00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,840
You're saying that the drizzling rain will stop soon?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,040
Yes, based on the weather chart,

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,040
I've calculated everything

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,740
from the direction of the wind, measured the temperature and humidity,

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,240
the difference in elevation, atmospheric pressure and so forth.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,640
As a result...

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,140
The weather will clear up in an hour.

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,040
How bold of you.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,740
Just as expected of a genius beautiful weather forecaster

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,240
who is known to be 100 percent correct!

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,040
I'm impressed.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,140
But, you too, make deductions on the job, don't you, Mr. Mouri?

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,340
Well, certainly,

Oh, boy...

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,940
I'm sorry. He's capable when he wants to be.

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,040
Oh, no. No problem. He's hilarious.

21

-Right? -Yes.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,740
I'm sure it'll turn out to be a good program.

23

Wonderful.

24

Tricks.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,340
Yes, no matter what kind of trick

26

or suspicion there may be,

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,640
I can clear things up in an hour!

You can clear any trick or suspicion in an hour.

38
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:28,436
Just because she's good looking, I think you're taking it a bit too far.

00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,436
True.

00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,636
I think it's kind of hard for Pops to figure things out in an hour.

42
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:41,836

00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:48,436

I see. Good work.

Would you like to check it?

You'll be filming right after break.

61
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,836
Okay.

Does Yasumi have more work to do from now?

69
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:27,136
Yes, she has to film an image video on the next floor.

70
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,236
This is the sketch of the image.

71
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:34,436
She makes a breezy appearance onto the foggy stage

72
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:38,036
in the heavy snow.

73
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:41,536
How nice. The image of a weather forecast is being depicted, right?

74
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,436
She's a weather forecast queen.

75
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:47,136
I'm sure she sells well.

76
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:50,436
So, shall we head on home?

77
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:51,536
-Yes. -Yes.

78
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,236
Pops! Over there!

79
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:05,836
Yasumi?

80
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:09,736
Ms. Sekine?

81
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,336
Yasumi...

82
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:18,336
Don't move!

83
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,536
Stay right there.

84
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,836
Only the hair on her left side?

85
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:41,336
Pops! Over there.

86
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,336
What's that?

87
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,136
Wait a second...

88
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:47,336
Maybe...

89
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:49,336
A dying... dying message?

90
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:51,136
Which means...

91
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,236
Call the police!

92
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,136
Hurry, call the police.

93
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,436
This is...

94
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:59,136
Yasumi's hairpin decoration.

95
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,936
Why is it over there?

96
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:05,436
Yeah... It seems she died instantly

97
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,936
from the shock of the fall.

98
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:09,536
But, why?

99
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:12,436
I wonder if there was something defective with the set.

100
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,736
You were the last one to check the set,

101
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,836
weren't you, Shinohara?

102
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:21,836
Yes, it was I...

103
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:24,236
But, I found nothing wrong in particular...

104
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:29,236
First of all, this is the producer, Mr. Yukio Kodama,

105
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:33,936
he is Mr. Takuya Yamaguchi, the manager of the victim, Ms. Yasumi Sekine,

106
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,536
she is the Assistant Director, Ms. Hiroko Shinohara.

107
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:39,536
These three were near the site during the incident.

108
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:41,836
According to the staff,

109
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,836
this building is scheduled to be taken down next year

110
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:48,136
because of deterioration from age.

111
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,736
I see.

112
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,136
Inspector, I got it.

113
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:55,936
After Yasumi had the talk with me, she took a break.

114
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:59,136
Then, she was scheduled to film a video.

115
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:04,136
However, she decided to check this stage before taking a break.

116
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,236
She leaned against the railing back then,

117
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,636
but since the railing was deteriorated from age,

118
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:11,436
she fell to the first floor.

119
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:13,336
In other words...

120
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:14,936
It's an accident?

121
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,736
Yes, very likely.

122
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:21,136
Well, I guess there was no need

123
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,236
to call you all the way out here, Inspector.

124
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:28,436
Then, what about the dying message or whatnot that Yasumi left behind?

125
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,836
She probably scratched the floor

126
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:33,336
with her blood smeared hands just before dying

127
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:34,836
and left something like that behind.

128
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:37,236
It hurts...

129
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:40,336
I've been pricked by the thorns of the roses.

130
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:43,136
Hey, brat! How come you're over there?

131
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,936
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:48,136
I'm tangled to the tinsel this time!

133
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:50,436
Just what do you think you're doing?

134
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,236
There's a burst balloon over there.

135
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,836
Come to think of it, Pops,

136
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,036
didn't we hear the sound of a bang,

137
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,936
like something burst before the scream?

138
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:05,736
Yeah... If I remember correctly, a bang...

139
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:08,536
A balloon... A tinsel...

140
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:09,636
Roses?

141
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,136
What's the matter?

142
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:17,936
Isn't it enough already?

143
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:21,536
We've got to change the set of the studio right away.

144
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:24,336
Besides, when Ms. Sekine fell,

145
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,436
everybody was over that side.

146
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,936
We have nothing to do with it.

147
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,336
Right? Don't you think so?

148
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,536
-Yes. -Yes.

149
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,836
All right. See you all then...

150
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:34,936
Wrong!

151
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,836
You can't deceive the eyes of Kogoro Mouri here.

152
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:44,836
This looks to be an accident but it's not.

153
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,236
Just what do you mean, Mouri?

154
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:53,636
Somebody set a trap against Yasumi.

155
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,636
A trap?

156
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,636
Yes, there was something like this decorated on stage.

157
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:04,836
First, you tie the tip of this tinsel to the pillar.

158
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,436
Furthermore, you take this end of the tip and tie it

159
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:09,136
onto the pillar opposite the stage.

160
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,536
Okay!

161
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:13,436
Ran! Walk on stage, will you?

162
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:16,236
Over here... Please...

163
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:17,736
Okay...

164
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:30,836
Everyone, just before you heard Yasumi's scream,

165
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,036
you heard this sound, didn't you?

166
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,936
Yeah.

167
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:39,036
Right, Yasumi who came to check this stage,

168
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:42,936
fell right into this malicious trap.

169
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:47,136
She was then surprised and staggered over to the railing...

170
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:54,136
Which means this is homicide after all.

171
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:57,736
No, it's impossible to deliberately make her fall

172
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:59,336
by just doing something like this.

173
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:03,336
The person who set the trap just wanted to scare her.

174
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:07,236
And that, brought about this tragedy.

175
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:10,636
Then, who on earth set up a trap like this?

176
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,336
What time was the stage ready for use?

177
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:15,036
Well...

178
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,136
Mr. Yamaguchi, if I remember correctly,

179
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:20,536
you said that you would be here until morning?

180
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,136
Yes...

181
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,236
Is something wrong?

182
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:26,136
The fact is...

183
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:29,036
I inadvertently dozed off.

184
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,136
By the time I got up,

185
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,336
they were just about to start filming the program.

186
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:34,036
Dozed off?

187
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:37,836
Yes but I couldn't tell Yasumi about it.

188
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:39,536
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:41,736
That doesn't tell us anything

190
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,136
about who and when the trap was set up.

191
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:48,036
Then, who was the last one to check the stage?

192
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,436
It was me.

193
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:53,236
The last time I check it was...

194
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,936
But, I didn't find anything wrong in particular...

195
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:58,636
You said that nothing was wrong back then, right?

196
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,436
Are you sure?

197
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:01,436
Yes.

198
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:04,136
Well, the thing is...

199
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,036
On the tinsel that was used for the trick,

200
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:08,736
this was pasted onto it...

201
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:14,136
A masking tape like that can be found anywhere.

202
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,936
Then, shall we check it out?

203
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,136
The fingerprints and footprints

204
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,936
that are near the place where the trap was set?

205
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:25,736
We could come up with a decisive proof of the perpetrator.

206
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:42,995
Inspector, the forensics.

207
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,095
Yes, sir.

208
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:46,895
We need to take fingerprints

209
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:48,395
and saliva from the three of you.

210
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:52,495
I refuse. I don't want to!

211
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,195
Why not?

212
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,595
I can't do what I can't do.

213
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:59,395
That's enough, Shinohara! Cut it out!

214
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,795
I know that you did it!

215
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,795
I heard her.

216
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,495
When she was talking in the kitchenette of the company yesterday.

217
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,195
How ruthless of Yasumi!

218
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:16,195
It's impossible to change the set of the studio by tomorrow!

219
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,695
But, I've got to do it.

220
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,395
It's not that I'm going to do it for nothing, though.

221
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:24,395
I'm going to embarrass her tomorrow.

222
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,595
With a balloon.

223
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,295
I didn't want to embarrass our company

224
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,695
so I hesitated from saying anything about it till now.

225
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,795
Hiroko, is what he just said true?

226
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,095
Yes. I set the balloon up!

227
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:42,295
I hated her!

228
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:44,695
She always went around acting like a queen

229
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:46,295
and was so selfish.

230
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:48,795
Right? Don't you think so too, Mr. Yamaguchi?

231
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,395
She got to you too, didn't she, Mr. Yamaguchi!

232
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:55,295
If something goes wrong on the set next time,

233
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,595
disappear from in front of my eyes!

234
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,795
She was arrogant and egotistical...

235
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,295
It's unlike my image!

236
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:09,795
Fix by tomorrow!

237
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,695
Just like she did to me,

238
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:13,595
I wanted to embarrass her in front of everyone.

239
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:19,795
By surprising that snob and making a laughingstock out of her!

240
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,395
But, I didn't expect...

241
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:28,195
I didn't expect what happened.

242
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:33,095
Please come to the police station with us.

243
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:35,995
Yes.

244
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:39,595
What is it? Something's not right...

245
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:42,295
The other sound that was heard back then...

246
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:46,195
And, her hair that was disheveled just on one side.

247
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,295
The hairpin decoration that flew.

248
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,295
This is...

249
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,295
A smoke machine.

250
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,195
I see.

251
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:07,395
It... It come!

252
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:10,995
Dad.

253
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:13,495
Something's wrong, right, Mr. Mouri?

254
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,295
With the deduction up to now?

255
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:19,095
No, unusually my deduction is correct.

256
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:22,595
It's correct? Unusually?

257
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,895
Oh... Pardon me...

258
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:28,695
The fact is there's still a continuation to my deduction.

259
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,595
Because there are several questions still left unanswered.

260
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:33,595
Several questions?

261
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,495
Yes. I heard from Conan that

262
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:40,995
Yasumi said that she wouldn't be checking the stage.

263
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:45,695
But, she actually checked it and fell for the trap.

264
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,695
Don't you think it's strange?

265
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:48,895
True.

266
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,795
However, if you think of it this way,

267
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,095
everything falls into place.

268
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:56,795
Yasumi already knew about the trap!

269
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:00,395
Hold it, how did she?

270
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:03,595
Because the real perpetrator told her about it.

271
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,495
The real perpetrator?

272
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:06,595
Right.

273
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:10,195
That perpetrator told Yasumi beforehand.

274
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,995
That a balloon trap had been set up,

275
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:15,695
and that the balloon would burst before the filming.

276
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:16,895
Hiroko...

277
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,895
To make a laughingstock out of you.

278
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,995
To make a laughingstock out of me?

279
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:25,095
Yes, Yasumi was going to make fun and be mean to you

280
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:27,895
more than she had ever done before.

281
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:34,695
Furthermore, the perpetrator also told her that

282
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,495
if she stood at a distance, towards the railing,

283
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,895
she would be safe.

284
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:44,095
Yasumi worked the balloon trap just like she was told to

285
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:48,495
Of course, Yasumi wasn't surprised.

286
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:50,095
However, the next second,

287
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:54,395
the other trap that the real perpetrator had set up was activated.

288
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:56,095
The other trap?

289
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,695
Yes. Hey, Conan!

290
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:02,295
The snow falls heavily and the fog sets in.

291
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,695
The queen of the weather forecast,

292
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,695
that was Yasumi's stage, right?

293
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:11,195
Look here! There is a machine here.

294
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:14,995
A smoke machine?

295
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:18,495
Right, a machine to eject fog.

296
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,395
The other question that was left unanswered

297
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:24,795
was the wind like sound

298
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,795
that was heard right after the bang of the bursting sound.

299
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:36,295
I'm sure that there are some of you here that heard it.

300
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,295
The perpetrator using the sound of the balloon that burst as a signal

301
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:44,395
turned on the switch of the machine.

302
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:47,495
The output volume was set at maximum.

303
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:51,695
Officer Takagi, will you please turn the switch on?

304
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,195
Yes, sir.

305
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,195
What?

306
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:57,595
This is...

307
00:17:57,595 --> 00:18:03,395
The real perpetrator showered Yasumi with carbon dioxide gas fog,

308
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,895
with tremendous impact.

309
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,395
Yasumi couldn't even open her eyes,

310
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,495
she had no choice but to back down.

311
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:14,895
However, right behind her was the loose railing.

312
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:18,495
The railing was probably rigged to come off beforehand.

313
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,795
So, Yasumi went falling to her death.

314
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,495
Hold it, Mr. Mouri...

315
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:26,195
There's no proof that she was showered with something like that.

316
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:29,195
Carbon dioxide gas evaporates right away.

317
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:33,595
However, only the left side of Yasumi's hair was disheveled.

318
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:34,895
Furthermore, her hairpin decoration

319
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:37,595
had flown all the way to the wall beyond.

320
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:41,495
The carbon dioxide gas was ejected to the left side of her,

321
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,295
and that's probably why her hairpin was blown off.

322
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:47,595
In other words, the perpetrator worked his trick

323
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,795
and masked it behind the trap that Hiroko set up.

324
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:54,995
That way, thanks to her, he was taken off the suspect list.

325
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,695
Then, Mouri...

326
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,395
Who is the real perpetrator?

327
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,295
It's simple...

328
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:04,495
The one who knew about Hiroko's plan,

329
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,395
Mr. Kodama.

330
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,795
You said that you heard her, didn't you?

331
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:12,095
Are you saying that I did it?

332
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:15,695
Just because I eavesdropped, that makes me the perpetrator?

333
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:20,595
Not only that, but you secretly told Yasumi about it,

334
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,795
and lured her to the trap.

335
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,995
That's enough! Do you have proof?

336
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:29,595
You're wearing a great brown suit today.

337
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,595
Your shoes are brown too, and you sure look dandy.

338
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:36,895
Did you polish your shoes this morning?

339
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,595
So, what if I did?

340
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,595
It's drizzling today. Humidity is also high,

341
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:45,295
so the cream that you used on those shoes didn't dry too well.

342
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,695
The ejection hole of the smoke machine

343
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:51,095
was most likely faced towards the loose railing.

344
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:53,695
After the crime was committed, the perpetrator had to find the time

345
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:56,795
to return the hole to its original position.

346
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,795
The traces of the cream that was left behind at that time,

347
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:02,895
the brown cream was found on the machine!

348
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:04,495
Wrong...

349
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,395
That won't serve as evidence!

350
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,495
Ms. Shinohara.

351
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:09,595
Yes.

352
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:11,795
How do you turn on the switch of the machine?

353
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,295
It can be done manually or by wireless.

354
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,895
Wireless?

355
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,295
Officer Takagi!

356
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:20,595
Don't! Cut it out!

357
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,295
I found it!

358
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:23,995
Why do you have that on you?

359
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:25,395
Darn.

360
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:27,995
Mr. Kodama. Why?

361
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,795
The woman really sucked!

362
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,495
She found out,

363
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:41,695
that I embezzled money from the program.

364
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:44,995
She got proof of it and blackmailed me.

365
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,995
She would ask me to appoint her to new programs

366
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,495
or to provide her with production expenses.

367
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,995
She'd ask me repeatedly, over and over.

368
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:55,295
I wasn't about to be at her beck and call all my life.

369
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:59,295
But, I didn't think that the drizzle would give me away.

370
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:00,995
Drizzle?

371
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:03,395
You're wrong, Mr. Kodama.

372
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:08,195
I had another reason for thinking that you committed the crime.

373
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:11,695
Yasumi realized just before she fell.

374
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,495
That she had been deceived by you.

375
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,995
So, she used whatever strength that was left in her

376
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:21,095
to leave behind a dying message.

377
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:24,095
By using something that wouldn't be found by you and erased...

378
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:26,295
A special symbol.

379
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,995
A weather symbol.

380
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,295
Snow. (Pronounced as "Yuki" in Japanese)

381
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:32,495
Yes, Mr. Yukio Kodama,

382
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:36,295
you're the only one with the word "snow" in your name!

383
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:40,395
I see.

384
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:43,095
Just as would be expected of a weather forecast queen.

385
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,295
Darn.

386
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,795
That woman...

387
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,695
It's cleared up.

388
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,395
Just as Yasumi had predicted.

389
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:58,295
And I solved the case in an hour too.

390
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:21,995
I'm glad it cleared.

391
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:23,095
Yes.

392
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:25,495
But, I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow,

393
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:27,595
dad?

394
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,395
Tomorrow's weather?

395
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:30,495
He can't forecast it, no way.

396
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:34,595
Pops can deduce cases but he can't forecast the weather.

397
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:36,895
What! I'll show you I can...

398
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:40,595
What will tomorrow's weather be?

399
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,695
-It'll be a fine day tomorrow too! -It'll be a fine day tomorrow too!

400
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:54,695
"Next Episode"

401
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:56,695
Die! Kanzaki!

402
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,795
Just because he was wearing the Bekapon outfit.

403
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:04,295
Bekapon?

404
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:07,895
It's the mascot character of Beikado.

405
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:11,195
Are you suspecting our employees?

406
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:13,095
This mistaken bomb scare incident

407
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,695
is full of things that can't be explained.

408
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:21,095
Next Conan, "Bekapon Bleeding Service"

409
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:39,195
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,295
"Uniform"

411
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:43,395
It's Bekapon, not Bekashi.

412
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:45,395
Is he a Beika-cho character?
