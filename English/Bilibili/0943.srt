"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,370
You're such an annoying brat!

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,370
You're acting suspicious.

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,770
There's nothing suspicious about me!

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,770
That's...

"I hereby invite my beloved detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri to my restaurant."

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,270
"Signed, Toyoko."

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,970
It's an invitation from a fan.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,470
So you trim your nose hairs to go eat monja in Tsukishima?

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,170
It's my first time meeting her. I want to look nice.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,270
You mean perving on someone you're meeting for the first time?

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,070
Perving?

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,370
Honestly, there's a little bit of that.

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,770
So you admit it.

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,270
I do.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,070
I want monja, too.

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,570
What?

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,370
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,470
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

21
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,270
Kogoro is invited out for monja

22
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,070
and is hired by an unexpected client.

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,570
His name is Detective Conan!

Let's see...

28
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:42,427
It's this way.

29
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:46,827
I want the deluxe gizzard and garlic monja with cheese.

30
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,427
You idiot. Monja aren't supposed to be so luxurious.

31
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,827
Monja are a simple food.

32
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,627
That's an old-fashioned way of thinking.

33
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,627
It's just down that alleyway.

34
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,627
What is that?

35
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,127
Looks like Toyoko's restaurant is over there.

36
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:28,527
What is that old woman doing?

37
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,627
How rude! Who are you?

38
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:39,227
Are you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?

39
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:45,327
I am indeed the super famous detective Kogoro Mouri.

40
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:51,827
My, my. One moment, please.

41
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,627
What?

42
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,827
Does she work here?

43
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,827
Excuse us.

44
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,327
Excuse me.

45
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:05,027
Oh, my. I'm Toyoko.

46
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:10,427
I received your invitation.

47
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:13,227
I'm the great detective...

48
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,127
Kogoro Mouri...

49
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,827
Pops!

50
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,927
Oh, my.

51
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:32,727
I don't believe it.

52
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:37,527
The great detective Mouri is overwhelmed by my beauty.

53
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:39,127
I don't think that's it.

54
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,027
I'm so upset!

55
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:46,727
Only the great river can heal the wounds on my heart.

56
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:49,827
The great river has always healed my heart.

57
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,127
The great river?

58
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,727
The Sumida River has always healed my heart.

59
00:05:55,727 --> 00:06:00,527
Sumida River, please soothe this broken heart.

60
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,627
That hurts...

61
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:10,327
Kid, where's the old woman?

62
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:14,227
She said something about being upset and went to the Sumida River.

63
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,027
Sumida River?

64
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:19,727
What? Was she so upset by my rejection

65
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,527
that she's jumping into the Sumida River?

66
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:24,727
No way.

67
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,027
There she is.

68
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,827
She's doing that weird dance again.

69
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:42,427
I used be a dancer at the big theater in Ginza.

70
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:43,427
What?

71
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:45,827
The big theater in Ginza.

72
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:46,827
Heard of it?

73
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:49,827
The big theater in Ginza?

74
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:54,527
Come to think of it, I heard there used to be a place like that.

75
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:57,727
It looked something like this,

76
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:03,127
and featured long lines of beautiful girls dancing.

77
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:07,627
We can continue our conversation over monja.

78
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,627
"Toyoko's Restaurant"

79
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:19,327
It's good!

80
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,627
Is it? That's good.

81
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:23,027
Eat all you'd like.

82
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:27,527
Monja and draft beer in the afternoon...

83
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,027
This is great!

84
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:32,427
I think I'll have some, too.

85
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:39,627
It's good. Go, me.

86
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:46,427
Tokyo Barls Collection?

87
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:47,627
What's that?

88
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,227
What's wrong, madam?

89
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,327
I can't breathe...

90
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,927
Hey, are you okay? Pull yourself together!

91
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,727
Pops, water!

92
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:00,827
Have some water.

93
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,327
Calm down. Drink slowly.

94
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,727
Are you okay, madam?

95
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,227
What's this?

96
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,927
The core of a cabbage?

97
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,327
Someone was...

98
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,827
Someone was trying to kill me.

99
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:22,627
They put the core of a cabbage in my monja!

100
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,227
What?

101
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:27,027
I know who the culprit is!

102
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:28,227
The culprit?

103
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:30,427
Calm down, madam.

104
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,927
It was one of my childhood friends.

105
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,127
What?

106
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:39,027
They called us the Bufu'usu of Tsukishima.

107
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:41,427
Tsukishima's...

108
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,627
Bufu'usu?

109
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,827
I, Toyoko Busujima, was Bu.

110
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:53,527
Eiko Fuda was Fu.

111
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:56,527
Kyoko Ugajin was U.

112
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,927
Yuko Suo was Su.

113
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:02,427
Modern women are no good.

114
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:06,227
They don't drink skim milk with their school lunches.

115
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:09,127
Those children know nothing of war.

116
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,027
I heard they don't do that at schools anymore.

117
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,527
Don't do what?

118
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:17,927
Carry firewood while studying, like Ikkyu.

119
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:21,827
That guy who came up with the crying nightingale Jomon culture?

120
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,527
What? Jomon culture?

121
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,227
Bu, you're always showing off your intellect

122
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:30,027
since you're the only one who attended high school.

123
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,327
Yeah.

124
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,127
You've got a big head just because we didn't complete

125
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,127
our compulsory education to your satisfaction.

126
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,827
I'm stuffing myself until I'm full of this disgusting thing!

127
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,727
-Me, too! -Me, too!

128
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,427
Don't stuff yourselves with it!

129
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:48,427
It must've been one of them.

130
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,327
What?

131
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:51,827
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:55,827
Mid-century women can't help but speak their minds.

133
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,627
I understand.

134
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,327
It's your age that makes you say that.

135
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:05,327
No, you don't. Your age doesn't make you say anything.

136
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:08,827
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

137
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:11,027
Could you investigate this case?

138
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,927
-What? -Here's your pay.

139
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,727
I accept!

140
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:24,627
Will suspect No.1, Eiko Fuda, also known as Fu of Tsukishima,

141
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:28,627
really appear on the bullet train platform at Tokyo Station?

142
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,227
According to Toyoko, also known as Bu of Tsukishima.

143
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,627
Is that her?

144
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:41,227
Fu of Tsukishima?

145
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,527
Excuse me.

146
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,727
Are you Eiko Fuda, also known as Fu of Tsukishima?

147
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,327
You're here about Bu.

148
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,327
-How did you know? -Did she die?

149
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:53,527
Not yet.

150
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,427
That Bu of Tsukishima is as tough as ever.

151
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,327
Do you resent her for some reason?

152
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,027
Of course I do.

153
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:07,127
During middle school, I was dating ping pong team captain Cho.

154
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:23,327
Let him break up with Eiko...

155
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,527
Break up with Eiko...

156
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:32,427
Break up...

157
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:36,427
Fine, I'll do it! I'll break up with Eiko!

158
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,727
I see. I'm sorry about...

159
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:45,127
Over there.

160
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,427
Please don't jog on the station platform!

161
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,827
It's very dangerous!

162
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:58,427
Suspect No.2, Kyoko Ugajin, also known as U of Tsukishima,

163
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,927
butchers tuna at Toyonaka Market.

164
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:16,827
You're here about Bu, aren't you?

165
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:19,227
I'm surprised you knew.

166
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,627
Eiko called me.

167
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:24,627
She said a detective came to ask her about Bu.

168
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,127
So you do resent her for some reason.

169
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,727
Of course I resent that nincompoop.

170
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:35,327
During middle school, I was dating baseball team captain Fuji.

171
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:41,727
What a heavy roller.

172
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,827
Break up with Kyoko and date me instead!

173
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:48,627
-What? -If you won't date me,

174
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,527
then kill me!

175
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,427
Kill me!

176
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,127
Kill me!

177
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,827
Push that roller over me!

178
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:01,327
Okay!

179
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:06,127
I will have my revenge.

180
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:09,127
Eko Eko Azarak!

181
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,727
She's awfully energetic.

182
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:29,194
Suspect No.3, Yuko Suo, also known as Su of Tsukishima, is...

183
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:32,294
Hello, ni hao, guten tag.

184
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:34,794
I've got great souvenirs.

185
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:38,594
Good stuff from Mt. Fuji, good stuff from Hokkaido.

186
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:42,194
You, boss. I've got good stuff from Nikko, too.

187
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:46,194
I'm not your boss, and I'm not a foreign tourist.

188
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,894
During middle school, I was dating...

189
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:56,994
The basketball team captain, who she stole from you?

190
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:04,594
During middle school, I was dating judo team captain Ban.

191
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,594
Toyoko Busujima... I mean, Bu of Tsukishima.

192
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,694
That hurts!

193
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:12,894
"Anti-itch Cream"

194
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,794
This medicine should work.

195
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:20,294
-It's working! -I saw you!

196
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:23,194
I saw you doing something embarrassing!

197
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,894
Don't tell anyone.

198
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:29,494
If you don't break up with Yuko

199
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,294
and starting dating me instead, I might.

200
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:36,894
Don't tell anyone...

201
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,894
Something's not right.

202
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:53,794
All three of the women named as suspects resent Toyoko,

203
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:57,494
but all three of them resent her for the same reason.

204
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:04,194
During middle school, I was dating ping pong team captain Cho.

205
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:09,794
During middle school, I was dating baseball team captain Fuji.

206
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:13,194
During middle school, I was dating...

207
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:16,394
The basketball team captain, who she stole from you?

208
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:21,094
During middle school, I was dating judo team captain Ban.

209
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,994
Furthermore, Yuko said the exact same thing

210
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:28,594
after Pops' interruption.

211
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,394
But why did those three...

212
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:35,594
No, including Toyoko, it's the four of them.

213
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:37,794
Hey, kid.

214
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:41,494
What are you scowling and thinking about?

215
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:44,094
It's simple.

216
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,894
Those three women conspired

217
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:49,394
to put a cabbage core in the monja

218
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:52,694
to get their revenge.

219
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,294
But then...

220
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,894
I know.

221
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:58,894
We're dealing with women who don't have long left to live.

222
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:00,794
I give them a proper talking to,

223
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,594
make them reflect on their actions,

224
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,994
and throw a proper sushi party with my pay.

225
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:09,694
"Toyoko's Restaurant"

226
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:10,994
What?

227
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:15,894
So it was Eiko, Kyoko, and Yuko who tried to kill me

228
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:18,294
by putting the cabbage core in my monja?

229
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:23,394
The great Kogoro Mouri doesn't make mistakes!

230
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:26,894
What happened to being proper?

231
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:29,594
By the way, Detective Mouri.

232
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:30,994
Yes?

233
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:35,294
I know I should go to the local police,

234
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,894
but they're so unreliable.

235
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:41,994
Could you ask your friends at the MPD to handle it?

236
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,794
What?

237
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,494
But...

238
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:49,994
My chronic pain!

239
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,094
Are you all right?

240
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,194
Please. My days are numbered.

241
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:57,994
Your days are numbered?

242
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:04,294
Very well. I'll talk to them.

243
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:06,294
Thank you!

244
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,894
I'll bring you another beer.

245
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,694
Don't worry about it.

246
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:13,394
He's too easy.

247
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:15,094
They're not answering.

248
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,194
Anyway, why is she doing this?

249
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:25,394
Isn't that...

250
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,494
I see!

251
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,594
So that's how it is.

252
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:40,894
"Toyoko's Restaurant"

253
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,294
Here's your beer.

254
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,794
-Toyoko. -Yes?

255
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:49,994
Picking up where we left off,

256
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:54,694
when cooking monja, you use two spatulas

257
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:58,294
to finely chop ingredients spread over a hot plate.

258
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,894
In other words, even if a cabbage core

259
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,794
were mixed in with the ingredients,

260
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,594
it should've been chopped too small

261
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,394
to get caught in your throat by the time you ate it.

262
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:14,794
Therefore, the cabbage core you choked on

263
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,794
must have been put in after you finished preparing the monja.

264
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:21,294
Not only that, but if the core

265
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:23,594
was carelessly thrown into the ingredients,

266
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,494
the boy or I could've eaten it.

267
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:31,094
There would be no guarantee you would choke on it.

268
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:37,894
The only certain way to choke you would be to put it in

269
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:39,994
just before you served yourself.

270
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:46,194
However, this presents a fundamental problem.

271
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:50,194
Would you not notice a cabbage core

272
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:54,094
falling into the bit of monja you were about to eat?

273
00:18:55,994 --> 00:19:02,194
In other words, the four of you worked together

274
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:05,094
to cause a commotion by involving me and the police.

275
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:08,894
It was all a lie.

276
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:11,994
She's not even here.

277
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:20,594
Does that mean she didn't listen to any of my reasoning?

278
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:32,994
I knew they'd be here.

279
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:38,094
If the great detective Kogoro Mouri and the MPD

280
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,494
get involved in the investigation...

281
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:43,894
It'll be a huge story! The media will swoop in!

282
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:48,794
Then everyone will be talking about the Tokyo Barls Collection!

283
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:51,794
But won't we be arrested?

284
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,894
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

285
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:57,094
Should we make a public apology then?

286
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,994
Then even more people will be talking about us.

287
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,794
The Barls Collection is guaranteed to be a success!

288
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:05,394
Maybe we'll be invited to appear on TV.

289
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,994
And interviewed by handsome men.

290
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,794
That would really get people talking.

291
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,994
The Barls Collection is guaranteed to be a success...

292
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:21,894
Well, whatever.

293
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:25,294
"Toyoko's Restaurant"

294
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,694
Hello, Inspector?

295
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:35,694
I'm sorry, but there's something I'd like to discuss with you.

296
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,694
Oh, no. He got a hold of Inspector Megure.

297
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:06,194
"Toyoko's Restaurant"

298
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:27,394
We just wanted to cheer up all the elderly people

299
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:30,694
around the country who are our age.

300
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:36,694
We're terribly sorry for the inconvenience our carelessness caused.

301
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:40,894
We're sorry...

302
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:26,994
No one stands a chance against the Bufu'usu of Tsukishima.

303
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,594
Hey, kid.

304
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:30,294
What are you doing? Let's go.

305
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:31,894
Okay.

306
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,794
What's wrong with those women?

307
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,394
But it ended well, right?

308
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:38,594
It'll cheer up some old women.

309
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,994
And besides, didn't you get paid?

310
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,394
Paid?

311
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:45,994
There were just free monja coupons in that envelope.

312
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:48,094
Really?

313
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:52,094
The Tokyo Barls Collection is guaranteed to be a success!

Look happy.

316
00:23:57,494 --> 00:24:01,794
I'll earn more likes for you.

317
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:06,494
Kagura suffered collateral damage about half a month ago.

318
00:24:06,494 --> 00:24:07,594
What?

319
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:10,194
This can't be a coincidence.

320
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,494
-What? -Conan, could it be...

321
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:17,494
I'll expose everything!

00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,137
We'd be the Moe of Beika!

326

I doubt anyone would hire the Moe Detectives.
