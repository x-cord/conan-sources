1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.870
Sergeant Momosaki Toko, who went to
karaoke with Naeko Miike after work,

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.910
was found dead the next morning.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.370
Momosaki Toko (28)
Transportation Department
(Sergeant)
was found dead the next morning.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.370
Next to her body was a bent 100 yen coin,

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.960
and there were traces suggesting that Sergeant
Momosaki had been pointing at something.

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.990
Yagi Shiori (28)
Transportation Department
(Lieutenant)

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.710
Then, Lieutenant Yagi who was at the karaoke
box with Miike and Sergeant Momosaki...
Yagi Shiori (28)
Transportation Department
(Lieutenant)

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.470
Then, Lieutenant Yagi who was at the karaoke
box with Miike and Sergeant Momosaki...

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.750
I asked one of your colleagues from work.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.980
They said you'd be here
if you weren't at home.

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.940
Japan's police truly are exceptional.

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.320
I knew it!

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.480
You're the one who killed Toko!

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.110
And next to her body is a 100
yen coin stuck inside her phone.

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.490
Just like the one found next
to the body of the officer

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.000
discovered in the park this
morning, it was deliberately bent.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.730
100 yen coins are engraved
with a cherry blossom.

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.890
It goes without saying that the cherry
blossom is the emblem of the Japanese police.

19
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.830
Th-Then this is...

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.180
Yes, without a doubt.

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.280
This case is a serial murder
of female police officers.

22
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.620
Furthermore, Lieutenant Miyamoto Yumi, who
noticed something about both their bodies...

23
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.690
I know I took the mini patrol car,

24
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.620
but since I'm helping the
investigation, go easy on me.

25
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.260
Wh-Who's there?!

26
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510
Oh, just my imagination.

27
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.540
Jeez. I'm jumping at shadows.

28
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.030
Let's see. This area is...

29
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.520
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

30
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.420
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

31
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.950
A black shadow closes in on Yumi!

32
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.180
How far will the case's darkness spread?

33
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.790
Always determining the one truth

34
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.590
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

35
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.960
his name is Detective Conan!

36
00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:11.448
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Three)

37
00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:15.018
"Target: MPD Transportation
Department, Part Three!"
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Three)

38
00:04:15.018 --> 00:04:16.948
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Three)

39
00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:23.628
Well, I just got home.

40
00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:26.618
I couldn't have seen any suspicious figures.

41
00:04:26.618 --> 00:04:29.708
Then do you know anything about
this female police officer?

42
00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.708
I haven't seen her.

43
00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:34.498
I see.

44
00:04:35.028 --> 00:04:38.978
Was she pushed from that apartment building?

45
00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:41.968
Yes. That's what we believe at this time.

46
00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:43.868
How horrifying.

47
00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:47.478
And there was that incident
just the other day, too.

48
00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:49.198
"That incident?"

49
00:04:49.198 --> 00:04:52.148
Did something else happen at that building?

50
00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:58.388
Remember the woman who committed suicide
by jumping from a nearby building?

51
00:04:58.388 --> 00:05:01.648
I heard she was a resident of that building.

52
00:05:01.648 --> 00:05:02.868
Suicide?

53
00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:03.878
Yes.

54
00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:08.578
Don't the police know
more about it than I do?

55
00:05:08.868 --> 00:05:13.708
When no foul play is suspected, the MPD
isn't called to investigate the case.

56
00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:15.958
The local jurisdiction
investigates it instead.

57
00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:19.308
When did that suicide occur?

58
00:05:19.308 --> 00:05:22.838
I believe it was a week ago.

59
00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:24.718
A week ago?

60
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:28.318
I'm sorry, but could you tell
us more about the incident?

61
00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:30.798
Do you know the name of the woman who died?

62
00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:33.688
No, I don't know who she was.

63
00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:37.938
What was that?

64
00:05:38.288 --> 00:05:39.738
It came from that apartment building.

65
00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:42.668
Sh-She's dead!

66
00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:44.988
There's a dead policewoman!

67
00:05:44.988 --> 00:05:45.748
What?

68
00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:49.908
Thank you!

69
00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.418
That mini patrol car... Could it be?

70
00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:07.798
Yu...

71
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.148
Yumi?

72
00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:17.698
No!

73
00:06:18.518 --> 00:06:19.798
You're kidding.

74
00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:23.128
Yumi...

75
00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:32.298
Yumi!

76
00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.248
Huh?

77
00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:42.458
Whoops. I fell asleep.

78
00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.008
Huh?

79
00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:46.758
Y-Yumi?

80
00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:48.108
Sorry!

81
00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:53.118
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

82
00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:55.768
Yumi-san asked me for a favor.

83
00:06:56.518 --> 00:06:57.648
Yumi-san?

84
00:06:57.968 --> 00:06:59.938
What are you doing here?

85
00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:02.168
Oh, good timing.

86
00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:03.098
Uh, okay.

87
00:07:03.098 --> 00:07:05.428
Apparently Yumi-san noticed something

88
00:07:05.428 --> 00:07:09.158
and asked to lie on the ground
in the same position as the body.

89
00:07:09.698 --> 00:07:11.408
Come on, please?

90
00:07:11.978 --> 00:07:15.628
You don't mind, right? You and I are friends.

91
00:07:15.628 --> 00:07:20.458
Yeah, but we're not even that close.

92
00:07:20.978 --> 00:07:25.408
Oh, please. That close?

93
00:07:25.408 --> 00:07:29.138
You're such a naughty boy, Takagi-kun.

94
00:07:29.818 --> 00:07:31.338
I'd better report this to Miwako.

95
00:07:31.338 --> 00:07:33.518
No, wait!

96
00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:37.088
I forgot the specifics of our conversation,

97
00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:40.358
but in any case, it seemed
like Yumi-san had an idea,

98
00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:45.228
and forensics had finished examining the
scene, so I thought it'd be all right.

99
00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:47.618
I didn't think she'd fall asleep.

100
00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:49.128
Did we scare you?

101
00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:51.298
Yeah, sort of.

102
00:07:51.898 --> 00:07:54.978
I was up all night playing
mahjong, so I'm so sleepy.

103
00:07:54.978 --> 00:07:58.278
Anyway, sorry I forgot to call you.

104
00:08:01.068 --> 00:08:03.838
So, what did you notice?

105
00:08:04.188 --> 00:08:10.218
When I saw the photo of
Yagi's body you sent me,

106
00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:15.398
I realized what was in the direction
Yagi forced herself to face.

107
00:08:16.468 --> 00:08:19.988
Since we drive past this
alleyway on our patrols,

108
00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:24.108
anyone from the Transportation
Department would know what's there.

109
00:08:24.458 --> 00:08:30.738
Yagi faced this direction before she
died because she knew that was here.

110
00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:33.488
She wanted us to focus on that.

111
00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:41.018
A no parking sign?

112
00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.178
What does it mean?

113
00:08:43.178 --> 00:08:47.508
That sign's the only obvious
thing in that direction.

114
00:08:48.068 --> 00:08:53.428
Sergeant Momosaki, who was killed first,
was pointing at a swing set in the park.

115
00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:56.018
What does that have to do with this?

116
00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:58.018
Try to remember, Miwako.

117
00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:02.958
What else was in the direction Momosaki
pointed besides the swing set?

118
00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:03.648
What?

119
00:09:04.218 --> 00:09:06.028
Besides the swing set?

120
00:09:08.008 --> 00:09:09.738
What else was there?

121
00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:16.988
There was something!

122
00:09:17.448 --> 00:09:19.498
A no parking sign!

123
00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:23.938
That's right. Momosaki wasn't
pointing at the swing set,

124
00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.658
but the no parking sign behind it.

125
00:09:26.658 --> 00:09:29.998
Since Yagi knew the same
sign happened to be here,

126
00:09:29.998 --> 00:09:33.388
she forced herself to face in its direction.

127
00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:37.938
Yagi realized what message Momosaki
was trying to convey with that sign,

128
00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:41.088
and this happened when
she went to confirm it.

129
00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:44.938
But she was trying to tell us
something until the very end.

130
00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:50.118
But that would mean the no parking sign...

131
00:09:50.118 --> 00:09:54.588
...is some kind of direct hint to
the identity of the suspect.

132
00:09:54.588 --> 00:09:58.318
Something that led Lieutenant Yagi here.

133
00:09:58.318 --> 00:10:01.788
It must be the three men Yumi-san mentioned.

134
00:10:02.088 --> 00:10:04.978
The three traffic violators Sergeant Momosaki

135
00:10:04.978 --> 00:10:10.168
and Lieutenant Yagi arrested one week ago.

136
00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:14.798
One of them must have parked illegally.

137
00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:16.598
About that...

138
00:10:17.048 --> 00:10:17.178
Aono was using his phone while
driving and didn't have his license.

139
00:10:17.178 --> 00:10:20.138
Aono Kengo
Aono was using his phone while
driving and didn't have his license.

140
00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:22.958
Aono was using his phone while
driving and didn't have his license.

141
00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:23.228
Akamine was driving a motorcycle
against traffic without a helmet.

142
00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:26.108
Akamine Manji
Akamine was driving a motorcycle
against traffic without a helmet.

143
00:10:26.108 --> 00:10:26.608
Akamine was driving a motorcycle
against traffic without a helmet.

144
00:10:26.938 --> 00:10:27.268
Shiroyama was driving with an expired
inspection and wasn't wearing his seat belt.

145
00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:30.188
Shiroyama Yuzo
Shiroyama was driving with an expired
inspection and wasn't wearing his seat belt.

146
00:10:30.188 --> 00:10:31.608
Shiroyama was driving with an expired
inspection and wasn't wearing his seat belt.

147
00:10:32.218 --> 00:10:35.458
None of them parked illegally.

148
00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:38.618
Then why point at a no parking sign?

149
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.148
Who knows?

150
00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:44.528
If anything, I guess their
names contain the characters

151
00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:47.378
for the red, blue, and
white used in the sign.

152
00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:53.008
But that doesn't tell
us which of them did it.

153
00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:56.388
Or how Yagi arrived here.

154
00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:59.758
None of them have present
addresses in this building.

155
00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:02.948
Come to think of it, what about
the building's security cameras?

156
00:11:02.948 --> 00:11:08.268
Apparently this building doesn't
have security cameras installed.

157
00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:11.178
The opinions of the residents are divided.

158
00:11:11.178 --> 00:11:12.068
Oh, my.

159
00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:15.858
And I just received a call from
the forensic investigators.

160
00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:20.028
They figured out the last number
Lieutenant Yagi tried to call.

161
00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:22.628
Well, we may have figured it out,

162
00:11:22.628 --> 00:11:27.168
but calling the number 7155
didn't connect us to anyone.

163
00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:33.668
Perhaps her mind was hazy since
she was on the brink of death.

164
00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:37.678
No, she wasn't trying to call that number.

165
00:11:38.138 --> 00:11:42.468
She pressed the call button because she
wanted to preserve the number 7155.

166
00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:45.808
That way it would be left in the phone's
records even if the suspect broke her phone.

167
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:51.378
7155... Seven thousand
one hundred fifty-five?

168
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.198
Seven-one-five-five...

169
00:11:53.198 --> 00:11:55.568
It doesn't seem to be a play on words.

170
00:11:55.928 --> 00:11:59.778
Maybe it's the request number for a song.

171
00:11:59.778 --> 00:12:04.068
They went to karaoke just
before they met the suspect.

172
00:12:04.068 --> 00:12:07.158
Didn't Miike go with them?

173
00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:09.708
M-Miike?

174
00:12:10.248 --> 00:12:13.028
Could you call her and check?

175
00:12:13.028 --> 00:12:18.878
Yeah, but she seems like her memory
would be worse than a cat's.

176
00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:21.478
A cat? Mike (calico)?

177
00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:22.758
Oh, it's just a nickname.

178
00:12:23.248 --> 00:12:25.378
Cats have bad memories?

179
00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.508
What? Isn't that what they say?

180
00:12:28.558 --> 00:12:29.518
No, no.

181
00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.568
Why am I thinking about that now?

182
00:12:33.568 --> 00:12:35.278
Oh, right. Takagi-kun.

183
00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:37.718
It's still unclear how it's connected,

184
00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:41.538
but a week ago, one of this building's
residents committed suicide.

185
00:12:41.538 --> 00:12:46.288
Really? Sounds like we should ask
the local jurisdiction about that.

186
00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:51.848
That girl in the Transportation Department
might look like my first love, but...

187
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.028
She's someone else.

188
00:12:57.968 --> 00:13:01.488
I can't keep holding onto that forever.

Miike here.

191
00:13:13.758 --> 00:13:16.438
What? 7155?

192
00:13:16.438 --> 00:13:18.828
A karaoke request number?

193
00:13:20.028 --> 00:13:25.288
I don't remember every song everyone sang.

194
00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:28.048
You've got the brain of a cat after all.

195
00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:30.598
What? What does that mean?

196
00:13:30.598 --> 00:13:34.208
You know, like how people
say cats have small brains.

197
00:13:34.418 --> 00:13:36.708
It's not brains, it's foreheads.

198
00:13:37.058 --> 00:13:41.968
A person might say their yard is the size of
a cat's forehead to mean it's really small.

199
00:13:42.268 --> 00:13:46.348
And these days, you don't enter numbers
to request songs at karaoke places.

200
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.248
What? Seriously?

201
00:13:48.248 --> 00:13:51.158
Some of them even use phone apps.

202
00:13:51.758 --> 00:13:56.358
In any case, let Miwako know if you
think of anything relating to 7155.

203
00:13:56.808 --> 00:13:58.358
Got it.

204
00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:02.608
But we're both officers of the
Transportation Department.

205
00:14:03.028 --> 00:14:06.368
You should let the violent
crimes unit handle the case

206
00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:09.248
and go home and get some sleep,

207
00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:10.618
Yumi-san.

208
00:14:18.698 --> 00:14:24.768
Yumi... Yumi... Yumi!

209
00:14:34.745 --> 00:14:38.445
We'll stay to canvas the
area a little longer.

210
00:14:38.855 --> 00:14:42.045
Yumi-san, you really should go home.

211
00:14:42.045 --> 00:14:44.455
Okay. Later.

212
00:14:45.295 --> 00:14:46.845
So, what will you do?

213
00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:50.465
Between me and Shiratori-kun,
we can probably handle this area.

214
00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:56.925
In that case, I'll go ask the local
jurisdiction about that suicide.

215
00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:58.325
Please do.

216
00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:01.715
Then I'll go the park where
the first murder took place.

217
00:15:02.095 --> 00:15:07.965
I might find something related
to 7155 in that park.

218
00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:08.835
Good idea. Thanks.

219
00:15:08.835 --> 00:15:10.525
See you for mahjong this weekend.
Good idea. Thanks.

220
00:15:17.945 --> 00:15:20.505
I'm falling asleep the second I get home.

221
00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:30.505
You're finally back.

222
00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:32.495
We saw it on the news.

223
00:15:32.495 --> 00:15:34.505
Who are you guys?

224
00:15:34.675 --> 00:15:38.735
We heard two lady cops were
killed one after another.

225
00:15:38.735 --> 00:15:43.235
So we were guarding your
mini patrol car for you.

226
00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:45.265
You owe us a fee.

227
00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:48.525
What? Are you stupid?

228
00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:51.185
What's your problem? You're just
a miniskirt officer anyway!

229
00:15:53.985 --> 00:16:01.865
Should a cop be speaking like
that to a law-abiding citizen?

230
00:16:05.605 --> 00:16:09.465
Excuse me. They're with me.

231
00:16:09.465 --> 00:16:12.095
It seems they can't hold their liquor.

232
00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:15.375
Just imagine they're speaking
nonsense and ignore them.

233
00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:18.255
What? Who are—

234
00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:27.015
You're with me, right?

235
00:16:27.015 --> 00:16:29.845
Uh, yeah. I'm starting to feel like I am.

236
00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:35.045
Then perhaps it would be best if
you got some fresh air to sober up.

237
00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:38.695
Y-Yes! I'll do that!

238
00:16:40.805 --> 00:16:42.475
Sorry for the trouble.

239
00:16:42.475 --> 00:16:46.145
No problem. Thanks, I think.

240
00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:53.625
Tell your friends to take care.

241
00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:56.015
And tell them not to drink so much.

242
00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.335
I will.

243
00:17:04.645 --> 00:17:09.135
Brother, protect Yumi-tan! You have to!

244
00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:10.735
Wh-Who's there?!

245
00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:15.275
Oh, just my imagination.

246
00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:19.145
Jeez. I'm jumping at shadows.

247
00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:25.865
She doesn't look like a woman
who needs protection to me.

248
00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:38.165
7155... 7155...

249
00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:42.165
I don't see anything.

250
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:46.415
Huh?

251
00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:50.965
Detective Chiba, what are
you doing here at this hour?

252
00:17:51.235 --> 00:17:55.225
C-Conan-kun! I could ask you the same thing.

253
00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:59.725
I saw the body of the
policewoman here this morning.

254
00:17:59.985 --> 00:18:03.445
At first I thought she was
pointing at the swing set,

255
00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:09.555
but I thought she might be pointing at
the no parking sign behind it instead.

256
00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:11.395
That's why I came here.

257
00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:17.405
The same sign was near the second
female officer who was murdered.

258
00:18:17.405 --> 00:18:20.875
So he's been to the crime
scene in Haido City, too.

259
00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:24.925
Both of the victims belonged to
the Transportation Department,

260
00:18:24.925 --> 00:18:30.005
so you suspect the traffic
violators they arrested, right?

261
00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:35.635
So I thought there might be some
meaning behind the road signs.

262
00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:39.145
Sato-san and Yumi-san said the same thing.

263
00:18:39.145 --> 00:18:42.275
But we couldn't figure out anything else.

264
00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:45.275
Did you come to confirm their suspicions?

265
00:18:45.495 --> 00:18:50.875
There's that, and we also determined
that the second victim Lieutenant Yagi

266
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:55.285
entered the numbers 7155 into
her phone just before she died.

267
00:18:56.165 --> 00:19:01.185
I thought there might be something relating
to those numbers at this park, so I came here.

268
00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:03.195
7155?

269
00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:08.075
Seven thousand five hundred fifty-five,
seven-one and five-five...

270
00:19:08.075 --> 00:19:10.775
71... 55...

271
00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:15.055
Wait a minute. What does the order
of those numbers mean again?

272
00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:18.695
Conan-kun, it's already after eight.

273
00:19:19.305 --> 00:19:21.215
Don't you need to go home?

274
00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:26.965
I told Ran-neechan I'd be staying
at the professor's house tonight,

275
00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:29.485
but my skateboard ran out of batteries.

276
00:19:29.765 --> 00:19:34.555
I know. Could you drive me
to the professor's house?

277
00:19:34.555 --> 00:19:35.405
What?

278
00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:43.515
Come to think of it, do I
have Sato-san's phone number?

279
00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:46.505

284
00:20:04.215 --> 00:20:05.775
Excuse me.

285
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:10.185
I left my car parked with the
trunk open in an alleyway.

286
00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:14.025
A stray cat jumped in,
and it won't stop crying.

287
00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:17.745
Could you search inside my car for me?

288
00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:20.915
I'm allergic to cats, so I can't touch it.

289
00:20:20.915 --> 00:20:23.145
Huh? Sure.

290
00:20:30.615 --> 00:20:35.345
7155... No parking signs...

291
00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:38.925
Damn. I nearly have the answer, too...

292
00:20:39.285 --> 00:20:41.625
By the way, Yumi-san told me.

293
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:44.815
She said you studied road signs together.

294
00:20:45.165 --> 00:20:47.355
Huh? Yeah, I guess.

295
00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:54.115
I had no idea Japanese road signs
were based off English ones.

296
00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:57.365
I doubt most people know.

297
00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.615
When I said that to Yumi-san,

298
00:20:59.615 --> 00:21:02.915
she responded that it was only natural for
a Transportation Department officer to know,

299
00:21:02.915 --> 00:21:07.375
that there was no way she wouldn't
know such common knowledge.

300
00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:08.875
You think that's true?

301
00:21:11.735 --> 00:21:13.675
England...

302
00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:18.385
Japanese road signs are
based off English ones...

303
00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:25.685
That's it! So that's how it is!

304
00:21:27.175 --> 00:21:28.625
Listen, Detective Chiba...

305
00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:31.275
Oh, sorry. Someone's calling.

306
00:21:49.415 --> 00:21:52.405

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.725
Hey, what are you doing?!

308
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:06.765
Damn! You had two phones?
