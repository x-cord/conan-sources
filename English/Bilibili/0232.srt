1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.640
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.940
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.740
Today's case occurs in a regular condominium.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.640
There's a twist to the strange accident.

5
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.130
"Was it Murder or an Accident?"

9
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.730
Good grief.

10
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.130
Ran says she's going to see a movie

11
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.030
so she dumps Conan on me.

12
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.530
Think of me as your lucky charm.

13
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.830
What do you mean?

14
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.530
Well, every time you solve a case,

15
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.230
I'm always with you.

16
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.530
You're crazy! It was all just coincidence!

17
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.130
Welcome!

18
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.330
-Are you Mr. Mouri? -Yes.

19
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.730
You must be Mr. Ueda.

20
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.930
-Please sit down. -Thank you.

21
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.130
I'm sorry!

22
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.730
My cigarette... Does it bother you?

23
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.130
Yes.

24
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.730
Hot coffee, please.

25
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.630
Yes, right away.

26
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.230
Actually, it's about a colleague of mine, Dr. Yoshimura.

27
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.730
We both work at the same university hospital.

28
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.230
Are the prank calls still coming?

29
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.730
They seem to getting worse.

30
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.130
At first, a threatening letter arrived.

31
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.530
But lately, threatening telephone calls have been coming in.

32
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.830
When he goes out, he's followed.

33
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.230
He's become a nervous wreck.

34
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.230
I'm so worried he might commit a terrible medical mistake.

35
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.530
I don't blame you for worrying.

36
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.630
Dr. Yoshimura says he doesn't understand

37
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.330
what it's all about either.

38
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.830
I want to hire you to look for the culprit

39
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.730
and find out why he's doing this.

40
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.130
I understand.

41
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.130
You can leave it to Kogoro Mouri!

42
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.330
First off, I think it would help

43
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.530
if I spoke to the victim, Mr. Yoshimura

44
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.630
and got all the details from his personally.

45
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.930
I'm going to see if that Dr. Yoshimura is in his room.

46
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.530
Hello, Yoshimura? It's me.

47
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.830
He was in his room.

48
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.030
I'll take you there.

49
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.230
This is the place, Mr. Mouri.

50
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.030
Yoshimura lives in the corner unit on the 5th floor.

51
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.530
Shall we go up?

52
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.130
What was that just now?

53
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.430
This way!

54
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.330
Hey, Conan!

55
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.630
What in the world?

56
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.630
This is...

57
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.930
Pops, call an ambulance!

58
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.130
Right.

59
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.030
-Yoshimura! -What did you say?

60
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.930
Yes, this is Mr. Yoshimura!

61
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.730
Mitsuo Yoshimura!

62
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.130
Yoshimura!

63
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.830
Hey, Yoshimura! Snap out of it!

64
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.530
Yoshimura...

65
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.430
What does this mean?

66
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.330
The deceased is Mitsuo Yoshimura,

67
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.130
a 25 year old male.

68
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.930
He was employed as a doctor at the city's medical university.

69
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.430
The key to his apartment was found in his pocket.

70
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.130
So Mr. Mouri, you were hired by Mr. Yoshimura

71
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.330
and just happened to witness the accident. Is that right?

72
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.730
Yes. According to his friend, Mr. Ueda,

73
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.430
Mr. Yoshimura was apparently being threatened.

74
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.430
I see.

75
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.430
Mr. Yoshimura's apartment is on the 5th floor.

76
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.030
It's the unit at the extreme end.

77
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.130
I guess he fell from his own apartment.

78
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.430
We'll be going to his apartment now.

79
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.430
We may be able to determine how he fell.

80
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.430
I know it's your job

81
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.130
but we really appreciate your cooperation.

82
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.030
It's really no problem.

83
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.330
The situation being as it is.

84
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.930
I'm so sorry about Mr. Yoshimura.

85
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.030
Huh? No one's here either.

86
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.030
For security reasons, we've programmed the elevator

87
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.530
to stop on every floor at night.

88
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.730
I see. But it must be very irritating when you're in a hurry.

89
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.130
It is. That's why the late Mr. Yoshimura

90
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.730
always used the emergency stairs

91
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.330
of the warehouse on the next building when he was in a hurry.

92
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.730
The stairs on the building next door?

93
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.430
He's right.

94
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.830
The distance between his apartment

95
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.930
and the warehouse stairwell is perfectly jumpable.

96
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.430
I warned him several times he shouldn't, but...

97
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.230
5th floor.

98
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.830
Excuse me, officer.

99
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.230
Would it be all right if I changed?

100
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.230
My apartment's on the next floor

101
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.030
if you need me for something.

102
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.130
I think it'll be all right.

103
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.230
When you're done changing,

104
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.930
please come to Mr. Yoshimura's apartment.

105
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.030
Yes, I most certainly will.

106
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.630
"Yoshimura"

107
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.330
It's May, but this year's pretty chilly.

108
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.830
You're so right.

109
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.130
A glass of whiskey and water.

110
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.830
It looks like he was drinking alone.

111
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.830
It seems he didn't feel safe anywhere else

112
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.730
besides the hospital where he worked and this apartment.

113
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.930
Now that you mention it, recently...

114
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.930
Some very suspicious looking men were following him around.

115
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.230
They'd go to his apartment in the middle of the night sometimes.

116
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.030
According to Mr. Ueda,

117
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.430
the threatening phone calls came at all hours, there was no pattern.

118
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.130
This is...

119
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.730
Is the veranda Mr. Yoshimura always used to get in and out?

120
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.930
Yes, that's right.

121
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.630
Mr. Yoshimura kept a pair of sandals here all the time

122
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.630
and came and went through here.

123
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.030
I warned him against it many times.

124
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.430
Inspector. The apartment was locked

125
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.930
and his key was found in his pocket.

126
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.730
On top of that, the lights...

127
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.330
in the room were all on

128
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.130
and there're no signs of a struggle.

129
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.430
It appears the death was accidental,

130
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.730
a result of Mr. Yoshimura's carelessness.

131
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.830
That theory does appear very credible.

132
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.230
A sandal?

133
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.030
How'd it get way over there?

134
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.430
But...

135
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.730
Wait a minute!

136
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.330
It's not the roof.

137
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Which means...

138
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.030
I see.

139
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.230
Thank you very much.

140
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.230
Gosh. So it was a prank call.

141
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.130
"Ueda"

142
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.930
Huh? This door bell's not working.

143
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.530
Mr. Ueda...

144
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.730
Yes?

145
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.230
Mr. Ueda, I'm so thirsty.

146
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.330
May I have some water?

147
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.530
Sure.

148
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.630
No problem. Come on in.

149
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.030
Thanks!

150
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.530
Wait here, sit wherever you want.

151
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.130
Thank you.

152
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.930
You know, Mr. Ueda,

153
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.530
a flower delivery man was just here.

154
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.230
Yes. I think someone played a prank on them.

155
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.630
Really?

156
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.430
What's the matter, kid?

157
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.430
You shouldn't be up there. It's dangerous!

158
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.930
-Come back here. -All right.

159
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.330
Here's some juice.

160
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.630
Thank you.

161
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.630
After you finish that,

162
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.430
let's both go to where Mr. Mouri is waiting.

163
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.830
Okay!

164
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.330
Mr. Ueda, are you hot?

165
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.630
You're perspiring so much.

166
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.230
I perspire easily.

167
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.830
I'm going to the restroom.

168
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.230
Why don't you finish your drink?

169
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.730
Okay.

170
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.530
I wonder what left that mark.

171
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.230
What is this?

172
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.430
There's another other there.

173
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.630
And over there too.

174
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.030
On the bed, table and sofa too.

175
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.030
I see. Now I understand!

176
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.430
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

177
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.530
Well...

178
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.330
I forgot something in the room downstairs.

179
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.930
I'm going to get it!

180
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.530
Good grief!

181
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.430
"Yoshimura"

182
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.330
Hey!

183
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.630
You shouldn't do that. We're still checking the scene.

184
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.330
I'm sorry!

185
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.930
Actually, I came here to give you a message from Mr. Mouri.

186
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.130
From Mr. Mouri?

187
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.130
He said...

188
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.630
Yes...

189
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.330
Yes, I understand!

190
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.730
I'll go right away,

191
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.730
but you mustn't touch anything in this apartment.

192
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.330
Okay!

193
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.730
"No new messages"

194
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.230
I knew it. There's no mistake about it.

195
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.130
Mr. Yoshimura's death wasn't an accident.

196
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.430
He was murdered!

197
00:12:37.038 --> 00:12:38.438
I regret having to say this,

198
00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.038
but as Mr. Mouri deduced,

199
00:12:40.038 --> 00:12:41.838
it appears Mr. Yoshimura's death was an accident.

200
00:12:41.838 --> 00:12:43.538
For some reason,

201
00:12:43.538 --> 00:12:45.838
when he tried to jump from his veranda to the warehouse,

202
00:12:45.838 --> 00:12:47.538
he must have tripped.

203
00:12:47.538 --> 00:12:48.738
How unfortunate.

204
00:12:48.738 --> 00:12:51.538
Just when you were coming to see him...

205
00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:52.938
Mr. Ueda.

206
00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:55.938
Didn't you call him and tell him we were on our way?

207
00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:59.438
-Yes. -Then I wonder why he would go out?

208
00:13:00.638 --> 00:13:02.838
Children shouldn't butt in!

209
00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:05.138
If you're going to bother us, you can wait outside.

210
00:13:05.138 --> 00:13:06.638
All right.

211
00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:09.038
I guess I have no choice.

212
00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.938
I'll have to put him to sleep for awhile.

213
00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:18.438
What's wrong, Mr. Mouri?

214
00:13:18.438 --> 00:13:22.238
Inspector, I think it's too soon to leave.

215
00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:23.338
What?

216
00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:25.538
There are several suspicious details that need clearing up

217
00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.838
before we dismiss this as a simple accidental death.

218
00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:32.738
Mr. Yoshimura's apartment was locked

219
00:13:32.738 --> 00:13:36.238
but the door chain wasn't on.

220
00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:38.238
Don't you think that it's strange

221
00:13:38.238 --> 00:13:40.338
for a man who was being threatened?

222
00:13:40.338 --> 00:13:42.538
-Yes, that's true. -Another thing.

223
00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:43.838
If he was sitting in his living room

224
00:13:43.838 --> 00:13:46.638
having a drink just prior to falling to his death,

225
00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:50.638
isn't it strange that all the ice was melted?

226
00:13:51.338 --> 00:13:54.738
Hey, Mr. Mouri. What are you trying to say?

227
00:13:54.738 --> 00:14:00.238
Mr. Yoshimura wasn't in his apartment when he fell.

228
00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:01.338
That's ridiculous!

229
00:14:01.338 --> 00:14:03.638
Then, where do you think he was?

230
00:14:03.638 --> 00:14:07.038
The key to that question is Mr. Yoshimura's sandal.

231
00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:09.038
His sandal?

232
00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:10.638
On the victim's foot,

233
00:14:10.638 --> 00:14:13.138
he wore sandals on his left foot

234
00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:15.638
but his right was bare.

235
00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:16.938
The missing side

236
00:14:16.938 --> 00:14:18.538
was on the roof of the warehouse next door

237
00:14:18.538 --> 00:14:21.438
and pretty far in too.

238
00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:26.438
Even if he'd tripped while trying to jump to the emergency stairs,

239
00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:29.738
I doubt the sandal would fly all the way there,

240
00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:33.138
he'd have had to fall from above the 5th floor.

241
00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:37.938
I'd guess the roof!

242
00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:42.438
But the door to the roof was locked.

243
00:14:42.438 --> 00:14:45.038
Are you sure? Then that means...

244
00:14:45.038 --> 00:14:47.238
If it wasn't from the roof,

245
00:14:47.238 --> 00:14:49.538
then there's only one other place I can think of.

246
00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:51.538
You're not implying...

247
00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:53.838
I am, Inspector.

248
00:14:53.838 --> 00:14:57.038
Mr. Yoshimura didn't fall from his apartment on the 5th floor,

249
00:14:57.038 --> 00:15:00.738
he fell from this apartment on the 6th floor.

250
00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:03.138
Mr. Ueda.

251
00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:05.138
You caused it to happen, didn't you?

252
00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:08.838
That's absolutely absurd!

253
00:15:08.838 --> 00:15:12.238
Officer Chiba, will you help me?

254
00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:13.338
Sure.

255
00:15:13.338 --> 00:15:16.638
First, move the television to the corner of the room.

256
00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:17.738
Okay.

257
00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:21.438
Is this all right?

258
00:15:21.438 --> 00:15:22.738
Fine.

259
00:15:22.738 --> 00:15:24.538
Next, move the table to the center of the room

260
00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:27.538
and put the chairs on both sides.

261
00:15:27.538 --> 00:15:30.838
And finally, move that bed against the wall.

262
00:15:30.838 --> 00:15:32.738
Mr. Mouri, hold it right there.

263
00:15:32.738 --> 00:15:34.738
A bed's too heavy to move.

264
00:15:34.738 --> 00:15:37.238
Just you wait and see.

265
00:15:37.238 --> 00:15:38.438
Huh?

266
00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.738
This bed has casters, so it's easy to move.

267
00:15:42.738 --> 00:15:44.638
Now, Inspector,

268
00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:46.338
look at this room carefully.

269
00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:49.238
Haven't you seen this exact same setting somewhere before?

270
00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:58.838
Everything's set up like Mr. Yoshimura's apartment, #501.

271
00:15:58.838 --> 00:16:03.338
Mr. Ueda rearranged his apartment in this manner.

272
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:08.638
He made Mr. Yoshimura think this was his apartment.

273
00:16:08.638 --> 00:16:11.538
But Mr. Mouri, the furniture's not the same.

274
00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:12.638
That's right.

275
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.838
But if you were to wake up in dark,

276
00:16:14.838 --> 00:16:15.938
you wouldn't notice right away

277
00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:19.038
that you were in someone else's place.

278
00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:21.138
That's how you got Mr. Yoshimura

279
00:16:21.138 --> 00:16:24.438
to fall to his death from the window.

280
00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:26.338
Just a minute!

281
00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:28.038
When Yoshimura fell,

282
00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:31.738
I was with you, Mr. Mouri, remember?

283
00:16:31.738 --> 00:16:33.538
That's right.

284
00:16:33.538 --> 00:16:37.138
You used me as your alibi.

285
00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:40.938
But if I were with you,

286
00:16:40.938 --> 00:16:45.638
how did I make Yoshimura fall? Tell me that.

287
00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:47.538
You knew Mr. Yoshimura had a habit

288
00:16:47.538 --> 00:16:50.838
of using the warehouse's emergency stairs,

289
00:16:50.838 --> 00:16:53.038
so you used this fact to stage your trick.

290
00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:59.138
You were probably drinking with Mr. Yoshimura in his apartment,

291
00:16:59.138 --> 00:17:03.538
drugged him with something that could snap him out of quickly,

292
00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:05.038
just in case something happened.

293
00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:07.538
Something weak like a sleep inducing drug.

294
00:17:07.538 --> 00:17:08.938
After he fell asleep,

295
00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:11.938
you carried him to this apartment and put him on the bed.

296
00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:18.638
Mr. Yoshimura was mentally distraught

297
00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:21.938
and you fooled him into thinking he was in his own apartment,

298
00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:25.438
then you left him there and came to meet us at the coffee shop,

299
00:17:25.438 --> 00:17:27.938
where you called and told him those men were coming for him now.

300
00:17:27.938 --> 00:17:31.038
And that he should get away from there.

301
00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:34.038
And you had an accomplice.

302
00:17:34.038 --> 00:17:35.938
Are you saying he had help?

303
00:17:35.938 --> 00:17:38.138
Inspector Megure.

304
00:17:38.138 --> 00:17:41.438
This man has something to tell us.

305
00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:43.938
My name is Umemoto. I'm a florist.

306
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:47.738
Inspector Megure, this is the accomplice.

307
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:51.838
Although he didn't realize that he was aiding a murder.

308
00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:53.238
Mr. Umemoto.

309
00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:58.838
Please tell everyone what you did here tonight.

310
00:17:58.838 --> 00:18:00.138
All right.

311
00:18:00.138 --> 00:18:02.438
I received an order for flowers

312
00:18:02.438 --> 00:18:05.738
to be delivered to Mr. Ueda in unit 601,

313
00:18:05.738 --> 00:18:08.938
of this condominium tonight at 7 pm.

314
00:18:08.938 --> 00:18:10.438
To this apartment?

315
00:18:10.438 --> 00:18:14.138
Yes, I arrived at 7 pm

316
00:18:14.138 --> 00:18:15.638
and I'd been told that the buzzer was out of order

317
00:18:15.638 --> 00:18:18.638
so I should knock when I arrived.

318
00:18:18.638 --> 00:18:21.638
I did as I was instructed and pounded on the door

319
00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:24.238
but no one answered.

320
00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:27.238
So what did you do?

321
00:18:27.238 --> 00:18:29.238
Well, there was nothing I could do,

322
00:18:29.238 --> 00:18:32.738
so I made my other deliveries and came back again.

323
00:18:32.738 --> 00:18:35.138
That gentleman over there came to the door

324
00:18:35.138 --> 00:18:37.338
and said that he didn't place any order.

325
00:18:38.638 --> 00:18:40.138
Inspector Megure.

326
00:18:40.138 --> 00:18:42.338
Now, do you understand?

327
00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:45.538
Mr. Ueda's call scared Mr. Yoshimura,

328
00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:47.838
then Mr. Umemoto the florist's timing is perfect

329
00:18:47.838 --> 00:18:50.038
when he knocks on the door.

330
00:18:50.038 --> 00:18:54.538
Mr. Yoshimura thinks it is the men who are after him.

331
00:18:54.538 --> 00:18:58.038
So he tries to jump to the next building like he always does.

332
00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:03.738
But he's on the 6th floor and he doesn't make it.

333
00:19:07.738 --> 00:19:10.038
Then he falls straight down.

334
00:19:10.038 --> 00:19:13.938
That's ridiculous! You have some imagination!

335
00:19:13.938 --> 00:19:17.938
The reason you held Mr. Yoshimura up was

336
00:19:17.938 --> 00:19:19.938
to give yourself an excuse to go back

337
00:19:19.938 --> 00:19:23.338
to your apartment rearrange the furniture.

338
00:19:23.338 --> 00:19:27.238
That's why you said you wanted to change out of your bloodied sweater.

339
00:19:27.238 --> 00:19:29.738
The reason why you were perspiring

340
00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:31.638
when Conan went to your place

341
00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:34.938
was you'd been moving the furniture all by yourself.

342
00:19:35.938 --> 00:19:38.538
That's a lie! Can you prove any of this?

343
00:19:38.538 --> 00:19:39.938
You want proof?

344
00:19:39.938 --> 00:19:41.638
We have proof.

345
00:19:42.638 --> 00:19:44.438
When you were in the coffee shop,

346
00:19:44.438 --> 00:19:47.038
you said you didn't smoke Cigarettes.

347
00:19:48.038 --> 00:19:51.338
And yet, there're cigarettes and an ashtray right there.

348
00:19:52.338 --> 00:19:54.538
Mr. Yoshimura's a smoker.

349
00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:57.538
Just in case he woke up before time and wanted a cigarette,

350
00:19:57.538 --> 00:19:59.538
you didn't want him wandering around looking for an ashtray

351
00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:02.638
because that would make him realize he wasn't in his own place.

352
00:20:02.638 --> 00:20:07.438
That's why you brought one from his' place.

353
00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:10.738
Mr. Yoshimura brought this himself when he came to visit!

354
00:20:10.738 --> 00:20:13.538
It doesn't prove anything!

355
00:20:13.538 --> 00:20:17.938
Inspector, please check the incoming calls on that telephone.

356
00:20:19.138 --> 00:20:20.938
Let's see now.

357
00:20:22.038 --> 00:20:24.238
A call came in at 7:15 pm.

358
00:20:25.638 --> 00:20:29.238
Mr. Mouri, the number is from a cellular phone.

359
00:20:29.238 --> 00:20:33.738
It's probably Mr. Ueda's number.

360
00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:36.638
It's the call he made from the coffee shop.

361
00:20:36.638 --> 00:20:39.438
-I see. -Hey, hold on just one minute!

362
00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.838
I called my apartment by mistake that time.

363
00:20:42.838 --> 00:20:44.038
Really?

364
00:20:44.038 --> 00:20:46.938
Then why is your call to Mr. Yoshimura

365
00:20:46.938 --> 00:20:49.338
recorded on his telephone?

366
00:20:50.938 --> 00:20:56.238
How did you confirm that Mr. Yoshimura was in the apartment?

367
00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:59.038
You must've been positive that you wouldn't be suspected

368
00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:01.038
since you were with us all along

369
00:21:01.038 --> 00:21:02.938
and you thought his death would be written off

370
00:21:02.938 --> 00:21:04.838
as a simple accident, didn't you?

371
00:21:04.838 --> 00:21:08.938
That's why you didn't think we'd ever check his telephone.

372
00:21:08.938 --> 00:21:11.538
Is that true, Mr. Ueda?

373
00:21:14.538 --> 00:21:17.138
The truth is, I bought some stock and lost a lot of money,

374
00:21:17.138 --> 00:21:19.038
Just when I needed money,

375
00:21:19.038 --> 00:21:23.238
Yoshimura came to me with a no fail proposition.

376
00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:25.438
His plan was that I'd steal drugs from the university

377
00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:29.438
and he'd sell them.

378
00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:31.138
So I did like he said, I got my share of the money

379
00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:32.738
and that tided me over.

380
00:21:32.738 --> 00:21:37.238
But then he said that if I didn't do it again,

381
00:21:37.238 --> 00:21:40.638
he threatened to tell the university about me.

382
00:21:41.338 --> 00:21:43.838
I was afraid I'd be dragged in too deep

383
00:21:43.838 --> 00:21:47.138
so I started planning how to get rid of him.

384
00:21:47.138 --> 00:21:48.538
Just about the same time,

385
00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:52.338
I heard that he was being threatened by some bad business partners,

386
00:21:52.338 --> 00:21:54.838
so I decided to use that.

387
00:23:31.438 --> 00:23:33.838
Case solved.

388
00:23:36.538 --> 00:23:39.238
Pops, you sneezed earlier too.

389
00:23:39.238 --> 00:23:40.438
Are you catching a cold?

390
00:23:40.438 --> 00:23:44.138
No, my nose is just itchy, that's all.

391
00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:45.438
As for you,

392
00:23:45.438 --> 00:23:48.238
you'd better not catch a cold and cause us trouble.

393
00:23:48.238 --> 00:23:50.638
I wouldn't talk.

394
00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:53.038
Oh, right! Conan! Come with me tomorrow, too.

395
00:23:53.038 --> 00:23:55.238
What? You're working tomorrow, too?

396
00:23:55.238 --> 00:23:57.038
You are such a fool!

397
00:23:57.038 --> 00:24:00.338
Somehow whenever you're with me, I have luck!

398
00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:03.238
I feel like I could win big at the horse races!

399
00:24:04.238 --> 00:24:06.638
Like that will ever happen.

400
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:10.538
"Next Episode" -Smoke is coming out of the incinerator!

401
00:24:21.038 --> 00:24:23.338
Huh? That's strange.

402
00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:26.538
Just a while ago, there were only blue cushions.

403
00:24:27.638 --> 00:24:29.738
One extra cushion.

404
00:24:29.738 --> 00:24:31.738
What does this all mean?

405
00:24:32.738 --> 00:24:38.038
Next Conan, "The Nonvanishing Evidence (Part 1)"

406
00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:41.256
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:43.256
"Sound of the clock"

408
00:24:43.256 --> 00:24:44.956
It's been a while but in the next episode, animals appear.

409
00:24:44.956 --> 00:24:46.956
Sit!

410
00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.156
What?
