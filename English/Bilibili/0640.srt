00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,140

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,340
Yes.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,340
In Okayama where fruit

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,640
such as peaches and grapes are local specialties.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,140
A campaign with the slogan,

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,140
"The city of fruit parfait-Okayama"

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,540
is currently being held.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,640
So, various cafes and restaurants all over Okayama City

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,240
are serving a variety of parfaits.

Here's your Castle Parfait.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,640
It looks delicious.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,740
There's an ample amount of white peaches

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,240
and it's really delicious.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,940

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,140
Okay.

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,140
I going to make my rounds

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,240
to all the best five shops with delicious octopus rice and liquor!

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,840
Just as would be expected of Okayama, the place famous for peaches.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,540
The girls are all really peachy too.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,140
Like the fog clears.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,440
Let's see through love and crime as well.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,040
A journey to pursue the lost memory of a beauty

34

39
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,465
Too bad.

40
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:40,965
I wanted Mr. Mouri to accompany on the gourmet report too.

41
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:43,065
Well-known detective cuts the Gordian Knot Whether

42
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:46,065
or not the name of Sleeping Kogoro is in the report,

43
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:48,865
makes a great difference in the response we get from the readers.

44
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,665
You mean to tell me that maybe I was chosen

45
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,865
because I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter?

46
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,565
I guess so.

47
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:58,865
If I succeed in all the gourmet specialties I handle

48
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,465

the artist who is well known for painting beauties.

57
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,565
I think I've heard of it before.

The lyrics of the song are written here too.

59
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:40,165

60
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:44,165

61
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:49,065

00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,765
Please.

That's the woman we saw a while ago.

71
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,365
Let go.

72
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,965
I'm going to call the police.

73
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,065
Police?

74
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,765
Wait.

75
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,165
Ouch... my head hurts.

76
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:36,665
Are you all right?

77
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,965
No, stay away.

78
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,065
Are you being pursued by someone?

79
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:43,865
Pursued? Me?

80
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:48,165
No good. Nothing...

81
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,965
I can't remember anything!

82
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,665
My head hurts.

83
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,965
What's your name, miss?

84
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,965
Where did you come from?

85
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,665
My name... I can't remember.

86
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,065
I don't know.

87
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,165
She.

88
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,365
What's the matter?

89
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,765
My, she's the person we saw a while ago...

90
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:09,365
Ran, call the ambulance.

91
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,365
Yes.

92
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:25,965
Darn.

93
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:29,365
I didn't get to eat my octopus rice.

94
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:31,165
What the heck's going on?

95
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,565
Post-traumatic amnesia?

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,965
It seems to be a sudden onset of memory loss caused by trauma.

97
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:46,765
There are bruises on her body too.

98
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,765
Will she be able to regain her memory?

99
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:51,165
I can't say for sure.

100
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:54,665
Fortunately, there seems to be no damage to her brain,

101
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,765
so all I can say is the possibility is not all that low.

102
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,265
And...

103
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:02,365
Didn't she have anything on her that could be used as identification?

104
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:05,065
Dad, what took you so long?

105
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,665
How about it?

106
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,765
She didn't have anything on her.

107
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:12,065
She had no cell phone, I.D. or wallet on her.

108
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,465
Did you contact the police?

109
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:17,665
Of course, and we were being questioned until a while ago.

110
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,565
They said they'd investigate just to be safe,

111
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,865
but that it's questionable

112
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,365
whether there's any criminal activity involved.

113
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:26,165
Which means, I'm not in need.

114
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,665
Okay, octopus rice here I go.

115
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:30,365
But you've got a job request.

116
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,065
Job request?

117
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,465
Mr. Mouri... I believe?

118
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:39,565
Yes. I'm the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

119
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:44,165
Please... Please investigate who and where I'm from.

120
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,565
Please.

121
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,765
Yes.

122
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:52,165
So, pops officially accepted her request

123
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:56,965
and proceeded investigation of her past but...

124
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:01,465
I asked her to draw a sketch of whatever came to mind.

125
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:04,965
It's uncertain whether they are correlated in any way,

126
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,365
but I think it's safe to say

127
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,065
that they are all parts of memory.

128
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:12,665
Incomprehensible.

129
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:16,265
Isn't this a bird? A crane?

130
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,965
I got it. It's a red-crowned crane.

131
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,465
This symbolizes the Kourakuen Garden.

132
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:26,065
That's where we first heard her sing the song Evening Primrose.

133
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,765
And, doesn't this one look like a cat?

134
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,165
True.

135
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,165
Speaking of a black cat...

136
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,065
Right. Yumeji Takehisa.

137
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,665
Right. The Yumeji Takehisa Art Museum.

138
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,165
You remember it, don't you?

139
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,065
Yes, I do.

140
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,865
But, why was I in such a place?

141
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:53,265
I see, she still can't remember the critical fact that we seek.

142
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:56,265
But there're things we did find out.

143
00:08:56,265 --> 00:09:00,665
All these sketches are undoubtedly of places that you've been.

144
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,565
The places I've been to?

145
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,765
Yes. I can't be all that sure,

146
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,165
but that is a possibility.

147
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,565
What other things can you figure out?

148
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,465
This is a peach, isn't it?

149
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:13,765
And this one is grapes?

150
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,065
It could be.

151
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,965
But since both are local specialties,

152
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,165
it's difficult to specify the location.

153
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:24,165
We've got one more clue to go on.

154
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,765
That cell phone.

155
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,965
Please, let me listen to it once more.

156
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,365
Who the heck are you?

157
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,465
Please.

158
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:35,365
Yes, I remember that too,

159
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:40,365
but I still can't remember why I did something like that.

160
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,865
Leave it to me.

161
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:48,165
I, Kogoro Mouri will cut the Gordian Knot

162
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,165
and help get your memory back.

163
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,265
Excuse me.

164
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:55,865
Oh, no. I'm sorry, I've got to write my article.

165
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:58,465
Well... I just got word from the editor

166
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,865
to slightly change the contents of the article.

167
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,065
Change?

168
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,665
Just what do you mean?

169
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:11,065
We're going to upload her picture,

170
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,065
sketches that she'd drawn

171
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,465
as well as the Great Detective Sleeping Kogoro

172
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,365
investigating the case on our Town Magazine Website.

173
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,965
I'm sure we'll get great response.

174
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,065
But, is it going to be all right?

175
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:24,565
What about your all important report on sweets?

176
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,365
Sweets and mystery,

177
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:28,965
we're continuing on with these two topics.

178
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:32,965
As for me, I'd like to go with just one topic, sweets though.

179
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:39,665
"Okayama Electric Tramway" -We attempted to retrace her memories

180
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:42,965
based on her sketches

181
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,765
but, aside from the red-crowned crane and the black cat,

182
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,965
we failed to find places matching her sketches.

183
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,365
She wasn't able to regain her memory either.

184
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:01,365
We're being followed?

185
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,265
If I'm not mistaken, back then...

186
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:05,765
Ran, call an ambulance.

187
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,765
Okay.

188
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,465
The same person?

189
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:10,465
Okay, then.

190
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,865
Conan, not that way.

191
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:17,965
Shoots.

192
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,665
Darn it.

193
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:31,365
What's the matter, Conan?

194
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:34,165
Nope, it's nothing.

195
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,665
Is anything the matter?

196
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,665
Did you recall something new?

197
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:43,665
Quiet.

198
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,465
Where?

199
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,065
Where is this sound coming from?

200
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,965
See, it's recorded all right.

201
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,765
How beautiful.

202
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:06,265
Please let me listen to it.

203
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,365
Yes, go ahead.

204
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:12,665
Grandma.

205
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,565
Where did you record that?

206
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,065
This was from...

207
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:20,965
"Nozaki former residence" -It was from the Nozaki residence

208
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,965
who made a fortune from the salt farm business.

209
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:26,565
Their residence was also known as the "Salt Palace."

210
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,465
"Water Zither Cave Suikinkutsu"

211
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,665
Suikinkutsu...

212
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:43,165
is composed of an urn buried underground

213
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:44,465
with an open hole atop

214
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:46,465
allowing droplets from the water basin to drip through

215
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,865
and echo inside,

216
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:49,765
it's a refined device uniquely found

217
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:51,965
in Japanese gardens, it says.

218
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,365
It sounds really beautiful.

219
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:58,365
So, you're certain that you heard this sound here?

220
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:01,265
Yes. Most likely.

221
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,465
But...

222
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:05,965
You still can't remember why you came here, right?

223
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,165
No.

224
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,265
Mayuko?

225
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:12,065
Where were you?

226
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:15,265
I was looking for you all this time.

227
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:17,465
It's me, Kanae.

228
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,265
Your friend.

229
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,265
Kanae?

230
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,365
That's right, Mayuko.

231
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:25,165
Mayuko?

232
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,470
"Mayuko Kichise (25)" -Mayuko Kichise is my name?

233
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,870
"Kanae Nonomiya (25)" -Yes, you're Kanae Nonomiya's friend, my friend.

234
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,970
Kanae, my friend.

235
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,970
We got some response on our website too.

236
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,070
She is Ms. Mayuko Kichise who works at a cafe in Okayama City.

237
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,470
The customers and staff at the cafe are posting.

238
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,070
There's no mistake about it.

239
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,370
That's where I got to know Mayuko too.

240
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,670
What about her family?

241
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,370
Her parents.

242
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,770
Something about they died of an illness when she was little.

243
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,470
She seems to have no relatives either,

244
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,170
and I've heard before that she was completely alone.

245
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,970
How about it?

246
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,870
Now do you remember something?

247
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,670
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,470
No good?

249
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,970
You said that you were looking all over for Mayuko, didn't you?

250
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,570
Yes. But, I had no idea that she had amnesia.

251
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,370
What shall I do?

252
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,570
If she stays as is, my older brother will...

253
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,570
What's this about your older brother?

254
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,070
Please, Mayuko.

255
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,270
Please try to remember.

256
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,870
My older brother... Please help him.

257
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,370
The night before yesterday,

258
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,070
from this jewelry store in Okayama City,

259
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,770
three billion yen worth of valuables were stolen

260
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,270
and the man arrested as a suspect was,

261
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,970
"Keigo Nonomiya (28)" -Mr. Keigo Nonomiya, Kanae's older brother.

262
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,370
According to the news,

263
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,070
the police found him unconscious

264
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,470
in front of the emergency exit beside the store.

265
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,970
At that time, part of the jewelry that was stolen,

266
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,670
was found in his possession.

267
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,070
Since my brother had a previous record of theft,

268
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,870
they arrested on charges of being one of the robbers in the group.

269
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,270
But when I visited him at the police,

270
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,470
my brother definitely told me that he was innocent.

271
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,570
My brother just happened to pass by that road.

272
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,070
Then he was attacked by the culprit there,

273
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,670
and set up as a scapegoat.

274
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,070
And...

275
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,770
I... witnessed that?

276
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,970
He said, "She's undoubtedly your friend Mayuko."

277
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,070
"She's the only one that can prove my innocence,

278
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,670
so please have her testify."

279
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,970
That's why I kept on looking for her.

280
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,370
Is that so?

281
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,270
Mayuko, can't you remember anything?

282
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,470
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,270
Leave everything to me.

284
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,470
You can count on me, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

285
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,670
Mayuko's loss of memory

286
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,370
may be due to the fact that the culprit came

287
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,570
after her to shut her up.

288
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,770
I see. That's possible.

289
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,170
If you regain your memory,

290
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,070
the robbery case will be solved.

291
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,070
We'll be killing two birds with one stone.

292
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,970
Do you know where Mayuko lives?

293
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,770
Yes, of course.

294
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,770
That's it. If we go there,

295
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,670
we may be able to come up with something.

296
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,270
Mayuko explained the situation to the landlord,

297
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,570
and we decided to investigate Mayuko's room.

298
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,870
Look.

299
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,570
This is...

300
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,870
Isn't this one side of Mayuko's pierced earring?

301
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,770
Which means she fell down these stairs and lost her memory?

302
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,970
What's going on here?

303
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,770
This is a badge?

304
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:30,270
The person in this picture most probably messed this place up.

305
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,570
From the looks of the photo,

306
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,270
could he be her boyfriend?

307
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,970
My room?

308
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,970
My boyfriend?

309
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,170
Kanae, have you ever seen this person around Mayuko before.

310
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,070
No, because Mayuko never liked to talk about things like that.

311
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,270
I can't... I can't recall anything, my head hurts.

312
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,170
Are you all right?

313
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,170
Don't you think she should rest a while, dad?

314
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,870
Yes.

315
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,570
This is an order form for custom made jeans?

316
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,970
The order date is three days ago,

317
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,170
a day before the robbery case.

318
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,670
This shop is famous.

319
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,770
We headed for the Betty Smith Museum in Kojima,

320
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,370
the district famous for being the place

321
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,970
where jeans in Japan originated.

322
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,970
"Betty Smith Museum"

323
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,770
I remember.

324
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,070
She did order custom made jeans.

325
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,570
Like the one and only jeans in the world,

326
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,770
I'm going to live a life of my very own.

327
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,670
A life of my very own...

328
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,170
I've heard her say it before too.

329
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,570
Although you were a tomboy from before,

330
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,170
you were prone to believe people immediately, and was usually deceived.

331
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,970
Each time you tried to get back on your feet, you were betrayed.

332
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,070
Your life was a repetition of this.

333
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,670
So, you swore to yourself that you would shape up

334
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,470
and said you would start living a life of your very own.

335
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,170
You told me so yourself, Mayuko.

336
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,570
I said something like that?

337
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,970
Shall we head off for lunch?

338
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,570
They have pretty good octopus rice in this area.

339
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,470
Octopus rice sounds good.

340
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,570
Wait...

341
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,270
Welcome.

342
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,270
I'll show you the way. So one moment please.

343
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,570
It looks good.

344
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,770
Dad.

345
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,970
Mr. Nashida.

346
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,970
Mr. Taira?

347
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,170
"Kenzo Taira (40)" -Yes, I'm Taira.

348
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,970
Long time no see, Mr. Nashida.

349
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,670
You look really pleasantly different.

350
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,470
How embarrassing.

351
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,170
I don't mean to go through any image change

352
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,770
or something like that.

353
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,670
The fact is, I'm thinking of turning a new leaf,

354
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,670
and open up a new shop soon.

355
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,270
That's really something.

356
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,870
I'll report it on the next article.

357
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,370
Let me introduce him.

358
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,370
He's Mr. Kenzo Taira, a pastry maker living in Okayama.

359
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,170
Mr. Nashida, you used to be a famous sommelier yourself too.

360
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,470
Thanks to the wine you chose for me,

361
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,770
I was able to make masterpiece sweets.

362
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,070
Is that right?

363
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,570
How embarrassing.

364
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,970
The fact is while being in charge of gourmet articles

365
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,270
for the Town Magazine,

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm waiting for a chance to make a comeback.

367
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,070
I'll be seeing you, then.

368
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,970
Oh, yes, see you.

369
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,170
Hello, editor.

370
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,370
Right now?

371
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,970
Yes, sir.

372
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,970
I'm sorry, the editor just called me.

373
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,070
I'll be back in about an hour,

374
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,970
so please go on and eat without me.

375
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,070
All right.

376
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,370
I see.

377
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,970
This is, if you take a good look at it,

378
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,070
doesn't it look like a rice cooker?

379
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,070
Now that you mentioned it.

380
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,570
It could be a fragment of your memory of having eaten somewhere.

381
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,970
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,970
I can't remember anything after all.

383
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,970
-Mayuko, please wait. -Hey, wait.

385
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,270
Dad.

386
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,270
Conan.

387
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,670
This is?

388
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,970
If you want to know of your past, find a place to be alone.

389
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,770
Conan!

390
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,070
Conan.

391
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,770
"No matter how long I wait"

392
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,370
"Seto Ohashi Bridge" -"No matter how long I wait"

393
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,770
"He never shows up"

394
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:20,370
"Sad like the evening primrose"

395
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,970
Ms. Mayuko.

396
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,270
Darn.

397
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,670
Are we too late?

398
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,170
I'm going to get my memory back no matter what it takes.

399
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,870
The grapes are gone

400
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,870
and there are two bunches bananas instead.

401
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,470
By changing the angle,

402
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,970
a different thing can be seen?

403
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,970
What a beautiful moon.

404
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,170
Mr. Mouri, please cut the Gordian knot.

405
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,670
In fact, the culprit was depicted

406
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,570
in the sketches drawn by Mayuko to begin with.

407
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,870
Next Conan,

408
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,870
"Memory Trip of the Eight Sketches (Kurashiki Part)"

409
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,139
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:24,839
"Grapes".

411
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,039
Isn't there a way to regain loss memory?

412
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,839
I lose my memory at times too.

413
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,885
You know yourself, don't you?
