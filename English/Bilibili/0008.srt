1
00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:05.783
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:09.073
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a pill that shrunk him!

3
00:00:09.073 --> 00:00:10.283
Doesn't matter if I'm small!

4
00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:12.233
My mind is that of
a former great detective!

5
00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.693
Today's case takes place
at an art museum!

6
00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:15.403
Behind the scenes is a grisly, red death!

7
00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:18.303
No matter the incident,
there is always only one truth!

8
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.700
The Murder of the Art Museum Owner.

9
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.690
Medieval Art Exhibit

10
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.610
Patrolling an art museum at night
is the last thing I wanted to do!

11
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.480
You'll never make a good watchman
with an attitude like that.

12
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.150
Did you just hear something?

13
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.320
P-Please don't tease me like that, sir!

14
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.360
I-It came from this room...

15
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.530
Who's there?!

16
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.570
Is there someone in here?

17
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.650
A medieval suit of armor? All by itself?

18
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.190
Two watchmen saw it!

19
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.350
Everyone's talking about it!

20
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.320
What do you say we all go there
right now? It sounds interesting!

21
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.100
The museum obviously cooked that
story up to bring in more visitors!

22
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.940
Yeah, Ran! Only kids would fall for that!

23
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.840
And you're not a kid all of a sudden?

24
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.860
Well, time to get to work.

25
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.680
Guess I'll do my homework.

26
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.240
Not so fast!

27
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.780
Coming?

28
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.750
Yes!

29
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.190
Ran always gets like that
when she gets mad.

30
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.960
Shouldn't have let her learn karate.

31
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.010
Look at all these beautiful paintings!

32
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.070
I'm so glad we came!

33
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.450
Look at this! The colors are so lovely!

34
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.320
I take it you like that painting, Miss?

35
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.150
I, too, enjoy this painting very much.

36
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.570
No, I love all of the paintings here!

37
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.570
Almost as if they were my own children.

38
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.630
Who might you be?

39
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.110
Oh, where are my manners?

40
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.330
My name is Ochiai.
I run this art gallery.

41
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.770
Oh! I should have known!

42
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.010
Please enjoy your visit here.

43
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.280
Kubota! What are you doing?!

44
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.350
How many times have I said to wear
gloves when handling exhibits?!

45
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.590
I-I'm sorry!

46
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.780
You can go.

47
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.570
Iijima-kun. Please take over for him.

48
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.160
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.320
As empty and quiet as ever, I see.

50
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.650
Mr. Manaka...

51
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.280
Ten days left until
this place shuts down.

52
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.880
Take care of all this moldy,
old junk for me until then!

53
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.780
Okay, architect. Bring the blueprints.

54
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.650
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.020
This art gallery is going
to close for good?

56
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.150
Yes. The previous owner's
company went bankrupt

57
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.490
so he sold this place
to that Mr. Manaka.

58
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.530
He sold it under the agreement
that Mr. Manaka would keep it running!

59
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.150
But then the instant he bought it,

60
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.800
he said he was going
to turn it into a hotel!

61
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.170
He's carelessly handling
another exhibit again.

62
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.480
I take it you're Kubota-kun?

63
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.110
I've heard about you.

64
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.360
I suggest you hurry and scrape
whatever money you can get together!

65
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.950
Damn it!

66
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.820
Again?!

67
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.290
Please enjoy your visit.

68
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.850
Why didn't he get angry again just now?

69
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.170
Earth Gallery

70
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.110
Sky Gallery

71
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.080
Sea Gallery

72
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.510
Huh?

73
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.980
No entry.

74
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.530
That's strange. There's supposed
to be another room up ahead.

75
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.990
Just forget about it.
Let's hurry and get through this place.

76
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.440
So tired!

77
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.530
Let's go home, Ran.

78
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.770
I'm starving!

79
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.230
Talk about pathetic!
Getting exhausted so easily like this!

80
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.740
Huh?

81
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.900
The no entrance sign is gone.

82
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.680
Hey! Since we're here,
why don't we go see the last room?

83
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.900
You can go home if you want,

84
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.320
but you'll have to cook
dinner yourselves.

85
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.560
That's not fair!
That's not fair!

86
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.070
Hell Gallery

87
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.650
This room sure is dark...

88
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.690
Well, it is the Hell Gallery.

89
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.940
What a huge picture!

90
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.280
It literally is a picture from Hell.

91
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.750
The title is "Divine Punishment."

92
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.680
It says it's a picture of a knight
of justice sealing away a demon.

93
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.480
It's Mr. Manaka, the owner!

94
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.410
You again?!

95
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.530
Yes, sir!

96
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.280
I assure you, I haven't allowed anyone
to touch the corpse, Inspector!

97
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.360
So, did anyone see who did it?

98
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.780
No. I've checked with everyone,
but no one saw a thing...

99
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.830
That security camera might
have caught the person on tape!

100
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.870
Okay, here we go.

101
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.840
What a stupid murderer. Being caught
on tape without knowing it...

102
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.360
Oh? It's the owner!

103
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.610
Time to come out, killer!

104
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.250
Let us have a good look at your face--

105
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.570
Wait a second!

106
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.310
I've seen this scene somewhere before!

107
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.790
It's exactly like in that painting!

108
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.230
What painting?

109
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.030
The picture on display
directly across from the victim.

110
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.530
The title was "Divine Punishment."

111
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.530
The murderer must have
killed him in this manner

112
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.650
to make it look exactly
like that painting.

113
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.780
What a daring murderer, though.

114
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.780
It would be all over if someone
saw them wearing that around.

115
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.940
Now that you mention it, there was
a no-entry sign in front of the room.

116
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.070
What now?

117
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.310
Ran. That was around
4 o'clock, wasn't it?

118
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.780
But when we passed by just after 5:00,
the sign was gone.

119
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.900
The murder took place
at approximately 4:30.

120
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.460
It would seem it was the murderer
who put the sign up.

121
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.320
After doing that to keep people away,

122
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.650
the murderer put the armor on
and hid in the room.

123
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.400
And then killed Mr. Manaka.

124
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.070
Which means the killer was someone
well-acquainted with the museum.

125
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.370
In other words...

126
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.810
...the killer is one of you.

127
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.520
Hey, look! The owner's doing something!

128
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.150
Hey, you! Don't be messing with
the tape without permission!

129
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.990
Look! He's doing something
before the killer jumped out...

130
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.220
He realized something
and took that card!

131
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.700
And then the pen on top of the desk!

132
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.870
He's writing something!

133
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.780
He threw the pen away!

134
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.590
What about the card?!

135
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.700
Crumpled up in his hands!

136
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.190
Does that card say what I think it might?

137
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.910
It might still be in his hand!

138
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.320
I found this piece of paper
in the victim's hand.

139
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.790
What's this?!

140
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.760
K-Kubota!

141
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.190
W-What's my name doing on that?!

142
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.610
It seems you wore the armor to conceal
your identity from the camera,

143
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.670
but it also seems that
the victim wasn't so easily fooled!

144
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.370
N-No! It wasn't me!

145
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.340
In that case, give us your alibi.
Where were you at 4:30?

146
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:08.110
I was alone in the office, doing work
that Mr. Ochiai asked me to do...

147
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.480
Yes, I did ask him to do some work.

148
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.990
Then that means nobody
saw you, doesn't it?

149
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.330
Hold on! What motive would
I have for killing the owner?!

150
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.030
There's no point in trying to talk
your way out of this, Kubota-san!

151
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.940
The owner threatened
to sue you for damages

152
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.780
because you were secretly
selling this museum's exhibits!

153
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.740
Well, you see...

154
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.690
Is this the truth?

155
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.190
But that had nothing to do with this!

156
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.680
I wasn't the one who killed him!

157
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.900
If you say so.

158
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:44.140
The truth will come to light once
my men find the suit of armor.

159
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.360
Inspector Megure!
There's a ballpoint pen over here!

160
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.760
What?

161
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.280
Excellent work, my boy.

162
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.200
This is quite a nice pen!

163
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.650
That pen was created this year

164
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.030
in celebration of Beika Art
Museum's 50th anniversary.

165
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.610
Everyone who works here has one.

166
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.900
So, someone accidentally
left it here then?

167
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.030
Both colors and widths
are exactly the same.

168
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.430
This is probably the one the victim used.

169
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.280
That's strange.

170
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.370
Kubota-san should have known
about the security camera,

171
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.480
so why did he choose this room,

172
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.270
especially if it meant wearing armor
to conceal his identity?

173
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.570
To make it look like that painting?

174
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.500
No, he doesn't seem
to have much interest in art.

175
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.280
Would such a person actually
do something like this?

176
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.780
Oh, man!

177
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.820
It's straight out of a horror movie!

178
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.790
Hey there!

179
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.500
Hey, little boy!
You can't just barge in here!

180
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.430
Inspector Megure says he wants you
to help with something else.

181
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.570
He must've figured out we really
wanted to watch the tape.

182
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.440
Well, let's get going.

183
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.400
Right.

184
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.680
This is where it starts!

185
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.460
What's with that expression?

186
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.860
What's on the card that
he's so shocked about?!

187
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.440
Why did he throw the pen away
when he finished writing?

188
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.270
The killer would have realized he
was there if he made any sounds...

189
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.510
Wait! When I found the pen...

190
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.410
...the tip was retracted!

191
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.480
Something's not right!

192
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.980
It's unnatural for someone
who's about to be killed

193
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.680
to retract the pen tip
of a twist-style ballpoint pen!

194
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.940
Then maybe that means...

195
00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:23.899
Take care of the rest.

196
00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:24.609
Yes, sir.

197
00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:28.859
Now, then...

198
00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:30.319
Hey!

199
00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:31.509
There's a mark on the paper!

200
00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:33.859
So, I was right.

201
00:14:33.859 --> 00:14:35.439
Now I have this trick figured out!

202
00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:36.479
Hey, you!

203
00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:38.229
What do you think you're doing?!

204
00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:39.419
Inspector! We found it!

205
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:41.889
We found the armor
in Kubota-san's locker!

206
00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:43.359
You found it?!

207
00:14:45.979 --> 00:14:48.759
This is crazy!
I don't know anything about this!

208
00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:51.859
We have two major pieces
of evidence that point to you!

209
00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:56.489
This blood-smeared suit of armor,
and the victim's dying message!

210
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:01.359
No! That isn't a dying message at all!

211
00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:05.319
It's a trick the killer used
to put the blame on Kubota-san!

212
00:15:06.819 --> 00:15:09.439
That was one bloody attack.

213
00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:11.939
It's a shame that this
work of art was ruined.

214
00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:15.069
Actually, that's a replica
used for decoration purposes.

215
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:18.399
I believe it was the same one
Kubota-san was moving this afternoon.

216
00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:19.889
Oh, that one?

217
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:23.819
Ah, so it was a replica.

218
00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:26.029
That's why the museum manager
didn't say anything

219
00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:29.239
when he handled
the armor so violently.

220
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:34.439
The replica was used in the attack,
so the real one wasn't ruined.

221
00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:37.179
It seems none of the other
exhibits have been touched, either.

222
00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:41.149
Come to think of it,
the wall where he was killed...

223
00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.499
...had cards, but no paintings!

224
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:50.689
The killer removed them in advance.

225
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:53.489
To protect them from
the blood during the attack.

226
00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:57.409
The killer really was one
of the staff members!

227
00:15:58.859 --> 00:15:59.819
Wait a second!

228
00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:04.999
This is a trick that doesn't work
without nulling Kubota-san's alibi.

229
00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:08.439
Which means the one behind it...

230
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:11.589
...must be the museum manager!

231
00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:15.479
If my conclusions are correct,

232
00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:18.819
there's a possibility
the murderer might still have it...

233
00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:20.689
Well, Kubota-san.

234
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.779
For now, you'll have to
come down to the station.

235
00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:24.249
T-This can't be happening!

236
00:16:29.859 --> 00:16:31.329
I have to go bad!

237
00:16:33.229 --> 00:16:35.669
Bathroom! Bathroom!

238
00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:37.979
Mister! Where's the bathroom?!

239
00:16:37.979 --> 00:16:42.689
The restroom? Go out this room,
go down the stairs on your right,

240
00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:43.639
and then--

241
00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:45.859
That's too complicated for me!

242
00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:47.349
Draw it on this!

243
00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:51.519
Hurry up!

244
00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.989
As I said, you go out this room...

245
00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:03.359
What's the matter, Mister?

246
00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:04.529
Why aren't you writing anything?

247
00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:09.739
Oh! You knew before writing anything
that that pen doesn't work!

248
00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:14.689
But that's strange. Why did you have
a pen that you knew didn't work?

249
00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:18.069
A ballpoint pen that doesn't work?!

250
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.779
Hold on.

251
00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:23.859
If Mr. Manaka was also using
a pen that doesn't work,

252
00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.649
then this dying message should be...

253
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:29.109
...blank!

254
00:17:30.819 --> 00:17:33.229
Look! There's a strange mark left behind!

255
00:17:34.609 --> 00:17:38.569
It looks like someone scribbled over
the letters with a pen that didn't work!

256
00:17:40.899 --> 00:17:42.569
What if that mark was left behind

257
00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:45.109
because someone tried to cross
out the letters beneath it,

258
00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:47.009
but the pen didn't work?

259
00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:50.479
Who is this boy?!

260
00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:54.479
Aha! This wasn't written
by Mr. Manaka at all!

261
00:17:54.479 --> 00:17:58.049
It was written beforehand
by none other than the killer!

262
00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:02.519
But then why did he take
the card in the first place?!

263
00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:05.899
Simple.

264
00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:07.979
The killer told the owner the following--

265
00:18:07.979 --> 00:18:12.929
"Look at the card behind you!
The name of your murderer is on it!"

266
00:18:12.929 --> 00:18:17.909
But the card had Kubota's name on it,
not the name of the killer!

267
00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:25.689
Shocked, he tried to cross out the
name and replace it with the real one

268
00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.309
using the ballpoint pen on the table.

269
00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.399
But he couldn't.

270
00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.439
That pen had been placed there
in advance by the killer,

271
00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:34.519
and it didn't work!

272
00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:40.489
So, that's why he threw the pen away
and tried to crumple up the paper!

273
00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:44.779
In short, this was all a trick
to fool us, perpetrated by the killer

274
00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:50.479
using a pen without ink and
a video tape without sound!

275
00:18:54.229 --> 00:18:57.779
But the pen we found does work.

276
00:18:58.229 --> 00:19:02.479
Wasn't the tip of that pen
retracted when we found it?

277
00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:04.979
Yes, now that you mention it...

278
00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:08.479
Strange for someone
who's about to be killed

279
00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:10.919
to go through all the trouble
of retracting a pen's tip...

280
00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:15.529
So, the killer switched this pen
with the other one after the murder,

281
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:19.269
but carelessly forgot
to put the pen tip out?

282
00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:24.359
Which means whoever's currently
in possession of a pen that doesn't work

283
00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:25.739
is the one responsible!

284
00:19:26.479 --> 00:19:27.979
In other words...

285
00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:32.179
...it was you, Mr. Ochiai!

286
00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:35.359
Let us hear your alibi.

287
00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:38.149
Where were you at 4:30
when the murder took place?

288
00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:42.059
Mr. Ochiai...

289
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:48.359
I was waiting to meet someone at 4:30.

290
00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:52.039
Waiting for that black-hearted demon...

291
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:54.339
...while inside that suit of armor!

292
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:59.669
Everything that happened afterward
is exactly as you said, Detective.

293
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:04.649
Good thing everything
was caught on tape!

294
00:20:06.899 --> 00:20:08.619
That was no accident.

295
00:20:09.229 --> 00:20:12.589
Having Mr. Manaka stand
where he did, the timing,

296
00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:16.519
the location of the card,
the location of the pen...

297
00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:19.189
They were all done
according to my plan.

298
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:21.959
I practiced here on several
occasions, you see.

299
00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:25.029
Then the rumor about
the security guards

300
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:27.409
seeing the suit of armor
walking late at night was real?!

301
00:20:29.569 --> 00:20:32.149
I felt it was a foolish thing to do,

302
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:35.609
but I did it for the purpose
of getting rid of Mr. Manaka,

303
00:20:36.399 --> 00:20:40.279
the demon who was going
to shut down this divine museum

304
00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:45.549
and take away from me all of these
exhibits that are like my own children.

305
00:20:46.109 --> 00:20:49.519
And then there was Kubota-kun,
who went and sold some of my exhibits.

306
00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:52.489
I wanted to punish you as well.

307
00:20:53.229 --> 00:20:55.649
It appears to be different
from the picture, Mr. Ochiai.

308
00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:58.469
It seems you've been struck down
by divine punishment as well.

309
00:20:58.939 --> 00:21:01.899
No, it is exactly like the painting.

310
00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:06.479
Although the knight of justice
has slain the demon,

311
00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:09.279
he has also been covered
in its evil blood,

312
00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:13.369
which will soak into him
and make him wicked in turn.

313
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:18.439
No matter how you look at it,
I am a murderer.

314
00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:21.389
I, too, have become a demon.

315
00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:24.779
The fact that I was unable to deceive
the small knight of justice

316
00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:26.339
is proof enough of this!

317
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:28.699
The small knight of justice?

318
00:21:29.779 --> 00:21:32.399
Say, little boy. Do you not need
to go to the restroom anymore?

319
00:23:24.729 --> 00:23:27.919
Eh? The art museum's not
going to close after all?

320
00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:31.909
Nope. The citizens all got together
after they heard what happened.

321
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:36.389
That's good. We don't have many
cultural spots around here, after all.

322
00:23:36.389 --> 00:23:39.159
I'm getting sick of this.

323
00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:41.999
Sick of what, Genta-kun?

324
00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:44.829
It's always Conan
and that old man Kogoro!

325
00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:47.999
We never get to help out at all!

326
00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:49.299
Uh, that's because--

327
00:23:49.299 --> 00:23:50.469
Oh yeah!

328
00:23:50.469 --> 00:23:51.869
Have you heard the story at school

329
00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:54.509
about the biology room skeleton
coming to life at midnight?

330
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:56.709
Yeah, I've heard about that!

331
00:23:56.709 --> 00:23:58.479
One of the teachers saw it!

332
00:23:58.479 --> 00:23:59.479
But the heart was still...

333
00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:02.979
Okay! This is a case that calls
for the Junior Detective Club!

334
00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:05.129
Let's break into school later tonight!

335
00:24:05.889 --> 00:24:07.759
Hey, now...

336
00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:09.989
Conan! You better come too!

337
00:24:09.989 --> 00:24:12.329
Give me a break!

338
00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:28.509
There's no doubt about it!
He's the murderer!

339
00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:31.449
But what's with that big smile?!

340
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:35.919
Just what sort of alibi does
he have in that camera?!

341
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:39.249
Look! I took this!

342
00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:40.619
On the next Conan--

343
00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:42.889
The Tenkaichi Night Festival Murder.

344
00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:08.575
Next Conan's Hint:

345
00:25:08.575 --> 00:25:08.581
Next Conan's Hint:
Disposable Camera.

346
00:25:08.581 --> 00:25:10.904
Disposable Camera.
