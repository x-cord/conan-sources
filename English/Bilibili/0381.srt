1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,140
A case where building blocks are the clues.

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,740
Heiji's and Sleeping Kogoro's deductions conflict!

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,840
Which one will win?

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,040
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:58,725
Here's your Detective Samonji, File. 44.

8
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,625
"Testament With the Devil's Trap, Part 2".

9
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:04,625
This is it.

10
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,625
I knew you wanted it so bad, so I kept one for you.

11
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,925
Really?

12
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,525
Thank you so much, sir!

13
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,625
I've been waiting this for so long.

14
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,825
All right! I have to eat supper real quick

15
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:26,325
so I can finish the book before going to bed.

16
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,725
And tomorrow morning, I'm going to read it all over again.

17
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,225
I can't wait! I just can't wait.

18
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,425
I'm back!

19
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,125
Welcome home...

20
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:47,825
"The Deduction Battle (Part 1)"

21
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,325
Welcome home...

22
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,225
All right! The kid is back.

23
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,725
Let's go out and eat at a fancy restaurant, right?

24
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,425
Sure. It's kind of early,

25
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:03,325
so I guess we could go a little farther than usual.

26
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,525
Hey, kid. How about it?

27
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,125
What do you want to eat?

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,125
-I'll pass! -Pass?

29
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,925
Pasta? You mean Italian food.

30
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,025
I remember!

31
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:16,425
I heard there's a new fancy Italian restaurant in Haido Town.

32
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:18,125
All right. Let's go there.

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,625
Right. It's not so far from here, too.

34
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,825
All right. Let's go.

35
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,925
Man, that was good.

36
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,625
It's nice to have real spaghetti once in a while.

37
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,825
Right! We made the right choice, didn't we?

38
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:38,125
Yes! It was fantastic.

39
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,825
So why are you guys here, Kazuha and...

40
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,825
this dark-skinned guy.

41
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:49,825
Hey! What was that? What the heck was that?

42
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:52,825
Well, you came here without telling me anything beforehand.

43
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,825
I've got a schedule, too.

44
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:58,225
Right, speaking of schedule,

45
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,525
that's the reason why we came here!

46
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:03,225
We wanted to ask you about your schedule.

47
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,725
Schedule?

48
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:08,525
Yes. We want you guys to come to Osaka again.

49
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,925
There are many nice places that we haven't shown you yet.

50
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,325
What do you mean by nice places?

51
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,125
Of course.

52
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,925
It's the symbol of Osaka.

53
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,725
-Koshien Stadium. -Takarazuka Revue.

54
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,925
Koshien Stadium?

55
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:24,225
Takarazuka Revue?

56
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,025
Those are not in Osaka.

57
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:31,725
Hey, what's this about Koshien Stadium?

58
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:34,325
We didn't talk about Takarazuka Revue either.

59
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:35,825
Have you forgot already?

60
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,225
I told you I was going to get the tickets

61
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,825
to the Takarazuka Revue from my neighbours.

62
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:43,125
Oh, right. I remember you said something like that.

63
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,725
All right, then why don't we go to both?

64
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:49,225
Okay! It's the final game of the high school baseball tournament

65
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:51,925
that I really want to watch with you guys.

66
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,025
Oh, no. We can't go to both.

67
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,825
Kazuha, what's wrong?

68
00:04:56,825 --> 00:05:00,825
Hey, don't tell me you got the tickets from the five crazy ladies?

69
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,625
I did.

70
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,025
Who are those ladies?

71
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:09,725
They are enthusiastic fans of Takarazuka Revue.

72
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,925
They save their money throughout the year

73
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:16,225
and spend all of it for the Takarazuka shows during summer time.

74
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,225
I heard they go to every single show,

75
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,825
but there is one show that they all cannot go to.

76
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,125
Don't tell me that's the day of...

77
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,225
The final game of the high school baseball tournament?

78
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,325
Those ladies are working for the same company,

79
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,325
and their boss is a huge fan of high school baseball.

80
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:36,325
Every year, all the workers go and watch the final game of the tournament,

81
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:38,525
and that's why I got the Takarazuka tickets

82
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,525
for the show playing on the same day as the final game.

83
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,925
I see.

84
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,925
It doesn't matter whether the final gets postponed to another day or not.

85
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:48,625
It's still going to be the same day as the final game anyway.

86
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,425
Well, I feel sorry for you, Kazuha.

87
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,225
But I think you should forget it this time.

88
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,325
What?

89
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,325
Takarazuka Revue plays the same show many times a year.

90
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:57,925
But the final game of the high school baseball tournament

91
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,825
is just once and that's it.

92
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,725
I can't miss it.

93
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,225
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,425
Those baseball games are on the sports news and stuff.

95
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,325
You can watch them many times.

96
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,325
Stupid.

97
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,725
You have to watch it live!

98
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:12,225
Who in the world likes to watch only the result of the games on TV?

99
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:16,225
But I have to watch the Takarazuka show live, too!

100
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:18,625
They are amazing seats.

101
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,925
You'll never get seats like these again if you miss this opportunity.

102
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:25,325
Hey, Ran. You want to watch the Takarazuka show, right?

103
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:27,125
Yes.

104
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,325
Hey, kid. You're a man. You love baseball, right?

105
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:33,425
Of course.

106
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,525
Then what about you, Mr. Mouri?

107
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,325
Let me see.

108
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:40,425
Well, I love the seriousness and excitement of baseball games!

109
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,625
But at the same time,

110
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,525
I love the beauty and gorgeousness of the Takarazuka shows, too.

111
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,125
-Make up your mind. -Make up your mind.

112
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,525
Okay, how about this?

113
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:53,525
Whoever wins a deduction battle gets to see what he or she wants.

114
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:54,825
Deduction...

115
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,325
Battle?

116
00:06:56,325 --> 00:07:01,225
At the end of last month, there was a murder in the office of a company.

117
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:03,225
This murder case needs further investigation,

118
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:07,225
so Inspector Megure has asked me for help on it.

119
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:10,125
That company is actually in this area

120
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,725
and I was thinking about going there after dinner.

121
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,025
Although it's unethical to treat a murder case like this,

122
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:19,425
I thought you guys could come and help us.

123
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:23,125
It's not so bad because we are helping to solve the murder case, right?

124
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:27,525
All right. So Kazuha, you and I are going to fight.

125
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,125
That's not fair.

126
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,525
There's no way I can beat you in a deduction battle.

127
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:33,525
Of course.

128
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:39,125
I, the Sleeping Kogoro will be on your side, Kazuha. You can rely on me.

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,425
Seriously? Thanks a lot, man!

130
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:47,125
Well, Sleeping Kogoro always stands up for the weak.

131
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,225
I know what's really in your mind, old man.

132
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,325
Ran. I need your help, too.

133
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,525
Sure! Why not?

134
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,125
Let's beat them and watch the Takarazuka show!

135
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,625
You dummy rat. You got two people on your side.

136
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,625
Well, what can I say?

137
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,125
I guess I have to take this little kid with me.

138
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,025
You are the dummy rat, Heiji.

139
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,125
Hey, Mouri.

140
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,925
Thanks for coming.

141
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,225
No problem.

142
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,225
Let's go inside.

143
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:20,825
Stop blocking the way.

144
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,225
Heiji?

145
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:25,625
Hey, you. You're not allowed at the murder scene.

146
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,725
Don't worry about it.

147
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:30,525
The forensic officers are done searching the murder scene, right?

148
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,725
Well, yes.

149
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:37,525
The victim is the owner of a toy production company,

150
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,525
Kenji Tsujiya, 53 years old.

151
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:44,425
He worked and also lived here.

152
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:49,425
The estimated time of death was the 29th of last month, Sunday, around 5pm.

153
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:55,025
The dead body was found on the 30th, Monday, around 10am.

154
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,625
Who found it?

155
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,025
Four workers in this company found it.

156
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,125
Four workers.

157
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,425
These four workers always come a little early in the morning,

158
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:09,025
and eat breakfast in a coffee house down there,

159
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,325
then come to the office together.

160
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:14,125
I see. That's why it's four people.

161
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,725
And these four workers found their boss,

162
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:22,225
who was tied with a rope and beaten to death with a golf club.

163
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,625
How do you know that, Heiji?

164
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,725
You see the ink spot around the victim's back?

165
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:28,725
Yes.

166
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:34,325
Perhaps the ink spilled over when they were fighting.

167
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,825
But the murderer didn't care and just tied the owner up with a rope.

168
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:42,625
I saw the marks of the rope all over the floor.

169
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,625
So I thought he was wriggling on the floor with his hands tied behind him.

170
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:50,425
Okay, but what about him being beaten with a golf club?

171
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,825
I saw the blood on his head.

172
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:58,425
And also, see the thin marks on the floor near his head?

173
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,325
These are from iron clubs.

174
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,625
The murderer missed the head and hit the floor

175
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,325
when he or she was beating the owner who was lying on the floor.

176
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:10,025
But why did the murderer tied him up first, and then clubbed him?

177
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:13,025
Maybe the murderer wanted the combination of the safe.

178
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:18,225
See? The door of the safe is left wide open.

179
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,425
I see.

180
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:21,925
Some outsider committed the murder for the money, is that it?

181
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,925
I don't know whether it was an outsider or not.

182
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,325
But it's certain that the murderer tied the president up first

183
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,525
in order to get the combination out of him.

184
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,825
And then, the murderer clubbed him to death

185
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:34,825
because the president saw his or her face.

186
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,025
Something like that. Right, Inspector?

187
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:41,325
Right.

188
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,725
Hey, are you going to be all right, Dad?

189
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,125
The boys are dominating this deduction battle.

190
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,525
Are they?

191
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:48,925
Well, it's not a hard thing to do.

192
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:52,025
With this murder scene, even a policeman can make a deduction like this.

193
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,625
-Even a policeman... -Hey.

194
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,325
This isn't everything, right? There must be something else.

195
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,925
Come on. Let it out.

196
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:02,725
All right.

197
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:10,325
We found these on the floor around the victim's dead body.

198
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,625
These four building blocks.

199
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:17,725
But there are other building blocks near the victim's dead body.

200
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,925
Actually, we found the victim's fingerprints

201
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:24,225
and also ink on those four blocks.

202
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,625
Ink?

203
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,025
If you look at the ink-spotted side of each building block...

204
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,025
And this is the last one.

205
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:46,825
-Toy? -Toy?

206
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:59,947
Toy?

207
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,447
No. Is it rice cake store?

208
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:04,947
I think it's rice cake store, don't you think?

209
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:07,247
Right.

210
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:08,447
If it really means "omocha",

211
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,947
then whoever made this could've picked the other block to spell it right.

212
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,247
Inspector.

213
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:17,147
Can you tell me specifically where the four blocks in the pictures were?

214
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,347
Sure.

215
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:21,647
This is how it looked when we found the dead body.

216
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:24,047
I guess this guy is the...

217
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,347
Yes, he's the victim.

218
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:30,047
The president of this toy production company, Mr. Tsujiya.

219
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:35,147
From the stack of the building blocks by the victim's dead body,

220
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:38,447
we found the four blocks with characters "o", "mo", "chi", and "ya".

221
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:42,047
Each of them had the victim's fingerprints and an ink spot on it.

222
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:45,547
The ink spots on the blocks

223
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:51,747
and the one that's on the victim's back came from the same bottle.

224
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:57,247
The problem is, who put the ink spots on those four building blocks?

225
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:58,247
Right.

226
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:02,147
We found the victim's fingerprints on those blocks,

227
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,347
but it could be that the murderer made the president hold them

228
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:07,447
to hide something.

229
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,947
Hey.

230
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:13,347
These are really the only ones that have the owner's fingerprints?

231
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:18,547
Actually the fingerprints are on some other blocks.

232
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,947
But we found that these four blocks have fingerprints all over them.

233
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,747
I mean on every single side.

234
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:28,447
Even on those characters.

235
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,147
So I guess it's possible to think that those four blocks

236
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:36,647
are the owner's dying message.

237
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:40,247
What? What makes you think that?

238
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,447
Look closely at the picture of the murder scene.

239
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,747
His hands are tied behind his back, right?

240
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:52,247
You can hardly see and touch anything if your hands are tied like this.

241
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:55,747
His fingerprints were on every single side of the four blocks

242
00:13:55,747 --> 00:14:00,247
because the victim was searching for the correct blocks.

243
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:03,147
He touched some other blocks,

244
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:05,147
but not so many fingerprints were found from them.

245
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:09,847
That's because each block is designed to have five characters in the order.

246
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,147
So it's not so hard to find which one's which.

247
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,747
I see.

248
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:17,747
That's why we found so many fingerprints particularly on the four blocks.

249
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:21,547
In fact, fingerprints are made of sweat and skin oil

250
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:22,947
and that's why they remain on things.

251
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:26,347
But once people die, these things stop coming out.

252
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:30,147
So even if you try to leave fingerprints of a dead body,

253
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:31,947
you can only get one or two solid ones.

254
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,547
Perhaps when the murderer wasn't looking,

255
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:41,747
the victim took the four blocks with his hands tied behind his back.

256
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,247
Then, rolled his body and put the ink on those blocks.

257
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,947
And, he rolled his body back again to put them back to where they were.

258
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:55,347
I'm sure his hands were full of sweat because of fear of death.

259
00:14:55,347 --> 00:15:00,647
As a matter of fact, the marks of the rope all over the floor prove that.

260
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,147
So it's possible to think

261
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:07,847
that the feeling of danger actually made the owner choose the wrong block.

262
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:10,047
This is a toy production company.

263
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:12,147
Logically, the dying message must be toys

264
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:15,447
rather than rice cake store, don't you think?

265
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,047
Oh, my God. We just got here.

266
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,147
How could you come up with so many things in such a short while?

267
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:22,847
Yeah, I know. That's my boy.

268
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:26,747
This isn't good, Ran.

269
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:29,247
He's dominating us mentally.

270
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,847
This is a battle between Heiji and us!

271
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,247
It's either the baseball game or Takarazuka show.

272
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,947
To win this deduction battle,

273
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:42,347
we have to find out what the dying message really meant first.

274
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:46,247
Maybe there are some hints in the other toys.

275
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:49,347
No, we found no strange toys other than the blocks.

276
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:51,447
-Are you sure? -Yes.

277
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:56,047
We checked every single toy in this office

278
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,647
looking for some other dying messages that could be hiding.

279
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:04,947
Then, maybe the dying message has a different meaning.

280
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,747
What do you mean?

281
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:10,247
Different combinations of four of the characters, you mean?

282
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:13,247
Omoyachi, ochimoya, ochiyamo...

283
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,747
Oyamochi, oyachimo, mochiyao...

284
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,847
It doesn't make sense at all.

285
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,547
All right, what else have we got?

286
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:31,347
We found only a golf club and a leather coat with the victim's blood on it,

287
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:34,347
which we assume the murderer was wearing during the murder.

288
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,347
But the golf club and the leather coat are the victim's belongings.

289
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:44,547
So they didn't help us determine who killed him.

290
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:49,747
What's more confusing is that the murderer was wearing that leather coat.

291
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:53,347
The bloodstain. It's faded only around the left shoulder.

292
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,447
It's got rubbed against something.

293
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,247
Actually, that's another mystery.

294
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:00,447
We searched throughout this office,

295
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:04,647
but found no spots where the bloodstain got rubbed against.

296
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:07,747
The murderer may have touched it when he or she took it off.

297
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:10,747
You haven't found gloves or something like that, right?

298
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,047
Hey.

299
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,647
Speaking of blood,

300
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,047
there's a strange bloodstain right here.

301
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,947
-Where is it? -Right here.

302
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:21,947
Why'd you crawl under there?

303
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,547
-This is it. -Hold on a sec.

304
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:26,547
You have to look at it really close.

305
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,447
You see the part where the bloodstain ends unnaturally?

306
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,347
Maybe something was here, don't you think?

307
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:35,847
Could be. What kind of thing would you put here though?

308
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:41,647
Where is the remote?

309
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:45,147
Hey! Don't touch them.

310
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,047
We have to keep the desk just like the way it is.

311
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,547
It's external input only.

312
00:17:55,547 --> 00:18:00,847
So then, maybe a video camera was here until the victim was murdered.

313
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,447
The video camera was in the president's room.

314
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,147
Okay, then. Call the forensic officer

315
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:08,947
to check if there's any blood on it, will you?

316
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:10,547
It's strange.

317
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,147
Let's assume that the video camera was here.

318
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:16,547
But why would the murderer move it after killing the owner?

319
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,247
The murderer connected the video camera to the TV

320
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:21,947
just to watch the president after tying him up?

321
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,647
Then why did he remove it? The owner was dead.

322
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,547
Also...

323
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,647
Something's been bugging me ever since I got here.

324
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,847
Right here, in this office.

325
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,947
There's something odd, something unnatural.

326
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:41,447
Hey, Conan.

327
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,647
What's up, Ran?

328
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,547
Could you do me a favour?

329
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:51,347
I really want Kazuha to win this deduction battle.

330
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:56,747
I think she is really looking forward to see the Takarazuka show with us.

331
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,147
So, next time you come up with a good idea or something,

332
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:01,447
I want you to tell us quietly.

333
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,747
I'll give Dad your ideas

334
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:07,747
and Sleeping Kogoro will take care of the rest like always.

335
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,847
Yes? Please?

336
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:12,947
Please?

337
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:17,747
Conan, please?

338
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:19,047
Hey...

339
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,447
This kid is mine.

340
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,947
So stop headhunting him, will you?

341
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:36,147
Of course you respect a guy's friendship more than one with girls, right?

342
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,647
Friendship?

343
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,147
I'm on your side only because you gave me no choice.

344
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,647
Doesn't matter!

345
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:46,647
We have to win this the battle anyway. We have to watch the final game!

346
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,647
Oh, what a guy.

347
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:52,447
How was the identification?

348
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,447
We found it.

349
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:54,747
We found the victim's blood even though it was very slight.

350
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:57,347
I guess the murderer did not realize it.

351
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,547
But why was the video camera here anyway?

352
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,547
Perhaps the murderer connected the camera to the TV

353
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:06,947
and watched the owner until he spit out the combination to the safe.

354
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:10,647
But why do something round about like that?

355
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:13,547
Why not just tie him up and wait in front of the safe

356
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,347
until he spits out the combination?

357
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:19,947
He left the video camera on, to keep him from moving around

358
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:23,247
because he was ransacking the other rooms.

359
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:29,347
The murderer didn't know the victim left a dying message.

360
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:33,647
Well now, it is more likely that the murderer is well acquainted

361
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:38,047
with this office and also with the victim.

362
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,847
The president left a dying message.

363
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:45,047
If we get it right, it's possible to find out who the murder is.

364
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:49,047
Then, we should investigate the four workers who found the dead body.

365
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,647
Takagi is asking them about their alibi right now.

366
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:52,647
Inspector Megure.

367
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:56,947
I just finished the interrogation.

368
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:58,947
And how was it?

369
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,547
They are all designers

370
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:07,047
but also do some other types of work, like Nao Aiko, who does accounting.

371
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,947
June 29th around 5pm, when the murder occurred,

372
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,347
she was out fishing alone.

373
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:17,147
Atushi Hasami, the salesperson, was watching a movie at home.

374
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:21,047
Isao Nakagami, the planner, was at the turf.

375
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,347
Hajime Iwatomi, the vice president,

376
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:27,247
was out watching the final round of a golf tournament.

377
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:29,847
Those are all very vague alibis.

378
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:33,747
Yes. Right now, Chiba is verifying their stories

379
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:35,447
and if there is anything hiding behind the stories.

380
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:37,447
It seems nobody is able to prove their alibi. Not even one.

381
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:39,047
Hiding...

382
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,047
Behind...

383
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:44,847
Wait a minute. If the situation was...

384
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,347
That dying message on the four blocks is...

385
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,847
It was so easy.

386
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,547
How come I didn't realize this?

387
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,647
Kazuha, I'm sorry.

388
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:08,147
This battle is mine.

389
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:30,847
Kazuha?

390
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,747
"Next Episode"

391
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:04,347
Now all we need is that thing.

392
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:06,547
The thing that connects the pieces of the mystery all together.

393
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,847
Kazuha?

394
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,247
Sorry, Ran. I can't talk right now.

395
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,047
I think I'm just about to solve it.

396
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:15,847
Kudo.

397
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:18,647
I got it.

398
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,547
This must be it.

399
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,547
The murderer is...

400
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:29,547
Next Conan, "The Deduction Battle (Part 2)"

401
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,574
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:34,874
"Calendar"

403
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,074
The battle finally ends in the next episode!

404
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,874
Kazuha or Heiji?

405
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,478
-Who do you think is going to win? -Who do you think is going to win?
