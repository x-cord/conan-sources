1
00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:07.024
The victim's name is Maho Katagiri, a member of that tour.

2
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:10.624
According to Kazuha, her coat caught on fire

3
00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:13.324
and she fell into the moat as if she were collapsing.

4
00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:17.624
But the cause of death is a blow to the back of her dead.

5
00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:22.824
She probably got it when she fell.

6
00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:25.124
I think she hit her head n the girder over there.

7
00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.424
Was it suicide?

8
00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:29.424
It looks that way, at least for now.

9
00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.824
Kazuha, are you sure she wasn't holding anything else

10
00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.424
beside the lighter?

11
00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.824
Yes. I'm sure, that's how it looked to me.

12
00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:39.224
Was there anybody near her?

13
00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:41.624
No, not near her,

14
00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.324
but there was somebody near the bridge's entrance, right?

15
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.224
-Yes. -That's it!

16
00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:47.724
That's who set her on fire!

17
00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:49.724
I don't think it was possible though.

18
00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:52.824
That person was on the same side as we were.

19
00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:55.124
I definitely think it was suicide though.

20
00:00:55.124 --> 00:00:57.224
Don't be stupid! No way it was suicide!

21
00:00:58.924 --> 00:00:59.924
There's got to be something here!

22
00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:01.924
Something to prove it was murder! There has to be!

23
00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:03.724
Stop that, Heiji!

24
00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:17.124
Dad?

25
00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:20.124
Heiji, stop acting like you know everything!

26
00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:21.724
Don't you understand?

27
00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:24.424
Do you know how much trouble you cause

28
00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:26.624
every time you meddle in police matters?

29
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:28.624
Calm down, sir!

30
00:01:28.624 --> 00:01:32.324
Heiji's just trying to solve the crime in his own way.

31
00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:34.424
Sorry.

32
00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:37.824
Mr. Mouri, that may be how you see it.

33
00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:38.924
But when it comes to this kid,

34
00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:40.524
you don't call his methods police work.

35
00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:42.524
He's a pest.

36
00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:44.724
People flatter him by calling him a high school detective

37
00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:46.924
and that's given him a swollen ego.

38
00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:49.124
He interferes with our investigations by handling the evidence

39
00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:51.624
and the victim's bodies all because it's his hobby.

40
00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:55.624
He's nothing more than a crime scene assaulter.

41
00:01:55.624 --> 00:01:57.124
To prove my point, look around two people

42
00:01:57.124 --> 00:01:58.924
have died right in front of his eyes

43
00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:01.024
and he hasn't done anything to stop it.

44
00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:02.824
He was so sure that nothing else would happen

45
00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:06.524
because the police had the area covered.

46
00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:10.724
Actually, you could say we were just as much at fault.

47
00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:11.824
At any rate.

48
00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:13.924
Meddlesome amateurs should leave.

49
00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:16.224
Get out of my sight immediately!

50
00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:17.924
Sir!

51
00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:19.724
You're being too hard on him.

52
00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:20.924
Otaki.

53
00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:25.424
Did you forget? I told you to follow that guy, didn't I?

54
00:02:25.424 --> 00:02:28.624
That's right! No wonder the Chief's so...

55
00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:32.824
Yes. That's his way of showing he cares about his son.

56
00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:40.924
Otaki, are these both murders?

57
00:02:40.924 --> 00:02:42.424
No.

58
00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:43.524
Regarding Mr. Kato's case,

59
00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:45.624
he fell from the tower as he burned

60
00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.724
and we found a lighter on the roof

61
00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:51.224
with the victim's fingerprints on it.

62
00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:53.124
As for Ms. Katagiri,

63
00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:57.624
she lit the fire on herself and fell into the moat.

64
00:02:57.624 --> 00:03:00.324
Kazuha herself witnessed this.

65
00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:02.724
There are several things we can't explain,

66
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.924
but I'm almost certain there were both suicides.

67
00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:08.624
If that's the case, then 2 or 3 men

68
00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.124
should be enough of cover the work here.

69
00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:11.624
Huh?

70
00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.624
-Toyama, let's go. -Huh?

71
00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:17.824
The police have more important work to do.

72
00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:20.824
We can't spend so much time on a case as minor as this.

73
00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:23.824
Chief!

74
00:03:26.824 --> 00:03:28.524
Heizo.

75
00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:30.824
What are you planning?

76
00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:43.324
Don't look so disappointed, Heiji.

77
00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:45.824
The Chief's probably angry

78
00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:49.424
because two people died so close to headquarters.

79
00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:52.024
Still, he didn't have to hit him.

80
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:56.224
Maybe it's all the killer's fault.

81
00:03:56.224 --> 00:03:57.924
Remember the story?

82
00:03:57.924 --> 00:04:01.024
About Heiji's dad driving us home

83
00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:03.124
and they were talking about some pottery.

84
00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:05.824
Well, there's a continuation to that.

85
00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:08.024
They said it was possible

86
00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:10.624
that when the burnt body was found 13 years ago

87
00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:13.024
there was a rash of armed burglaries

88
00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:16.124
and that the burglar might unexpectedly be discovered.

89
00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:18.524
Armed burglaries?

90
00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.224
Yes, there were five consecutive incidents.

91
00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:21.624
Seven people were killed

92
00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:23.924
and the vicious killer is still on the loose.

93
00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:26.824
Are you saying that Hattori's father thinks

94
00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:30.324
the killer in these recent cases is the same person?

95
00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:31.924
Now I get it.

96
00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:34.524
Heizo didn't want to put his son in danger

97
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.124
so he acted coldly to distance him from the case.

98
00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:40.424
That's so touching. It makes me want to cry.

99
00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:42.924
Yeah. It makes me want to cry, too.

100
00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:47.624
Who'd have thought my old man would go soft like that?

101
00:04:47.624 --> 00:04:49.124
Heiji.

102
00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:52.524
I don't take orders very well.

103
00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:54.924
If I get pushed, I push back.

104
00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:56.224
I'm going to solve the case

105
00:04:56.224 --> 00:04:58.624
and shove the killer right up my father's nose!

106
00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:04.824
What he's saying is he's more stupid than obedient.

107
00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:08.324
But that's strange.

108
00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.224
You'd think that being his father,

109
00:05:10.224 --> 00:05:14.124
he would know that his son wouldn't give up so easily.
