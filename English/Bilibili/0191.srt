1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.740
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.640
It's what you've all been waiting for,

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.640
he makes his appearance after a long absence!

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.099
While exploring a limestone cave,

9
00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.399
I was shot by a gang of bank robbers.

10
00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.199
Ran's blood is used for my transfusion and it saved my life.

11
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.099
This makes me decide to tell Ran about everything.

12
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.599
But then Haibara points a gun at me.

13
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.199
I came here to make things clear to you.

14
00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.899
I want you to know that

15
00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.999
she'll certainly be one of those the organization gets rid of.

16
00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.399
You have three choices.

17
00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:23.699
The first is,

18
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.899
leave things as it is,

19
00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.299
don't tell her anything and keep your distance.

20
00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.399
Second,

21
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.499
you cast your fates to the wind

22
00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.799
and tell her everything.

23
00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.199
Or your third choice which is...

24
00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.799
Later at Teitan High School

25
00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.199
on the day of their school festival,

26
00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.099
during the play in the gymnasium,

27
00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.099
a murder is committed right among the audience.

28
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.599
"Perilous Return: The Black Knight"

29
00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.899
It's still not clear what trick the killer used

30
00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.399
to poison Mr. Kamata's drink,

31
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.799
nonetheless,

32
00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.799
it's clear one of you is the killer.

33
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.999
Isn't that right, Inspector?

34
00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.499
-Well... -Inspector!

35
00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.299
We found unopened tubs of milk and gum syrup

36
00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.399
in Mr. Kamata's pocket.

37
00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.099
Unopened?

38
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.599
Which could only mean...

39
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.599
Hey, did Mr. Kamata usually drink his iced coffee black?

40
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.599
No, I'm pretty sure he always used the milk and gum syrup.

41
00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.199
-Right? -Yes, I'm sure he did too.

42
00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.599
Then, why were both of it were unopened?

43
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.499
His drink...

44
00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:52.299
There was cola in his cup, not iced coffee.

45
00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.799
What?

46
00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.599
I thought that he'd come to the concession to change it

47
00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.599
if I did that.

48
00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.799
I thought he might come to ask me

49
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.999
why I broke off our engagement.

50
00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.099
You were engaged?

51
00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.499
Yes, we intended to get married after I graduated.

52
00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.099
But I started to feel insecure

53
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.599
and I called him last week to break it off.

54
00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.799
I've gone to the hospital, but he refused to see me.

55
00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.699
So that's why there was cola in mine, too.

56
00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.999
I almost put this milk and gum syrup in it, you know.

57
00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.799
I'm very sorry.

58
00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:35.399
Well, let's take all their drinks and the milk and gum syrup

59
00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.599
down to the lab and have it analyzed.

60
00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:37.899
We'll continue this conversation later

61
00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:39.099
Yes, sir!

62
00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.399
Inspector.

63
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.999
From the looks of things, you can't overlook that either.

64
00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.299
What do you mean?

65
00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:47.699
Suicide!

66
00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.499
He must've taken quite a shock being dumped

67
00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.199
by a girl 10 years younger than him and he might've already

68
00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.199
been thinking of suicide when he runs into her here.

69
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.199
So he decides to kill himself right in her presence.

70
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.999
And if things worked out right, she'd become the prime suspect.

71
00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.599
I just remembered, wasn't Kamata looking around for something

72
00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.299
on his car's dashboard?

73
00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:10.399
Right, he said he was looking for his driver's license.

74
00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.899
Huh? Did you remember something?

75
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.799
No, we all came here with Kamata's car,

76
00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.799
and we thought he acted a little strange.

77
00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:22.599
Like feeling around his dashboard.

78
00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.499
Officer Takagi, have someone take you to his car

79
00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.199
and check it out.

80
00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.899
We might find something.

81
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.399
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:31.799
This way.

83
00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.899
Hey, Kudo.

84
00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.099
You probably figured it out too, right?

85
00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.899
The person who poisoned the drink

86
00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.199
is more than likely that person.

87
00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.599
The lid was off the victim's cup the whole time,

88
00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.699
but there was cola inside it and not iced coffee.

89
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.499
And the strange things that person said.

90
00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:59.499
The trick has been completely blown.

91
00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:03.399
All we need is the evidence, then our theory will be perfect.

92
00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.399
Hey!

93
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.899
Hey, wait! Come back!

94
00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.999
He and that kid are such good friends.

95
00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:11.699
Right.

96
00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.899
Oh, what a bummer.

97
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.899
We get caught in a weird case and the play is called off.

98
00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.199
And now it's starting to rain.

99
00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.699
It's put a damper on everything.

100
00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.499
Isn't that right, sir?

101
00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.399
There's nothing we can do,

102
00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.199
not when something like this happened.

103
00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.299
There will always be a next time,

104
00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:33.299
let's just call it quits for today.

105
00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:36.399
Is that so? Anyway, thank you for your cooperation.

106
00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.299
Inspector!

107
00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:40.499
Officer Takagi!

108
00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.799
How was it?

109
00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:46.399
We found this on the dashboard of the victim's car.

110
00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.199
I'm pretty sure it's potassium cyanide.

111
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.499
Good work!

112
00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.499
The forensic lab just called me

113
00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:57.899
saying there was no trace of poison in any of the drinks.

114
00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:59.899
Then, you mean...

115
00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.899
That's right. We'll close this as a case of suicide.

116
00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.799
Just a minute, Inspector!

117
00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.499
This is no suicide.

118
00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.399
It's a simple and straightforward...

119
00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:28.899
murder!

120
00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:35.299
No! Don't do it!

121
00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:39.099
You're not supposed to be out front in the spotlight.

122
00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:42.499
That's not allowed.

123
00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:44.399
Don't you understand that?

124
00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:52.599
That's right. Mr. Kamata was poisoned

125
00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:56.199
right before this stage draped in darkness.

126
00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:58.099
The killer knew the victim's habit

127
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:01.499
and used it to commit the murder.

128
00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:07.199
And I am certain the killer still has the weapon.

129
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.899
Like the risk I take, the crime was also bold and brazen.

130
00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.099
That is, if I am correct.

131
00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:17.399
Who are you?

132
00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.999
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure.

133
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:23.599
It's me, Shinichi Kudo.

134
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:30.899
Idiot.

135
00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:42.088
Shinichi?

136
00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:44.688
I don't believe it. It can't be...

137
00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:46.488
Because Shinichi is...

138
00:08:46.488 --> 00:08:49.888
Shinichi is...

139
00:08:49.888 --> 00:08:54.288
This guy is Kudo and so is that guy.

140
00:08:55.888 --> 00:08:57.888
What's going on here?

141
00:08:57.888 --> 00:09:00.088
He is such a man.

142
00:09:00.088 --> 00:09:03.488
Yes! That's our hero!

143
00:09:03.488 --> 00:09:04.588
It's Shinichi Kudo!

144
00:09:04.588 --> 00:09:06.188
Show them what you can do, Kudo!

145
00:09:06.188 --> 00:09:13.688
Kudo...

146
00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:14.888
Quiet, please.

147
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.388
You can celebrate

148
00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:19.488
after we bring the curtain down on this murder.

149
00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:25.488
He is as dramatic as always.

150
00:09:25.488 --> 00:09:27.388
Shinichi.

151
00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:29.288
Are you really Shinichi?

152
00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:31.888
What? You idiot.

153
00:09:31.888 --> 00:09:34.788
You must still be sleepy.

154
00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:36.788
I have something important to tell later,

155
00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:38.588
so don't you go running off.

156
00:09:40.088 --> 00:09:42.488
Hattori.

157
00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:45.788
Do you have any 10 yen coins on you?

158
00:09:45.788 --> 00:09:48.188
Sure, I think I've got a couple.

159
00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:49.988
But what are you going to do with them?

160
00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:53.488
I get it now.

161
00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:56.088
Can I borrow one for awhile?

162
00:09:56.088 --> 00:09:57.788
Sure thing, but it'll cost you.

163
00:09:57.788 --> 00:09:59.788
I will give it back to you soon.

164
00:09:59.788 --> 00:10:01.488
Kudo.

165
00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:03.188
You've been away a long time

166
00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:04.488
and I appreciate you trying to help,

167
00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:08.788
but there was no trace of poison from the victim's cup

168
00:10:08.788 --> 00:10:11.388
nor his three friends'.

169
00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:15.588
On top of that, the victim drank most of his drink.

170
00:10:15.588 --> 00:10:17.888
So, no matter how you look at it...

171
00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:19.488
Yes, at first glance, it looks like suicide

172
00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:23.888
where Mr. Kamata took the poison himself.

173
00:10:23.888 --> 00:10:25.288
If you use a certain something,

174
00:10:25.288 --> 00:10:27.988
murder is also a possibility.

175
00:10:27.988 --> 00:10:29.488
A certain something?

176
00:10:29.488 --> 00:10:32.788
That's right and it's a very basic trick.

177
00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:35.188
By using ice.

178
00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:36.488
Did you say ice?

179
00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:38.388
The poison used was potassium cyanide,

180
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.688
which doesn't dissolve easily in iced water.

181
00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:42.288
A tiny hole was made in the ice

182
00:10:42.288 --> 00:10:44.888
and the poison was poured in the center,

183
00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:46.888
then a thin piece of ice was used

184
00:10:46.888 --> 00:10:48.288
to plug the hole and refrozen.

185
00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:50.588
The ice cube was then put into the victim's cup,

186
00:10:50.588 --> 00:10:52.488
so by the time the ice melts and the poison seeps out,

187
00:10:52.488 --> 00:10:56.188
Mr. Kamata would have finished up his drink.

188
00:10:56.188 --> 00:11:01.588
But then there should be some trace of poison left in his cup.

189
00:11:01.588 --> 00:11:05.188
The lid on the victim's cup. It was off, wasn't it?

190
00:11:05.188 --> 00:11:06.988
Do you know why?

191
00:11:06.988 --> 00:11:09.088
After he drank the poison, it probably fell off

192
00:11:09.088 --> 00:11:11.488
when he crushed the cup because of the pain.

193
00:11:11.488 --> 00:11:15.088
You fool, then why wasn't the cup crushed?

194
00:11:15.088 --> 00:11:18.888
There's only one reason someone would take the lid off their cup

195
00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:20.488
after finishing their drink.

196
00:11:20.488 --> 00:11:23.288
The victim didn't drink the poison,

197
00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:24.488
he ate it!

198
00:11:25.988 --> 00:11:27.788
He ate it?

199
00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:33.088
I get it! Inspector, you usually eat the ice in your drink, too.

200
00:11:33.088 --> 00:11:34.688
I see.

201
00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:36.888
Someone who knew the victim had this habit

202
00:11:36.888 --> 00:11:39.888
could have poisoned him

203
00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:43.088
and nothing would be left in the cup.

204
00:11:43.088 --> 00:11:47.588
And? Who put the poisoned ice in the victim's cup?

205
00:11:47.588 --> 00:11:49.388
Mr. Mitani who just handed him the drink

206
00:11:49.388 --> 00:11:52.288
and Ms. Noda wouldn't have had the chance.

207
00:11:52.288 --> 00:11:58.288
Ms. Ninagawa who sold the drinks had the opportunity.

208
00:11:58.288 --> 00:12:04.488
But she deliberately put cola into the iced coffee he ordered,

209
00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:07.688
so she wouldn't poison his drink

210
00:12:07.688 --> 00:12:09.988
knowing he might return to exchange it.

211
00:12:09.988 --> 00:12:14.988
Besides, there was another person who ordered iced coffee,

212
00:12:14.988 --> 00:12:17.988
so she wouldn't know who would get poisoned.

213
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:20.388
There was only a 50 chance of success,

214
00:12:20.388 --> 00:12:22.188
and the risks were too high.

215
00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:23.388
So, you mean...

216
00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:24.988
That's right.

217
00:12:24.988 --> 00:12:26.988
The person who poisoned Mr. Kamata

218
00:12:26.988 --> 00:12:28.288
is the one who bought the drinks,

219
00:12:28.288 --> 00:12:30.488
then delivered them to everyone.

220
00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.788
Ms. Mai Kogami.

221
00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:39.888
You're the only one who could have done it.

222
00:12:39.888 --> 00:12:41.688
Mai...

223
00:12:41.688 --> 00:12:43.688
You went to the concession to buy drinks.

224
00:12:43.688 --> 00:12:45.388
So you had the opportunity to open the drinks

225
00:12:45.388 --> 00:12:47.988
and drop the poisoned ice cube

226
00:12:47.988 --> 00:12:50.288
in pretending to put milk and gum syrup in it.

227
00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:51.888
Just a minute.

228
00:12:51.888 --> 00:12:55.388
Mai didn't put milk or gum syrup in those drinks!

229
00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:56.988
She's right!

230
00:12:56.988 --> 00:13:00.488
You found the unopened tubs in Kamata's pocket, didn't you?

231
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.888
That's because when she dropped the ice in,

232
00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:06.488
she realized it was cola.

233
00:13:06.488 --> 00:13:08.188
If she put the milk and gum syrup in it,

234
00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:11.188
there was the chance Mr. Kamata wouldn't drink it.

235
00:13:12.588 --> 00:13:14.488
The reason she brought you the drinks

236
00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:17.088
just before the play was about to begin

237
00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.888
was so that he wouldn't bother to go change it.

238
00:13:19.888 --> 00:13:21.888
After all, even if he realized it wasn't iced coffee,

239
00:13:21.888 --> 00:13:23.888
once the room got dark, it would be a bother

240
00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:28.088
to get up and go to the concession.

241
00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:33.088
But how did she go around carrying the poisoned ice cube?

242
00:13:33.088 --> 00:13:35.388
Oh, the answer to that

243
00:13:35.388 --> 00:13:37.988
is this item that I found in the trash can outside the restroom

244
00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:41.488
when Officer Takagi left the room.

245
00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:44.388
It's this vinyl pouch.

246
00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:46.088
Get that to the lab, quick!

247
00:13:46.088 --> 00:13:47.288
Yes, sir!

248
00:13:48.388 --> 00:13:51.188
If you put the poisoned ice cube in here

249
00:13:51.188 --> 00:13:54.388
with a tiny piece of dry ice,

250
00:13:54.388 --> 00:13:57.988
it won't melt for quite a while.

251
00:13:57.988 --> 00:14:02.588
Ms. Kogami, after you handed the poisoned drink

252
00:14:02.588 --> 00:14:07.088
along with the others, you went to the restroom

253
00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:09.088
and flushed the dry ice down,

254
00:14:09.088 --> 00:14:11.588
then threw the pouch in the trash can.

255
00:14:11.588 --> 00:14:14.588
Have I made a mistake in my deduction?

256
00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:16.588
Mai...

257
00:14:16.588 --> 00:14:18.988
My hats off to you, Shinichi Kudo.

258
00:14:18.988 --> 00:14:21.688
You're as good as what I heard.

259
00:14:21.688 --> 00:14:23.988
But have you forgotten?

260
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.888
I also had iced coffee

261
00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:30.988
and I handed it to Mitani along with the others.

262
00:14:30.988 --> 00:14:34.788
I had no idea which cup he'd give Kohei,

263
00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:36.988
so how could I poison his drink?

264
00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:39.888
Or are you saying I took a 50/50 chance

265
00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:42.888
that he'd get it and if that's the case, then Ayako also...

266
00:14:42.888 --> 00:14:46.088
No, you were covered 100%.

267
00:14:46.088 --> 00:14:51.588
That's because you put poisoned ice cubes in both cups.

268
00:14:51.588 --> 00:14:53.388
That's ridiculous!

269
00:14:53.388 --> 00:14:57.188
She drank all the contents of her cup.

270
00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.888
That can be accomplished

271
00:14:58.888 --> 00:15:01.088
if she gulped it all down before the ice melted.

272
00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:05.988
But there'd still be traces of poison in her cup.

273
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:09.088
And if she tried to get the poisoned ice cube out,

274
00:15:09.088 --> 00:15:11.688
the others around her would notice.

275
00:15:11.688 --> 00:15:15.488
Like Mr. Kamata, what if she put the ice cube in her mouth

276
00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:18.488
and pretend to eat it?

277
00:15:18.488 --> 00:15:19.988
What?

278
00:15:19.988 --> 00:15:22.388
That's right. Without anyone noticing,

279
00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:24.288
she spit the ice out in her hand

280
00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:27.288
and hid in a certain place.

281
00:15:27.288 --> 00:15:28.988
And that place would be...

282
00:15:33.588 --> 00:15:38.588
Putting poisoned ice in your mouth is extremely dangerous,

283
00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:41.088
but if the poison is in the very center,

284
00:15:41.088 --> 00:15:42.988
it is possible in getting the deed done.

285
00:15:42.988 --> 00:15:45.888
But are you sure it was in her hood?

286
00:15:45.888 --> 00:15:47.988
It's not a lie.

287
00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:49.388
Take a look at this!

288
00:15:49.388 --> 00:15:53.288
All the tarnish is gone from the coin, see how shiny it is.

289
00:15:53.288 --> 00:15:54.588
It's proof that it came in contact with potassium cyanide

290
00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:57.888
and oxidation reduction reaction has occurred.

291
00:15:57.888 --> 00:16:00.088
Oh, I see.

292
00:16:00.088 --> 00:16:02.288
How did you know

293
00:16:02.288 --> 00:16:05.088
she put the poisoned ice cube in the hood?

294
00:16:05.088 --> 00:16:06.888
Well, that's...

295
00:16:06.888 --> 00:16:08.288
Because of the rain.

296
00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:09.488
Huh?

297
00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:11.988
It was raining,

298
00:16:11.988 --> 00:16:15.188
but when I went outside to show the officer to Kamata's car,

299
00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:17.788
I didn't cover my head with the hood.

300
00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:19.388
That's what made you suspicious, isn't that right?

301
00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:21.688
Yes, I figured that the ice melted,

302
00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:27.688
and you didn't want the poison all over your head.

303
00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:30.688
So, like he said, you killed Kamata?

304
00:16:30.688 --> 00:16:32.488
Yes, that's right.

305
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:35.488
I poisoned him.

306
00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:38.488
He was a disgrace as a doctor!

307
00:16:38.488 --> 00:16:42.288
What do you mean by that?

308
00:16:42.288 --> 00:16:44.788
I'm sure you all know about it.

309
00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:47.088
I'm talking about the doctrine he was going to present

310
00:16:47.088 --> 00:16:48.388
at the next conference.

311
00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:49.888
What?

312
00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:54.788
But there was an unusual patient in our hospital

313
00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:56.788
who would have overruled his theory.

314
00:16:56.788 --> 00:17:01.988
Unfortunately, his condition turned for the worse and he died.

315
00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.988
It's almost as if it's an exception to the theory never existed.

316
00:17:04.988 --> 00:17:07.888
Are you saying that Kamata...

317
00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:12.788
That's right. He gave that patient the wrong medication,

318
00:17:12.788 --> 00:17:15.788
and made his symptoms worse, killing him.

319
00:17:15.788 --> 00:17:19.588
Just to protect his meaningless research.

320
00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:27.188
He told me himself last week

321
00:17:27.188 --> 00:17:29.988
that Ayako broke off their engagement and he was upset.

322
00:17:29.988 --> 00:17:33.488
So, I went drinking with him and he got very drunk.

323
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:35.988
He didn't even regret what he did,

324
00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.988
instead he disgustingly blurted out that

325
00:17:38.988 --> 00:17:42.388
he thought this world was unfair

326
00:17:42.388 --> 00:17:45.588
when a man who held people's lives in his hand

327
00:17:45.588 --> 00:17:48.788
should be upset over being jilted by a young girl in her teens.

328
00:17:48.788 --> 00:17:50.888
No way...

329
00:17:50.888 --> 00:17:52.788
That's why I showed him.

330
00:17:52.788 --> 00:17:56.488
I showed him it was even more unfair for a man like him

331
00:17:56.488 --> 00:17:58.088
to be a doctor.

332
00:17:58.088 --> 00:18:03.288
Then, the bottle of poison in Mr. Kamata's car...

333
00:18:03.288 --> 00:18:05.588
Yes, I put it there.

334
00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:08.588
I hid his driver's license

335
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.888
so he would look for it and arouse suspicions.

336
00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:14.788
You were lucky weren't you, Mr. Detective?

337
00:18:14.788 --> 00:18:16.988
That it rained.

338
00:18:16.988 --> 00:18:21.888
If it didn't, you wouldn't have any proof I did it.

339
00:18:21.888 --> 00:18:24.688
No, even if it weren't for your hood,

340
00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:28.788
I would have asked the police to check your clothes anyway.

341
00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:31.988
That's because I already had you pegged as the killer

342
00:18:31.988 --> 00:18:36.388
when I saw that you had the unopened tubs in your pocket.

343
00:18:36.388 --> 00:18:38.888
When you returned from the restroom,

344
00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:42.588
you said the play had already started, isn't that right?

345
00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.888
When the play began and the lights went out,

346
00:18:44.888 --> 00:18:46.588
you wouldn't have been able to tell

347
00:18:46.588 --> 00:18:50.588
if your drink was cola or iced coffee even if you took the lid off.

348
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.588
That's what convinced me.

349
00:18:52.588 --> 00:18:54.888
It told me that you had already opened the lids

350
00:18:54.888 --> 00:18:58.188
and seen that it wasn't iced coffee.

351
00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:02.088
I give up.

352
00:19:02.088 --> 00:19:04.088
As a fellow alumni of this high school,

353
00:19:04.088 --> 00:19:07.688
I am proud of your brilliance.

354
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:10.188
We can continue this at the station.

355
00:19:10.188 --> 00:19:12.088
-All right. -Mr. Mitani, Ms. Noda,

356
00:19:12.088 --> 00:19:13.488
and Ms. Ninagawa,

357
00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:15.588
I'll need your statements, too.

358
00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:16.988
So, could you please come with me to the station?

359
00:19:16.988 --> 00:19:18.788
Yes...

360
00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:20.388
You know, Heiji,

361
00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:22.588
you seemed to be a mere assistant to a great magician today.

362
00:19:22.588 --> 00:19:24.088
Well, that can't be helped.

363
00:19:24.088 --> 00:19:25.588
We're in Tokyo,

364
00:19:25.588 --> 00:19:27.988
I've got to make Kudo look good.

365
00:19:27.988 --> 00:19:31.888
Well, you're as dependable as always!

366
00:19:31.888 --> 00:19:32.988
No, no.

367
00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:36.188
But he's not still in the same league as me.

368
00:19:36.188 --> 00:19:37.288
How about it?

369
00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:40.388
Do you want to sit in on the interrogation, for old times sake?

370
00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:42.788
No, I'll pass this time.

371
00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:45.788
I have something I need to do.

372
00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:49.188
Oh, I see.

373
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.588
And I'd like for you to not let it get out

374
00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:52.788
that I was involved in this case.

375
00:19:52.788 --> 00:19:54.288
That's fine with me,

376
00:19:54.288 --> 00:19:56.788
but you're certainly keeping a low profile these days.

377
00:19:56.788 --> 00:19:58.788
Let's go, Mouri

378
00:19:58.788 --> 00:20:00.288
Yes, Inspector!

379
00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:02.988
Hey, Kudo.

380
00:20:02.988 --> 00:20:05.988
Why didn't you want to watch the interrogation?

381
00:20:05.988 --> 00:20:07.888
Sorry.

382
00:20:07.888 --> 00:20:11.888
A trick is merely a puzzle thought up by someone.

383
00:20:11.888 --> 00:20:13.188
All you have to do

384
00:20:13.188 --> 00:20:15.688
is give it enough thought and eventually,

385
00:20:15.688 --> 00:20:17.988
you'll come up with a logical explanation.

386
00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:20.888
Hey, what's wrong?

387
00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:22.388
It's very frustrating,

388
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.688
no matter how many times it's explained,

389
00:20:24.688 --> 00:20:26.188
I just don't know the rationalization

390
00:20:26.188 --> 00:20:28.088
behind one human being killing another.

391
00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:29.488
I can understand the emotion,

392
00:20:29.488 --> 00:20:32.388
but I can't accept the action.

393
00:20:32.388 --> 00:20:34.988
It's just beyond me...

394
00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:48.188
Oh, no. It's happening already.

395
00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:51.688
I thought I'd changed back into my old self...

396
00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:53.988
I thought it was going to work out.

397
00:20:55.188 --> 00:20:58.988
This is a test product,

398
00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:03.388
it's a specially mixed antidote for the APTX 4869.

399
00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.988
What are you going to do?

400
00:21:04.988 --> 00:21:07.788
It could kill you If you take it, you know.

401
00:21:09.388 --> 00:21:11.088
Are you willing to give it a try?

402
00:21:11.088 --> 00:21:14.388
Shinichi?

403
00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:16.688
What's wrong, Shinichi?

404
00:21:16.688 --> 00:21:17.988
Are you alright?

405
00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:19.288
Does it hurt?

406
00:21:19.288 --> 00:21:21.088
Ran...

407
00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:22.188
It's all over.

408
00:21:22.188 --> 00:21:24.888
If I turn back into Conan here,

409
00:21:26.088 --> 00:21:28.288
Ran will find out about me.

410
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:33.088
Darn it! My body...

411
00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:40.388
Kudo!

412
00:21:40.388 --> 00:21:44.888
Shinichi?

413
00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.888
Shinichi!

414
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.388
What is this smell?

415
00:21:55.388 --> 00:21:57.488
Is this the school infirmary?

416
00:21:57.488 --> 00:22:00.588
Oh, right. I was carried in here.

417
00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:03.888
It's Ran.

418
00:22:03.888 --> 00:22:06.688
She looks pale.

419
00:22:06.688 --> 00:22:08.388
I can't blame her.

420
00:22:08.388 --> 00:22:10.588
She just saw a person shrink right in front of her eyes.

421
00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:14.488
What's this?

422
00:22:14.488 --> 00:22:16.888
Kudo! So, you're awake!

423
00:22:16.888 --> 00:22:19.088
I'm so glad you re awake.

424
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:22.288
Gosh! Don't worry us like that again.

425
00:22:22.288 --> 00:22:23.888
Huh?

426
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:01.088
"Next Episode"

427
00:24:01.088 --> 00:24:03.888
There he is! It's Shinichi!

428
00:24:03.888 --> 00:24:05.488
I wasn't dreaming.

429
00:24:05.488 --> 00:24:07.388
He really came back.

430
00:24:12.888 --> 00:24:14.788
I hate to say this,

431
00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:17.688
but this doesn't look like it was a hold up.

432
00:24:19.688 --> 00:24:20.988
Inspector Megure.

433
00:24:20.988 --> 00:24:22.688
Kudo!

434
00:24:22.688 --> 00:24:28.509
Next Conan, "Perilous Return: Shinichi Is Back"

435
00:24:28.806 --> 00:24:31.106
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:33.606
"Watch's dial"

437
00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:36.306
-Next time... -Gosh, Ran is consumed by love.

438
00:24:36.306 --> 00:24:38.106
How long will it last?
