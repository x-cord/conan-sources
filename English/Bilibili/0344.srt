1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,640
Ran encounters a queer case at the convenience store.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
She makes a pure deduction in order to help her friend.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:54,868
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 2)"

9
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,968
Who are you?

10
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:32,768
Jodie? Jodie!

11
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,668
Are you all right, Jodie?

12
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,268
Did you come across an idea or something?

13
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,968
You seemed to be in deep thought.

14
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,768
No idea. Not the slightest!

15
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:45,568
Huh? What's the matter?

16
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:49,168
I saw you take off your glasses for the first time, so...

17
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,168
You know what I mean, don't you?

18
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,068
For the first time?

19
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,968
But those glasses sure look old.

20
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,168
Oh, yes! This is something I cherish.

21
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:03,768
The only vestige that a person very, very important to me

22
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,968
left in this world.

23
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:08,268
That's why it's so very important!

24
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,168
A very important person?

25
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:14,468
Is it a keepsake of your ex-lover or something?

26
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:18,668
By the way, did you two figure out this case?

27
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,968
Not at all!

28
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,068
It stopped.

29
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,668
A delivery truck?

30
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:32,368
Right! The sales clerk mentioned it.

31
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,768
Remember? On the days that Aya is in charge,

32
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,968
even the boxes that arrive just before closing

33
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,068
are nicely organized, right?

34
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:43,668
Now that you mentioned it, the sales clerk said so.

35
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:46,468
So? How does that connect to what happened?

36
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,968
Well, I wonder how it connects.

37
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,668
I thought you had something in mind.

38
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,968
But...

39
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,368
There!

40
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:01,468
Here are the items you ordered!

41
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,068
Oh, you're early.

42
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,468
We'll stack the boxes up

43
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,868
as usual in the corridor in front of the restroom.

44
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:10,868
Oh, a customer is still using the restroom. What should I do?

45
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:14,268
Oh. We'll bring the boxes over again later.

46
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:16,468
We got other places to make deliveries to too,

47
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,768
so we'll stop by again after we complete the other deliveries.

48
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:19,568
Thank you.

49
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,768
Since a customer is using the restroom,

50
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:24,868
the boxes cannot be placed in front of the restroom.

51
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,568
If the boxes are placed there,

52
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:29,268
the customer cannot come out of the restroom.

53
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,168
We'll be back later then!

54
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,168
Thank you, see you later!

55
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,468
On the days that Aya is in charge,

56
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:40,268
the boxes in front of the restroom are nicely organized.

57
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:49,768
What was it? That famous dialog by Holmes.

58
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:54,768
Shinichi used to remark haughtily.

59
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:58,268
When you have eliminated the impossible, then... this and that.

60
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:02,268
When you have eliminated the impossible.

61
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:08,768
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

62
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,568
however improbable,

63
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:12,368
must be the truth.

64
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:17,468
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

65
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,768
however improbable,

66
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,968
must be the truth.

67
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:26,168
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,

68
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,268
however improbable,

69
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:30,468
must be the truth.

70
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,168
This dialog?

71
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,068
-Oh, yes! -What, what?

72
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,668
Don't tell me Ran, that you came across something?

73
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:40,868
-Oh, not really. -Stop bringing my hopes up again.

74
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:45,868
I think I got it. I feel like I got it

75
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:49,168
but I wonder if my deduction is correct.

76
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,568
My!

77
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,468
It's already 21:00!

78
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:00,968
I'll have to call mother.

79
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,868
The customers are decreasing.

80
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:03,868
Yes.

81
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,468
-Aya! -Shopkeeper.

82
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:14,968
So, are you ready to confess?

83
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:17,568
But, I really haven't done anything.

84
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:20,768
It seems I have no choice but to call the police!

85
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:22,768
Oh, no.

86
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,668
What shall I do?

87
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,468
I could tell them about my deduction.

88
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:32,568
But what if I'm wrong? What if I'm off the point?

89
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:35,168
Then, I may be getting Aya into more trouble than helping her.

90
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:38,568
What shall I do?

91
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,068
What would he do at a time like this?

92
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,268
What would he do?

93
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,768
Caller unidentified?

94
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,468
Hello?

95
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:05,668
Ran.

96
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:08,668
How're you doing?

97
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,068
Shi...

98
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:12,068
Shinichi?

99
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,568
Sorry, Ran.

100
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:16,068
I don't have anything to say

101
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,268
but there was a little something I wanted to ask you.

102
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:19,768
Shinichi.

103
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,068
Shinichi!

104
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,968
Huh? What?

105
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:29,368
Is it from Shinichi?

106
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,768
Yeah.

107
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:32,468
Hey, what's up?

108
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:35,768
My friend's in a tight situation right now.

109
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,268
You know her too,

110
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,568
Aya, who was our classmate in intermediate school.

111
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,668
Yeah, you mean Nanakawa?

112
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,668
For some reason, things disappear

113
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:46,068
at the convenience store where she works

114
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,868
and it happens only on the days

115
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,868
that Aya is in charge of cleaning and closing the store.

116
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:54,768
So, the shopkeeper suspects that Aya is stealing the things

117
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:58,568
and says that he will call the police unless she confesses.

118
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,568
There aren't any customers on the surveillance camera

119
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:02,368
that are shown stealing either.

120
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,468
The shopkeeper insists that there is no one but Aya

121
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,768
because he was watching the store after it closed,

122
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,068
but things disappeared after all.

123
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:11,468
And? What kinds of things have disappeared?

124
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:13,768
Game softwares, CDs, DVDs,

125
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,068
drinks, lunch boxes and candies.

126
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,168
According to Aya, she thinks that

127
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:21,568
there are three suspicious people among the customers.

128
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,568
Oh, what kind of people are they? Those three?

129
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:27,468
One of them is a man that looks to be a university student

130
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:30,168
who reads game magazine till near closing time.

131
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:34,068
He bought some cup noodles and pouched food.

132
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,868
The second one is a timid office worker type of man

133
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:38,968
who always lets others go through the register

134
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,868
or use the restroom before him.

135
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:44,968
He bought a toothbrush set, a shaver, batteries and a towel.

136
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,368
The third one is a stubborn old lady

137
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:50,168
who asks for discounts on lunches are near shelf life expiration.

138
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:54,268
She seems to have bought nothing at the store.

139
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,568
And?

140
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,968
What all the three of them have in common

141
00:08:56,968 --> 00:09:00,668
is that they frequently come to use the restroom at this store.

142
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:02,368
A month ago,

143
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,968
when Aya was scolded in front of the restroom by the shopkeeper,

144
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:07,668
things stopped disappearing just like that.

145
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,068
Then, last night, a month after the incident,

146
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,768
again on the night when Aya was in charge, things disappeared.

147
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:15,768
I see, which means it's only natural that Nanakawa is suspected.

148
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,968
Wait! Don't talk like it's somebody else's problem!

149
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,668
And? There's something else, isn't there?

150
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,768
Something that only Nanakawa does on the days

151
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:26,368
that she is in charge that nobody else does.

152
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:29,668
Oh, yes. The other employees

153
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,868
leave the boxes that arrive just before closing time

154
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:35,868
stacked up in the corridor in front of the restroom, and go home

155
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,968
but, Aya organizes the boxes neatly before closing the store.

156
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:42,068
Since the surveillance cameras are working all this time,

157
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:44,568
it should be easy to prove Aya's innocence,

158
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,968
but the shopkeeper seems to turn off

159
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:49,168
the switch of the surveillance camera after operating hours.

160
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,168
Weren't the lunches that were stolen

161
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:54,768
all near shelf life expiration?

162
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,968
Huh? How do you know?

163
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:58,368
Just as I thought.

164
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:01,668
The culprit is probably a pretty nice person.

165
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,768
What? You know who the culprit is?

166
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,768
Yeah, the culprit is probably...

167
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,868
Wait, Shinichi!

168
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:13,668
I sort of came up with my own deduction.

169
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:16,868
So, will you hear me out without laughing?

170
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,468
Go ahead.

171
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:19,668
Ran.

172
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:26,568
Let me hear your deduction.

173
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:35,231
So, that's my deduction.

174
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:36,931
I took everything into consideration,

175
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:40,831
I came to the conclusion that it's not shoplifting, a thief, or Aya.

176
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,631
Although it's hard to believe...

177
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:45,531
Well? Am I right?

178
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,831
Hey! I told you not to laugh.

179
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:55,931
Oh, sorry. It's not your deduction I'm laughing at.

180
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,531
I mean I couldn't help imagining you looking all troubled

181
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:01,731
after having deduced the situation as much as you have.

182
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:05,531
Huh? Then are you saying I'm right? Is my deduction correct?

183
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,631
I wonder.

184
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,231
Just what do you mean by that?

185
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,231
Don't be mean and tell me!

186
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:16,731
I'm not an over confident detective like somebody somewhere!

187
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:18,031
Don't be silly.

188
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:22,931
A detective is only human, and not some almighty god.

189
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,531
Huh?

190
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:27,431
When a detective reveals his deductions,

191
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:30,531
chances are that he carries doubts somewhere in his heart.

192
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:35,531
Like maybe, I left some detail out or overlooked something.

193
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,531
That's why when your deduction hits the bull's eye,

194
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,631
you feel more joy than anyone ever will!

195
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,531
I'm just thinking that I don't want

196
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:44,831
to take the best part away from you, Ran.

197
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:46,431
Shinichi.

198
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,631
He's putting on airs like he always does,

199
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,831
that "hubby" of yours.

200
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:55,231
If you think your deduction is correct, try it out.

201
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,231
Try it out?

202
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,431
You know? Come on, Ran.

203
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:05,031
There's a simple way to drag the culprit out before everybody.

204
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,831
Drag the culprit out.

205
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:10,131
If you were the culprit,

206
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:12,931
what situation would you hate to be in?

207
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:15,431
If I were the culprit?

208
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,631
Ran?

209
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:26,831
Mouri?

210
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,531
Welcome!

211
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,231
Excuse me.

212
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,731
Let me borrow your restroom!

213
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,731
Ran.

214
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:07,931
Shinichi.

215
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,131
Where's Ran?

216
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,631
The restroom.

217
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:16,831
Huh? The restroom?

218
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,231
Fire!

219
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:23,931
Quick, everybody! Run!

220
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,431
You'd better hurry, or you'll burn to death!

221
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,831
You'd better cut it out or I'll file charges against you

222
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:31,031
for interfering with business!

223
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,131
Listen, here.

224
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,231
What on earth's on your mind?

225
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,231
Hi.

226
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:10,231
No...

227
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:16,531
What...

228
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,531
-What's with him? -What's up?

229
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,231
So, it was you after all.

230
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,331
What?

231
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,331
Timid, office worker type customer.

232
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,431
Don't tell me it was him?

233
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,831
Yes, it's him!

234
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:32,531
He's the one who's been stealing stuff night after night

235
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:36,731
from this store and giving Aya a bad time!

236
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,431
Night after night? I was in front of the store watching last night too,

237
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:43,831
but I didn't see him sneak into the shop.

238
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,831
Of course, you didn't.

239
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:50,731
Because he was living in the attic of your store all this time!

240
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,731
What?

241
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,531
I can't believe it.

242
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:58,731
It may be hard to believe, but this is the truth.

243
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,531
After Aya closed the store,

244
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,331
he came out of the attic through the restroom

245
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,031
and sneaked into the store,

246
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:08,731
taking drinks and tons of food, and was making a living!

247
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:13,431
But Aya is in charge only 2 or 3 days a week and not everyday.

248
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:18,331
If he steals a lot at one time, he can probably last 2 to 3 days.

249
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:22,531
Then, why were games software and CDs also being stolen?

250
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:25,731
I think he was probably taking them out of the store occasionally

251
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,431
and selling them off for cash.

252
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,631
He'd have to go get a hair cut as well

253
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:31,431
as go to take a bath at the times,

254
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,731
otherwise his hair would grow long and he'd be smelly,

255
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,331
which would force him to stay in the attic

256
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,531
keeping him from coming out forever.

257
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:41,031
But, can he come in and out of that restroom

258
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:44,331
without the customers or the employees noticing him?

259
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:46,131
If he suddenly comes out of the restroom

260
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:48,131
or goes inside and doesn't come out,

261
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,931
he'll be suspected right away.

262
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:54,231
No problem! If he's hesitant and careful.

263
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:57,731
Because if he keeps letting people go before him

264
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:00,131
and keeps standing at the end of the line,

265
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:02,131
nobody would notice him going into the restroom,

266
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:04,831
so he wouldn't have to come back out, right?

267
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,331
Oh, I see.

268
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,831
If he comes down from the attic to the restroom

269
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,131
just before it starts getting crowded,

270
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,831
and comes out of the restroom after it gets crowded

271
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:15,931
and go into the store among the other customers,

272
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,131
he wouldn't risk being suspected.

273
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,031
If he'd been living in the attic for a while,

274
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,131
he would probably have had an idea

275
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,031
of when it would start getting crowded.

276
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,731
Besides, if the restroom starts getting crowded,

277
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:26,131
so would the store,

278
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,731
so the employees wouldn't possibly be able to remember

279
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,831
who came into the store and who went out, right?

280
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:35,631
Then the toothbrush set, batteries and shaver that he bought...

281
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:39,231
The batteries he used for the flashlight he used

282
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,931
when looking for stuff after the store closed!

283
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:46,131
All the other stuff he took to make himself look decent!

284
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,531
Besides, there's a mirror in the restroom too!

285
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:52,631
Shopkeeper! It's just as she says!

286
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,931
The board of the ceiling of the restroom is removed!

287
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,431
What?

288
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:00,531
Which mean he was hiding in the attic all this time, after all.

289
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,931
This place is a trash dump, shopkeeper!

290
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:09,531
-Incredible! -Oh my God.

291
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:13,331
But, why did he do it only on the days that Aya was in charge?

292
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:16,731
That's because Aya is a diligent worker!

293
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:19,531
The cardboard boxes that are left out on the corridor.

294
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:22,131
The other employees would leave the boxes stacked,

295
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,831
in other words, the restroom door was blocked,

296
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:25,431
so he couldn't come out.

297
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,031
But, Aya would organize them

298
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:28,731
and move them to both sides of the corridor,

299
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:31,231
making it possible for him to come out of the restroom

300
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,731
and go into the store!

301
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:33,931
But, Ran,

302
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:37,831
the boxes can be moved over with just a slight shove, can't they?

303
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,731
Exactly.

304
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:42,231
That's one thing I can't make out.

305
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:43,331
Hey.

306
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:46,931
Maybe he could've gone through the corridor if he moved the boxes.

307
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,731
If the employees find out that the boxes have been moved even slightly,

308
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,631
they might find out that the culprit walked through the corridor

309
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,731
and get suspicious.

310
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,531
They would suspect the restroom

311
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,431
and the fact that he's hiding in the attic may be discovered.

312
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:03,531
Since he was afraid of this happening, he couldn't make any moves.

313
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,531
-That's the story! -Right!

314
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,731
I see.

315
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,731
But, I still don't understand.

316
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,331
Huh?

317
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:14,331
Why did he stop stealing for a month?

318
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:16,431
Well, it may be that he was working things out with the cash

319
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:18,331
he got from selling off the games and all,

320
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,031
but if he didn't stop at that timing,

321
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,831
I wouldn't have suspected Aya as much as I did.

322
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:27,231
The culprit is probably a pretty nice person.

323
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,431
That's probably because he's a pretty good person.

324
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:34,031
That is, he heard Aya being scolded because of what he did

325
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,631
from the attic

326
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:38,031
and that's why he probably decided not to steal for a while.

327
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,831
I see! That's the story.

328
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:43,931
He stole only the lunches that were near the expiration date

329
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:47,631
because he wanted losses to the store to be as little as possible.

330
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:50,731
But stealing is stealing!

331
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,731
How dare you make Aya go through something like this?

332
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,431
Ran? Hey.

333
00:18:55,431 --> 00:19:01,231
I could never forgive anyone who did something like this to Aya!

334
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:05,931
I'm so sorry!

335
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:09,931
Three months ago, I was fired from my company

336
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,431
and evicted from my apartment.

337
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:14,931
I walked into this store feeling faint from hunger.

338
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,431
But I didn't have money to buy anything.

339
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:19,131
The lights were turned off

340
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:20,831
while I was in the restroom at a loss what to do.

341
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:23,031
Even if I wanted to go out, the doors were locked

342
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,531
and I couldn't go out.

343
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,331
Once my eyes got used to the dark,

344
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,531
the thing that came bursting into my eyes

345
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,031
was the stack of food.

346
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,931
That's why you stole things from our store.

347
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,931
Yes. I figured since there was so much,

348
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:36,831
taking just a little wouldn't hurt.

349
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,131
You've gotta be kidding!

350
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,931
How much do you think we have to sell

351
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,531
in order to regain the amount you stole from us?

352
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,831
I'm really sorry!

353
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:50,031
Either way, you're going to pay us back for all the loss you cost us!

354
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,831
Even if I wanted to pay you back, I don't have a cent.

355
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:56,031
You're going to work here.

356
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,631
Although you'll have to work for free for a while to start with.

357
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,331
You're willing to hire me?

358
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:05,231
After all the trouble I caused you?

359
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,931
I quit being an office worker and started working here,

360
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,431
so I sort of understand how you feel!

361
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:12,831
Shopkeeper.

362
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,131
Thank you so much.

363
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,531
Do your best and work hard.

364
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:19,031
-Yes, sir. -Well...

365
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:22,531
I hate to be a wet blanket when you guys are getting it on but...

366
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:25,431
Will you please apologize to Aya?

367
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:27,231
Both of you!

368
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,031
I'm so sorry.

369
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,331
I'm very sorry, really. I'm sorry.

370
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:41,331
-I'm happy for you, Aya. -All is well!

371
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,031
Ran. Sonoko.

372
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:47,731
Thank you! Ran and Sonoko!

373
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:52,131
Nothing to it, just leave it to me.

374
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:56,831
Hey, woman detective!

375
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,631
Sorry, Shinichi, what was it you wanted to talk about?

376
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:02,331
Well, it's nothing much.

377
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:04,831
Did you come to my house recently?

378
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,631
Huh? No. Why?

379
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,931
Nothing. If not, it's okay.

380
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:13,531
-See you, then. -Oh, hey, Shinichi...

381
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:16,431
It's not Ran.

382
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:50,831
Yes. So, I'm going to sleep over at Jodie's place tonight.

383
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:53,531
Eat dinner at Cafe Poirot, okay, dad?

384
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:54,931
See you!

385
00:22:55,631 --> 00:23:00,031
It's her little farewell party

386
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:02,431
and she gets wasted to the point of no return.

387
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:05,331
I'm sure she's relieved because she gets to go back to her country

388
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:07,631
after a long time.

389
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:09,531
Where are you going?

390
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,231
To the restroom.

391
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:18,231
Again. He helped me again.

392
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,931
It's so vexing.

393
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,031
Really vexing.

394
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:26,331
What on earth is this?

395
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:31,731
Pictures?

396
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:35,131
What's this?

397
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,431
Jodie...

398
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:48,731
Why? Jodie?
