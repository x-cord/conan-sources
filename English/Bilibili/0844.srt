1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.170
We, the members of the Detective Squad come to

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.970
the classy restaurant at the top of the Beika Department Store

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.870
because Dr. Agasa won a meal ticket.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.070
However, the chef of the restaurant there

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.270
is seriously injured after being stabbed in the stomach.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.370
I contacted the members of the Detective Squad

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.070
who scattered inside the department store right away

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.370
and instructed them to look for the perp.

9
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.070
Now, we need to get the testimonies of the children

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.170
who say they saw the perp.

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.670
They'll do fine!

12
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.170
They say they didn't see the perp's face

13
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.570
but they remember the characteristics!

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.070
He was pretty small!

15
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.370
He had the number "2" on his clothes.

16
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.870
His clothes were gray!

17
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.370
The color was like what Ai is wearing now!

18
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.470
-Wrong. -What?

19
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.170
He was pretty big and was wearing dark gray clothes!

20
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.070
And he ran like a man!

21
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.570
I thought it was a woman.

22
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.770
She was wearing light gray clothes that was almost white.

23
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.970
She was of normal height, a little taller than Doc!

24
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.970
Hey, hey.

25
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.870
-I said he was small built! -We've got a problem here.

26
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.370
It's no mistake that he was big built!

27
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.070
-Their testimonies are all different! -Nope! It was a woman!

28
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.170
A canvas stained black with crime.

29
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

30
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.870
First of all, Merry Christmas!

31
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.270
Can the mystery of the varied testimonies be solved?

32
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.870
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.170
His name is Detective Conan!

35
00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:24.827
"The Detective Squad is in a Grove (Part 2)"

36
00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:28.927
Hey, Conan!

37
00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:30.827
Wait!

38
00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:36.427
What?

39
00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:37.927
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

40
00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:39.827
When I saw the perp,

41
00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:43.727
those mannequins were lined out by the 5th floor stairs!

42
00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:46.727
I just remembered that the perp went down the stairs

43
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:50.627
weaving through the mannequins!

44
00:03:50.627 --> 00:03:53.927
Sir! Did you really have them lined out on the 5th floor?

45
00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:56.427
Yeah, about 10 of them.

46
00:03:56.427 --> 00:03:58.127
Since we're having a children's uniform fair

47
00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:00.827
at the sport equipment department,

48
00:04:00.827 --> 00:04:03.227
I'm taking the mannequins that were stored in the 5th floor storage room

49
00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:05.427
up to the 7th floor.

50
00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:07.627
Because the 5th floor used to be the toy department before

51
00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:09.627
and they used to handle children's clothes, too.

52
00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:10.827
Really?

53
00:04:10.827 --> 00:04:14.227
I also carried an extra four to five signs up to the 7th floor

54
00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:16.027
so I'm pooped.

55
00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:19.427
The business elevator is under maintenance right now,

56
00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:22.127
but my boss wants to hurry things up, you see.

57
00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:23.427
That's right.

58
00:04:23.427 --> 00:04:25.627
The signs blocked my view

59
00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:28.527
so I couldn't see the perp from neck up!

60
00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:30.827
Then if you see those signs,

61
00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:34.127
maybe you'll be able to figure out how tall the perp was?

62
00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:37.527
But there were signs of varying heights

63
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.627
so I don't know which ones they were.

64
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:42.627
Was the mannequin the same as the one we just saw?

65
00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:46.027
Yes, although they were all kind of whitish.

66
00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:48.527
Then were the signs white, too?

67
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:49.627
Yes.

68
00:04:49.627 --> 00:04:52.027
There seems to have been something stuck onto the front,

69
00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:53.727
but it was all taken off.

70
00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:57.527
Let's rush over to the 4th floor toy department!

71
00:04:57.527 --> 00:05:01.827
Because she may be the most reliable eye-witness.

72
00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:03.027
Yeah.

73
00:05:04.827 --> 00:05:06.427
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:10.427
You're talking about the time I took her over to the stairs, right?

75
00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:14.427
My contacts fell out of place because I ran,

76
00:05:14.427 --> 00:05:17.527
so everything was blurred and I couldn't see.

77
00:05:17.527 --> 00:05:20.727
Is that so? Too bad.

78
00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:23.427
Don't you remember anything from back then?

79
00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:25.827
Even if vaguely.

80
00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:28.327
Well...

81
00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:31.827
I was waiting with her by the wall in front of the stairs

82
00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:35.227
for the perp to come down.

83
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:36.927
When the person first appeared,

84
00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:39.727
the figure was silhouetted in the backlight from the window,

85
00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:42.527
so I don't think she got a good look at the person either.

86
00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:47.227
It seems that the perp was standing in place for a while

87
00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.227
in front of that window, though.

88
00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:51.127
Standing in place?

89
00:05:51.127 --> 00:05:53.127
Isn't that right?

90
00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:56.327
Yep! It looked like that person was trying

91
00:05:56.327 --> 00:05:57.927
to take something off from the sole of the left shoe.

92
00:05:57.927 --> 00:06:00.127
What is that something?

93
00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:01.327
Beats me.

94
00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:04.927
Maybe chewing gum?

95
00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:06.727
I don't know.

96
00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:10.027
Well, even if it were chewing gum,

97
00:06:10.027 --> 00:06:12.927
it would've been disposed of already.

98
00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:16.827
And the perp came down after that, right?

99
00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:18.627
Couldn't you see the perp's face?

100
00:06:18.627 --> 00:06:19.827
Nope.

101
00:06:19.827 --> 00:06:21.927
I tried to look

102
00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:24.427
but a lot of boys who looked to be intermediate school

103
00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:27.927
or high school students came up the stairs,

104
00:06:27.927 --> 00:06:31.927
and the perp went down passing all those boys

105
00:06:32.027 --> 00:06:34.727
so I couldn't see very well.

106
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.927
How did you know they were in intermediate school or high school?

107
00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:41.527
Because they were all wearing the same clothes!

108
00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:43.727
Same clothes?

109
00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:45.627
Yep!

110
00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:49.127
Come to think of it, students who were on a high school excursion

111
00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:51.427
came to buy souvenirs.

112
00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:55.027
They reminded me of the high school cheerleader I liked.

113
00:06:55.027 --> 00:06:57.627
In my case, even flirty students look handsome

114
00:06:57.627 --> 00:06:59.827
with their stand-up collars that hide their shallowness

115
00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:02.827
and make them look good.

116
00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:05.327
Hide...

117
00:07:05.327 --> 00:07:07.027
and look?

118
00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:11.027
Then those students must've seen the perp, too.

119
00:07:11.027 --> 00:07:13.527
Do you know what high school they were from?

120
00:07:13.527 --> 00:07:14.827
No.

121
00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:17.527
There were two or three of them around just a while ago, though.

122
00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:19.027
Darn it!

123
00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:20.227
If we know which school,

124
00:07:20.227 --> 00:07:23.027
maybe we can figure out who the perp is!

125
00:07:23.027 --> 00:07:25.227
Don't worry.

126
00:07:25.227 --> 00:07:28.227
I don't think that's necessary anymore.

127
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:33.127
Isn't that right, Detective?

128
00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:36.127
Yeah, I've figured everything out.

129
00:07:36.127 --> 00:07:39.127
Why all your testimonies were different...

130
00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:43.127
And who the perp is, too!

131
00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:47.527
Inspector, we found it!

132
00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:49.427
-You found it! -Yes, sir.

133
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:54.327
Inside the shrub near the phone booth by the department store.

134
00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:56.527
The can of helium gas

135
00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:59.727
that the perp seems to have used to change his voice

136
00:07:59.727 --> 00:08:01.827
when calling the restaurant of the victim!

137
00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:06.727
If so, the perp who changed his voice used the pay phone

138
00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:09.427
and called the restaurant on the 10th floor of this department store

139
00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:11.727
and complained.

140
00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:13.427
After making the call,

141
00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:15.127
he rushed over to the stairs near the restaurant

142
00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:19.627
and stabbed the chef who came to cope with the complaint,

143
00:08:19.627 --> 00:08:23.027
then ran down the stairs and attempted to flee.

144
00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:24.027
Yes.

145
00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:28.927
The forensics are examining the pay phone and can of helium now,

146
00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:32.527
but judging from the fact that there were no fingerprints on the knife,

147
00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:35.827
we can't count on finding the perp's fingerprints.

148
00:08:37.227 --> 00:08:40.027
Then maybe we have no other choice

149
00:08:40.027 --> 00:08:42.027
but to wait till the victim regains consciousness.

150
00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:44.727
No problem!

151
00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:46.927
Because I've figured out the perp,

152
00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:49.227
thanks to their testimonies!

153
00:08:49.227 --> 00:08:50.627
What?

154
00:08:52.727 --> 00:08:54.927
Right, Doc?

155
00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:56.027
Yeah.

156
00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:58.127
But, Conan...

157
00:08:58.127 --> 00:09:01.327
The suspects that tried to flee hurriedly out of the department store

158
00:09:01.327 --> 00:09:04.327
were Ms. Mitsuko Shikama, of small built, wearing light gray clothes,

159
00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:09.027
with a broche that looked like the number 6.

160
00:09:09.827 --> 00:09:14.127
Mr. Masaru Miyadai, of big built, wearing a dark gray stadium jacket

161
00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:18.127
with the logo mark of the Tokyo Spirits in the back.

162
00:09:18.127 --> 00:09:22.327
And Mr. Takashi Kamaya of medium built and average height

163
00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:25.727
wearing a gray parka that is neither dark or light

164
00:09:25.727 --> 00:09:28.827
with the kanji character (beika) on the back.

165
00:09:28.827 --> 00:09:32.427
All your testimonies are different

166
00:09:32.427 --> 00:09:35.827
and no one matches the description perfectly.

167
00:09:35.827 --> 00:09:38.227
Then, would you like to actually try it out?

168
00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:40.427
-Try it out? -Yep!

169
00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:43.327
If we do so, I'm sure you'll see that

170
00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:46.527
the different testimonies of everyone point to one person.

171
00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:54.927
First, the 7th floor where the sporting goods are.

172
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:58.927
You saw the perp run down the stairs from here, right, Genta?

173
00:09:58.927 --> 00:10:00.127
Yeah!

174
00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:02.427
Yes...

175
00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:06.327
They are?

176
00:10:06.327 --> 00:10:09.027
The members of the basketball club that were here

177
00:10:09.027 --> 00:10:11.127
at the time Genta saw the perp.

178
00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:13.527
I called them and asked them to come.

179
00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:15.127
I see.

180
00:10:15.127 --> 00:10:17.827
Then Genta, will you tell us once more

181
00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:19.427
the characteristic of the perp you saw?

182
00:10:19.427 --> 00:10:22.327
Okay! He was rather small

183
00:10:22.327 --> 00:10:24.627
and was wearing gray colored clothes just like Ai's,

184
00:10:24.627 --> 00:10:27.227
with the number 2 on the back!

185
00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:29.227
Then, Officer Chiba,

186
00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:33.027
will you line up with the members of the basketball club?

187
00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:34.127
Okay.

188
00:10:34.127 --> 00:10:37.127
Officer Chiba is a bit plump,

189
00:10:37.127 --> 00:10:41.027
and is of average height only a bit taller than Doc.

190
00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:43.427
Plump...

191
00:10:43.427 --> 00:10:47.227
See? Surrounded by tall members of the basketball club

192
00:10:47.227 --> 00:10:48.927
he looks small, doesn't he?

193
00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:51.927
Yeah. Well, true.

194
00:10:51.927 --> 00:10:55.127
The impression that you get when looking at something

195
00:10:55.127 --> 00:10:56.827
is influenced by the size of the things around you.

196
00:10:56.827 --> 00:11:00.227
So even if it's the same size, it may look different!

197
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:01.827
I see.

198
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.627
Then next...

199
00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:06.427
Officer Chiba! Will you carry Ai

200
00:11:06.427 --> 00:11:10.527
and stand behind the members of the basketball club as if hiding?

201
00:11:10.527 --> 00:11:12.227
Okay.

202
00:11:12.227 --> 00:11:13.927
Sorry.

203
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.027
Hide a little more.

204
00:11:24.527 --> 00:11:26.527
The button of Ai's clothes...

205
00:11:26.527 --> 00:11:29.127
It looks like the number 3!

206
00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:31.827
Really.

207
00:11:31.827 --> 00:11:33.727
If you hide both sides of the button,

208
00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:36.527
it looks like a number 8, too!

209
00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:37.727
The uniform of the members of the basketball club

210
00:11:37.727 --> 00:11:40.327
and Ai's clothes are both gray,

211
00:11:40.327 --> 00:11:43.827
and there are numbers everywhere, that's why it looks that way!

212
00:11:43.827 --> 00:11:47.627
But I saw a number 2, you know?

213
00:11:47.627 --> 00:11:51.427
And? So who's the perp?

214
00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:54.927
We'll have to go to the next floor to find out.

215
00:11:57.827 --> 00:11:59.627
Next, the stairs of the 5th floor

216
00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:02.127
where the camera shop that Mitsuhiko was at is!

217
00:12:05.927 --> 00:12:07.427
Is this how it was?

218
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.227
Yes! More or less so.

219
00:12:10.227 --> 00:12:13.227
Next, it's full of children's mannequins.

220
00:12:13.227 --> 00:12:16.027
There are a lot of sign stands, too.

221
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:19.827
The perp slipped through the mannequins and sign stands

222
00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:23.027
and ran down the stairs!

223
00:12:23.027 --> 00:12:26.427
I asked the department person to re-create the entire scene.

224
00:12:26.427 --> 00:12:29.427
So that it would look just like when Mitsuhiko saw the perp!

225
00:12:29.427 --> 00:12:31.027
I see.

226
00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:34.827
And? What was the characteristic of the perp that you saw, Mitsuhiko?

227
00:12:34.827 --> 00:12:37.927
He was a large built man wearing dark gray clothes,

228
00:12:37.927 --> 00:12:40.627
who ran like a man.

229
00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:44.327
Then, Officer Chiba, please line up with the mannequins!

230
00:12:44.327 --> 00:12:45.827
Well, I don't have to line up

231
00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:47.827
because it's exactly the opposite from the one before.

232
00:12:47.827 --> 00:12:49.127
If I stand in here,

233
00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:52.327
I can see that I would look to be a big person.

234
00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:53.827
Okay!

235
00:12:53.827 --> 00:12:58.527
Then, Ai, will you stand in front of that short sign stand?

236
00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:00.027
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:02.727 --> 00:13:04.727
Will this do?

238
00:13:06.027 --> 00:13:08.427
Hey, Ai's clothes sort of looks...

239
00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:10.727
It looks darker than before.

240
00:13:10.727 --> 00:13:12.327
You're right!

241
00:13:12.327 --> 00:13:15.627
The mannequins and sign stands are white of high luminosity

242
00:13:15.627 --> 00:13:18.327
so the color gray looks even darker.

243
00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:20.227
Just like the size,

244
00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:23.727
color is also influenced by the colors around it!

245
00:13:23.727 --> 00:13:27.827
This is called "luminosity contrast". Right, Dr. Agasa?

246
00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:29.127
Yeah.

247
00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:30.427
I see!

248
00:13:30.427 --> 00:13:33.927
Which means that the clothes of the perp that Mitsuhiko saw

249
00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:37.027
was more likely a darker gray.

250
00:13:37.027 --> 00:13:38.327
Yeah.

251
00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:40.427
And? Who's the perp?

252
00:13:40.427 --> 00:13:42.627
Okay, let's go on to the next step!

253
00:13:46.327 --> 00:13:48.327
Gosh.

254
00:13:59.894 --> 00:14:01.594
And finally, Ayumi!

255
00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:02.894
You saw the perp

256
00:14:02.894 --> 00:14:05.694
by the stairs of the 4th floor where the toy department is.

257
00:14:05.694 --> 00:14:07.194
After hearing from me,

258
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:09.294
the salesclerk took you to the stairs

259
00:14:09.294 --> 00:14:12.594
where you were waiting for the perp to come down, right?

260
00:14:12.594 --> 00:14:13.694
Yep!

261
00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:16.594
And? What kind of a person was the perp?

262
00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:18.894
At first, because of the light from the window,

263
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:21.794
all I could see was a dark figure of a person,

264
00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.094
but I had a feeling it was a lady!

265
00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:28.594
After that, the person came down the stairs,

266
00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:31.194
wearing light gray clothes, was about average height,

267
00:14:31.194 --> 00:14:35.194
a little taller than Dr. Agasa.

268
00:14:35.194 --> 00:14:37.594
In other words, about the height of Officer Chiba.

269
00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:40.294
Sorry to keep you waiting.

270
00:14:40.294 --> 00:14:43.194
What can we do to help you with the case?

271
00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:44.394
What?

272
00:14:44.394 --> 00:14:47.694
Can you stand surrounding her?

273
00:14:48.994 --> 00:14:50.494
Me again?

274
00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:56.994
Hey, Ai's clothes... This time...

275
00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:59.894
Looks like a lighter gray than before.

276
00:14:59.894 --> 00:15:01.494
Yes, it does, it does!

277
00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:02.994
In contrast to what you saw before,

278
00:15:02.994 --> 00:15:04.994
since the surrounding is black of low luminosity,

279
00:15:04.994 --> 00:15:08.894
the color that it is surrounded by looks lighter than it actually is!

280
00:15:10.494 --> 00:15:12.594
When Ayumi saw the perp,

281
00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:16.894
it seems he passed students who were on excursion

282
00:15:16.894 --> 00:15:20.194
so I asked the member of the basketball club

283
00:15:20.194 --> 00:15:22.694
to ask their friends to come here wearing their uniforms

284
00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:26.694
because we want help in catching the perp who stabbed a person!

285
00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:30.294
And? So, who's the perp, anyway?

286
00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:31.994
If you were to exclude from the testimonies

287
00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:34.494
the size of the person that was influenced by the surroundings,

288
00:15:34.494 --> 00:15:35.794
the number 2 that may have been mistakenly seen

289
00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:38.094
among the colors and many numbers around,

290
00:15:38.094 --> 00:15:39.994
and the testimony about the perp being a woman

291
00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:42.594
just because the witness felt that way.

292
00:15:42.594 --> 00:15:45.494
The height of the perp was about average, a little taller than Doc,

293
00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:48.294
the clothes was the same color gray as Ai's clothes,

294
00:15:48.294 --> 00:15:53.194
and someone who ran like a man, right?

295
00:15:53.194 --> 00:15:55.694
There's only one person that matches that description!

296
00:15:55.694 --> 00:15:57.794
I see!

297
00:15:57.794 --> 00:15:59.494
In other words, the perp is...

298
00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:04.894
Hey, hey. Give me a break!

299
00:16:04.894 --> 00:16:07.894
What makes me the perp?

300
00:16:07.894 --> 00:16:11.494
All you got is the vague testimonies of those brats!

301
00:16:11.494 --> 00:16:14.794
There are three testimonies that are definite.

302
00:16:14.794 --> 00:16:17.494
His height is a little taller than Dr. Agasa.

303
00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:19.394
His clothes are the same color gray as the one Ai is wearing,

304
00:16:19.394 --> 00:16:21.794
and that he walks like a man.

305
00:16:21.794 --> 00:16:25.294
The one who matches all these descriptions is nobody else

306
00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:27.594
but you, Mr. Takashi Kamaya!

307
00:16:27.594 --> 00:16:32.494
But my clothes have no number 2 on it,

308
00:16:32.494 --> 00:16:34.594
nor am I a lady!

309
00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:37.394
The brats were saying so, right?

310
00:16:37.394 --> 00:16:38.994
Brats?

311
00:16:38.994 --> 00:16:40.394
Huh?

312
00:16:40.394 --> 00:16:43.994
There's something on the sole of your left shoe, sir!

313
00:16:45.194 --> 00:16:47.294
It's just plain chewing gum!

314
00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:50.094
I stepped on it somewhere in the department store.

315
00:16:50.094 --> 00:16:53.594
Hey. There's no gum stuck on it?

316
00:16:53.594 --> 00:16:55.794
He's doing the same thing the perp did!

317
00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:56.994
What?

318
00:16:56.994 --> 00:16:58.194
Right.

319
00:16:58.194 --> 00:17:00.794
In case something gets stuck to the sole of your left shoe,

320
00:17:00.794 --> 00:17:03.994
men usually bring their shoe to the front

321
00:17:03.994 --> 00:17:05.694
and try to remove whatever is stuck with their right hand.

322
00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:10.594
Because men unlike women find it hard to bend their hips outward.

323
00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:14.094
But you couldn't use your right hand because of your sprained finger.

324
00:17:14.094 --> 00:17:15.794
That's why you bent your left leg

325
00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:18.494
in a difficult position backwards outwardly, raised it,

326
00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:21.194
and removed the gum with your left hand!

327
00:17:21.194 --> 00:17:24.394
Ayumi, who saw your silhouette against the backlight from the window,

328
00:17:24.394 --> 00:17:26.594
saw you doing this

329
00:17:26.594 --> 00:17:29.694
and intuitively thought that you were a woman!

330
00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:32.694
That's...

331
00:17:32.694 --> 00:17:35.694
Even that lady over there would do the same, right?

332
00:17:35.694 --> 00:17:38.994
Then, carry your knapsack on your back!

333
00:17:40.094 --> 00:17:42.394
Then, I think we'll be able to see

334
00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:45.894
the number that would point out the perp.

335
00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:48.394
Can't you do it?

336
00:17:48.394 --> 00:17:50.994
Fine. Like this?

337
00:17:54.194 --> 00:17:55.594
It's the number 2!

338
00:17:58.094 --> 00:18:00.594
That's the number 2 that I saw!

339
00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:03.094
-No joke? -I see.

340
00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:05.394
The "ka" of the word Beika is cut in half

341
00:18:05.394 --> 00:18:08.794
hidden by the knapsack and looks like the number 2.

342
00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:16.394
Which means that all your testimonies were correct.

343
00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:18.794
Yep.

344
00:18:18.794 --> 00:18:21.694
So, will you come to the station with me?

345
00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:23.494
Wait!

346
00:18:23.494 --> 00:18:25.994
You still don't have proof that I'm the perp.

347
00:18:25.994 --> 00:18:28.294
Inspector Megure!

348
00:18:28.294 --> 00:18:31.594
We got saliva from the suction hole of the can of helium gas!

349
00:18:31.594 --> 00:18:32.694
And?

350
00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:35.994
If we can get DNA from the saliva,

351
00:18:35.994 --> 00:18:38.394
we'll be able to specify who it belongs to.

352
00:18:39.394 --> 00:18:43.994
Which means if that DNA is yours,

353
00:18:43.994 --> 00:18:47.694
you'll give us a plausible explanation, won't you?

354
00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:50.294
Of why you used the pay phone near this department

355
00:18:50.294 --> 00:18:51.494
after changing your voice,

356
00:18:51.494 --> 00:18:54.594
called who and for what.

357
00:18:59.494 --> 00:19:02.494
I thought that he'd know who I was unless I changed my voice.

358
00:19:02.494 --> 00:19:05.594
I quit the restaurant 2 years ago,

359
00:19:05.594 --> 00:19:09.694
and yet the chef remembered who I was.

360
00:19:09.694 --> 00:19:13.894
Did you stab him because you were fired?

361
00:19:13.894 --> 00:19:17.694
Even I wouldn't stab somebody just because I was fired!

362
00:19:17.694 --> 00:19:23.894
I took my girlfriend to eat at that restaurant the other day.

363
00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:28.094
I hid the fact that I part-timed there two years ago.

364
00:19:28.094 --> 00:19:29.794
It's so surprising that you know

365
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.094
such a classy restaurant like this, Takashi!

366
00:19:32.094 --> 00:19:33.094
I may not look it

367
00:19:33.094 --> 00:19:35.494
but I'm quite knowledgeable when it comes to food, you know!

368
00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:38.594
I used to watch the chef cook.

369
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.094
I dyed my hair black and shaved

370
00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:44.194
so I didn't think he'd recognized me. That's why I called him to our table.

371
00:19:44.194 --> 00:19:47.694
The hidden ingredient you have in this marinade is honey, isn't it?

372
00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:50.694
My taste buds can't be fooled.

373
00:19:50.694 --> 00:19:52.894
But that chef...

374
00:19:52.894 --> 00:19:55.294
No, I used a small amount of jam.

375
00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:58.194
I can't tell you what kind of jam it is because that's company secret.

376
00:19:58.194 --> 00:20:00.294
What?

377
00:20:00.294 --> 00:20:01.894
But in the past...

378
00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:05.194
Yes. I used to use honey

379
00:20:05.194 --> 00:20:07.694
before to mellow out the sour taste.

380
00:20:07.694 --> 00:20:09.994
What? Aren't you...

381
00:20:09.994 --> 00:20:12.494
Mr. Kamaya who used to part-time at our restaurant?

382
00:20:12.494 --> 00:20:14.294
What? No...

383
00:20:15.894 --> 00:20:21.194
Well, I was worried that maybe I was a bit too tough on you.

384
00:20:21.194 --> 00:20:24.494
Because you were crying when you quit back then.

385
00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:29.394
No, that's...

386
00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:35.594
Because of him, she got fed up with me

387
00:20:35.594 --> 00:20:37.894
and dumped me.

388
00:20:37.894 --> 00:20:40.794
I finally got her to come back to me and yet

389
00:20:40.794 --> 00:20:43.494
all because of that Chef.

390
00:20:43.494 --> 00:20:46.294
Just because of that man...

391
00:20:46.294 --> 00:20:49.694
But I didn't intend to kill him!

392
00:20:49.694 --> 00:20:53.394
I just wanted to scare him using a knife,

393
00:20:53.394 --> 00:20:56.494
and see his terrified face!

394
00:20:56.494 --> 00:20:58.694
He's not dead.

395
00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.194
The hospital called a while ago

396
00:21:01.194 --> 00:21:02.894
and said that he regained his consciousness.

397
00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:04.194
What?

398
00:21:04.194 --> 00:21:07.794
Chef Hosogoe seems to have requested

399
00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:10.494
not to publicize the name of the person who stabbed him

400
00:21:10.494 --> 00:21:14.394
until the perp himself turns himself in.

401
00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:15.694
Because he still considers you

402
00:21:15.694 --> 00:21:17.894
a colleague who he worked together with in the past

403
00:21:17.894 --> 00:21:19.894
and shared the same kitchen.

404
00:21:21.594 --> 00:21:24.694
It's like he's disclosing who the perp is.

405
00:21:27.094 --> 00:21:29.394
You completely got him wrong.

406
00:21:29.394 --> 00:21:31.994
It's so disgusting, it's not even worth getting angry over.

407
00:22:58.994 --> 00:23:00.494
Okay, Doc.

408
00:23:00.494 --> 00:23:01.694
Isn't it about time...

409
00:23:01.694 --> 00:23:03.794
To give it to us...

410
00:23:03.794 --> 00:23:06.394
Our Christmas present?

411
00:23:08.194 --> 00:23:10.194
So you remembered, after all.

412
00:23:10.194 --> 00:23:11.994
Of course...

413
00:23:13.194 --> 00:23:18.194
I haven't given up on the Fusae brand new pouch yet either.

414
00:23:18.194 --> 00:23:21.694
Hey, Ai. That's enough joking around already.

415
00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:25.094
What?

416
00:23:26.994 --> 00:23:30.694
What's wrong? Is there anything on my face?

417
00:23:33.594 --> 00:23:34.794
You got...

418
00:23:34.794 --> 00:23:36.894
Black stuff by your eyes!

419
00:23:36.894 --> 00:23:37.894
No way!

420
00:23:37.894 --> 00:23:39.894
It's mascara, right?

421
00:23:39.894 --> 00:23:41.994
Gosh.

422
00:23:41.994 --> 00:23:45.294
I thought I removed it nice and clean in the restroom and yet.

423
00:23:45.294 --> 00:23:47.294
Ai.

424
00:23:47.294 --> 00:23:49.594
You... That face of yours...

425
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.594
"Next Episode"

426
00:23:56.594 --> 00:23:58.494
What on earth...

427
00:23:58.494 --> 00:24:00.594
Why am I in a place like this?

428
00:24:00.594 --> 00:24:02.894
I see.

429
00:24:02.894 --> 00:24:04.894
You realized this morning?

430
00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:06.394
"No Signal"

431
00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:07.894
No response?

432
00:24:07.894 --> 00:24:09.694
Safe breaker?

433
00:24:12.794 --> 00:24:14.794
Dry ice?

434
00:24:14.794 --> 00:24:17.994
Don't tell me I'm inside a coffin?

435
00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:24.294
Next Conan, "Conan Cornered in the Darkness (Part 1)"

436
00:24:25.037 --> 00:24:27.437
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:29.237
"Two-tone shoes"

438
00:24:29.237 --> 00:24:30.737
-All through this year... -We appreciate your support.

439
00:24:30.737 --> 00:24:32.037
You've got to have...

440
00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:34.137
-A really good year up ahead. -No matter what!
