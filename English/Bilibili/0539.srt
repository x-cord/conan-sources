1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.840
"Kamakura"

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.840
"10:00 am"

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.840
We'll get to see the famous temple that's surrounded

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.340
by hydrangeas right up this hill.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.640
Really, it's a beautiful sight to see!

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.040
Huh?

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.540
What the... there aren't any flowers here.

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.740
That's weird. I wonder where I went wrong.

9
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.540
Hey...

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.140
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.640
Saturday nights are for mystery.

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.840
The three brothers are unable to understand their parent's love.

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.140
Fight over an inheritance, results in an unfortunate case.

14
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:33.725
"A Fool's Inheritance"

18
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:40.125
What happened? Are you all right?

19
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.125
Over there!

20
00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:49.925
Hey you! What the heck are you doing over there?

21
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.525
Darn!

22
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:56.425
Tell me what that gunshot was about!

23
00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:58.025
Shut up!

24
00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:00.425
Get out of the way!

25
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:02.125
Hey, wait!

26
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:22.925
That's strange.

27
00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.325
The blood's already dried.

28
00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.325
It's still warm.

29
00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:30.625
Then why...

30
00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.425
What's this?

31
00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:36.225
It looks like some sort of crystalline substance.

32
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:40.725
Darn, that guy was quick, he got away.

33
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:43.425
Hey, brat. What did you find?

34
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.825
What the heck is this?

35
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:52.925
The victim is Mr. Hisaemon Yaguchi, 70 years old.

36
00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:56.425
He was the owner of this house and was quite wealthy.

37
00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:59.625
He was shot directly in the chest and died soon thereafter.

38
00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:02.025
It was the fatal shot.

39
00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.725
The weapon must be that rifle over there.

40
00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:09.325
And, you all happen to be the witness, right?

41
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:10.425
Yeah.

42
00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:12.925
Geez, what're you doing back in Kamakura again?

43
00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:14.725
Just sightseeing. Sightseeing!

44
00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:16.725
These kids said they wanted to watch the hydrangeas.

45
00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:19.025
Inspector Yokomizo, may I have a moment with you?

46
00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.225
Sorry to keep you waiting.

47
00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.625
Is it true that my dad's dead?

48
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.525
Yes. Sorry, and you are?

49
00:04:30.525 --> 00:04:32.525
I'm his oldest son, Rokurou.

50
00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.125
What's your occupation?

51
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.225
I'm a film director.

52
00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:37.725
Film director?

53
00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:40.425
Never heard of one by that name.

54
00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:44.025
Regardless, have you figured out who did it?

55
00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:47.625
Before that, at 6:00 this morning, where were you?

56
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:51.625
But it was almost 10:00 when we heard the gunshot.

57
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.825
He was killed long before that.

58
00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:55.225
Really?

59
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:58.125
Yeah, according to autopsy, his time of death is around...

60
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.225
Hey! Shut up about that!

61
00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:01.525
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:04.725
So, the time of death is around 6:00?

63
00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:07.125
Then, the gunshot we heard...

64
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.925
Was that to throw us off from the actual time of death?

65
00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:11.425
But, even so...

66
00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:13.525
I was in Tokushima.

67
00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:17.025
I went to Tokushima seeking for an interview of my new film.

68
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.125
I checked out of the hotel at about half-past 6:00.

69
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:23.625
And by the time, I made it back to Tokyo, it was already after 10:30.

70
00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.425
Oh, that's right.

71
00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.725
I also kept the stub of my air ticket.

72
00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:29.825
Here you are.

73
00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:33.525
I see.

74
00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:35.725
-Check this out. -Roger.

75
00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:39.225
By the way, did Hisaemon live here alone?

76
00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:42.425
Yeah. He used have servants here looking after him,

77
00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.725
but he laid them all off a half-year ago.

78
00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:49.825
Jeez, to think he'd go this far just to save money.

79
00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:52.425
What a stingy father he was.

80
00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:56.025
He decided not to keep servants, despite owning a large house?

81
00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:57.525
Do you have any other family members?

82
00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:59.425
Two young brothers.

83
00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:04.325
That's right, they may know something about the case.

84
00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:08.325
Well, I don't know if they'd tell the truth though.

85
00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:13.625
Hey, we know you're in there.

86
00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:15.025
Get out here right now!

87
00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:16.825
Return the money or else!

88
00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:23.025
Who're you guys?

89
00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:25.725
Bug you, or what?

90
00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:26.725
Hey!

91
00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:30.325
Our apologies, Big Boss Yokomizo.

92
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:32.425
You guys still at it?

93
00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.825
Yeah.

94
00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:36.125
-Let's get home! -What?

95
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:37.625
Just go!

96
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:43.625
Mr. Yaguchi!

97
00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.425
Mr. Akihiko Yaguchi.

98
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.925
This is the police! We want to talk to you.

99
00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:51.925
"Akihiko Yaguchi (37) Second-born Son"

100
00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:54.625
The police? What do you want?

101
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.325
Around 6:00, huh?

102
00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:02.825
I was at the family restaurant.

103
00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:05.025
To get to my dad's house from there,

104
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:08.725
it'd take about an hour even by car.

105
00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:10.825
The money it took to open this shop.

106
00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:13.825
Your father was the one who covered it, wasn't he?

107
00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:17.125
And even after that, you still received money from him.

108
00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:20.925
Until he recently refused to give you any more, isn't that right?

109
00:07:20.925 --> 00:07:22.525
Who told you that?

110
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.325
Your elder brother, Rokurou.

111
00:07:25.325 --> 00:07:28.225
That jerk, Rokurou.

112
00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:32.025
My brother's the one who relied on dad to fund his movies!

113
00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:33.425
But since he didn't give him much,

114
00:07:33.425 --> 00:07:35.825
he still had to take out loans!

115
00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:42.725
Actually, the company I ran went bankrupt recently.

116
00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.225
And my father, who had always supported me financially,

117
00:07:45.225 --> 00:07:48.325
refused to bail me out just like that.

118
00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:52.225
And, let's talk about what you did around 6:00 this morning?

119
00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:53.725
"Kimio Taguchi (32) Third-born Son" -Of course,

120
00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:56.525
I was still as sleep around 6:00.

121
00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:58.125
Really?

122
00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.125
That's true.

123
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:03.325
Actually, prior to the incident,

124
00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:07.125
there was someone who witnessed you at the scene.

125
00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:16.225
Care to explain that?

126
00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:18.225
Well... that's for... I mean...

127
00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:20.125
-Say it! -Yes.

128
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.725
I went to my father's house.

129
00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:24.225
What for?

130
00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:25.725
For the money...

131
00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:28.925
With good intentions? The early in the morning?

132
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.625
No. I tried to steal some...

133
00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:32.625
But...

134
00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:35.525
It isn't like I heard.

135
00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:37.625
I can't get this safe opened.

136
00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.125
Darn!

137
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.825
Don't move!

138
00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:43.425
Who the heck are you?

139
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.725
Kimio?

140
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.625
What a pathetic man you are!

141
00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:54.725
To think you would act like a thief.

142
00:08:54.725 --> 00:08:57.225
I just did what Akihiko asked me.

143
00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:59.325
Akihiko, you say?

144
00:08:59.325 --> 00:09:03.225
Darn it, you're forever a greenhorn!

145
00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:06.525
No! I'm not a greenhorn!

146
00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:10.525
It's the truth. Please believe me!

147
00:09:10.525 --> 00:09:13.825
After that, I went to see my brother Akihiko.

148
00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:18.225
Well? How'd it go?

149
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.225
Dad caught me stealing.

150
00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.325
You moron!

151
00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:23.925
I even worked out the plan on how to do it!

152
00:09:23.925 --> 00:09:25.025
Worked out the plan?

153
00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:26.925
What I saw wasn't what we expected at all!

154
00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:29.025
Dad's safe was so sturdy, there was no way to...

155
00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:30.225
A safe?

156
00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.025
You didn't know?

157
00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:35.825
Dad, an old fox! When'd he buy such a safe?

158
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.125
Fine. I'll do it.

159
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:40.425
-You still want to steal it? -Of course!

160
00:09:40.425 --> 00:09:43.925
I'll give you a portion of the green to shut you up.

161
00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:45.325
All right.

162
00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:47.525
If that safe is really that sturdy,

163
00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:50.625
I've gotta prepare some tools.

164
00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:55.925
That was at 6:00 this morning.

165
00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:06.225
Darn, to think you two were going to rob from dad!

166
00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:08.225
It's Akihiko who told me to do it.

167
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:09.525
Don't blame me!

168
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:10.925
But you really did!

169
00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:12.425
What? Disbanding right now?

170
00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:14.325
Be quiet!

171
00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:15.625
Akihiko,

172
00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:19.925
until 5:45 this morning, you claimed you were in a family restaurant.

173
00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:23.625
This has since been confirmed by the waitress and several customers.

174
00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:25.525
Yeah, of course.

175
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:29.725
Afterwards, you went to a discount shop nearby to buy some items?

176
00:10:30.825 --> 00:10:33.825
A crowbar, an electric drill.

177
00:10:33.825 --> 00:10:37.125
A number of witnesses confirmed this for us.

178
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:39.225
I remembered, too.

179
00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:41.425
Look at your right hand.

180
00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:44.525
This is...

181
00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:46.625
Fine, I did come to steal.

182
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.725
But I didn't kill dad!

183
00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:50.525
When I arrived, dad was already...

184
00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:53.925
What the...

185
00:10:53.925 --> 00:10:55.725
Who did this?

186
00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:57.625
But, this is my chance.

187
00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:03.725
It really was a strong safe, though.

188
00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:06.025
I tried my best and still couldn't get it open.

189
00:11:06.025 --> 00:11:08.125
And...

190
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.825
How's this?

191
00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:14.825
Then, the gunshot we heard at that time was...

192
00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:18.225
Yeah, it was me but the shotgun couldn't beat that safe.

193
00:11:18.225 --> 00:11:21.225
The time of death was around 6:00 this morning.

194
00:11:21.225 --> 00:11:22.625
At that time.

195
00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:25.825
The oldest brother, Rokurou, was in Tokushima,

196
00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:28.925
while Akihiko, the second youngest brother and Kimio, the youngest

197
00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:32.725
were at a family restaurant, an hour's drive away by car from here.

198
00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.225
Hisaemon was shot at close range.

199
00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:38.825
After seeing the culprit wielding a rifle before his eyes,

200
00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:41.325
why didn't he try to escape?

201
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:45.125
And then the white crystalline substance.

202
00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:49.325
Just what was that, anyway?

203
00:12:02.447 --> 00:12:04.047
Now then.

204
00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:06.347
Aside from the body,

205
00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:08.347
what else do you notice?

206
00:12:08.347 --> 00:12:10.547
Is something missing?

207
00:12:11.847 --> 00:12:13.347
Now that you mention it...

208
00:12:13.347 --> 00:12:14.847
Oh, yes.

209
00:12:14.847 --> 00:12:17.547
Dad's antique collections are gone!

210
00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:18.747
Yeah.

211
00:12:18.747 --> 00:12:22.047
Faugh. I'd bet it was our older brother that snatched them, right?

212
00:12:22.047 --> 00:12:23.447
What'd you say?

213
00:12:23.447 --> 00:12:27.047
I bet you stole them when you come to break into the safe!

214
00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:32.447
The victim recently discontinued financial aid for his sons.

215
00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:35.547
He also dismissed his servants six months ago.

216
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.647
And then his antiques were gone.

217
00:12:38.647 --> 00:12:39.947
Could it be...

218
00:12:39.947 --> 00:12:42.447
Then, that safe is...

219
00:12:43.947 --> 00:12:48.347
By the way, we found this item in this room.

220
00:12:48.347 --> 00:12:51.347
It appears to be a webcam.

221
00:12:51.347 --> 00:12:53.747
Who planted that thing?

222
00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:55.747
You're a pro when it comes to cameras, big bro?

223
00:12:55.747 --> 00:12:56.947
What's this?

224
00:12:56.947 --> 00:12:58.547
Are you saying I did that?

225
00:12:58.547 --> 00:12:59.847
Inspector.

226
00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:02.847
I see.

227
00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:05.847
Everyone, we've come cross further information,

228
00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:07.847
so please come back over to other room again.

229
00:13:07.847 --> 00:13:09.547
By the way, officer.

230
00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:12.047
Can you open that safe for us?

231
00:13:12.047 --> 00:13:14.247
Can you try something?

232
00:13:16.747 --> 00:13:18.647
This?

233
00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:20.147
In this position.

234
00:13:25.147 --> 00:13:27.447
-Say, Mr. officer. -What?

235
00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:30.447
Where was that stuffed eagle originally?

236
00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:33.847
Let's see. Right over there.

237
00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.847
See that dust mark?

238
00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:38.147
I think the eagle was placed here.

239
00:13:38.147 --> 00:13:42.047
And fell off while the victim was struggling with the culprit?

240
00:13:43.047 --> 00:13:46.147
Rokurou, I have received a report

241
00:13:46.147 --> 00:13:48.047
from the Tokushima Police Department.

242
00:13:48.047 --> 00:13:52.347
How was it? I was in Tokushima staying at a hotel, right?

243
00:13:52.347 --> 00:13:54.947
Well, it was witnessed that a man

244
00:13:54.947 --> 00:13:57.447
wearing a hat and sunglasses like yours was there.

245
00:13:57.447 --> 00:13:59.847
Yeah, you mean me.

246
00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:02.147
Well, how should I know?

247
00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:04.947
I heard the guest refused to remove his hat and sunglasses

248
00:14:04.947 --> 00:14:07.747
even while inside his room.

249
00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:10.147
That's because this is my trademark style.

250
00:14:10.147 --> 00:14:11.747
I don't take these off in front of people!

251
00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:13.847
But, since no one saw your face,

252
00:14:13.847 --> 00:14:17.847
we can't say that guest was you, can we?

253
00:14:17.847 --> 00:14:19.047
No way.

254
00:14:19.047 --> 00:14:22.847
Also, that guest's checkout time was until tomorrow.

255
00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:26.547
But he suddenly decided to leave this morning, I heard.

256
00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:31.147
Perhaps he already knew that Hisaemon was dead at that time.

257
00:14:31.147 --> 00:14:34.947
This morning in a haste, that must be it.

258
00:14:34.947 --> 00:14:38.147
The loans you borrowed were huge.

259
00:14:38.147 --> 00:14:41.147
However, you said you had already secured a way

260
00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:43.847
to pay off all these debits.

261
00:14:43.847 --> 00:14:46.547
-That's... -So big bro, you really did kill dad?

262
00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:47.547
Absolutely no!

263
00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:49.047
So, the person who went to Tokushima

264
00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:52.047
was a double that you hired?

265
00:14:52.047 --> 00:14:56.847
And then you used that online webcam to monitor this study.

266
00:14:56.847 --> 00:15:00.047
In order to obtain the code for the safe.

267
00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:01.447
I see.

268
00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:05.547
You saw Kimio attempt his robbery over that camera.

269
00:15:05.547 --> 00:15:07.547
And decided to kill Hisaemon

270
00:15:07.547 --> 00:15:11.947
and frame Kimio for it.

271
00:15:11.947 --> 00:15:14.147
Because even if you couldn't open the safe,

272
00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:16.047
you could inherit more this way.

273
00:15:16.047 --> 00:15:18.547
-Big bro! -I knew it.

274
00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:20.347
That's complete nonsense!

275
00:15:20.347 --> 00:15:23.547
You broke into the house this morning,

276
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:26.547
and killed Hisaemon in this study.

277
00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:29.147
Since there aren't any neighboring houses nearby,

278
00:15:29.147 --> 00:15:32.647
there was no one around to hear the gunshot.

279
00:15:32.647 --> 00:15:35.947
Then, you ordered your double to return

280
00:15:35.947 --> 00:15:38.847
and hand over the ticket stub to you.

281
00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:41.447
That way, you could appear here as if nothing happened!

282
00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:43.347
Guess right?

283
00:15:43.347 --> 00:15:46.147
No! Absolutely wrong guess!

284
00:15:46.147 --> 00:15:48.147
Where the heck are we wrong?

285
00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.447
Come right out, spit it out already!

286
00:15:54.347 --> 00:15:56.547
Dad?

287
00:15:57.747 --> 00:16:02.447
Rokurou, I advise you to tell the truth for your own-sake.

288
00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:05.347
If you don't, you'll be made the culprit by mistake.

289
00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:07.947
-What did you say? -What?

290
00:16:07.947 --> 00:16:12.047
Hisaemon's death was actually an unfortunate accident.

291
00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:14.247
Right?

292
00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:15.647
What do you mean by "accident"?

293
00:16:15.647 --> 00:16:19.847
Recall the position where the body fell.

294
00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:22.647
Judging from that position,

295
00:16:22.647 --> 00:16:24.847
when Hisaemon was shot,

296
00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:27.847
he would be standing about a foot away from the shelf,

297
00:16:27.847 --> 00:16:31.347
facing the wall.

298
00:16:31.347 --> 00:16:33.747
It isn't possible to stand in front of him

299
00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:37.247
and shoot him in the chest like that.

300
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:42.347
Also, consider the stuffed eagle that fell next to the victim's foot.

301
00:16:42.347 --> 00:16:46.447
And that branch the eagle was perched on, it was broken.

302
00:16:46.447 --> 00:16:48.547
So it was, but what does that mean?

303
00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:52.647
Rokurou, you actually witnessed the entire scene, didn't you?

304
00:16:52.647 --> 00:16:55.747
On that webcam of yours.

305
00:16:58.147 --> 00:16:59.947
Yeah, yes, it's true.

306
00:16:59.947 --> 00:17:02.647
I saw everything.

307
00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.547
Seeing is believing.

308
00:17:08.947 --> 00:17:12.447
Look. This is the truth.

309
00:17:15.947 --> 00:17:18.147
After Kimio fled,

310
00:17:18.147 --> 00:17:22.147
dad sat there like that for a while.

311
00:17:22.147 --> 00:17:23.147
What's...

312
00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:25.347
Does anything occur as attacks?

313
00:17:29.347 --> 00:17:32.747
So the trigger got tangled on the eagle's branch

314
00:17:32.747 --> 00:17:34.647
and caused the gun to misfire.

315
00:17:34.647 --> 00:17:36.847
That's correct.

316
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.747
The way dad died wasn't by murder.

317
00:17:39.747 --> 00:17:41.247
It was an accident.

318
00:17:41.247 --> 00:17:43.447
Hey you! If you had this on video all along,

319
00:17:43.447 --> 00:17:45.047
why didn't you show us earlier?

320
00:17:45.047 --> 00:17:49.547
He tried to make Akihiko and Kimio look to be murderers

321
00:17:49.547 --> 00:17:51.747
in order to keep them from getting the inheritance.

322
00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:53.847
-What? -That was why Rokurou

323
00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:56.547
hurriedly returned from Tokushima.

324
00:17:56.547 --> 00:17:59.047
Before the body was discovered.

325
00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:00.547
He planned to recover the webcam and plant fake evidence

326
00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:05.847
that would make it seem like the crime was committed by his brothers.

327
00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:10.447
But before he could, we discovered the body.

328
00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:12.747
You jerk, how could you?

329
00:18:12.747 --> 00:18:15.847
At least I proved you two innocent,

330
00:18:15.847 --> 00:18:18.147
-you should thank me! -What?

331
00:18:18.147 --> 00:18:19.947
By the way, what becomes of our share of the inheritance?

332
00:18:19.947 --> 00:18:22.847
That's right! Anyway, just get that safe open!

333
00:18:22.847 --> 00:18:25.047
For the two that act like robbers,

334
00:18:25.047 --> 00:18:27.547
I don't think you have the right to inherit anything!

335
00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:30.447
No right to inherit anything, indeed? You "Spy Camera" brat!

336
00:18:30.447 --> 00:18:31.847
You can't just keep everything yourself!

337
00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:34.247
Knock it off already!

338
00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:38.447
Have you still not figured out Hisaemon's feelings?

339
00:18:38.447 --> 00:18:40.347
Dad's feeling?

340
00:18:40.347 --> 00:18:42.647
After Kimio fled,

341
00:18:42.647 --> 00:18:48.647
he sat in front of the safe. Hisaemon wept in sorrow!

342
00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:51.447
"Wept"? Dad did?

343
00:18:51.447 --> 00:18:54.047
How could you know such a thing?

344
00:18:54.047 --> 00:18:57.547
Hisaemon's collar and chest,

345
00:18:57.547 --> 00:19:02.347
traces of a white crystalline substance was slightly found.

346
00:19:02.347 --> 00:19:05.347
That is most likely salt.

347
00:19:05.347 --> 00:19:09.547
The tears ended up drying out on his clothes.

348
00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:12.347
And left traces of salt.

349
00:19:12.347 --> 00:19:15.047
To have left salt crystals after his tear dried,

350
00:19:15.047 --> 00:19:17.747
he must have shed a lot of them, right?

351
00:19:17.747 --> 00:19:20.847
Yes. He must have cried in deep sorrow,

352
00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:23.247
and out of great embarrassment.

353
00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:25.947
He loved and pampered you all so much.

354
00:19:25.947 --> 00:19:29.947
And yet you still cannot take care of yourselves or take responsibility.

355
00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:31.747
It was due to the pampering that

356
00:19:31.747 --> 00:19:35.247
he felt he had lead you to a life of crime.

357
00:19:35.247 --> 00:19:38.147
And finally he felt hopeless

358
00:19:38.147 --> 00:19:41.947
because he could no longer financially support you.

359
00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.047
No longer support, what do you mean?

360
00:19:44.047 --> 00:19:47.547
There's nothing left in this house

361
00:19:47.547 --> 00:19:49.547
that can be considered valuable.

362
00:19:49.547 --> 00:19:51.347
That can't be!

363
00:19:51.347 --> 00:19:52.947
Think about it for a moment.

364
00:19:52.947 --> 00:19:55.747
In a house as large as this one on such a steep hill,

365
00:19:55.747 --> 00:19:57.547
would a senile 70 year-old man

366
00:19:57.547 --> 00:20:00.947
live all alone and not hire any servants to help him?

367
00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:02.447
Why do you think that is?

368
00:20:02.447 --> 00:20:06.847
No longer... that means he had no money left to hire anyone?

369
00:20:06.847 --> 00:20:08.647
He likely sold all his antiques,

370
00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:13.447
and had to mortgage his house along with the land.

371
00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:17.247
No way! What the heck is the safe for, then?

372
00:20:17.247 --> 00:20:18.947
Tell me what could possibly be in there.

373
00:20:18.947 --> 00:20:21.347
Inspector.

374
00:20:21.347 --> 00:20:22.947
We have opened the safe.

375
00:20:22.947 --> 00:20:25.047
Understand.

376
00:20:25.047 --> 00:20:27.847
Why not go see for yourself?

377
00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.947
Oh, no. It can't be.

378
00:20:32.947 --> 00:20:37.147
Why... they're all loan contracts.

379
00:20:37.847 --> 00:20:40.747
You guys mooched him off, that's why.

380
00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:42.347
Not to mention your movie production costs,

381
00:20:42.347 --> 00:20:47.047
surf shop costs, and company operation costs.

382
00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.647
Gosh!

383
00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:50.847
What do we do now?

384
00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:52.747
It's all over.

385
00:21:02.547 --> 00:21:05.247
This... could this be of you three?

386
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:06.747
Yeah.

387
00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:10.847
That's from when mom was still alive.

388
00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:14.147
That's right. It's so nostalgic.

389
00:21:32.747 --> 00:21:37.247
This photo is what Hisaemon left behind,

390
00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:40.447
his final inheritance.

391
00:21:40.447 --> 00:21:44.447
The happy memories you shared as a family.

392
00:21:44.447 --> 00:21:47.747
They're all presents in that only one photo.

393
00:21:47.747 --> 00:21:53.547
However, none of you was able to inherit that present.

394
00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:58.347
Guess not.

395
00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:01.147
Sorry, dad.

396
00:23:29.747 --> 00:23:31.547
I'm glad about our family,

397
00:23:31.547 --> 00:23:33.947
since we don't have to worry about fighting over inheritance.

398
00:23:33.947 --> 00:23:37.047
Oh, yeah, guess you're right.

399
00:23:37.047 --> 00:23:38.447
This is it.

400
00:23:38.447 --> 00:23:39.947
Dad?

401
00:23:39.947 --> 00:23:41.847
Miss.

402
00:23:41.847 --> 00:23:45.447
Please grab me all these sake bottles.

403
00:23:45.447 --> 00:23:48.447
-Yes, sir. -Hold it, dad!

404
00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:49.847
What're you doing?

405
00:23:49.847 --> 00:23:52.547
What am I doing? I'm buying sake for souvenirs.

406
00:23:52.547 --> 00:23:54.647
If it's just for a souvenir, just buy one bottle!

407
00:23:54.647 --> 00:23:57.747
-One bottle! -Don't be so stingy.

408
00:23:58.847 --> 00:24:02.347
There won't be any inheritance left at this rate.

409
00:24:05.547 --> 00:24:07.547
It could be a regular call of love?

410
00:24:07.547 --> 00:24:11.047
You sink into despair? What the hay?

411
00:24:11.047 --> 00:24:13.247
Ga? Mr. Gamou?

412
00:24:13.247 --> 00:24:15.647
Then, was it true?

413
00:24:15.647 --> 00:24:18.747
He was desperate enough to, he talked you on the phone.

414
00:24:18.747 --> 00:24:21.947
Inspector. He must be killed by someone!

415
00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:23.147
But...

416
00:24:23.147 --> 00:24:25.247
He was innocent, but I suspected him.

417
00:24:25.247 --> 00:24:28.647
By pressing him, I caused his death.

418
00:24:28.647 --> 00:24:30.147
Next Conan,

419
00:24:30.147 --> 00:24:33.846
"The Day Detective Kogoro Mouri Goes Out of Business (Part 1)"

420
00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:51.367
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:53.767
"Flashlight"

422
00:24:53.767 --> 00:24:55.667
Dad's probably going to give up being a detective.

423
00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:57.667
What's that you say? Mouri?

424
00:24:57.667 --> 00:24:58.996
Don't yell.
