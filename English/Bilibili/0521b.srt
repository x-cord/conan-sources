1
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,648
That stuff is just fairy tale.

2
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:09,348
True. The story about Death

3
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:12,448
is a story of the god of the district who protects the land

4
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:14,748
from those who dare mess around with it.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,148
A folklore that is often heard of in rural areas.

6
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:22,448
That is until a young woman died in this lake...

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,648
9 years ago.

8
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,148
Oh no.

9
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:30,048
You mean something's really inside this forest?

10
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,548
Yes.

11
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:34,848
At sundown of the 3rd day

12
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,648
after the villagers went all out searching

13
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,648
for the young woman that never came back from the forest.

14
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:42,648
A rumor started going around among the tired villagers

15
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:45,348
that she'd been punished for breaking the rule

16
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:48,048
that had been set from ancient times

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,548
by entering the forest at night and angered Death,

18
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:54,048
the guardian of the forest.

19
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:58,348
The father of the young lady who heard this rumor

20
00:00:58,348 --> 00:01:00,548
ignored all those who tried to stop him,

21
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:03,748
went into the forest just around sundown

22
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:06,448
to look for her and never came back.

23
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,448
It was two days later

24
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:12,548
that the people found the corpse of the young lady

25
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:15,648
who had slipped into the lake and drowned.

26
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:17,448
If I'm not mistaken her name was...

27
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,948
Tamako Okuda.

28
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,748
Okuda?

29
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,048
Right.

30
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,148
She was the younger sister of Makoto Okuda

31
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:27,348
who you said sent you a letter.

32
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,948
Then, the father who you mentioned

33
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,448
went into the forest to search for her was...

34
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,448
Yes. Makoto's father.

35
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,448
He hasn't been found to this day.

36
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:40,248
Maybe Makoto's father was also fell prey to Death.

37
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:43,848
But I wonder if it's credible to conclude

38
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,848
that an imaginary figure committed the crime,

39
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,948
just by the information that we have now.

40
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:51,048
I didn't believe the story at first either.

41
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,748
But...

42
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,548
I saw it.

43
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,048
I saw the white haired monster hiding on top of a tree

44
00:01:57,048 --> 00:02:00,848
inside the crimson forest at sundown,

45
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:02,648
with its teeth showing and sneering.

46
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,948
What?

47
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:09,248
Maybe you mistook a monkey or something for it.

48
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:11,248
It wasn't a monkey.

49
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,848
A person from the town office said that he saw it just last week.

50
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,948
But, it's strange?

51
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:21,448
Why would the village and his wife be killed by that monster?

52
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:23,548
Did he go into the forest at night?

53
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:25,548
The redevelopment of the village.

54
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:27,948
Mr. Hinohara was planning to build

55
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,448
a large tourist facility in the forest.

56
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:32,848
I see.

57
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,848
That's why he angered Death.

58
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,648
Yes, therefore, the plan went down the drain.

59
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:42,748
As for the hero of this village, Hinohara,

60
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,148
all he was trying to do was do something

61
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,748
about the rural exodus that was occurring in this village.

62
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:49,048
Hero?

63
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,548
You don't know?

64
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:52,048
During his younger days,

65
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,748
he was a track runner nominated as candidate

66
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:57,448
for track in the Olympics representing Japan.

67
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:01,548
I forgot what exactly he competed in.

68
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,348
But, if you'd like to, do you want to go and see

69
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:05,548
upstairs to his room on the 2nd floor?

70
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:09,148
Really.

71
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,048
He seems to have competed in many contests.

72
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,848
It doesn't say what contest it was.

73
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:18,848
How come only the medals are here?

74
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,948
I wonder if he took all the strings off?

75
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,648
It's the statue of the Deva Kings.

76
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:26,748
Let's see.

77
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,348
It's pretty heavy.

78
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:31,748
It's exquisitely well made.

79
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:34,448
But why is there only one?

80
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,948
The Deva Kings are a pair of two wrath-filled

81
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:39,848
and muscular guardians of the Buddha.

82
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:42,548
Since that's the Unzo with its mouth closed,

83
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:46,348
there would usually be an Azo with its mouth open too, right?

84
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,648
The Azo of the Nioh statue,

85
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:50,348
on the night the incident occurred,

86
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:54,848
disappeared from this house together with the jewelry of Mrs. Hinohara.

87
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:58,048
I see. The culprit stole it?

88
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:00,048
Is this expensive?

89
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:03,548
Yes, it's the masterpiece of a famous wood carver of the Edo Era,

90
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:06,848
and at present its probably no less than 5 million yen.

91
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:09,048
Five... five million?

92
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,548
Hold it. Isn't it funny?

93
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:14,248
Why'd the culprit take only one of it?

94
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,748
It's worth more if they're a pair, right?

95
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:17,848
I wonder...

96
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:21,348
That seems to have bothered Mr. Shinichi Kudo,

97
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:27,348
who came here a year ago too.

98
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:31,648
Kudo, can't you remember anything yet?

99
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:32,948
Kudo.

100
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:36,648
Ran.

101
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:40,248
-Where? -Over this way.

102
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,248
Come over to this room over here.

103
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,948
You'd be surprised.

104
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,948
Shinichi's picture?

105
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:56,948
This is a picture of when Shinichi first did an interview for a magazine.

106
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,648
How nostalgic.

107
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:01,648
It's been enlarged.

108
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:03,748
It sure is big.

109
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,648
All the cases that Shinichi solved are filed.

110
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,748
Whose room is this?

111
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:12,948
It's Makoto's room.

112
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:17,748
Makoto worshipped this high school detective you see,

113
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:20,248
that's why when he heard that Shinichi Kudo

114
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:21,348
was going to come help solve the case,

115
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,648
Makoto was really happy

116
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,948
saying that he was sure Shinichi would solve the case.

117
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:29,348
But, the conclusion he came to was that,

118
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:31,948
the village head committed a double suicide.

119
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:35,048
Makoto was really depressed too

120
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,548
because he lost his mother

121
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:37,948
who fell sick when he was little.

122
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:39,948
And now Mr. Hinohara who adopted him as his son,

123
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:44,148
when he thought that he'd be alone for life was.

124
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,248
They were a typical blood type O family.

125
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,548
He told me that Mr. and Mrs. Hinohara,

126
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,948
as well as their son, Daiki were all very pleasant,

127
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:54,648
so he felt very comfortable and that he couldn't be happier.

128
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,448
So, it's hard to believe

129
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:00,348
that the village head would do anything to hurt his wife.

130
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:02,348
But, I told myself over and over again

131
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:04,948
that I had no choice but to accept it

132
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,448
because Makoto believed that you're a renown detective.

133
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:12,548
But it turns out that the truth of the case

134
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:15,348
is not what that renown detective concluded.

135
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:16,848
The detective was wrong

136
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,748
when he said that the Mr. Hinohara

137
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:22,248
was told by the doctor that he had cancer

138
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,848
and committed double suicide in despair.

139
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:28,048
Right. Makoto tried to get in touch you

140
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:30,648
by writing letters and calling you repeatedly,

141
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,748
but he was disappointed because he couldn't get a hold of you at all.

142
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,348
He said that he even personally went to see you

143
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:37,248
to ask you to reinvestigate the case, but you weren't in.

144
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,648
Well, yes...

145
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,648
Because he shrunk and wasn't at home.

146
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,948
But, only now you come

147
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:44,748
and have amnesia to make things worse?

148
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:46,148
You got to be kidding.

149
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,548
I want to be alone.

150
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:54,248
Would you please let me stay in this room alone for a while?

151
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,848
I feel as if I can maybe remember something.

152
00:06:58,148 --> 00:06:59,748
Okay.

153
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:01,948
Well leave you alone for a while then.

154
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,948
Take your time and try to remember, okay?

155
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:20,148
Which means that the village head's son, Daiki

156
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,348
is staying with you Mr. Shiroyama?

157
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:26,948
Yes, Makoto was doing likewise till six months ago too.

158
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:30,448
You know, it's been bothering me from a while ago but...

159
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:32,648
Why is his name still Makoto Okuda?

160
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:35,348
If he was adopted by Mr. Hinohara,

161
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:37,648
wouldn't his name have been changed to Makoto Hinohara?

162
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:41,248
Yes. That's what's written on the family register.

163
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,348
But, he felt that it would be too audacious for him

164
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,148
to take after the village heads name,

165
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,348
so he used to go by his previous last name, Okuda.

166
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:50,948
Shinichi's come out.

167
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,548
And were you able to remember something?

168
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,448
Well, no need to be depressed.

169
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:02,448
I'm sure that you'll regain your memory in time.

170
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:11,848
I was wondering what kind of trick you had up sleeve,

171
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:14,848
but I guess you haven't come up with anything yet.

172
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:15,948
Trick?

173
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,048
Yes.

174
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:21,848
Mr. Kudo, I know what you're up to.

175
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:24,548
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

176
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:27,748
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

177
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:33,048
Well, if you decide to give in and confess to everything,

178
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:36,748
come to the Kotoh Inn where I'm staying.

179
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,848
If you do,

180
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:42,148
I'll write a very nice article about you in the papers

181
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,848
about the truth that you're trying to hide

182
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:48,248
the fact that you cannot speak of.

183
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:56,248
Don't tell anyone, all right.

184
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:00,648
A truth that he cannot speak of.

185
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:06,248
Gee, that newspaper reporter lady wasn't very likable.

186
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:09,148
What did she mean by know what Shinichi is up to?

187
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,348
Well, what we know for now is...

188
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:15,048
that this detective kid made a mistake deducing this case

189
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,348
which can be none other than armed robbery case

190
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,948
as forced double suicide,

191
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:22,648
as well as totally mistaking the motive for murder.

192
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:24,348
And one more thing.

193
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:25,948
Within this forest,

194
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:30,348
an unidentifiable creature or something is still here hiding.

195
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:33,348
Kazuha.

196
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:35,948
What if...

197
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:37,648
Just what if... This is just what if okay?

198
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:39,048
Yes.

199
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,748
The person you've been wanting to see and love

200
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,148
suddenly appears in front of you

201
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,248
and turns out to be amnesic.

202
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,348
What would you do, Kazuha?

203
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,548
Well...

204
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,348
I'd just break down and cry.

205
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,448
I'd be so happy to see him

206
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:59,048
and at the same time be so sad that he had forgotten all about me.

207
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,648
I'd be overwhelmed with emotion.

208
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,648
If you can't feel this way,

209
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:06,348
I'd say you don't love that person.

210
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:08,748
He'd be no more than a friend.

211
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,548
I thought so too.

212
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:11,548
No, no.

213
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:14,048
I was just talking about stupid me just now.

214
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,648
I don't feel a thing.

215
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:18,748
Only...

216
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:23,348
All I feel is that Shinichi has gone far away.

217
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:24,848
Don't worry.

218
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:28,848
Once he regains his memory, everything will return to normal.

219
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:29,948
Yes.

220
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:36,148
I wonder what's gotten into me?

221
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,148
Oh no. Rain.

222
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,748
This is bad.

223
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,048
Let's run to the inn.

224
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:48,448
Hurry, hurry.

225
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:01,548
"Okuho Inn" -What? Shinichi is not in the room?

226
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:03,148
Yes, when I got up in the morning

227
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:04,748
his side of the bed was empty.

228
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,148
Oh, no.

229
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,548
Hey.

230
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:09,748
I asked a villager just now

231
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:11,548
and he told me he saw Shinichi go into Mr. Hinohara's residence

232
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,448
early in the morning.

233
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:18,648
Don't tell me that he got his memory back?

234
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,848
Hey, Kudo!

235
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:31,548
Kudo's shoes and a woman's shoes?

236
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,348
Are you in there, Kudo?

237
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,348
There he is.

238
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:38,348
You got your memory back, right?

239
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:42,848
That's why you came here, right, Kudo?

240
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:48,148
Blood?

241
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,548
What's up?

242
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,548
You're bleeding profusely.

243
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,357
Hey, Kudo.

244
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:07,657
What's going on?

245
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,257
What happened?

246
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:11,857
I don't know.

247
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,057
My mind just went blank.

248
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:16,457
When I snapped back to myself, I was here.

249
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,357
Did I do it?

250
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:25,957
Did I... kill her?

251
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,157
She's still alive.

252
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:35,157
So you were here after all, detective kid.

253
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,057
Isn't she the newspaper reporter?

254
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,757
What happened?

255
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:44,557
She's bleeding badly.

256
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,157
Explain later.

257
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:49,057
Hurry call an ambulance and the police.

258
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:52,457
No, all you need to call is the ambulance.

259
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:54,057
Why?

260
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,857
Somebody did this to her, right?

261
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:58,857
How can you be so dense?

262
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:00,457
If we call the police with things the way they are,

263
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:04,157
the police will deem Shinichi the culprit.

264
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,757
Oh no...

265
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,257
Don't tell me that you...

266
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:10,957
Idiot. Kudo would never stab anyone.

267
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,557
This is a trap.

268
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:15,657
Somebody set it up to look as if Kudo did it.

269
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:20,757
After all there seems to be many who hate Kudo in this village.

270
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:24,957
Besides, if Kudo's taken to the police now...

271
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,057
No matter if he's innocent,

272
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,357
he'll have to be interrogated for a long period of time.

273
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:32,357
If the drug that will return his body back to a child's takes effect,

274
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:34,257
it'll be more than I can handle.

275
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:36,257
Call the ambulance, Kazuha.

276
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:39,757
Pops, bring the car here and hide Kudo, will you?

277
00:13:39,757 --> 00:13:40,757
Okay.

278
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:41,957
Yes.

279
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,457
That's the siren of an ambulance...

280
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,457
There are the sounds of police cars too.

281
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,057
It's getting closer.

282
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:51,557
Who called them?

283
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:59,057
I see.

284
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:02,957
You had doubts about a solved murder case

285
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:04,857
that occurred here a year ago,

286
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:07,457
despite having come here last night,

287
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,657
came back here again and found

288
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:12,257
newspaper reporter Ms. Misato Kawauchi,

289
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:16,257
stabbed in the stomach and lying here.

290
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,957
Yes, Detective Kogoro Mouri?

291
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,557
Yes, well I guess.

292
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:25,457
And when you came, are you sure that no one else

293
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,057
other than the victim was here?

294
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,557
Yes. Right?

295
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:30,557
Yes.

296
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,857
Well, the murder weapon is here,

297
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:35,457
so if we conduct investigation of the hardware at the entrance,

298
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,157
well probably come up with the culprit right away.

299
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,357
Hardware?

300
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:42,357
In police jargon, it means footprints.

301
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:46,557
But, how can you figure it out?

302
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:49,257
The ground is muddy from the rain all night yesterday,

303
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:51,057
so shoe prints are left on the ground.

304
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,357
The prints of the victim

305
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,957
and the culprit are left clear on the ground.

306
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:59,657
But, officer. They could be our shoe prints.

307
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:02,357
No. You all came here after the sun rose

308
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,457
and the ground more or less dried,

309
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,157
so your shoe prints are shallow.

310
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,657
We already matched your prints with those of your shoes at the entrance,

311
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,057
so there's no doubt.

312
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:14,057
What bothers me are the shoes prints of the culprit

313
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:17,057
who came here at the break of day when the ground while still wet.

314
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,357
Why did the culprit go outside from the backdoor of this house

315
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,557
after the ground dried?

316
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:25,957
Moreover, the number of people who came here

317
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,457
after the ground dried is supposed to be four,

318
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:30,557
but there are only three here.

319
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,357
What's more, the owner of the fourth shoes print also went outside

320
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:36,257
for some reason from the backdoor.

321
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:40,657
I wonder if you, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro can solve this mystery?

322
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,057
Oh, well...

323
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:43,757
I can't say anything yet.

324
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:44,957
Listen, Kudo.

325
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,257
I know it's sort of cramped in there,

326
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,657
but hang in there, okay?

327
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:49,457
Hold up for a while

328
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:51,757
until I find the real culprit and let you out of here.

329
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:56,357
The effect of the drug according to the little lady will keep

330
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:58,757
keep for 24 hours.

331
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:03,657
I've got to solve the case completely before sundown at all cost.

332
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,157
Heiji.

333
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:10,657
I can't take lying any longer.

334
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,757
She's right, Heiji.

335
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,557
I think we should tell the truth

336
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,957
and cooperate with the police in their investigation.

337
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,957
It's easy for them to say because they don't know anything.

338
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,957
Well, the situation looks really bad, though.

339
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:25,357
It seems that today the people who went to that house

340
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:28,157
before the police came, were we four,

341
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,857
the victim, Mrs. Kawauchi

342
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:33,857
and that detective kid, but no one else.

343
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:35,357
Is that true?

344
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,557
Yes.

345
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,157
The surroundings of the house was investigated with great care,

346
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:42,857
but only the shoes prints of the six, were found, I heard.

347
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,357
Shinichi's shoes are those that you bought for him

348
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:47,757
at the store of this village.

349
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,457
No matter how much we try to hide Shinichi,

350
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,457
I'm sure they'll find him right away.

351
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:53,457
A trick.

352
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:56,257
Somebody summoned the two,

353
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:58,857
drugged Shinichi putting him to sleep

354
00:16:58,857 --> 00:16:59,957
wore his clothes

355
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:01,957
and stabbed Mrs. Kawauchi in the stomach.

356
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,057
But, if so...

357
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:08,857
That somebody's shoes prints should be left here, shouldn't it?

358
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:11,957
That's why I'm saying a tricks been used.

359
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,757
There's got to be a way.

360
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,257
Wait a second.

361
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,357
The house should've been locked.

362
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,957
How'd the culprit make it inside?

363
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,657
Neither Kudo nor Mrs. Kawauchi have the key to the house, do they?

364
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,057
Right.

365
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,257
When we went there last night

366
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:30,457
the police officer called Mr. Shiroyama opened the door for us.

367
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:31,457
That's right.

368
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,357
Why'd that police officer have the key to the house?

369
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,857
I got it from Daiki.

370
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:43,057
Did anybody besides you have the key to the house?

371
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,557
I have the keys that the head of the house

372
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:48,357
and his wife had also.

373
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:52,557
If anyone else were to have the key,

374
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:56,057
it would be their foster son, Makoto.

375
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,557
But, his whereabouts are unknown.

376
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,257
Now that you mentioned it...

377
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,957
During the time that Makoto left for the city

378
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,857
to take his university exam,

379
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:08,457
they key was temporarily given to his classmate, Ms. Hikawa,

380
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:12,257
so she could help around the house.

381
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:14,457
If I remember correctly,

382
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:19,157
on the day of Makoto's university exam is when the incident occurred.

383
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:20,557
Yes.

384
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:24,557
If so, that young lady called Hikawa may be a suspect.

385
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:26,857
Well, if she had the key,

386
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,157
she could've made a spare.

387
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,557
Maybe that young lady's the one responsible

388
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:33,457
for the incident a year ago, that Kudo deduced wrongly,

389
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:36,657
as well as for the incident that occurred this morning.

390
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,157
What did he deduce wrongly?

391
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:42,157
It's true that the house was totally messed up.

392
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:43,857
But it could have been that just as Shinichi said

393
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,657
Mr. Hinohara killed his wife and after that messed the room up

394
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:50,857
to make it look like it was armed robbery.

395
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:53,757
Idiot. It seems that when the incident happened a year ago,

396
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,557
the ground was also muddy from rain,

397
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:59,557
but the only thing they found around the house

398
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,657
were the shoe prints of one person going to the road

399
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,457
from the backdoor and back.

400
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:07,657
The culprit also walked around inside the house wearing shoes.

401
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:11,357
If Mr. Hinohara wanted to make it look like armed robbery,

402
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,957
and went outside with those shoes on,

403
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:15,357
then came back to the house again,

404
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:19,057
those shoes should be somewhere in the house, right?

405
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,357
True.

406
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:23,057
If he threw his shoes out of the house

407
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,557
the police are sure to have found them already, right?

408
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:29,757
The house of the veranda is about 30 m from the lake,

409
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:31,857
so there's no way the shoes would've made it inside.

410
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:36,157
But, I'm sure that Shinichi knew of that too, no?

411
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:40,857
Yes. That's why I've been thinking all night from last night...

412
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:42,057
No, wrong.

413
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,757
Even if we were to assume that the culprit who had the key

414
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,457
was ambushing them inside.

415
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:49,557
Unless you can find a way to go in and out of the house

416
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:51,457
without leaving shoes prints behind,

417
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,757
the murder would be impossible to commit.

418
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,057
An impossible crime.

419
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,557
Impossible crime.

420
00:19:57,557 --> 00:20:01,257
A mysterious murder trick, but...

421
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:03,857
Shinichi would...

422
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:07,557
I'm sure that Shinichi would find a way.

423
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:08,757
Darn.

424
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:09,957
If Shinichi were his usual self,

425
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:11,857
we would've been able to think it out together

426
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,657
and solve it in no time.

427
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:17,257
Maybe we've got to go see Death after all.

428
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,557
Why Death?

429
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,957
Because the villager said yesterday, remember.

430
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:26,857
That he lost his memory after seeing Death in the forest.

431
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,057
And, last night

432
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,357
before going to bed

433
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,357
I heard from the clerk at the inn together with Ran

434
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:33,657
on what to do if Death's curse fell upon a person.

435
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:38,157
The clerk told us to go into the forest while the sun is still high.

436
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:45,857
When you see Death shout with all your might and call him.

437
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:48,657
And continue to pray with a heart that isn't tarnished.

438
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:51,457
Then, the curse will be lifted.

439
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,057
That is what's being said in this village.

440
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:57,757
But, there's virtually no one who actually tried it.

441
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:02,857
But, the clerk told us that the newspaper reporter lady did it.

442
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:04,157
Is that for real?

443
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:07,257
Yes. The clerk said that her daughter that she brought along with her

444
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:09,357
when she came to interview the people about the incident a year ago,

445
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:13,357
her daughter went into the forest and never came back so.

446
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,857
Hey.

447
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,157
Ran's not here.

448
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:17,457
What?

449
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,957
Don't tell me that she took that story seriously

450
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:22,557
and went into the forest?

451
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,857
Death...

452
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,757
Death.

453
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:34,857
Please.

454
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:37,757
Return Shinichi back to normal.

455
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:40,157
If you don't mind my tarnished heart and all,

456
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,057
I'll give it to you.

457
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:43,957
That's why please return Shinichi

458
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:45,957
back to the real Shinichi.

459
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,157
Please, Death.

460
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,457
There... there he is.

461
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:10,557
He's really there.

462
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:15,257
Wait...

463
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:18,257
No good. I'm so scared that I've lost my voice.

464
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:28,357
Hey, wasn't that...

465
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,257
Wasn't that Ran's voice?

466
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:31,857
Something must've happened.

467
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:35,457
-Ran! -Ran...

468
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:37,357
-Where are you? -Ran!

469
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:42,057
No good.

470
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:45,557
My whole body hurts and I can't move.

471
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:49,257
What am I doing anyway?

472
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:51,457
I come into the forest of my own initiative,

473
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,857
then fall on my own.

474
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:56,357
How stupid can I get.

475
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,757
Death.

476
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:21,157
Please... please return Shinichi...

477
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:22,957
Please return Shinichi to normal.

478
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:05,157
This place is filled with pictures

479
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:07,257
and articles of that detective kid.

480
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,657
It's treated.

481
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,357
Who could've done this?

482
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:13,257
Splattered blood of the victim on his clothes,

483
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:15,057
fingerprints on the murder weapon...

484
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:18,257
No matter how you look at it, he's the murderer, but...

485
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,957
That's true.

486
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:23,857
Because he's the killer.

487
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,357
Next Conan, a one-hour special,

488
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:31,257
"Shinichi's True Colors and Ran's Tears"

489
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:34,257

In the next episode Shinichi's memory...

492
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:39,657
And, the truth of the case is...

493
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:40,857
Don't miss it.
