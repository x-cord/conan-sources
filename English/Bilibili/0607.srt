"Principal's Office"

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.740
Ms. Kobayashi!

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.340
You talked things over with everybody after the hearing, right?

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.940
Yes, all of the lay judges

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.440
get together and discuss the case.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.440
How is it? Is the defendant guilty after all?

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440
Which decision was greater, guilty or not guilty?

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.940
Of course I can't tell you that!

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.640
Who cares? We'll keep it a secret.

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.840
I said no, and I mean no!

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.340
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi!

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.140
-Wait! -Tell us!

13
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440
What about the picture that

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.840
Ms. Kobayashi asked a question about?

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.740
Just like she said, the picture was upside down.

16
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.240
And who could've done that?

17
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.440
If that's figured out,

18
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.340
I think we'll also be able to solve the case.

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.640
I guess so.

20
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

21
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.140
Tears are the start of all dramas.

22
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.040
The truth of the case that the flower vase leads to.

23
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.440
The courtroom is shaken by the surprising sentence that is passed.

24
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:35.678
Ms. Kobayashi is chosen as a lay judge.

28
00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:38.578
The one who's going to be working for the defendant is

29
00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:41.978
Ran's mother, Attorney At Law Kisaki.

30
00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:46.478
Confronting her is Madonna Prosecutor Kujo.

31
00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:48.878
Although the defendant has a lot of evidence against him,

32
00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:51.478
Attorney at Law Kisaki manages to get around,

33
00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:55.578
and the hearing is a tie for the two women for now.

34
00:02:55.578 --> 00:03:00.478
The upside down picture that Ms. Kobayashi was concerned about,

35
00:03:00.478 --> 00:03:02.178
also concerned me.

36
00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:06.478
The picture was verified at the scene of the crime,

37
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:10.278
and an IOU agreement signed by the defendant was found.

38
00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:13.778
What an unexpected surprise evidence this was.

39
00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:16.678
However, the housekeeper,

40
00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:18.978
Hara at the victim's residence is also acting strange.

41
00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:23.478
What on earth is the outcome of the hearing going to be?

42
00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:30.678
"Courtroom Confrontation IV Lay Judge Sumiko Kobayashi (Part 2)"

43
00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:35.278
"Tokyo Detention Center"

44
00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:39.078
"Toshio Iwamatsu (35)" -What? My IOU was in the back of the picture?

45
00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:41.578
Why did you hide the fact

46
00:03:41.578 --> 00:03:43.478
that you borrowed money from Mr. Ishigaki?

47
00:03:44.778 --> 00:03:47.078
Just because I borrowed money from that guy,

48
00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:48.978
I was on the verge of losing my store

49
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.578
in exchange for paying off my debts.

50
00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:52.678
But if I told you what I thought,

51
00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:56.278
I'd be even more suspected.

52
00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.578
That's why...

53
00:03:57.578 --> 00:04:01.678
The prosecution is thinking of using the evidence

54
00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:04.078
as your motive for killing the victim.

55
00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:08.278
No, I just went to get the IOU back!

56
00:04:08.278 --> 00:04:10.978
You really haven't touched the picture?

57
00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:13.678
No, because this is the first time

58
00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.778
I'm hearing that it was hidden behind the picture.

59
00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:17.478
Please believe me!

60
00:04:17.478 --> 00:04:20.078
It's not whether I believe you or not,

61
00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:26.078
but rather, whether we can convince the lay judges or not.

62
00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:30.078
At any rate, I'll try to find a way out

63
00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:31.878
of this crisis by the next hearing.

64
00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:37.778
That's right, didn't you see a flower vase in that room?

65
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.278
What? A flower vase?

66
00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:42.878
Yeah.

67
00:04:53.478 --> 00:04:55.178
I saw a flower vase!

68
00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:57.878
So, it was there.

69
00:04:57.878 --> 00:04:59.578
"Kisaki Attorney At Law"

70
00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:02.878
My...

71
00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:04.078
Welcome back.

72
00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:06.078
Welcome back, mom.

73
00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:08.378
Ran, you're here.

74
00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:11.978
I came here together with Conan after school

75
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.378
because he says he wants to talk to you, mom.

76
00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:15.878
You mean about the flower vase

77
00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:18.278
you wanted me to ask the defendant about?

78
00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:20.678
Yes, and what did he say?

79
00:05:20.678 --> 00:05:22.678
Just as you said,

80
00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:25.178
there seems to have been a flower vase in that room, Conan.

81
00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:27.578
There is no mention of a flower vase

82
00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:29.678
on the report of the scene made by the police.

83
00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.778
It could be that someone walked off with it.

84
00:05:32.778 --> 00:05:36.478
Does the vase have something to do with the case?

85
00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:37.978
The only thing that disappeared

86
00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:40.178
from the site was not only the murder weapon.

87
00:05:40.178 --> 00:05:44.278
When the defendant saw the flower vase, where was it?

88
00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:46.078
Give me a minute.

89
00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:52.178
It fell from this shelf and rolled to about here, it seems.

90
00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:53.878
Near the door...

91
00:05:57.678 --> 00:06:00.978
Yes, this is Kisaki Law Office.

92
00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:02.278
What?

93
00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:06.378
Yes, she's here.

94
00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:07.778
Who is it?

95
00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:09.578
It's from Prosecutor Kujo.

96
00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:15.178
This is Kisaki.

97
00:06:15.178 --> 00:06:18.278
What? The murder weapon's been found?

98
00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:23.678
The pool cleaners found it at the bottom of the pool

99
00:06:23.678 --> 00:06:26.078
located in a pool at 3-Mizushima-cho.

100
00:06:26.078 --> 00:06:28.378
And as a result of forensic examination,

101
00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:31.578
"Reiko Kujo (33)" -it was found to have been

102
00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:33.478
used to commit the murder.

103
00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:37.578
How nice of you to go out of your way to tell me about it.

104
00:06:37.578 --> 00:06:41.278
But, isn't Mizushima-cho located some distance away

105
00:06:41.278 --> 00:06:43.678
from the culprit's escape route?

106
00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:47.378
The time the crime was committed seems to

107
00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:49.778
have been 15 minutes earlier than what we estimated.

108
00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:52.678
Around that time, we got a new eye-witness report

109
00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.278
a figure that looked to be Iwamatsu

110
00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:57.178
was in the vicinity of the Ishigaki residence.

111
00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:01.878
This may be the first time Ms. Kisaki

112
00:07:01.878 --> 00:07:06.078
who's had a successions of victories will experience losing a case.

113
00:07:06.078 --> 00:07:07.078
See you then.

114
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.878
You can look forward to tomorrow's hearing.

115
00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:18.078
Have they found the murder weapon?

116
00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:22.078
It seems that only evidence

117
00:07:22.078 --> 00:07:23.878
working against the defendant comes up.

118
00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:27.378
The IOU and all, are fatal evidence.

119
00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:29.578
No use brooding.

120
00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:31.278
Once we take on a client,

121
00:07:31.278 --> 00:07:35.478
it's our job to do our best for the defendant.

122
00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:36.978
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:40.778
Things are starting to get kind of tough.

124
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:44.078
I guess I'll go a bit out of my way for the sake of Ran's mom!

125
00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:48.978
"Sachie Hara (66)"

126
00:07:48.978 --> 00:07:51.978
Hey.

127
00:07:51.978 --> 00:07:54.478
Excuse me, are you from this house?

128
00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:55.778
Yes.

129
00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:59.078
We heard that the great detective Kogoro Mouri

130
00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.178
is going to help capture the real culprit of the incident

131
00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:04.278
that occurred here so we came to check the place out.

132
00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:06.178
The culprit of that case has been arrested sometime ago

133
00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:09.178
and is going through a hearing now.

134
00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:12.478
He's not the real culprit.

135
00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:15.678
What? Who said so?

136
00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:19.178
Like we just said, the great detective Kogoro Mouri!

137
00:08:19.178 --> 00:08:21.578
The culprit is another person

138
00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:24.078
who broke into the house and killed the president

139
00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:28.878
-to steal an expensive vase... -That can't be! That vase is...

140
00:08:28.878 --> 00:08:33.278
Come on, I don't know if he's a great detective or what

141
00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:34.478
but the trial is in progress right now.

142
00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:37.278
The culprit's going through a hearing.

143
00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:41.878
Are you sure she said, "That vase"?

144
00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:43.278
No mistake about it!

145
00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:45.478
Come on, it's about time you tell us.

146
00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:47.978
Did that lady steal the vase?

147
00:08:47.978 --> 00:08:50.378
Is it true that another person is the real culprit

148
00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:52.378
who committed the crime?

149
00:08:52.378 --> 00:08:54.778
You'll learn about it soon.

150
00:08:54.778 --> 00:08:57.178
I'm sure that the lady will tell us about the vase

151
00:08:57.178 --> 00:08:59.878
that disappeared from the scene.

152
00:09:16.378 --> 00:09:18.878
Is that the vase that disappeared?

153
00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:24.378
You had it on you, after all.

154
00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:33.078
Okay, so won't you tell us about it?

155
00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:36.878
"Real Estate Company President Murder Case Second Public Trial"

156

"Toru Tsukano (46)"

157
00:09:49.578 --> 00:09:51.678
The hearing will commence.

158
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:53.978
Before we call the witness,

159
00:09:53.978 --> 00:09:59.078
prosecution has submitted new evidence.

160
00:09:59.078 --> 00:10:02.678
As a result of inspecting the picture that was in question

161
00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:04.378
during the previous hearing.

162
00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:06.478
We found from inside the frame of the picture

163
00:10:06.478 --> 00:10:08.378
an IOU in the amount of three million yen.

164
00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:10.978
The borrower's name on the IOU is

165
00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:12.978
Toshio Iwamatsu.

166
00:10:15.478 --> 00:10:18.878
And the murder weapon that

167
00:10:18.878 --> 00:10:21.178
could not be found was also discovered.

168
00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:23.178
The blood that was found on it

169
00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:24.978
matched the blood of the victim.

170
00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:28.378
I know nothing of it! I don't know of that knife!

171
00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:30.978
Darn it!

172
00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:34.178
-Do you want to turn me into a murderer? -Mr. Iwamoto, please calm down!

173
00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:35.578
Darn it!

174
00:10:35.578 --> 00:10:38.878
-Order in the court! -Let me go!

175
00:10:38.878 --> 00:10:42.378
The defendant must refrain from using unruly language.

176
00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:50.878
Things look in favor of Madonna.

177
00:10:50.878 --> 00:10:53.178
What about the vase?

178
00:10:53.178 --> 00:10:54.978
This is just the beginning.

179
00:10:54.978 --> 00:10:55.978
What?

180
00:10:55.978 --> 00:10:59.678
Does the defense have any objections

181
00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.478
about using the new evidence submitted by the prosecution?

182
00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:05.278
No objection, your honor.

183
00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:06.878
However, I'd like to request cross-examination

184
00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:10.878
of housekeeper Hara once again.

185
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:12.978
What is she up to calling her out

186
00:11:12.978 --> 00:11:15.178
to the witness stand again at this point?

187
00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.978
Does the witness have any recollection

188
00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:23.678
of seeing this flower vase?

189
00:11:23.678 --> 00:11:28.178
Yes. It's the flower vase that was in Mr. Ishigaki's study.

190
00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:30.778
When did you see it?

191
00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:34.778
I'm sure it was there on the day of the incident.

192
00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.778
Before I went to clean the second floor,

193
00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:40.278
I cleaned the study room.

194
00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:42.178
So, I'm sure about it.

195
00:11:42.178 --> 00:11:44.178
What's going on?

196
00:11:44.178 --> 00:11:45.178
There was no flower vase

197
00:11:45.178 --> 00:11:47.478
among the things left behind at the scene.

198
00:11:47.478 --> 00:11:51.778
When is the next time you saw this flower vase and where?

199
00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:54.278
The following day after the incident...

200
00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:56.278
in the trash dump.

201
00:11:56.278 --> 00:11:58.978
I headed for the residence like always to start my work day,

202
00:11:58.978 --> 00:12:01.078
but the house was closed off.

203
00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:02.678
So having no other choice,

204
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:05.978
I decided to go back home...

205
00:12:05.978 --> 00:12:08.978
and found this flower vase in the trash dump.

206
00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:09.978
"Whoever dumped this, please take it back."

207
00:12:09.978 --> 00:12:11.378
"We are not collecting nonflammable garbage today."

208
00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:14.978
I wonder why it was in a place like that.

209
00:12:14.978 --> 00:12:17.678
So, you took it with you?

210
00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:22.978
I just took it with me temporarily. It's true.

211
00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:26.778
If nobody noticed, I'll bet you wanted to steal it.

212
00:12:26.778 --> 00:12:28.078
Objection!

213
00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:31.378
We are here to adjudicate a homicide case.

214
00:12:31.378 --> 00:12:34.378
The questions by the defense pertain to the suspected theft

215
00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:37.278
of the witness, and is clearly a tactic to buy time.

216
00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:39.178
Will the defense explain to the court,

217
00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:40.878
the nature of the question?

218
00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:42.578
I would like to call to the stand a man who was present

219
00:12:42.578 --> 00:12:44.278
when this vase was discovered,

220
00:12:44.278 --> 00:12:48.078
a new witness, Kogoro Mouri.

221
00:12:52.878 --> 00:12:54.878
Showtime, dad!

222
00:12:54.878 --> 00:12:56.678
How dare she introduce me as if I was just a part of the evidence

223
00:12:56.678 --> 00:12:57.778
left behind at the crime scene.

224
00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:00.378
-Pops, there dust on your suit! -What?

225
00:13:03.378 --> 00:13:05.578
Okay, off I go!

226
00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:08.978
We're counting on you, Pops!

227
00:13:18.283 --> 00:13:22.383
Please explain the connection of this flower vase to the case.

228
00:13:24.483 --> 00:13:27.283
Why did the vase disappear?

229
00:13:27.283 --> 00:13:31.183
Because the culprit hid the murder weapon knife inside it

230
00:13:31.183 --> 00:13:34.183
to remove it from the study room, the scene of the crime!

231
00:13:34.183 --> 00:13:37.083
Objection! He's only assuming.

232
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:41.783
Can you see the soiled part on the inside of the vase?

233
00:13:43.683 --> 00:13:46.683
The brownish part...

234
00:13:46.683 --> 00:13:49.083
Don't tell me it's blood!

235
00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:52.383
When I got this back from the housekeeper

236
00:13:52.383 --> 00:13:58.283
an inspiration flashed through my grayish brain cells!

237
00:13:58.283 --> 00:14:02.183
Don't tell me that you were trying to steal this vase,

238
00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:03.483
but the victim found you, so you stabbed him.

239
00:14:03.483 --> 00:14:05.283
No way!

240
00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:08.683
I didn't do such a thing!

241
00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:12.583
The stain on the inside of the vase looks like blood.

242
00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:13.883
What?

243
00:14:17.183 --> 00:14:19.583
No doubt, it's blood!

244
00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:22.283
There're stains on the bottom of the vase too!

245
00:14:24.783 --> 00:14:27.583
If you doubt my perfect deduction,

246
00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:30.583
try comparing the blood that is left on this vase

247
00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:32.783
to that of the victim's.

248
00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:34.983
Even so, you can't tell if they're blood stains

249
00:14:34.983 --> 00:14:36.583
from the murder weapon.

250
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:40.083
After stabbing the victim, the culprit hid this knife

251
00:14:40.083 --> 00:14:43.883
inside the vase and took it out of the study room.

252
00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.083
The culprit left the vase behind in the trash dump,

253
00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:49.183
took only the knife and fled!

254
00:14:49.183 --> 00:14:51.983
Why did the culprit do something as troublesome as that

255
00:14:51.983 --> 00:14:53.583
when the culprit could've fled

256
00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:55.083
along with the murder weapon to begin with?

257
00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:56.883
No, so like I was saying...

258
00:14:56.883 --> 00:14:58.483
if the blood on the knife got on his clothes,

259
00:14:58.483 --> 00:14:59.783
it would leave stains behind...

260
00:14:59.783 --> 00:15:02.083
When the defendant was arrested,

261
00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:06.283
the blood of the victim was found on his shirt sleeve and slacks.

262
00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:07.583
I wonder if he would've bothered

263
00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:09.983
to think about getting blood stains on himself?

264
00:15:09.983 --> 00:15:13.083
No, so...

265
00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:16.383
Hey! Didn't you figure out the truth?

266
00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.983
Well, you see...

267
00:15:18.983 --> 00:15:21.383
Pops, I'll take care of things from here!

268
00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:29.283
What on earth is happening?

269
00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:30.983
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

270
00:15:30.983 --> 00:15:33.183
What?

271
00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.383
The victim was stabbed to death

272
00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:37.983
before the defendant snuck into the house.

273
00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:43.383
Most probably when housekeeper Hara was vacuuming the room upstairs.

274
00:15:43.383 --> 00:15:47.383
She testified that she thought she heard noise downstairs,

275
00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:51.583
at that time, the victim was probably

276
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:55.983
killed by the culprit in the first floor study.

277
00:15:55.983 --> 00:15:57.383
The culprit probably took the picture off the wall

278
00:15:57.383 --> 00:15:59.383
and took what he was looking for away

279
00:15:59.383 --> 00:16:02.483
from behind the frame of the picture.

280
00:16:02.483 --> 00:16:06.983
However, the culprit heard a strange sound just then...

281
00:16:08.183 --> 00:16:10.683
The culprit was probably in more than in a great hurry

282
00:16:10.683 --> 00:16:12.083
because he didn't even realize

283
00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.783
he hung the picture back on upside down.

284
00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:17.783
And the person who came sneaking in

285
00:16:17.783 --> 00:16:21.483
was the defendant who came to look for his IOU.

286
00:16:21.483 --> 00:16:25.683
Then, he found President Ishigaki's corpse.

287
00:16:36.783 --> 00:16:38.583
And then there...

288
00:16:40.383 --> 00:16:43.883
Are you back?

289
00:16:43.883 --> 00:16:45.283
Mr. Ishigaki?

290
00:16:49.183 --> 00:16:52.183
Back then, the culprit hid the knife

291
00:16:52.183 --> 00:16:53.683
in the flower vase that was nearby

292
00:16:53.683 --> 00:16:56.783
and came back in as if he just got there.

293
00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:59.983
As if he just got back?

294
00:16:59.983 --> 00:17:01.883
Then the real culprit is...

295
00:17:01.883 --> 00:17:03.283
Right.

296
00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:06.683
The one who appeared in the in the study right after Ms. Hara.

297
00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:11.083
What's wrong, Ms. Hara?

298
00:17:11.083 --> 00:17:12.783
Yes.

299
00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:15.983
The culprit is you, Mr. Tsukamoto!

300
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.083
What do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

301
00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:30.283
Mr. Tsukamoto, I know everything.

302
00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:31.783
At the time the corpse was found,

303
00:17:31.783 --> 00:17:33.083
you probably touched it

304
00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:35.483
because you wanted to distract attention

305
00:17:35.483 --> 00:17:37.783
from the blood that was already on your clothes from killing the victim...

306
00:17:37.783 --> 00:17:40.783
You made Ms. Hara go and call an ambulance

307
00:17:40.783 --> 00:17:42.483
and during that time...

308
00:17:42.483 --> 00:17:45.683
you took the vase that you hid the knife inside,

309
00:17:45.683 --> 00:17:48.483
out of the study and took it with you,

310
00:17:48.483 --> 00:17:53.483
leaving it at the trash dump that is behind the house.

311
00:17:53.483 --> 00:17:56.383
After finishing interrogation at the police station,

312
00:17:56.383 --> 00:17:59.983
on your way home, you took the knife and gloves out of the vase,

313
00:17:59.983 --> 00:18:01.783
and took it home with you.

314
00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:04.583
The flower vase was supposed to be collected

315
00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:07.483
along with the trash the following day.

316
00:18:07.483 --> 00:18:09.083
However,

317
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:12.983
unfortunately, it wasn't inflammable trash collection day.

318
00:18:12.983 --> 00:18:15.183
So, the flower vase that was left at the trash dump

319
00:18:15.183 --> 00:18:18.383
was taken home by Ms. Hara.

320
00:18:18.383 --> 00:18:22.383
Moreover, since the question of the missing murder weapon

321
00:18:22.383 --> 00:18:24.183
was brought up during the first hearing,

322
00:18:24.183 --> 00:18:27.683
you rushed over to the pool in the park and disposed of it there.

323
00:18:27.683 --> 00:18:29.483
You were hoping that it would be found when they drain the water

324
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:30.783
in order to clean the pool.

325
00:18:30.783 --> 00:18:32.883
That's enough!

326
00:18:32.883 --> 00:18:36.183
Why would I have to kill my brother-in-law?

327
00:18:36.183 --> 00:18:40.583
As to that, Attorney at Law Kisaki should've checked on it.

328
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:42.483
We have testimony that as chief manager, you,

329
00:18:42.483 --> 00:18:45.383
Mr. Tsukamoto embezzled money from the company

330
00:18:45.383 --> 00:18:48.283
and was on bad terms with the victim.

331
00:18:48.283 --> 00:18:52.483
That's only a rumor! Where's the proof?

332
00:18:52.483 --> 00:18:54.183
Did you find my fingerprints on the frame

333
00:18:54.183 --> 00:18:55.483
of the picture or something?

334
00:18:55.483 --> 00:18:57.783
I'm sure not...

335
00:18:57.783 --> 00:19:00.983
because you would've been wearing gloves when committing the crime.

336
00:19:00.983 --> 00:19:02.683
See.

337
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.383
Lay judges, please make sure that

338
00:19:05.383 --> 00:19:07.683
you take that part into consideration!

339
00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:12.483
Mr. Mouri.

340
00:19:12.483 --> 00:19:15.583
But, what about when you took the gloves

341
00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:17.983
and knife out of the flower vase?

342
00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:21.683
The gloves were inside the flower vase,

343
00:19:21.683 --> 00:19:23.183
so I'm sure when you were taking them out,

344
00:19:23.183 --> 00:19:24.983
you did it with bare hands.

345
00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:28.683
I checked the inside of the flower vase just to be sure,

346
00:19:28.683 --> 00:19:29.883
and...

347
00:19:35.983 --> 00:19:38.683
just as I expected, there was...

348
00:19:38.683 --> 00:19:41.783
a bloody fingerprints.

349
00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:43.783
When you took out the gloves and knife,

350
00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:45.983
blood smeared on your fingertips.

351
00:19:45.983 --> 00:19:48.583
That's what you left behind.

352
00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:52.383
But, since you wanted to get out of there as soon as possible,

353
00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:54.383
it didn't cross your mind.

354
00:19:54.383 --> 00:19:56.183
Besides, you obviously figured that

355
00:19:56.183 --> 00:20:00.583
the trash would be collected the following day anyway.

356
00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:03.383
The one who could move the flower vase

357
00:20:03.383 --> 00:20:06.383
that was at the scene of the crime, and move it to the trash dump.

358
00:20:06.383 --> 00:20:09.283
And the owner of the blood smeared fingerprints

359
00:20:09.283 --> 00:20:13.083
left on the vase is indeed the real killer!

360
00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:17.483
I would like to formally submit this flower vase as evidence,

361
00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:20.983
Prosecution. Any objections?

362
00:20:20.983 --> 00:20:23.183
We will take the flower vase immediately to forensics

363
00:20:23.183 --> 00:20:25.083
and have them check the traces of blood

364
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:27.483
as well as the fingerprints on it.

365
00:20:27.483 --> 00:20:32.183
He's the one to blame. That greedy guy...

366
00:20:32.183 --> 00:20:35.783
He took away the deed for land that my older sister left me,

367
00:20:35.783 --> 00:20:41.083
saying it was in return for the money I embezzled!

368
00:20:41.083 --> 00:20:43.783
That's why that day when he wasn't home, I...

369
00:20:46.283 --> 00:20:48.083
I recalled hearing about a picture

370
00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:49.983
from my older sister in the past.

371
00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.583
Ishiga, what do you think you're doing?

372
00:20:54.583 --> 00:20:57.183
Ishiga, what're you doing acting like a petty thief?

373
00:20:57.183 --> 00:21:00.083
I tried to overlook things because you're my brother-in-law,

374
00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:02.283
and you go and embezzled money from the company.

375
00:21:02.283 --> 00:21:04.783
This time, you're robbing me?

376
00:21:04.783 --> 00:21:09.783
Please! That land is what my older sister gave me.

377
00:21:09.783 --> 00:21:11.283
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:21:11.283 --> 00:21:13.783
You're not getting a cent from me!

379
00:21:13.783 --> 00:21:17.183
I could just turn you into the police, you know.

380
00:21:17.183 --> 00:21:18.583
If you don't want me to do that,

381
00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:21.083
don't you ever show your face to me again!

382
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:28.383
I didn't want to give my older sister's land to him no matter what.

383
00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:31.983
Not that land!

384
00:21:35.983 --> 00:21:38.883
Regarding the murder charges against suspect Toru Tsukano,

385
00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:41.683
I would like to make preparations to press charges against him.

386
00:23:09.683 --> 00:23:12.283
Please stand beside the great Detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

387
00:23:12.283 --> 00:23:13.683
How do you feel about having asked a question

388
00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:15.583
that lead to solving the case?

389
00:23:15.583 --> 00:23:17.683
I was honestly really surprised,

390
00:23:17.683 --> 00:23:21.483
but I am delighted that I contributed to solving the case!

391
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.783
Ms. Kobayashi's become a hero.

392
00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:25.883
Not a hero but a heroine.

393
00:23:25.883 --> 00:23:29.083
No wonder she's advisor for the Youth Detective Squad!

394
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:32.283
And all she said was, "the picture is upside down".

395
00:23:32.283 --> 00:23:34.883
If there is any other need to attend a hearing,

396
00:23:34.883 --> 00:23:37.083
I will gladly take the job, so call me.

397
00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.883
I don't think that'll ever happen again.

398
00:23:45.283 --> 00:23:48.183
"Next Episode" -Talking of White Day,

399
00:23:48.183 --> 00:23:49.783
did you receive anything, Ran?

400
00:23:49.783 --> 00:23:51.983
Something in return from Shinichi...

401
00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:54.183
What?

402
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:56.383
I wonder what's going to happen?

403
00:23:56.383 --> 00:23:57.983
What? What do you mean?

404
00:23:57.983 --> 00:23:59.483
According to Sonoko,

405
00:23:59.483 --> 00:24:03.083
they do something interesting every birthday!

406
00:24:09.883 --> 00:24:15.121
Next Conan, "White Day of Betrayal (Part 1)"

407
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.510
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.310
"Sour".

409
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.710
What comes to mind when you say, bitter sweet?

410
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.710
-The taste of a kiss. -A kiss? How did you know?

411
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.964
-Just kidding -What?
