1
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.340
Mystery train?

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.440
The Bell Tree Express?

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.040
It's unthinkable that Sherry would ever ride

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.640
such a flashy idiotic train like that, though.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.740
Oh, maybe that's the very reason why she chose it, right?

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.140
The compartments in that train are all single and private.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.940
I don't think that there's a more suitable way to divert

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.540
the Organization's eyes

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.440
and flee from the Kanto district, don't you?

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.940
But, it really is hard to believe

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.840
that Sherry was living in hiding in

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.040
-a remote mountain area in Gunma. -Yes.

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.040
Bourbon who got that information

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.540
also feels the same.

15
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.840
Because she just happened to tell a third party

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.640
that she coincidentally ran into about it,

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.940
so it may not be too reliable.

18
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
But, if Sherry were to be on that train,

19
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.640
wouldn't it make a great hunting ground?

20
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640
Yeah.

21
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.940
If we can only keep her from getting off part way.

22
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.340
It's a moving steel prison.

23
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.240
We can corner her with terror as if hunting down deer,

24
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.140
then, I'm sure she'll expose herself from her side

25
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.740
before the gun.

26
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.240
I hope you understand why I went out of the way

27
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.640
to leak this information to you?

28
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.240
You don't want me to do anything

29
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.540
until the iron snake returns to its nest, right?

30
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.940
Well, I'm sure happy to hear about Sherry from your side,

31
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.840
after such a long time

32
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.340
I was worried maybe you two were getting into some girl talk

33
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
and you were showing mercy for her or something so...

34
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.740
How stupid. Just who do you think I am?

35
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240
At any rate,

36
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.040
I'll contact you again after the hunt is over.

37
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740
Yeah.

38
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.640
Okay.

39
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.740
You win.

40
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.840
I'll forget about Sherry.

41
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.740
But...

42
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.040
I'm not the one who's going to do it,

43
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.140
Bourbon is.

44
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.340
She's one person

45
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.440
that shouldn't be on this planet.

46
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.740
No offense.

47
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.840
Silver Bullet.

48
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.640
Aim for a 100% solution.

49
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.940
Clear all mysteries and codes.

50
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.740
The shadow of the Organization closes in on Haibara.

51
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.740
The departure bell echoes throughout.

52
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.240
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:14.587
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Departure)"

56
00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:19.087
"Tokyo Station"

57
00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:21.387
Fantastic!

58
00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:23.787
This is the first time I've seem a locomotive!

59
00:04:23.787 --> 00:04:25.087
Me too!

60
00:04:25.087 --> 00:04:27.187
It sure is magnificent!

61
00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:29.787
Well, it just looks to be a steam locomotive on the outside.

62
00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:31.287
The inside looks to be

63
00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:33.887
a state-of-the-art diesel locomotive, though.

64
00:04:35.287 --> 00:04:37.787
Ai, you still have a cold?

65
00:04:37.787 --> 00:04:38.787
Yes.

66
00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:41.687
You know whose virus is so persistent, you see.

67
00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:43.587
If so, you should've stayed in bed at home.

68
00:04:43.587 --> 00:04:46.487
Hey, you kids!

69
00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:48.387
You'd better be grateful to the owner

70
00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:51.287
of the Bell Tree Express, the Suzuki Financial Group!

71
00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:53.787
I specially reserved seats for you guys, get that?

72
00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:55.487
Yes, Ma'am!

73
00:04:55.487 --> 00:04:58.887
Well, unlike you guys,

74
00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:01.487
we're sitting in a sparkling first class car, though.

75
00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:04.987
Come to think of it, it's the first class car, isn't it?

76
00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:07.487
That Kid said that he be coming after next time, right?

77
00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:09.187
That's right!

78
00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:12.787
This train usually only runs once a year,

79
00:05:12.787 --> 00:05:15.887
but when Uncle Jirokichi announced that

80
00:05:15.887 --> 00:05:17.887
he would specially run it and display a gem

81
00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:19.187
called whatever,

82
00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:21.587
Kid got super interested and...

83
00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:22.587
That's why I decided to

84
00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:23.887
get on board beforehand this time,

85
00:05:23.887 --> 00:05:25.587
write him a love letter

86
00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:29.187
and hide it in the train. What do you think?

87
00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:31.387
I wonder.

88
00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:33.187
I don't think that Kid would have the time

89
00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:34.887
to get the letter though.

90
00:05:34.887 --> 00:05:38.487
Rather, Kyogoku will get angry at you, you know.

91
00:05:38.487 --> 00:05:41.187
My love for Kid is a different story.

92
00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:44.887
More than a thief like him, I'm more concerned

93
00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:46.987
about the deduction quiz that

94
00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:48.387
they always have in the train!

95
00:05:48.387 --> 00:05:50.387
Sera? What brings you here?

96
00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:51.587
You're here?

97
00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:54.487
I'm a detective! It's only natural for me to be on board.

98
00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.387
Isn't your Daddy with you?

99
00:05:57.387 --> 00:05:59.887
Huh? He was here till just a while ago.

100
00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:05.187
Well, if it isn't you, Mr. Ando... Long time no see.

101
00:06:05.187 --> 00:06:06.887
Shall I take your bags for you?

102
00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:08.987
No, thank you.

103
00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:09.987
It's an important thing that

104
00:06:09.987 --> 00:06:11.587
a client asked me to carry for him,

105
00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:13.687
and, it's pretty heavy too.

106
00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:14.687
Well, the only thing that's heavy

107
00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:16.687
is the genuine gold frame though.

108
00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:19.187
The artwork itself is fake.

109
00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:20.487
Since it has already been appraised,

110
00:06:20.487 --> 00:06:23.487
I'm taking it to a client in Nagoya.

111
00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:26.087
Huh? This is a mystery train that's headed for

112
00:06:26.087 --> 00:06:27.787
an unknown destination, you know?

113
00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.687
Why are you sure it'll go to Nagoya?

114
00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:31.787
Hey.

115
00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:35.887
Conductor, how many years have you known us already?

116
00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:38.687
If we check which train has a change

117
00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:40.687
in time schedule today,

118
00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:42.687
it wouldn't be difficult to figure it out, no?

119
00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:43.987
Oh.

120
00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:46.187
The target of our intellectual excitement

121
00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:50.587
lies only in the mystery that occurs on board this train.

122
00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:53.387
Isn't that right, Ms. Sumitomo?

123
00:06:53.387 --> 00:06:55.487
Yes, Ma'am.

124
00:06:55.487 --> 00:06:58.587
Just as would be expected of all you, mystery lovers.

125
00:06:58.587 --> 00:06:59.787
I'm sorry to have under estimated you.

126
00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.487
Hey, you!

127
00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.587
What on earth's going on?

128
00:07:03.587 --> 00:07:05.387
I reserved the same room as I always do,

129
00:07:05.387 --> 00:07:06.487
in the 8th car

130
00:07:06.487 --> 00:07:08.587
where the first class rooms are,

131
00:07:08.587 --> 00:07:11.587
but why has my room been changed to the 7th car?

132
00:07:11.587 --> 00:07:13.387
I'm very sorry.

133
00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:16.787
We already informed you of that the other day.

134
00:07:16.787 --> 00:07:18.287
Due to careless oversight on our part,

135
00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:20.387
there's been an overbooking.

136
00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:21.987
Therefore, we had no choice

137
00:07:21.987 --> 00:07:23.487
but to change your room.

138
00:07:23.487 --> 00:07:25.187
That room's been a favorite of mine

139
00:07:25.187 --> 00:07:26.587
and I've been reserving it every year

140
00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:28.187
since tickets have first been issued.

141
00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:30.687
Who the heck came in between and took the room?

142
00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:33.887
It's me over here.

143
00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:36.387
Well, I'm so very sorry.

144
00:07:36.387 --> 00:07:40.787
My daughter happens to be friends with the owner of this train.

145
00:07:40.787 --> 00:07:44.387
Well, no need for worry since I am on board.

146
00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:47.987
No matter what may happen on this train...

147
00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:52.187
I, the renown detective, Poirot Mouri

148
00:07:52.187 --> 00:07:55.587
will solve the case in the wink of an eye.

149
00:07:58.387 --> 00:08:01.787
Hey, Dad! Just what do you think you're doing!

150
00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:03.487
Nothing, I was just introducing myself

151
00:08:03.487 --> 00:08:05.887
to the people that are staying in car 8 with me.

152
00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:07.787
It's no smoking here.

153
00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:10.087
What's with you? Calling yourself "Poirot"?

154
00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:12.087
You're Kogoro Mouri, aren't you, Dad?

155
00:08:12.087 --> 00:08:14.387
-Oh, you heard me? -Come on!

156
00:08:14.387 --> 00:08:16.787
Everybody's waiting for you in front of car 6

157
00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:19.387
to take pictures together, before the train starts off.

158
00:08:19.387 --> 00:08:21.787
Oh, is that right?

159
00:08:21.787 --> 00:08:25.187
What's this tense atmosphere all about?

160
00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:27.587
Is it because they all found out that Pops is a detective?

161
00:08:27.587 --> 00:08:29.187
Or...

162
00:09:02.887 --> 00:09:04.487
Wow! That's awesome!

163
00:09:04.487 --> 00:09:06.787
It's passing all the stations!

164
00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:08.887
I hear that this train virtually won't stop

165
00:09:08.887 --> 00:09:10.687
until it reaches its destination.

166
00:09:10.687 --> 00:09:12.287
No joke!

167
00:09:12.287 --> 00:09:15.387
Well, it's a mystery where the final destination is, though.

168
00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:17.487
It's Nagoya.

169
00:09:17.487 --> 00:09:20.487
If you check the service status on the web,

170
00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:22.587
you can more or less make out the service planning diagram.

171
00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:25.587
What a boring thing to say when after all,

172
00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:27.187
we're all on board a mystery train.

173
00:09:27.187 --> 00:09:29.487
More than that, what bothers me is,

174
00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:30.887
the deduction quiz that is given out

175
00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:33.087
during the time this train is running.

176
00:09:33.087 --> 00:09:35.687
Rumor has it that the culprit and victim

177
00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:37.087
will be picked out at random

178
00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:38.587
from among the passengers of the train,

179
00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:39.987
and an incident occurs.

180
00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:42.387
All the other remaining passengers become detectives,

181
00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:43.987
and by the time the train reaches its final destination,

182
00:09:43.987 --> 00:09:47.387
it seems that the culprit has to be disclosed.

183
00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.787
Yes! What is it?

184
00:09:51.187 --> 00:09:52.887
Huh?

185
00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:54.587
No one's here.

186
00:09:54.587 --> 00:09:57.187
Huh? A letter?

187
00:09:59.987 --> 00:10:01.187
Congratulations.

188
00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:04.487
You've been chosen to play the role of the detective!

189
00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:06.087
An incident will occur

190
00:10:06.087 --> 00:10:08.087
in room B of car 7 in 10 minutes

191
00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:10.387
so go and investigate.

192
00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.487
Aren't all the passengers supposed to be detectives?

193
00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.787
Room B of car 7...

194
00:10:17.787 --> 00:10:20.087
Here it is! It's this room!

195
00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.687
Excuse me.

196
00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:24.187
I'm coming in.

197
00:10:24.187 --> 00:10:26.587
Idiot! Don't come in!

198
00:10:28.487 --> 00:10:32.287
Wow, looks real!

199
00:10:32.287 --> 00:10:34.287
-Let's go after him. -Aye!

200
00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:37.587
Come on, Conan and Ai too!

201
00:10:38.787 --> 00:10:41.187
Rather than being a mystery...

202
00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:43.687
This is just a game of tag.

203
00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.487
Darn, we've lost track.

204
00:10:56.487 --> 00:10:58.087
It's full of private rooms,

205
00:10:58.087 --> 00:11:00.387
so it's hard to find him once he goes into a room.

206
00:11:00.387 --> 00:11:02.587
Children?

207
00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:05.287
Is this the first time you've all boarded this train?

208
00:11:05.287 --> 00:11:06.287
Yes.

209
00:11:06.287 --> 00:11:08.787
Then, I think you should stay in your room.

210
00:11:08.787 --> 00:11:10.587
Because the deduction quiz for this time

211
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.787
will be announced from the speaker in your room.

212
00:11:12.787 --> 00:11:15.687
Huh? Hasn't the incident or anything happened yet?

213
00:11:15.687 --> 00:11:16.787
No.

214
00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:20.487
I think it'll be in an hour or so this time.

215
00:11:20.487 --> 00:11:22.787
Then, don't tell me that what happened a while ago is...

216
00:11:22.787 --> 00:11:24.487
Hey, Conan?

217
00:11:24.487 --> 00:11:25.887
Please wait!

218
00:11:25.887 --> 00:11:28.987
-Ai, come on! -Okay.

219
00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:42.787
Ai?

220
00:11:45.787 --> 00:11:48.987
Come on, Ai, let's go.

221
00:11:56.287 --> 00:11:58.987
It can't be...

222
00:12:05.087 --> 00:12:07.587
Oh, Conan, what's the matter?

223
00:12:07.587 --> 00:12:11.287
At least knock when you enter a lady's room!

224
00:12:11.287 --> 00:12:13.287
Oh, no...

225
00:12:13.287 --> 00:12:16.387
This is car number 7, right?

226
00:12:16.387 --> 00:12:19.387
Just what are you talking about? This is car number 8!

227
00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:22.787
I just came over a while ago!

228
00:12:27.787 --> 00:12:32.487
Strange. I don't think I miscounted the cars and yet...

229
00:12:32.487 --> 00:12:33.987
It can't be helped.

230
00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:34.987
Because the car numbers

231
00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.887
are written only on the body of the train,

232
00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:38.387
and moreover, the only thing written on the door

233
00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:41.687
of the rooms is one letter of the alphabet.

234
00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:46.487
How'd you do on the deduction quiz?

235
00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:50.687
Doc. Is that room, our room in car number 6?

236
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.087
Huh? Yeah. See.

237
00:12:53.087 --> 00:12:55.487
The snacks that you've all been eating till a while ago,

238
00:12:55.487 --> 00:12:56.687
are still there too.

239
00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:58.287
Hey, Conan.

240
00:12:58.287 --> 00:12:59.687
Something's strange?

241
00:12:59.687 --> 00:13:03.887
We only moved one car from car number 8 and yet...

242
00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:05.887
Car number 7...

243
00:13:05.887 --> 00:13:07.587
You mean, car number 7...

244
00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:10.487
disappeared while the train was running?

245
00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:27.779
Car number 7 disappeared?

246
00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:28.879
That's ridiculous.

247
00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.779
It was in car number 7 a while ago,

248
00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:32.779
where the man who was shot was.

249
00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.279
And we went after the culprit who shot the man,

250
00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:39.279
but lost track of him.

251
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:42.379
When we returned to car number 7 where the passenger was shot,

252
00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:44.179
it happened to be car number 8!

253
00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:46.479
Shot?

254
00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:50.879
Then why didn't you tell us conductors about it right away?

255
00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:54.179
We thought that it was the deduction quiz back then!

256
00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:56.279
At any rate, please confirm!

257
00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.279
Because car number 7 disappeared

258
00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:00.479
along with the passenger who was shot!

259
00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:04.579
If so, it's best to ask the conductors who are in each car.

260
00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:06.579
They are seated like I am,

261
00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.579
at the rear end of the corridor of the passengers' room.

262
00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.279
Well, I'm sure that you're mistaken, though.

263
00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.479
Because of the intention of the owner of this train,

264
00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:16.879
the car numbers aren't displayed

265
00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:18.379
on the inside of the train, so...

266
00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:20.579
The owner's intention?

267
00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.779
Because of this, many passengers

268
00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.479
who lose track of where their rooms are,

269
00:14:26.479 --> 00:14:29.779
keep us conductors really busy.

270
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:34.179
Excuse me. May I help you?

271
00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:35.679
So, when the bell is rung

272
00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:37.279
and the light of the room turns on,

273
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:39.179
the conductor comes to the room!

274
00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:42.179
Wow! I'm going to give it a try later on too!

275
00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:44.379
Right now, our priority is to find car number 7 that disappeared!

276
00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:47.179
-Let's go confirm! -Aye!

277
00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:53.979
Ai, are you feeling bad because of your cold?

278
00:14:53.979 --> 00:14:57.379
I'm fine because I drank medicine.

279
00:14:57.379 --> 00:14:59.379
Okay, let's go then!

280
00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:06.279
That man just now resembled that person.

281
00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.479
But, that burn...

282
00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:10.079
what's going on?

283
00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:13.479
Car number 7?

284
00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.379
Is this really car number 7?

285
00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:16.679
Yeah.

286
00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:19.879
Car number 7 has returned!

287
00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.179
But, how?

288
00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:24.479
Let's go back to room B once more then.

289
00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:26.179
Yeah.

290
00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:32.779
I'm going to open the door.

291
00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:35.879
Huh?

292
00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:38.579
You know what...

293
00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:39.879
Is this really...

294
00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.279
I said it's car number 8, didn't I?

295
00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:46.279
Go back to your room brat, and stay there!

296
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.779
Just what is going on...

297
00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.579
I wonder if that conductor's making a mistake.

298
00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:54.479
Could be... He kind of looked sleepy too, so, you know.

299
00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:56.679
Wait a sec...

300
00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:58.579
If I remember correctly, at first...

301
00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:07.579
That's...

302
00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:11.879
Hey, you.

303
00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:13.879
You know, this room...

304
00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:18.679
is really actually room B of car number 7.

305
00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:19.779
Right?

306
00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.679
Like I've been trying to tell you...

307
00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:25.079
You received it too, didn't you, Sonoko?

308
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:27.279
A card that looks like this.

309
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:30.579
And you did as was instructed on the card, right?

310
00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.879
It told you to change rooms temporarily

311
00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:34.979
with the person playing the role of the victim

312
00:16:34.979 --> 00:16:38.779
in order to confuse the detectives that came to this room.

313
00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:40.779
Am I wrong?

314
00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:43.179
Wow! Just as would be expected of you, Conan!

315
00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:44.679
Correct!

316
00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:47.679
Somebody knocked on the door, and when I opened it,

317
00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:49.479
an envelope was on the floor.

318
00:16:49.479 --> 00:16:52.479
This is what was written on the card.

319
00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:56.679
"Congratulations, you've been chosen as the accomplice!"

320
00:16:56.679 --> 00:16:58.979
The rest is just as you said, Conan.

321
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:00.379
We were instructed to liven up the deduction quiz

322
00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:02.879
by switching rooms with the person playing

323
00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:06.179
the role of the victim in room B of car number 7!

324
00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:08.779
Angry at me for being correct, eh.

325
00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:11.179
And, I happened to pass by

326
00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:13.279
just when the person playing the role of the victim

327
00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:17.279
was switching rooms with them, so I joined them!

328
00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:19.879
So, I'm sure the person playing the role of the victim

329
00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:22.479
is relaxing in car number 8 now.

330
00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:24.379
Then, where's Pops?

331
00:17:24.379 --> 00:17:26.579
He went to the dining room after being told to do so,

332
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.879
by the person playing the victim!

333
00:17:28.879 --> 00:17:30.679
The dining room?

334
00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:32.379
He was told to wait in the dining room

335
00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:35.379
because they wanted him to play the role of the detective

336
00:17:35.379 --> 00:17:37.779
that would act as commentator of this deduction quiz at the end.

337
00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:39.179
Oh...

338
00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:40.579
That's that.

339
00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:42.379
But, I guess it's nice to meet you, for the first time, isn't it?

340
00:17:42.379 --> 00:17:43.779
Huh?

341
00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:45.979
It's you, isn't it? The one called Haibara?

342
00:17:45.979 --> 00:17:47.479
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:51.779
I wanted to talk to you from before.

344
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.279
This person...

345
00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:56.479
Don't tell me that...

346
00:17:56.479 --> 00:17:57.979
It can't be.

347
00:17:57.979 --> 00:17:59.379
Who is it?

348
00:18:02.479 --> 00:18:03.779
What?

349
00:18:03.779 --> 00:18:07.479
I thought somebody was peeking through the door just now.

350
00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:09.779
I guess not.

351
00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:21.379
The food and the wine are exquisite.

352
00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:28.279
Fire burning in the field?

353
00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:47.479
You solved the mystery of the missing corpse?

354
00:18:48.879 --> 00:18:52.479
The deduction quiz this time has not been announced yet.

355
00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:54.979
But, I got a card like this!

356
00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:56.579
We did too.

357
00:18:56.579 --> 00:18:58.379
Let me see.

358
00:18:59.979 --> 00:19:01.579
It looks to be the same as the instruction card

359
00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:04.279
that is usually given out but...

360
00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:08.879
what I was told this time was not this sort of trick.

361
00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:11.279
What on earth is going on?

362
00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:13.379
I guess we have no choice but to go to the room

363
00:19:13.379 --> 00:19:14.979
of the person playing the role of the victim,

364
00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:16.579
who's in car number 8 and ask him!

365
00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:18.579
Before that, I got to go to the restroom!

366
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:21.179
I've got to go too!

367
00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:24.879
What's up, Haibara?

368
00:19:24.879 --> 00:19:28.379
This train... don't you feel a strange presence?

369
00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:30.279
A murderous-like atmosphere.

370
00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:34.879
Well, that's because you've read too many Christie novels.

371
00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:37.179
That presence

372
00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:39.779
doesn't feel to be just one or two people.

373
00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:47.779
Mr. Noto, may I help you?

374
00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:51.079
Mr. Noto! Mr. Noto?

375
00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:54.079
What is it? I didn't call you!

376
00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:55.579
Huh?

377
00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:57.879
But the bell just rung.

378
00:19:57.879 --> 00:19:59.379
Beats me.

379
00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:01.579
I tell you. You don't come when I call

380
00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:03.879
and yet you come when I don't need you.

381
00:20:03.879 --> 00:20:05.679
Oh, I'm so very sorry.

382
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.979
Oh, I'm fine.

383
00:20:07.979 --> 00:20:09.879
There seems to have been some trouble next door,

384
00:20:09.879 --> 00:20:12.679
but it seems to have been a mistake.

385
00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:15.379
All right.

386
00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:17.479
Oh, yes.

387
00:20:23.379 --> 00:20:25.179
Ms. Idenami.

388
00:20:25.179 --> 00:20:27.579
Hey, do something about it, will you?

389
00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:29.479
Do what?

390
00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:33.579
The sound... I hear strange noises in my room!

391
00:20:33.579 --> 00:20:36.079
Oh.

392
00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:38.479
I don't hear anything.

393
00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:40.479
I heard it a while ago!

394
00:20:40.479 --> 00:20:43.079
Are you implicating that I'm lying?

395
00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:45.679
No, I'd do no such thing.

396
00:20:47.979 --> 00:20:50.579
See, it's this sound. You hear it, don't you?

397
00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:52.679
Yes, ma'am. I think it's probably

398
00:20:52.679 --> 00:20:55.879
a cell phone or the like that someone forgot.

399
00:20:55.879 --> 00:20:59.279
Hey, don't come in! I'll look for it myself!

400
00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:01.079
Oh.

401
00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:02.979
What I really want to say is,

402
00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:06.779
why you didn't find that cell phone before the train started off!

403
00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:09.379
I'm very sorry.

404
00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:12.379
What's up?

405
00:21:12.379 --> 00:21:15.279
Over here! This is our room.

406
00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:17.379
Hey, sir,

407
00:21:17.379 --> 00:21:19.679
the trick's already been figured out.

408
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:22.779
Come out and explain it, will you?

409
00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:27.079
Don't tell me he fell asleep in our room.

410
00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:29.579
No joke!

411
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:33.379
Sir! Get up and unlock the chain, will you?

412
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:34.779
Hey, sir!

413
00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:35.879
What's the matter?

414
00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:38.679
He seems to be napping on the sofa.

415
00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:43.479
He's bleeding from the temple, as if he's dead.

416
00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:46.379
I'll bet it's just another part of the deduction quiz?

417
00:21:46.379 --> 00:21:48.479
Move it, will you?

418
00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:54.079
-The smell of... -Gun powder.

419
00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:56.979
Let's break the door down!

420
00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:59.579
Ready, get set, go!

421
00:22:07.479 --> 00:22:08.979
Wow!

422
00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:11.279
Another deduction quiz?

423
00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:13.179
No.

424
00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:14.679
He's really dead.

425
00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:16.279
Huh?

426
00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.979
Moreover, this is...

427
00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:26.479
A locked door murder.

428
00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:55.579
I shall splendidly see through the truth

429
00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:58.379
of this Bell Tree Express murder and solve the case!

430
00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:02.079
I just got word from Vermouth.

431
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:05.879
She says she confirmed that Sherry's on the train.

432
00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:07.379
What shall I do?

433
00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:10.279
If the Organization is really after me

434
00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:12.879
and is on board this train...

435
00:24:12.879 --> 00:24:15.179
I don't stand a chance.

436
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:16.979
Next Conan,

437
00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:21.179
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Tunnel)"

438
00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:39.079
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:40.879
"Conductor's Testimony"

440
00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.079
-Locked room. -Building blocks.

441
00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:43.179
-Hot air balloon. -Eel.

442
00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:44.279
-Scrutiny. -Locked room.

443
00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:46.179
I'm locked in and can't stop the round.
