1
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:20.670
Risa...

2
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.770
Risa Purple sure is popular, isn't she?

3
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.370
Yes, she's a charismatic underground idol.

4
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.470
Everyone adores her.

5
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.270
It's the "in" thing now to do Risa's cosplay.

6
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.470
Her charm point is this mole.

7
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.970
We've got to be grateful to Pops Kogoro for letting us come here today.

8
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.870
Right. It's all thanks to Risa asking Dad to serve as her bodyguard.

9
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.570
That's why we were specially invited here.

10
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.670
"Risa Purple (21), Idol"

11
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.570
It's like a dream come true!

12
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.270
All these people gathered here for me.

13
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.870
"Ginji Yamane (38)" -I'm glad that her fans increased

14
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.170
but as her manager, I'm worried that she may be attacked.

15
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.970
You can count on me!

16
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.570
I, Kogoro Mouri, will protect Risa with my life

17
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.970
no matter who attack her.

18
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.470
Bianca. Where were you?

19
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.070
I'm so sorry...

20
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.670
Risa!

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.070
Bianca!

22
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.370
"Bianca (26), Concert MC" -Risa, it's time for the live performance!

23
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.670
"Junichi Sakuta (34)" -Okay, Bianca! Let's go!

24
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.370
Thank you for waiting, everyone!

25
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.170
I'm your master of ceremony, Bianca.

26
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.570
Thanks for having me today.

27
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.170
Let's call Risa Purple to come on stage!

28
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.570
Three, two, one!

29
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.970
-Risa! -Risa!

30
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.370
Everybody, thanks for coming today!

31
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:20.770
Risa...

32
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.670
What the heck?

33
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970
What're you doing, Dad?

34
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.970
Risa, this way!

35
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.770
Sakuta! Turn on the light!

36
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.570
This is bad!

37
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.770
Risa Purple has been abducted!

38
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.970
Hold it!

39
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.170
Oh, that's...

40
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.270
Ran?

41
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.770
A canvas stained black with crime.

42
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.970
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

43
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.070
A contemplated abduction from a live performance hall.

44
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.370
Ran is mistakenly abducted.

45
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.170
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.470
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:05:19.828 --> 00:05:24.828
"The Great Pursuit of Enraged Kogoro (Part 1)"

49
00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:39.128
Hey! What're you going to do with my daughter?

50
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:44.828
Hold it!

51
00:05:44.828 --> 00:05:47.128
Give me back my daughter!

52
00:05:48.328 --> 00:05:50.028
Pops! Hurry!

53
00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:00.228
Brat, get off.

54
00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:03.328
I'm worried about Ran too, you know!

55
00:06:03.328 --> 00:06:06.228
You worrying about her isn't going to get us anywhere!

56
00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:08.428
Leave it to me!

57
00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:09.728
Pops, that...

58
00:06:17.928 --> 00:06:19.228
Darn!

59
00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:22.028
Pops, look!

60
00:06:22.028 --> 00:06:23.528
"Risa"

61
00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:24.528
Risa?

62
00:06:24.528 --> 00:06:29.128
I'm sure Ran wrote this message!

63
00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:32.328
So, she tried to say that they mistook her for Risa?

64
00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:36.528
No. I think it's more like a clue to who the perpetrator is.

65
00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:39.728
I'm sure the perpetrator hasn't gone that far yet.

66
00:06:39.728 --> 00:06:41.928
I won't let the perpetrator get away!

67
00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:51.428
Wait! Excuse me.

68
00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:52.428
"Recycling Shop" -Yes?

69
00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:57.828
Did you see the guys who came down from the boat boarding area over there?

70
00:06:57.828 --> 00:07:00.328
Two men and a woman.

71
00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:03.828
The woman may have been carried by a man.

72
00:07:03.828 --> 00:07:06.628
Oh, the one with the purple hair!

73
00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:08.528
Yes, that's right.

74
00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:12.028
I saw them get on a red truck and go that way.

75
00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:13.528
A red truck?

76
00:07:13.528 --> 00:07:16.228
Got it!

77
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:18.828
Please lend me your car.

78
00:07:18.828 --> 00:07:20.128
What?

79
00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:22.128
It's a kidnapping!

80
00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:24.028
It's an emergency!

81
00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:25.928
Oh, hold it.

82
00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:32.528
Pops.

83
00:07:36.528 --> 00:07:39.828
A red truck...

84
00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:49.728
So, you're saying that the perpetrator

85
00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:53.828
mistakenly kidnapped Ran instead of Risa?

86
00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:56.128
Yes. Most probably.

87
00:07:56.128 --> 00:07:57.928
The hall was pitch dark

88
00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:01.628
and Ran was dressed just like Risa.

89
00:08:01.628 --> 00:08:07.328
I also at first thought that Risa was kidnapped.

90
00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:10.828
Inspector, it seems that someone pushed the fire alarm

91
00:08:10.828 --> 00:08:13.428
and turned off the breaker too.

92
00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:20.428
Inspector, please take a look at this.

93
00:08:22.428 --> 00:08:24.628
This is the flash from a stun gun.

94
00:08:24.628 --> 00:08:25.628
A stun gun?

95
00:08:25.628 --> 00:08:26.828
Yeah.

96
00:08:26.828 --> 00:08:31.028
They probably kidnapped Ran after she passed out.

97
00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:33.528
Do you work with her agency?

98
00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:34.528
No.

99
00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:39.228
I'm the director of Beika Cable TV, Sakuta.

100
00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:42.528
I've been filming Risa at her events for the past five years

101
00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:45.428
ever since she used to be an underground idol.

102
00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:47.828
Can I have you submit this footage

103
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.228
as material for investigation to the police?

104
00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:51.728
Sure.

105
00:08:51.728 --> 00:08:56.728
But I've already sent this data to other TV stations as news material.

106
00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:58.228
Huh?

107
00:08:58.228 --> 00:09:01.128
I'm sure that it'll be aired on the news soon.

108
00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:04.128
Investigations have just started.

109
00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:07.328
It's a problem to have it publicized indiscriminately.

110
00:09:10.128 --> 00:09:11.328
Megure here.

111
00:09:11.328 --> 00:09:13.528
Where are you now, Mouri?

112
00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:15.528
I'm in the pursuit of the perpetrator now.

113
00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:16.828
What?

114
00:09:16.828 --> 00:09:18.928
It seems that the perpetrator is on a red truck

115
00:09:18.928 --> 00:09:22.828
driving along the canal heading in the direction of the clock tower.

116
00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:26.728
Okay! Along the canal in the direction of the clock tower, right?

117
00:09:26.728 --> 00:09:29.428
How's the signal from Ran's cell phone?

118
00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:30.928
No doubt about it.

119
00:09:30.928 --> 00:09:35.428
The car that Ran is on is headed towards the clock tower!

120
00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:37.128
Contact headquarters.

121
00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:41.428
Red alert on a red truck driving along the canal!

122
00:09:41.428 --> 00:09:43.328
Yes, sir!

123
00:09:43.328 --> 00:09:46.728
Inspector Megure, I left Conan behind at the boat

124
00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:48.328
that the perpetrator had abandoned,

125
00:09:48.328 --> 00:09:50.328
so please go pick him up.

126
00:09:50.328 --> 00:09:51.628
Okay!

127
00:09:51.628 --> 00:09:53.628
Conan is at the wharf!

128
00:09:53.628 --> 00:09:55.628
Will you go pick him up on the double!

129
00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.728
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:06.328
Those guys are careless enough to mistakenly kidnap Ran.

131
00:10:06.328 --> 00:10:09.428
So, I'm sure they've left some sort of clue behind.

132
00:10:13.328 --> 00:10:14.428
That's...

133
00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:25.228
Inspector. The fact is...

134
00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:29.928
we've been getting threatening calls at the office since about a week ago.

135
00:10:29.928 --> 00:10:31.828
Threatening calls?

136
00:10:31.828 --> 00:10:33.828
From one who claims to be a fan of hers,

137
00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:36.128
saying to let her free,

138
00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:39.428
or that he feels sorry for her being slave driven on such cheap pay.

139
00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:40.528
He said that if things are left as is,

140
00:10:40.528 --> 00:10:44.028
something terrible would happen at the next event.

141
00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:48.328
It sure does sound like a forewarning of what happened today.

142
00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:50.728
But that's a misunderstanding!

143
00:10:50.728 --> 00:10:53.628
I have no gripes against the agency!

144
00:10:53.628 --> 00:10:57.828
I think it's probably an illusion that a fanatic fan is holding.

145
00:10:57.828 --> 00:10:59.828
Do you have any idea who it may be?

146
00:10:59.828 --> 00:11:03.928
Yes. There's a man who's been coming to the events

147
00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:07.028
ever since Risa's debut as an underground idol.

148
00:11:07.028 --> 00:11:08.628
Come to think of it,

149
00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:11.928
there's a suspicious man who always shows up

150
00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:14.228
at her filming and handshaking events.

151
00:11:14.228 --> 00:11:16.428
A suspicious man?

152
00:11:29.128 --> 00:11:32.728
Thank you so very much for your cooperation.

153
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.428
A red truck...

154
00:11:38.428 --> 00:11:40.728
Where is it?

155
00:11:46.828 --> 00:11:48.928
Are you all right?

156
00:11:48.928 --> 00:11:52.428
Yes, I just rushed a bit too much because I might be late for work

157
00:11:55.328 --> 00:11:57.928
I didn't know he was in such a rush.

158
00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:00.128
I sort of feel bad for what I did.

159
00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:02.528
News just came in.

160
00:12:02.528 --> 00:12:06.728
Just a while ago, at the live event hall of singer idol, Risa Purple,

161
00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:09.428
a kidnapping case seems to have occurred!

162
00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.628
We received footage of just after the incident,

163
00:12:11.628 --> 00:12:14.528
so please take a look.

164
00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:15.628
It's an emergency!

165
00:12:15.628 --> 00:12:18.928
Risa Purple has been abducted.

166
00:12:20.228 --> 00:12:23.528
That man just now sure looks familiar.

167
00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.828
Stop. Please zoom in on the face of that man.

168
00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:34.628
It's this man! I'm sure about it!

169
00:12:36.128 --> 00:12:37.728
I've seen him somewhere

170
00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.228
It was that guy!

171
00:12:58.095 --> 00:13:01.895
"Takichi Takeyama (43), Recycling Shop Owner"

172
00:13:02.295 --> 00:13:03.795
It's this man!

173
00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:06.795
The suspicious man who always comes to the events!

174
00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:12.795
I'll send you the image of the suspect.

175
00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:13.995
Check on him.

176
00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:21.595
Ran.

177
00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:27.995
Then, you mean that the perpetrator

178
00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:30.595
was in the car that Mr. Mouri was driving?

179
00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:36.795
Yep. That man said that Ran's hair was purple.

180
00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:39.195
Two men and a woman.

181
00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:42.495
The woman may have been carried by a man.

182
00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:45.495
Oh, the one with the purple hair!

183
00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:47.795
Yes, that's right.

184
00:13:47.795 --> 00:13:51.695
But this was floating between the wharf and the boat

185
00:13:51.695 --> 00:13:55.195
I'm sure that it fell off when she was taken off the boat.

186
00:13:55.195 --> 00:13:59.295
If that man was an eye-witness having nothing to do with the case,

187
00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:03.895
He would never have said that the hair was purple, right?

188
00:14:03.895 --> 00:14:05.795
Amazing, Conan.

189
00:14:05.795 --> 00:14:09.295
It's all thanks to the message that Ran left behind.

190
00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:10.595
Message?

191
00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:14.395
She actually wanted to write recycling shop but...

192
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:19.395
I think she was taken off the boat before she could write it out.

193
00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:21.395
Recycling shop.

194
00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:23.995
On the bed of the recycle truck,

195
00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:26.895
I'm sure I saw a refrigerator.

196
00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:31.395
So, maybe the larger man shoved Ran in there

197
00:14:31.395 --> 00:14:34.295
and then hid in the bed of the truck himself too.

198
00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:37.795
Since Ran's mouth was probably covered with something,

199
00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:42.195
she switched on her cell phone to let us know where she was.

200
00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:46.695
I see. That's why the signal was moving towards the clock tower.

201
00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:50.295
A red truck never existed to begin with.

202
00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:52.595
Oh, Pops Kogoro!

203
00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:57.095
Pops!

204
00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:58.195
Oh, kid!

205
00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:00.795
Good news, I've figured out who the perpetrator is!

206
00:15:00.795 --> 00:15:03.195
The driver of the recycle truck, right?

207
00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:05.095
What? How did you know?

208
00:15:05.095 --> 00:15:08.895
Ran's locked up in the refrigerator that was on the bed of the truck.

209
00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:11.595
What? In the refrigerator?

210
00:15:11.595 --> 00:15:15.395
Darn! To think that Ran and the perpetrator was riding together with me

211
00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:17.795
and yet I didn't realize it.

212
00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:21.295
Mr. Mouri. We know where Ran is from the GPS.

213
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.995
Please get in the car!

214
00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:41.595
Yosaburo. Handle Risa gently, will you?

215
00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:43.395
Yes, president!

216
00:15:50.995 --> 00:15:53.295
She's not Risa!

217
00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:56.795
-What? -Who are you?

218
00:15:56.795 --> 00:15:58.095
What's with you?

219
00:15:58.095 --> 00:16:01.695
You're the ones who made the mistake.

220
00:16:01.695 --> 00:16:04.395
Who are you guys?

221
00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:17.595
That's...

222
00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:20.095
The cell phone's switched on.

223
00:16:20.095 --> 00:16:23.095
The police will find out our whereabouts.

224
00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:26.895
"Yosaburo Ihara (28)" -President, shall we...

225
00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:30.395
Yosaburo, don't tell me that you...

226
00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:33.395
I feel sorry for her, but we have no choice.

227
00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:35.795
She's seen our faces too.

228
00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:47.495
The signal from Ran's cell phone disappeared.

229
00:16:47.495 --> 00:16:48.595
What?

230
00:16:52.895 --> 00:16:56.295
Mr. Mouri. Do you know where they're headed?

231
00:16:56.295 --> 00:17:00.495
That car's bumper is hanging down and scraping the ground!

232
00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:03.895
If we follow the trace, we should get to their hideout!

233
00:17:03.895 --> 00:17:07.295
But, Mr. Mouri. Why don't you get in the car...

234
00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.195
Yes, Takagi here.

235
00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:13.495
We found out the identity of the suspect.

236
00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:16.295
Takichi Takeyama, age 43.

237
00:17:16.295 --> 00:17:18.995
President of a recycling shop.

238
00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:20.995
There's only one employee.

239
00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:25.395
His height is 190 cm and its most likely that he's an accomplice.

240
00:17:25.395 --> 00:17:28.495
His name is Yosaburo Ihara, age 28.

241
00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:30.295
I'll send you the data now.

242
00:17:30.295 --> 00:17:31.695
Got it.

243
00:17:37.295 --> 00:17:41.295
Yes, all right.

244
00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:45.795
There are a lot of requests for interviews on the case, Mr. Sakuta.

245
00:17:45.795 --> 00:17:47.895
I think you'd better hurry back.

246
00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:49.195
I guess so.

247
00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:50.995
Wait a minute, please.

248
00:17:50.995 --> 00:17:52.595
Anything more?

249
00:17:52.595 --> 00:17:55.495
There's one thing that concerns me.

250
00:17:55.495 --> 00:17:57.095
Something that concerns you?

251
00:17:57.095 --> 00:17:59.695
The fire alarm that the perpetrator pushed

252
00:17:59.695 --> 00:18:04.195
was located in the corridor leading from the hall to the room backstage.

253
00:18:04.195 --> 00:18:08.095
But that door is usually locked from the corridor side

254
00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:10.895
and cannot be entered from the hall.

255
00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:13.295
In other words,

256
00:18:13.295 --> 00:18:18.095
the perpetrator couldn't have pushed the fire alarm button.

257
00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:22.895
So you're implying that one of us pushed the button?

258
00:18:22.895 --> 00:18:24.695
No way!

259
00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:29.395
When the fire alarm went off, we were all in the hall!

260
00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:30.595
That's right.

261
00:18:30.595 --> 00:18:33.195
Right, Risa, her manager and Bianca too.

262
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.495
They're all on this camera.

263
00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:38.695
Yes, exactly.

264
00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:40.695
There's no mistake that the one who pushed the fire alarm

265
00:18:40.695 --> 00:18:43.695
is one of the perpetrators.

266
00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:47.495
However, the fact that the perpetrator was able to get into the corridor

267
00:18:47.495 --> 00:18:51.795
means the door was unlocked from inside.

268
00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:55.295
You're saying that one of us here unlocked the door?

269
00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:58.095
There's no other way to think of it.

270
00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:04.395
Is there anyone who went out to the corridor just before the live began?

271
00:19:04.395 --> 00:19:05.895
Come to think of it.

272
00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.995
I didn't get to see Mr. Yamane for a little while.

273
00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:12.695
No. I just went to make a phone call.

274
00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:15.195
I didn't unlock the door.

275
00:19:20.795 --> 00:19:22.995
So, this is the perpetrator's hideout.

276
00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:26.395
Where are you, Ran?

277
00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:27.995
I came to rescue you!

278
00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:38.595
The perpetrator is a fanatical fan of Risa Purple, right?

279
00:19:42.395 --> 00:19:45.895
Mr. Mouri. I got a call from the Inspector.

280
00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:48.995
The perpetrator is Takichi Takeyama, age 43!

281
00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:52.795
The other one he says, is probably an employee called Yosaburo Ihara.

282
00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:55.795
It's him! Taikichi Takeyama!

283
00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.395
It's the Face Net of Takichi Takeyama.

284
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:01.095
Face Net?

285
00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:03.595
Risa Shigaki?

286
00:20:03.595 --> 00:20:06.895
Risa Shigaki is Risa Purple's real name.

287
00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:11.295
It seems the perpetrator was corresponding with Risa by mail.

288
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:15.895
"Mr. Takeyama, please save me."

289
00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:21.095
"Please carry me out of the live concert hall on the day of the event"?

290
00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:25.295
"Set the fire alarm off and cause a commotion"?

291
00:20:25.295 --> 00:20:29.095
This is the blueprint of today's event hall.

292
00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:33.895
Which means that Risa Purple's the one who planned today's kidnapping

293
00:20:33.895 --> 00:20:36.195
and made Takeyama carry it out?

294
00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:37.895
That's ridiculous!

295
00:20:37.895 --> 00:20:40.095
Why would an idol and fan have to work together

296
00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:42.495
and cause such a commotion!

297
00:20:42.495 --> 00:20:46.295
Because a commotion would cause nationwide attention.

298
00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:47.595
Attention?

299
00:20:47.595 --> 00:20:52.795
It's true that this case is being aired on TV and internet repeatedly.

300
00:20:52.795 --> 00:20:55.795
Therefore, I'm sure that the name Risa Purple are now,

301
00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:58.895
is known not only to her fans but also to people all over the nation.

302
00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:02.495
It seems that Takeyama mailed her back 15 minutes ago.

303
00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:07.195
"Risa, I've mistakenly kidnapped the wrong person."

304
00:21:07.195 --> 00:21:08.995
"What shall I do?"

305
00:21:08.995 --> 00:21:12.495
If you made a mistake, just release her right away!

306
00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:15.495
"We're going to take the refrigerator to the cemetery now."

307
00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:17.695
"Please call me."

308
00:21:17.695 --> 00:21:19.895
Cemetery?

309
00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:21.995
I think the cemetery is...

310
00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:25.495
I see. The grave for TVs and computers.

311
00:21:25.495 --> 00:21:30.595
Those guys were illegally disposing recycle goods in the mountains.

312
00:21:30.595 --> 00:21:36.595
I'm sure that the plan was to set Risa free over there.

313
00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.195
If so, I'm sure then Ran would also be set free.

314
00:21:39.195 --> 00:21:42.495
No. Ran most probably won't be set free.

315
00:21:42.495 --> 00:21:43.795
On the contrary,

316
00:21:43.795 --> 00:21:45.695
it hard to believe that they would let her free

317
00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:47.895
after she's seen their faces and all.

318
00:21:47.895 --> 00:21:50.095
Those who have no set plan

319
00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:52.895
are more prone to make irrational moves on impulse.

320
00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:57.695
Even if means taking action that would threaten a person's life.

321
00:23:34.495 --> 00:23:36.995
Where am I?

322
00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:44.295
What was that? What's going on?

323
00:23:44.295 --> 00:23:45.995
I'm scared.

324
00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:48.895
Dad. Conan.

325
00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:50.195
Help me.

326
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.695
"Next Episode" -Hey, where's Ran?

327
00:23:56.695 --> 00:23:59.495
The only method we could count on vanished!

328
00:23:59.495 --> 00:24:01.195
Help...

329
00:24:01.195 --> 00:24:05.895
I'm sure my daughter means nothing to you guys.

330
00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:09.795
Although my daughter tells me nothing,

331
00:24:09.795 --> 00:24:14.095
I'm sure she's hoping for a happy future.

332
00:24:14.095 --> 00:24:16.095
You guys are trying to take that happy future

333
00:24:16.095 --> 00:24:18.395
from my daughter right this minute!

334
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:24.295
Next Conan, "The Great Pursuit of Enraged Kogoro (Part 2)"

335
00:24:24.638 --> 00:24:26.838
Next Conan's Hint:

336
00:24:26.838 --> 00:24:29.238
"Mole"

337
00:24:29.238 --> 00:24:31.138
In the next episode, Pops and I are going to take a great chance.

338
00:24:31.138 --> 00:24:33.938
-Is it a dark horse? -That's not it, is it?
