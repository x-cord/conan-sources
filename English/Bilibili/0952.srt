1
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,170
You let your guard down, Shuichi Akai.

2
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,570
I could say the same thing to you.

3
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,370
Bourbon.

4
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,970
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

5
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,570
An unbelievable pair run into each other.

7
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,870
A surprising case lies at the end of the muzzle.

8
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,270
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,270
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:55,111
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 1)"

12
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:58,411
"Nine hours earlier"

13
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:00,711
Huh?

14
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:03,211
"Mouri Detective Agency" -You were just on your way out?

15
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:04,211
Yeah.

16
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:08,311
Oh, but I brought sandwiches.

17
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:10,311
Thank you as usual.

18
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,611
I'll have them as a late night snack.

19
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,311
You can leave them here.

20
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,711
Got it.

21
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,611
I'm sure they're just leftovers from Cafe Poirot.

22
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:21,111
Dad!

23
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:22,311
Is it that obvious?

24
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,411
So, are you going out for a case?

25
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:29,111
Why do you think that?

26
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,111
Huh?

27
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:33,911
We could be going out to eat together.

28
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,011
Mr. Mouri just said he'd eat the sandwiches

29
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,611
as a late night snack.

30
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:42,611
I thought it'd be strange if you were going out to eat.

31
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,911
Well, Mr. Mouri?

32
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:47,311
Well, you're half right.

33
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,511
Some rich guy is freaking out

34
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,411
because he received a threatening letter.

35
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:56,211
I'm on my way to take these two

36
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:59,011
to talk over dinner with said rich guy.

37
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,411
I see.

38
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,611
I still have a lot to learn.

39
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:04,211
Oh, right.

40
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,411
Speaking of cases, I heard a series of murders

41
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:10,411
happened during your school trip, Ran.

42
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:12,111
Oh, yeah.

43
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,811
But, well...

44
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,411
It seems your classmate, Shinichi Kudo,

45
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:20,211
helped solved the case.

46
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,411
I guess...

47
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,411
So, where did he go afterward?

48
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,811
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,611
Our teachers told us

50
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:31,011
-not to talk about Shinichi. -I knew he'd ask

51
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,711
-I see. -about me.

52
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:38,511
But I heard from Sonoko that you often go to his house to clean.

53
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,811
Yes, sometimes.

54
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:42,711
Hey...

55
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:46,311
You should come with us to talk about the case.

56
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,011
Aren't you Pops' apprentice?

57
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,111
What? Me too?

58
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:53,211
Sure, you can come.

59
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:58,111
These sandwiches will cover the cost of your detective lesson.

60
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,711
Well, my shift for today is over.

61
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:09,011
And if you insist...

62
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:13,711
Huh?

63
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,411
Oh, no.

64
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:19,711
It seems I forgot my phone.

65
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,611
What? Where?

66
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:26,711
I think I left it by the sandwiches I brought earlier.

67
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:29,711
Amuro, did you have your phone out?

68
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,511
I received a call from an acquaintance

69
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,811
while I was delivering the sandwiches.

70
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,111
Then I'll go get it.

71
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,711
Thank you, Ran.

72
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:41,811
Geez. You're surprisingly scatterbrained.

73
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:44,011
I'm not a very good detective.

74
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:59,011
I found it, Amuro.

75
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:00,211
Thanks.

76
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,911
Thank you for getting this.

77
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,511
"Cafe Poirot" -Let's go, then.

78
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,511
So, where are we going?

79
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:14,211
It's called the Black Bunny Restaurant.

80
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,611
It's probably a trendy little restaurant.

81
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,711
Maybe it's a well-established Western restaurant.

82
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:22,811
Aren't you excited, Conan?

83
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,011
Yeah.

84
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:31,711
Hey, wait...

85
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:35,211
This isn't a normal restaurant.

86
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,211
"Black Bunnys Club"

87
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,611
It's a bunny girl club!

88
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,211
True to its name.

89
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:58,211
There are black bunnies everywhere.

90
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,311
Unbelievable.

91
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:02,311
I wouldn't have brought Conan

92
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:05,011
if I'd known it was this kind of place.

93
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:07,511
I'm fine.

94
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,611
Look. They've got rolled omelets and curry

95
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,011
and everything looks good.

96
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,211
Thank you for waiting.

97
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:18,411
You must be the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

98
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,611
"Gunzo Morooka (50)" -Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:23,511
I'm the man who contacted you, Gunzo Morooka.

100
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,611
Hello.

101
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,911
So, about this threatening letter...

102
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,211
I brought it, of course.

103
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:32,711
Fukamachi, the letter.

104
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,711
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,111
"Atsufumi Fukamachi (72), Morooka's Butler"

106
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:40,511
This is the threatening letter my master received the other day.

107
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,811
Let me take a look.

108
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,211
A threatening letter made from clippings in this day and age?

109
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:48,811
"If you want to live,"

110
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:51,611
"stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant"

111
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:55,811
Wait! Isn't this the Black Bunny Restaurant?

112
00:07:55,811 --> 00:08:00,011
Yes, so I invited a detective

113
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:03,211
to find the scoundrel trying to kill me

114
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:07,511
who is surely at this restaurant.

115
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,611
That's insane.

116
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:13,711
But there's no guarantee you'll be attacked inside the restaurant.

117
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:18,911
Yeah. I have a few bodyguards with me at all times.

118
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:20,311
If I'm going to be attacked,

119
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,411
it'll be inside this restaurant.

120
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:25,911
Why aren't your bodyguards with you right now?

121
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,911
Well, obviously...

122
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:31,511
If I brought a bunch of stern-looking men in here,

123
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,011
I'd ruin the atmosphere of the restaurant.

124
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,611
Absolutely.

125
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:39,211
Oh, Mr. Morooka!

126
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:41,011
Welcome!

127
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:44,611
"Yuri Asakura (25), Employee" -Thanks for coming back.

128
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:48,011
Ah, Yuri. I'm here for a special reason today.

129
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:51,111
Oh? You brought a girl with you?

130
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,911
And a little boy.

131
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:54,211
So cute.

132
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:56,211
Actually, these kids are...

133
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:58,911
Oh, sorry...

134
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,211
I couldn't help myself.

135
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,411
Mr. Mouri, this isn't that kind of place.

136
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,811
Excuse me.

137
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,711
Who gropes a bunny girl in front of his own daughter?

138
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,211
You'll be accused of sexual harassment.

139
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,711
I won't do it again.

140
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,411
Geez.

141
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,311
Come on, order something.

142
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:21,711
Yuri, order whatever you'd like.

143
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,811
Could I get some food, then?

144
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:26,811
I missed lunch, so I'm starving.

145
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:29,211
Of course.

146
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:30,711
Let's see...

147
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:35,711
In that case, I'd like a fruit plate, rolled omelets,

148
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,411
and sandwiches.

149
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,511
You've got quite the appetite.

150
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,811
You can touch them, but I can't?

151
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:46,411
All right. Dinner's on me tonight.

152
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:50,211
Girls, you're all welcome to order whatever you'd like.

153
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:54,111
Fukamachi, you too.

154
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,311
Let's not stand on ceremony.

155
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,411
Have a seat and drink with us.

156
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,711
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:04,111
I'm not sure where to look in this type of establishment.

158
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:07,411
He's wiping his glasses so he can stare right at them.

159
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,611
Thank you for waiting.

160
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,711
These rolled omelets look delicious.

161
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,111
Let's eat.

162
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,111
Let's see...

163
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,911
Fukamachi, could you pass the sauce?

164
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,911
Huh? What?

165
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,011
Fine, I'll get it.

166
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,011
Glasses?

167
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:31,611
Are these yours?

168
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,011
Yes, sir.

169
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:36,111
I thought I left them on the table.

170
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:40,111
In any case, I have a spare pair in the car.

171
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:41,411
I'll go get them.

172
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,811
Hold it.

173
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,011
It's too dangerous to get them without your glasses.

174
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,811
I'll get them for you.

175
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,311
Thank you.

176
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:54,311
They're in the glove box.

177
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,711
Got it.

178
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:58,311
I'll go with you.

179
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:01,311
Excuse me, coming through.

180
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,711
Yuri, thanks for the drink.

181
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:08,111
I didn't pay for it.

182
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:12,311
But everyone's drinks count as your sales

183
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,311
since Mr. Morooka ordered them.

184
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,411
Maybe you'll be first today.

185
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,811
Yeah, right.

186
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,211
"Sana Murakami (28), Employee"

187
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:26,911
No way.

188
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,411
An earthquake?

189
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,711
I'm sorry...

190
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,611
It suddenly starting ringing

191
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,211
while I was checking my messages.

192
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:38,511
Let me see that.

193
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,811
Please be careful.

194
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:51,511
That type of phone sounds an alarm

195
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:56,411
if you press the power and increase volume buttons simultaneously.

196
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:59,811
I see.

197
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:01,411
What a surprise.

198
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:03,911
I'm glad it wasn't an earthquake.

199
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,811
I'm really sorry.

200
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:07,111
It's fine.

201
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:11,611
All the bunny girls keep their phones in the backs of their outfits.

202
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:12,611
Yeah.

203
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,511
Customers call us all the time

204
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:18,411
to ask if the restaurant's crowded.

205
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:21,111
And sometimes we call them

206
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,011
to invite them to the restaurant.

207
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,011
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,511
There are spare cuffs in the changing room.

209
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:31,011
Why don't you go change yours?

210
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,611
Okay.

211
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:46,311
Hello, Mr. Adachi?

212
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,211
Hello again.

213
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:51,111
I'm sorry, but we're full right now.

214
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,111
A table should open up in about an hour.

215
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,211
Found them.

216
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,011
I found the spare glasses.

217
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:04,911
Thank you for coming with me, Mr. Mouri.

218
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:08,711
Your butler sure is clumsy.

219
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:12,511
He can be old-fashioned and stiff

220
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:16,811
but he's a very hard-working butler.

221
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:19,911
He's been employed by my recently deceased wife's family

222
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:21,711
for a long time.

223
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,411
I see.

224
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,711
Anyway, that employee...

225
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,611
Ms. Yuri, was it?

226
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,411
The two of you seem quite close.

227
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,311
Really?

228
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,111
Well, I do always ask for her.

229
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:39,511
Do you come here often?

230
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,511
No...

231
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:44,111
Actually, there's a clothing store next to this one.

232
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,811
I'll stop by to see the girls

233
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:49,011
while getting a new suit made there.

234
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,511
That's about it.

235
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,111
I see.

236
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,811
Here, Fukamachi.

237
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:56,411
Thank you, sir.

238
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,611
Huh? Where's Yuri?

239
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:02,111
She hurried off to the changing room a moment ago.

240
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,611
Oh.

241
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:08,011
But almost all the food she ordered is here.

242
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:16,011
And my deduction was exactly correct.

243
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,711
Amazing!

244
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:20,811
Are you drinking, Fukamachi?

245
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,811
Yes, some.

246
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,511
It's my fruit plate.

247
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:28,011
That looks good.

248
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:29,011
Come on.

249
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:32,811
Everyone's been waiting for you since you ordered.

250
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:34,111
Really?

251
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,811
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,711
Now eat.

253
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,811
Okay. Thanks for the food.

254
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,311
It's so good!

255
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:47,111
Is it? Let me try.

256
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,911
Let's see. My glass is...

257
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:51,911
This one.

258
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:56,511
Well? Seen anyone suspicious?

259
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,111
Not in particular.

260
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:00,711
What about you, Amuro?

261
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:03,811
I don't detect any murderous intentions.

262
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:16,511
-What? -What?

263
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,378
Yuri...

264
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:41,878
Yuri!

265
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:43,778
Are you okay, Yuri?

266
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:45,078
Hey!

267
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,278
Yuri!

268
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,478
Don't touch her!

269
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,878
Ran, call an ambulance and the police!

270
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:52,978
Okay.

271
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:57,078
But why?

272
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,378
Perhaps she got food poisoning

273
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:02,678
from the fruit she ate.

274
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,478
Food poisoning?

275
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:05,778
No way.

276
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,478
That's not it.

277
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,978
Mr. Morooka had some of that fruit too.

278
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:15,178
It's hard to believe only Ms. Yuri got food poisoning.

279
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:19,878
Ms. Yuri said she was starving since she missed lunch.

280
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,678
And food poisoning symptoms manifest

281
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:25,878
30 minutes after eating at the earliest.

282
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:31,478
I saw it in an experiment on a TV show.

283
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:34,778
Sounds like a crazy TV show.

284
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:39,178
Which means she happened to eat some fruit

285
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:43,178
that had been poisoned by someone

286
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:47,578
or someone poisoned this glass

287
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,978
she was just drinking from.

288
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:54,478
Is that right, detective?

289
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,478
Why are you asking me?

290
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,678
Why don't you ask Pops?

291
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:03,378
Yes, it's called the Black Bunny Restaurant.

292
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,978
Please come immediately.

293
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:06,978
Thank you.

294
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:09,778
Huh?

295
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,578
My wallet's missing.

296
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,978
What does it look like?

297
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:18,078
It has ginkgo leaves on it.

298
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,778
There's not much cash in it,

299
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,178
but my house key...

300
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,378
Is this it?

301
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,878
Yes, that's it.

302
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,178
Oh, good.

303
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:34,278
Thank you.

304
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:36,478
Where did you find it?

305
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,878
He said it was by the washroom.

306
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:43,578
That dark and handsome man over there.

307
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:45,878
What? Amuro?

308
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:47,778
Too bad, though.

309
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:49,178
If that were Yuri's,

310
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:50,478
I would've investigated its contents

311
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:54,778
to figure out where she's been secretly meeting Mr. Morooka.

312
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:58,378
What? Mr. Morooka and Ms. Yuri?

313
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,478
I know those two are together.

314
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:05,278
Mr. Morooka normally calls her Yuri,

315
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:07,978
but he called her informally just now.

316
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:12,078
I don't know what your relationship is with Mr. Morooka,

317
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:13,678
but you should be careful.

318
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,478
Okay.

319
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:26,678
Arsenic?

320
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:30,778
You found arsenic in Ms. Yuri's drink?

321
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:31,978
Yeah.

322
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,578
No way...

323
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:38,178
So, how's Ms. Yuri?

324
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:41,578
They've finished treating her at the hospital,

325
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,278
but she hasn't regained consciousness yet.

326
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:48,278
So do you have any idea

327
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:52,678
who might've tried to kill the victim?

328
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:55,278
No idea...

329
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:57,578
It was me.

330
00:18:57,578 --> 00:19:01,378
Someone was trying to poison me

331
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:04,578
but Yuri drank it instead.

332
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,678
-What? -What do you mean?

333
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,078
I'm the one who was being threatened.

334
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:12,378
-Threatened? -What? Threatened?

335
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:13,678
"If you want to live, stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant"

336
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:15,978
I see.

337
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:19,278
So you received this letter.

338
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:23,178
Yeah, but Yuri was poisoned instead of me.

339
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:30,278
But your glasses were totally different shapes.

340
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:31,378
What?

341
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,678
Ms. Yuri's glass was a skinny champagne glass,

342
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:37,578
and yours was a standard highball glass.

343
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:40,178
I don't think they'd mix them up.

344
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:44,278
Then Ms. Yuri really was the culprit's intended victim.

345
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,278
We can't say that for certain yet.

346
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:51,778
Ms. Yuri collapsed after returning to the table

347
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:55,478
and drinking from her glass.

348
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,178
She covered her glass with a coaster

349
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:02,378
before leaving the table.

350
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,578
It could only have been poisoned by Mr. Morooka,

351
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,878
who passed by Ms. Yuri as she held her glass

352
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:11,278
before she left the table.

353
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,078
I'll get them for you.

354
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,478
Thank you.

355
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:19,678
They're in the glove box.

356
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,178
Got it.

357
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,378
I'll go with you.

358
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:26,478
Excuse me, coming through.

359
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:31,878
Or Mr. Fukamachi, who was sitting next to her

360
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:34,878
when she placed her glass on the table

361
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:38,278
when she was startled by the phone alarm.

362
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:44,378
No way.

363
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:45,878
An earthquake?

364
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,178
I'm sorry...

365
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:52,178
It suddenly starting ringing

366
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,778
while I was checking my messages.

367
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:56,078
Let me see that.

368
00:20:56,078 --> 00:21:00,678
Or Ms. Murakami,

369
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:03,978
who spilled red wine on her white cuffs

370
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:06,678
and created a reason for her to leave the table.

371
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:09,378
And sometimes we call them

372
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,178
to invite them to the restaurant.

373
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

374
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:17,778
There are spare cuffs in the changing room.

375
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,278
Why don't you go change yours?

376
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,578
Okay.

377
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:24,378
As far as I can recall,

378
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:30,578
only those three could've poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass.

379
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:32,778
Right, Mr. Mouri?

380
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:35,678
Yeah, you're right.

381
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:38,478
He's been watching closely.

382
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:42,278
The three he just named...

383
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:43,978
Mr. Morooka,

384
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:45,678
Mr. Fukamachi,

385
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:50,578
and restaurant employee, Ms. Murakami.

386
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:55,278
We'll be asking you in greater detail about what happened.

387
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:58,978
Like Amuro said,

388
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:03,178
one of those three must be the culprit.

389
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:10,378
But who poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass and how?

390
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:56,678
"Next Episode"

391
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:57,878
He said he needed to talk to Yuri

392
00:23:57,878 --> 00:23:59,678
and they headed out back together.

393
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:03,878
How far apart in age do you think we are?

394
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:06,978
I really was at a different table!

395
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,378
An injury?

396
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,078
Amuro, what's wrong?

397
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:11,978
You've been acting strange.

398
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:14,378
Oh, sorry.

399
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:16,378
It's bye-bye time,

400
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:17,578
Rei...

401
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:24,378
Next Conan, "The Unsolved Cocktail Case, (Part 2)"

402
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:27,121
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,321
"Champagne glass"

404
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:32,021
Summer vacation ends with a child-turned-bunny girl?

405
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:34,421
I didn't think we'd take it this far.
