1
00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:03.691
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.391
After the tears are "Welcoming Cats".

3
00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:07.291
Welcoming cats also welcome crime?

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.191
Which paw is raised? Left, right

5
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.291
or both?

6
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.791
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.391
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:07.685
Hey! Don't you dare look up.

10
00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:09.285
I'll kill you if you do!

11
00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.585
I know.

12
00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:12.385
Just hurry up, will you?

13
00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:13.485
Why?

14
00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:17.185
Why do I have to do something like this when I just happened to walk by?

15
00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:22.285
Don't worry, come on over here.

16
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:24.185
Just a little more and I can reach him.

17
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:27.985
I mean you're really smaller than you should be, Conan.

18
00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:29.785
Pardon me.

19
00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.685
Thanks to who.

20
00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.885
Do you know who this kitten belongs to?

21
00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.885
Nope.

22
00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.785
Do you know who this kitten belongs to?

23
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.085
Cha-cha!

24
00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:54.685
Where were you, Cha-cha?

25
00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:56.285
Excuse me.

26
00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.685
"Tamotsu Ishigami(35)" -It's my cat.

27
00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:01.185
He's been missing from just some time ago,

28
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:02.685
and I've been looking for him.

29
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:04.385
He was in the park.

30
00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.785
He seems to have hurt his right paw

31
00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:08.785
and is bleeding a bit.

32
00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:11.985
You treated him?

33
00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:13.785
-Thank you. -No problem.

34
00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:15.185
As a token of my appreciation,

35
00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:17.685
why don't you have something cold to drink at my shop?

36
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.085
Although there's one boisterous customer inside now.

37
00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:22.585
Please come in!

38
00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:25.185
There! There! Go for it!

39
00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:27.185
Whip! Whip! Whip him.

40
00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:29.085
Go!

41
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.185
My goodness.

42
00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:35.885
"Office Kanemaru"

43
00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:38.085
Master!

44
00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.785
Ishigami... Bad news! Please come quickly!

45
00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:44.785
"Kanemaru Office"

46
00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:48.285
"Cha-cha Coffee Shop"

47
00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:57.585
Mr. Kanemaru!

48
00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:13.185
"Welcoming Cat from Right to Left"

49
00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.685
Master, coffee please.

50
00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:22.185
May I have a second serving?

51
00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:30.485
Inspector Megure!

52
00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:32.185
Why did inspector...

53
00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:33.985
I wonder what it is?

54
00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:41.485
Inspector.

55
00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:43.485
You again?

56
00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:46.085
Well, I saw police cars while I was taking a walk

57
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.285
and I thought that I should show up again so...

58
00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.285
And why are you here?

59
00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:51.585
Oh, never mind.

60
00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:52.585
Do we have a case here?

61
00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:55.185
Yep, the president of this company...

62
00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:58.585
Kanemaru Office?

63
00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:02.485
What do they do here?

64
00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:04.785
Although it sounds like some prestigious company,

65
00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:07.385
it's just another money-lending business.

66
00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:08.585
He's the president of the company but the fact is,

67
00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:11.185
there are no other employees, and he runs this place alone.

68
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.385
What's the victim's name and what about his family?

69
00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.885
He's Mr. Kenzo Kanemaru, age 65.

70
00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.685
He's single and has no family.

71
00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:19.085
The coroner says that

72
00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:22.785
the cause of death is a deadly blow to his head with a hard object.

73
00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:28.685
He was probably hit on the head with one of those welcoming cats there.

74
00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.385
Talk about a lot of cats.

75
00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:34.785
The debris of the cracked cat seems to be scattered around the dead body.

76
00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:36.785
The murder weapon is a welcoming cat?

77
00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:39.085
And what's the estimated time of death?

78
00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:42.285
Yes, sir, just several hours ago

79
00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:44.785
between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.

80
00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:47.385
Who is he?

81
00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:49.385
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

82
00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:51.285
"Fumie Imaoka (65)" -And she's Ms. Fumie Imaoka,

83
00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:52.785
the one who found him.

84
00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.885
She is a contract worker

85
00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:56.385
who comes once a week to clean the place.

86
00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.085
She came here today as usual,

87
00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:01.185
at around 1:30 p.m.

88
00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:08.685
Just who do you think you're making the report to?

89
00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.585
I'm sorry, I got carried away...

90
00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:14.985
The safe seems to have been ransacked.

91
00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:16.385
Inspector Megure,

92
00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:18.885
there's approximately 1 million yen in it,

93
00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:21.285
that hasn't been touched.

94
00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:28.285
I see.

95
00:06:28.285 --> 00:06:32.085
Inspector! The one who found the dead body, that is, the killer.

96
00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:34.085
Isn't this how the theory goes?

97
00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:36.485
Ms. Imaoka...

98
00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:38.485
has a debt of about 300,000 yen.

99
00:06:38.485 --> 00:06:40.885
He probably severely demanded payment of her

100
00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:43.985
and because of the pressure ended up hitting him.

101
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:47.285
A very common pattern indeed, yes.

102
00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:48.685
Hey, Mr. Detective!

103
00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:50.585
You aren't suspecting me, aren't you?

104
00:06:50.585 --> 00:06:52.185
It's true that I borrowed money!

105
00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:53.285
300,000 yen.

106
00:06:53.285 --> 00:06:56.785
Moreover, he told me to come clean this place in place of paying him interest.

107
00:06:56.785 --> 00:06:58.785
And it's true that I'm angry.

108
00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.085
But, that doesn't mean that!

109
00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.785
Calm down. Let's not get so upset.

110
00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:04.885
-Inspector! -What is it?

111
00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:07.485
It's something that was on the desk of the president's room next door.

112
00:07:07.485 --> 00:07:09.185
Please take a look at it.

113
00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.985
It's a daily dated notebook.

114
00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:14.885
September 3rd, 12:30p.m., Chika Murai.

115
00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:16.285
In other words, today,

116
00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:17.985
I think it would be safe to say that

117
00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:21.585
the victim was scheduled to meet this woman.

118
00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:23.485
About that,

119
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.285
the Master of the coffee shop on the opposite side of the street

120
00:07:26.285 --> 00:07:29.485
says that at about 12:30 p.m.

121
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:31.985
he saw a young woman come into this office.

122
00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.485
A young woman?

123
00:07:34.485 --> 00:07:36.185
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

124
00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:39.185
-And, what did she look like? -Yes.

125
00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:45.785
She had a brand name bag and wore expensive brand clothes, too.

126
00:07:45.785 --> 00:07:49.185
"Chika Murai(22)" -She looked to be a flashy type of woman.

127
00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:54.285
I think it was about 10 minutes later.

128
00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:57.985
She came here about 12:30 p.m.

129
00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:00.985
and left at about 12:40 p.m.

130
00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:03.685
Right on the bull's eye of the estimated time of death.

131
00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:07.685
Yes, so we think she may have information regarding the incident

132
00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:10.485
and have dispatched a look out for her throughout this jurisdiction.

133
00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.685
Yes, I see. I got it.

134
00:08:27.685 --> 00:08:31.185
Bring her over so we can have her identified.

135
00:08:31.185 --> 00:08:33.985
A woman who looks to be Ms. Chika has been taken into custody.

136
00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:35.985
They're headed this way.

137
00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:37.085
Is that right?

138
00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:40.985
The victim Mr. Kanemaru sure has a strange hobby,

139
00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:43.185
collecting so many welcome cats.

140
00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:47.185
No, it's not his hobby. It's just plain greed.

141
00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:49.985
He's collecting them only because he wants money.

142
00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:51.485
He collected them out of greed?

143
00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.685
As you can see, all the cats here

144
00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.485
have their right paws raised.

145
00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:56.785
True.

146
00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:58.785
Since I've seen these cats with left their left paws raised too,

147
00:08:58.785 --> 00:08:59.985
in order to satisfy my curiosity

148
00:08:59.985 --> 00:09:01.985
I personally asked him why.

149
00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:03.785
He told me that cats with their left paw raised beckon people,

150
00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.285
while ones with their right paws raised beckon money.

151
00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:09.685
Please beckon money to me.

152
00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:11.285
Never mind about beckoning people.

153
00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.485
I don't want to waste money on having to serve them tea.

154
00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:16.985
I mean he was nothing but a super miser.

155
00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:20.685
I see, so that's the story on cats with their right paws raised.

156
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.585
Did you know that they beckon money?

157
00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:25.985
No.

158
00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:29.085
But even though I won't have to come here and clean anymore,

159
00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.985
I feel like I'll kind of miss it.

160
00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:33.785
Cleaning?

161
00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:48.485
Excuse me, ma'am.

162
00:09:48.485 --> 00:09:50.385
Did Mr. Kanemaru ever vacuum

163
00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:52.885
the room himself?

164
00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:54.485
Nope.

165
00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:55.985
He used to say that it was a waste of electricity

166
00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:59.085
so I came and did it once a week.

167
00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:05.385
Hey, don't you go loitering around and get in the way of the investigation.

168
00:10:05.385 --> 00:10:06.385
Alright.

169
00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:10.385
Trash bag?

170
00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:12.985
No, I didn't throw it away.

171
00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:15.785
I guess it's strange because I know that Mr. Kanemaru

172
00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:18.785
who doesn't clean wouldn't throw it away.

173
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.485
How about it?

174
00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:23.385
Yes, it's definitely her.

175
00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:24.985
"President's Room"

176
00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:42.885
I wonder what on earth that vacuum cleaner sucked in?

177
00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:45.485
Why was the trash bag inside the vacuum cleaner taken away?

178
00:10:46.685 --> 00:10:49.485
If it were taken away, for what reason?

179
00:11:06.885 --> 00:11:09.785
Well... I.O.Us that have been taken away,

180
00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:11.985
as well as memos, with all these stuck out to her,

181
00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.285
she can't make excuses what so ever.

182
00:11:13.285 --> 00:11:16.785
I guess I'm not called for this time.

183
00:11:16.785 --> 00:11:17.985
What's that?

184
00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:19.785
The fingertip of the welcoming cat.

185
00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:21.585
I found it under the sofa.

186
00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:25.385
It probably came flying over here, when the killer struck him.

187
00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:30.985
This is called a flapping clock,

188
00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:34.385
and time ticks away with each flip of the flap.

189
00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:37.585
What a thing to still be using in this day and age.

190
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:40.885
Just like Ms. Imaoka says, it sure is a rare antique.

191
00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:43.285
It flew all the way here.

192
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.385
It's not entirely impossible.

193
00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:48.685
No, but wait a sec.

194
00:11:51.785 --> 00:11:53.185
No,

195
00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:55.385
this didn't fly over.

196
00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:56.485
I see!

197
00:11:56.485 --> 00:11:58.885
Maybe that's why the culprit vacuumed the place.

198
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.285
But, who on earth did it?

199
00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:02.585
She confessed to the crime?

200
00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:03.685
And her motive?

201
00:12:03.685 --> 00:12:06.785
Clothes, shoes, accessories, bags and watches.

202
00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:09.685
It seems she was largely in debt to Mr. Kanemaru in order to buy

203
00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:13.585
the brand name items that she used to make herself look rich.

204
00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:14.985
It wasn't possible for her to repay him

205
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.685
even if she quit college and part-timed,

206
00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:18.785
but today she finally...

207
00:12:19.785 --> 00:12:23.085
100,000 yen. It doesn't even add up to interest.

208
00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:25.385
My patience is wearing out, too.

209
00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.885
I guess I'll call your parents

210
00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:28.885
and have them help you pay me back.

211
00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:31.685
No, don't! Please don't tell my parents.

212
00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.485
I beg you!

213
00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.585
I'm not volunteering my services or anything, you know.

214
00:12:35.585 --> 00:12:36.785
I lent you money

215
00:12:36.785 --> 00:12:38.785
and I'm going to make you pay it back.

216
00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:50.585
Then, she took the I.O.U. with her and fled.

217
00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:56.685
This is...

218
00:12:56.685 --> 00:12:57.985
blood?

219
00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:00.285
Something most surely happened in this room.

220
00:13:00.285 --> 00:13:02.185
Yeah, the chances are high.

221
00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:04.685
There's evidence of 1/60.

222
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.985
Evidence of 1/60?

223
00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:10.485
Yes. Evidence of once an hour.

224
00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:12.585
Well, then. I just remember that I've got some things to attend to

225
00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:14.185
so I'm going home.

226
00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:15.985
Hey, Haibara.

227
00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:19.685
So, you took the welcoming cat,

228
00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:23.885
walked over to the safe and flung it down, is that right?

229
00:13:27.985 --> 00:13:29.185
No, that's not right.

230
00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:32.685
This case is not that simple.

231
00:13:44.994 --> 00:13:47.294
It's stopped bleeding completely.

232
00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:48.394
Thank you.

233
00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:51.294
But, I think you should take him to the vet once.

234
00:13:51.294 --> 00:13:53.294
I guess so.

235
00:14:00.194 --> 00:14:02.694
Yeah, just as I thought.

236
00:14:04.194 --> 00:14:06.194
Conan, we're going home!

237
00:14:06.194 --> 00:14:08.994
There's enough time to make it for the final race.

238
00:14:08.994 --> 00:14:10.494
May I listen to it at the shop again?

239
00:14:10.494 --> 00:14:12.494
Yes, please do.

240
00:14:12.494 --> 00:14:15.694
Inspector, I'll be going then.

241
00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:21.194
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.394
Don't tell me you're going to start

243
00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:24.294
that "She's not the one who did it" bit again?

244
00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:26.794
Yes, exactly, Inspector.

245
00:14:26.794 --> 00:14:31.494
Ms. Chika Murai did actually strike Mr. Kanemaru with the welcoming cat

246
00:14:31.494 --> 00:14:33.394
in this office.

247
00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:35.694
But, she should charged for assault.

248
00:14:35.694 --> 00:14:38.294
Assault? Is that it?

249
00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:42.994
After being struck by Chika, Mr. Kanemaru probably fainted.

250
00:14:45.294 --> 00:14:48.094
It was probably for just a very short while.

251
00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:49.994
And at 12:40 p.m.,

252
00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:53.894
Mr. Ishigami saw Chika fleeing.

253
00:14:55.894 --> 00:15:01.394
However, a few minutes after that Mr. Kanemaru was struck again and killed.

254
00:15:01.394 --> 00:15:04.494
You mean he was attacked twice?

255
00:15:04.494 --> 00:15:07.894
Please bring the clock that is in the president's room here.

256
00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:09.694
-Mr. Hirota. -Yes, sir.

257
00:15:13.694 --> 00:15:17.494
Please set the clock back to 12:59 p.m.

258
00:15:17.494 --> 00:15:20.294
This sure is an old-fashioned clock.

259
00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:23.994
If I remember correct, it goes...

260
00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:29.394
This is...

261
00:15:29.394 --> 00:15:33.894
Blood that splattered from Mr. Kanemaru's head when he was hit.

262
00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:36.394
Moreover, it was at the president's room next door

263
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.794
at 12:59 p.m.

264
00:15:39.794 --> 00:15:43.194
In other words, she had already left the scene.

265
00:15:43.194 --> 00:15:47.594
Don't tell me someone else attacked Mr. Kanemaru?

266
00:15:47.594 --> 00:15:51.494
Yes, and that person's the one who killed Mr. Kanemaru.

267
00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:54.194
You mean the president's room is the second murder site?

268
00:15:54.194 --> 00:15:57.894
I'm sure the killer wiped the blood off on the spot,

269
00:15:57.894 --> 00:16:01.194
but the face of the clock happened to change just then,

270
00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:04.594
so he probably didn't notice the blood that splattered there.

271
00:16:04.594 --> 00:16:05.794
I see.

272
00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:08.894
And just who is that killer?

273
00:16:08.894 --> 00:16:11.294
Please look at the notebook over there.

274
00:16:11.294 --> 00:16:14.694
Mr. Kanemaru has left a clue behind.

275
00:16:14.694 --> 00:16:17.494
12:30 p.m., Chika Murai.

276
00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:20.394
Below that memo, on the next page.

277
00:16:21.394 --> 00:16:24.194
It's blank. There's nothing written?

278
00:16:24.194 --> 00:16:27.094
On the memo that's not there, the name of the person

279
00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:30.894
that Mr. Kanemaru was supposed to meet right after Chika was probably written.

280
00:16:30.894 --> 00:16:34.294
The killer noticed it and ripped it off.

281
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:40.094
Inspector, please try tracing over that blank sheet of paper there.

282
00:16:40.094 --> 00:16:43.794
The slight trace of what was written should be left.

283
00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:49.594
Words are emerging.

284
00:16:53.294 --> 00:16:57.094
September 3rd, 1'o clock. Ishigami.

285
00:16:58.494 --> 00:16:59.694
Mr. Ishigami,

286
00:16:59.694 --> 00:17:04.094
did you have an appointment to see Mr. Kanemaru at 1 p.m. today?

287
00:17:04.094 --> 00:17:05.594
Oh, yes.

288
00:17:05.594 --> 00:17:07.394
I mean no, I did have an appointment

289
00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:11.494
but, my shop got busy so I couldn't come here.

290
00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:13.994
Conan, give the thing to the inspector.

291
00:17:13.994 --> 00:17:15.394
Okay.

292
00:17:16.594 --> 00:17:18.394
Here you go.

293
00:17:18.394 --> 00:17:20.694
A handkerchief?

294
00:17:20.694 --> 00:17:22.994
Is this blood?

295
00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:26.794
Yep, it's the footprints of Cha-cha who hurt his front paw.

296
00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:29.994
Inspector,

297
00:17:29.994 --> 00:17:32.694
the cat footprint that you see by the window of the president's room

298
00:17:32.694 --> 00:17:35.394
is supposed to be the same as the one you see on that handkerchief,

299
00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:37.294
so please check it.

300
00:17:38.594 --> 00:17:40.894
Mr. Ishigami says he didn't come

301
00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.294
but Cha-cha was here.

302
00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:47.594
However, it's impossible that the cat would open the door and come in.

303
00:17:47.594 --> 00:17:49.394
Besides, although the window is open,

304
00:17:49.394 --> 00:17:51.994
it is closed off with crime-preventing bars, and even a cat

305
00:17:51.994 --> 00:17:56.294
wouldn't be able to jump through the bars into the room.

306
00:17:56.294 --> 00:17:59.394
Just as Detective Mouri says, the footprints match.

307
00:18:00.394 --> 00:18:02.694
The only possibility is that

308
00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:05.594
Cha-cha came here together with Mr. Ishigami.

309
00:18:05.594 --> 00:18:07.594
Mr. Ishigami made an appointment to come here at 1 p.m.,

310
00:18:07.594 --> 00:18:10.594
as was seen on the memo, and met Mr. Kanemaru.

311
00:18:10.594 --> 00:18:13.594
No, I... I didn't come here.

312
00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:17.494
There's something over there. I wonder what it is?

313
00:18:17.494 --> 00:18:20.694
There, see under the sofa in the foreground.

314
00:18:25.794 --> 00:18:28.194
This also seems to be a cracked piece of the welcoming cat.

315
00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:31.594
Inspector, that's the cracked piece that came from the welcoming cat

316
00:18:31.594 --> 00:18:34.094
that Mr. Ishigami used to kill Mr. Kanemaru.

317
00:18:34.094 --> 00:18:35.794
What?

318
00:18:36.994 --> 00:18:38.494
But, Mr. Mouri,

319
00:18:38.494 --> 00:18:40.394
Ms. Murai says that she attacked Mr. Kanmaru

320
00:18:40.394 --> 00:18:42.394
with the welcoming cat on this shelf.

321
00:18:42.394 --> 00:18:45.094
Probably the one that over there.

322
00:18:45.094 --> 00:18:46.894
The cracked pieces here are only of one welcoming cat,

323
00:18:46.894 --> 00:18:50.694
so where's the cat that Mr. Ishigami used then?

324
00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:52.494
Inspector Megure,

325
00:18:52.494 --> 00:18:56.694
isn't the cracked piece from a welcoming cat's left paw?

326
00:18:58.294 --> 00:19:01.194
Now that you mentioned it,

327
00:19:01.194 --> 00:19:04.694
all the cats here have their right paw raised.

328
00:19:04.694 --> 00:19:06.594
Any with the left paw raised...

329
00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:10.494
In other words, this one unique cracked piece

330
00:19:10.494 --> 00:19:14.794
is from a welcoming cat that is not normally here.

331
00:19:14.794 --> 00:19:16.294
Are you saying that a different type of welcoming cat

332
00:19:16.294 --> 00:19:18.694
was brought in here from outside?

333
00:19:18.694 --> 00:19:22.994
Mr. Ishigami, you came here a little before 1 p.m. after all,

334
00:19:22.994 --> 00:19:25.894
with a welcoming cat that had its left hand raised, didn't you?

335
00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:29.594
And, that's when you witnessed Chika, isn't that right?

336
00:19:36.494 --> 00:19:40.794
Mr. Kanemaru who was struck by Chika, just fainted on the spot,

337
00:19:40.794 --> 00:19:42.394
but regained consciousness immediately.

338
00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:44.594
Then...

339
00:19:44.594 --> 00:19:47.594
Hello there.

340
00:19:47.594 --> 00:19:48.894
Mr. Kanemaru,

341
00:19:48.894 --> 00:19:50.694
what on earth happened here?

342
00:19:50.694 --> 00:19:53.794
Talk about unlucky. A woman, on top of not paying back what I lent her,

343
00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:55.594
suddenly attacked me.

344
00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:57.594
By the way, did you come up with the money?

345
00:19:57.594 --> 00:19:59.894
Oh, no. Not yet...

346
00:19:59.894 --> 00:20:01.694
What?

347
00:20:01.694 --> 00:20:05.394
So, I brought this as a token of my apology to you.

348
00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:08.594
A welcoming cat, that's thoughtful of you.

349
00:20:08.594 --> 00:20:10.494
Are you stupid or what?

350
00:20:10.494 --> 00:20:14.494
The welcoming cats that I'm collecting all have their right paws raised,

351
00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:16.194
and holding an old Japanese gold coin in their left paw.

352
00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:17.394
I don't want this cat.

353
00:20:17.394 --> 00:20:20.494
Go on home, and make preparations to give your shop over to me.

354
00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:23.194
Shut up. Out of my way!

355
00:20:23.194 --> 00:20:24.894
I tell you, first it's that woman

356
00:20:24.894 --> 00:20:27.494
and now you...

357
00:20:31.394 --> 00:20:34.194
How dare you make light of me.

358
00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:44.694
Cha-cha, who panicked at the sight,

359
00:20:44.694 --> 00:20:47.594
hurt his paw with a cracked piece from the welcoming cat

360
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:50.294
and fled outside, in fear from the window.

361
00:20:50.294 --> 00:20:53.194
In the meantime, you flashed upon the idea

362
00:20:53.194 --> 00:20:56.594
of framing Chika to be the killer.

363
00:20:56.594 --> 00:20:59.994
You move Mr. Kanemaru's body to the office.

364
00:21:03.794 --> 00:21:05.394
You went around searching for even the slightest amount

365
00:21:05.394 --> 00:21:07.694
of blood you could find, and wiped them off.

366
00:21:07.694 --> 00:21:09.494
You gathered the large cracked pieces

367
00:21:09.494 --> 00:21:11.694
and sucked the small pieces up with the vacuum cleaner,

368
00:21:11.694 --> 00:21:14.094
then you took the trash bag in the vacuum cleaner away.

369
00:21:14.094 --> 00:21:18.494
However, unfortunately, you left a number of clues behind.

370
00:21:20.094 --> 00:21:22.694
Mr. Ishigami, is he right?

371
00:21:22.694 --> 00:21:24.994
Not much time has passed from the time of the crime.

372
00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:28.494
The range of your activities is also limited now.

373
00:21:28.494 --> 00:21:29.794
Therefore, it won't be too difficult

374
00:21:29.794 --> 00:21:32.094
looking for the cracked piece from the murder weapon too.

375
00:21:32.094 --> 00:21:36.194
Matching the fingerprints, hair and blood and doing a precise check,

376
00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:38.994
we'll bring everything into the light.

377
00:21:41.394 --> 00:21:46.094
Everything is as Detective Mouri has just said.

378
00:21:46.094 --> 00:21:49.394
But, if I couldn't pay Kanemaru back by today

379
00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:52.294
he would've taken my shop from me.

380
00:21:52.294 --> 00:21:53.994
That's why I...

381
00:22:06.894 --> 00:22:09.294
The welcoming cat that usually brings happiness,

382
00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:12.194
seems have been quite different this time.

383
00:23:38.194 --> 00:23:40.094
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, Conan.

384
00:23:40.094 --> 00:23:41.494
Come here, will you!

385
00:23:41.494 --> 00:23:42.694
What?

386
00:23:42.694 --> 00:23:44.294
Okay, just great!

387
00:23:44.294 --> 00:23:47.194
Get a load of this, it's a welcoming cat that I made.

388
00:23:48.294 --> 00:23:49.394
I made it with both paws in the air

389
00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:52.294
so that it would beckon money as well as people.

390
00:23:52.294 --> 00:23:53.694
Bravo!

391
00:23:53.694 --> 00:23:56.494
My dark horse is gonna win, bravo!

392
00:23:57.494 --> 00:24:00.094
This looks more like a give up pose to me.

393
00:24:00.094 --> 00:24:01.894
Like in a hold-up.

394
00:24:04.194 --> 00:24:06.694
"Next Episode" -Eisuke Hondo is secretly looking

395
00:24:06.694 --> 00:24:08.294
for the whereabouts of Keil, or Rena Mizunashi,

396
00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:11.794
one of the members of the Black Organization.

397
00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:16.694
I asked Heiji for help to find a connection between the two.

398
00:24:16.694 --> 00:24:19.694
The information I got was that Eisuke Hondo's father

399
00:24:19.694 --> 00:24:22.894
was hired by the "Company".

400
00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:25.394
If it's what I'm thinking of,

401
00:24:25.394 --> 00:24:26.994
what is his true identity?

402
00:24:28.594 --> 00:24:30.794
Next Conan,

403
00:24:30.794 --> 00:24:34.194
"Red and Black Crash (Prologue)"

404
00:24:49.994 --> 00:24:51.994
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:51.994 --> 00:24:55.994
"Wrong Phone Number"
