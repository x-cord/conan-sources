1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,040
A racing second hand,
a broken satellite!

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,420
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,090
Today's a tearful conclusion!
Depend on him for the case and feelings!

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,410
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,370
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,920
His name?

7
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:40,169
Sonoko, Ran, and I went
out skiing on our day off.

8
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:45,629
There, we met their old grade
school teacher, Yonehara-sensei,

9
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,549
and took up her invitation
to stay at a lodge.

10
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,769
That night, someone attacked
Sonoko and Yonehara-sensei

11
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:58,409
and the overdue Sugiyama-sensei
was found strangled to death!

12
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:06,459
On each of their hands was
a "mi", "na", and "ko"...

13
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,459
Upon seeing this, Shimoda-sensei
holed himself up in his room!

14
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,749
Thanks to Professor Agasa,

15
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,209
I learned there was a suicide at
Haido Elementary three years ago

16
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,169
and that the name of the deceased
student was Mochizuki Minako.

17
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,279
Just then...

18
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,519
"The Ski Lodge Murder Case (Part 2)."

19
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,599
Upstairs?! Oh, crap!

20
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,189
Conan-kun!

21
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,609
Stay right where you are!

22
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:42,319
Wait...

23
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,299
What is it?!

24
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,279
What happened?!

25
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,859
It's Shimoda-sensei!

26
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,239
Rope marks on his neck!

27
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,509
The murder weapon isn't here!

28
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,839
The upstairs windows don't open,
and there aren't any exits!

29
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,249
Which means it's in someone's room...

30
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,749
Wait!

31
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:08,629
Not here! Not here! Not here!

32
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,339
It's not anywhere!

33
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:13,639
Which means the rope is still...

34
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,599
...in the killer's possession!

35
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,739
One of them has it!

36
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,509
You're sure there's
no murder weapon, kid?

37
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:26,359
Yeah.

38
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,339
Here, look at his neck.

39
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:35,249
See how he has rope marks,
just like Sugiyama-sensei did?

40
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,539
But, I don't see
any rope in the room.

41
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,959
Does that mean the killer
ran off somewhere with the rope?

42
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,839
I don't think so.

43
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:49,429
I was by the staircase the entire time.

44
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,969
Maybe they're still upstairs?!

45
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,549
But it's strange.

46
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,839
I just checked all the upstairs rooms,

47
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:00,149
but didn't find any
suspicious people or rope.

48
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:03,589
Sakai Ryuichi Haido Elementary P.E. Teacher
You checked our bags?!

49
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:04,439
Sorry...
Sakai Ryuichi Haido Elementary P.E. Teacher

50
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,879
lnteresting. If what the runt says is true...

51
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,609
Mori Atsushi (37) Newspaper Reporter
lnteresting. If what the runt says is true...

52
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,079
...then one of you is the killer
and is still carrying the rope.

53
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:19,039
And you're not a suspect?!

54
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,509
Get serious.
This is my first time upstairs.

55
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,089
Besides, if I were the killer, this brat
would've seen me go downstairs.

56
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,629
Anyways, whoever has
the rope is the killer.

57
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,559
Let's do some body searches...

58
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,269
Well?!

59
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,459
You're so dumb!
There was no rope!

60
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,549
Never thought I'd get
stripped down in this weather!

61
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,699
But, is it true that
Shimoda-sensei was murdered...

62
00:04:56,049 --> 00:05:02,669
Yes. A cell phone kept
ringing in his room next door.

63
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,129
But, when I opened his
door to check, he was already--

64
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,589
The sound turned out to
be his phone's alarm clock...

65
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,629
I heard it from my
room across the hall, too!

66
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,169
Huh? I thought you
had a downstairs room?

67
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,339
Yes, but I moved upstairs
after you broke my door.

68
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,559
Oh!

69
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,529
But, if neither of
us is the killer, then...

70
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,549
...that leaves only Sakai-sensei...

71
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,739
Huh? You're done
body-searching already?

72
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,509
Yes...

73
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,709
Did he find the rope?

74
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,089
Of course he didn't! Right?!

75
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,669
Yeah. How about you two?

76
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,779
Of course not!

77
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,129
Which means there's
only one possibility.

78
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,089
That brat is lying!

79
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:01,239
So, the killer might
still be inside the lodge?!

80
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:04,949
Oh, no! Sonoko's
still asleep downstairs!

81
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,479
For now, let's hurry to her room!

82
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,359
I never left the staircase!

83
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,829
The killer is definitely
one of those three!

84
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:24,039
But why?! Why won't
the weapon turn up?!

85
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,239
It's all right.
She's just sleeping.

86
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:28,959
Whew.

87
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:34,969
Sonoko!

88
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,489
Ran! It's terrible! Yonehara-sensei
was murdered in her room!

89
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:44,429
And then the killer strangled
me with rope, like this...

90
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,699
Huh? You're alive?

91
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,239
Yes, somehow. Are you all right?

92
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,739
I guess, I'm still a little dizzy...

93
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,029
Then get some more rest...

94
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,989
You weren't strangled?

95
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:04,909
No, but I had my forehead
bashed into the wall instead.

96
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,879
But I'm glad you're all right!
I always looked up to you!

97
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,839
Eh?

98
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,139
Not just her! All the girls
in our class looked up to you!

99
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,349
Don't overrate me.

100
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:28,319
I'm just a woman who can't
do anything for her students.

101
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,269
I couldn't even help you today
when you were attacked...

102
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,609
It's not your fault!

103
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:35,989
The killer's to blame!

104
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,449
That's how the students covered
for you three years ago, too.

105
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,409
You were the teacher for the girl
who killed herself, Mochizuki Minako.

106
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,659
If the killer's goal
is to avenge her death,

107
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,749
then it's not surprising
you were attacked first.

108
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,859
How dare you?!

109
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,949
You're in the same boat.

110
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:02,859
You were in charge of
the volleyball club she was in.

111
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,759
Ah, yes.

112
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,059
And, she was Nakamura-sensei's
favorite in the Health Committee.

113
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:13,019
You could've stopped her
from committing suicide, too...

114
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,989
It looks like this murder
mystery will continue yet.

115
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,409
Murder mystery?! Don't tell
me someone's been killed?!

116
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,779
We can explain later.

117
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,369
In any case,
it's dangerous to be split up!

118
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,699
Let's gather in the living
room and wait for the police!

119
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,459
Darn it! What the heck's going on?!

120
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,929
Think! There's gotta be a
key to unlocking this mystery!

121
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:43,889
Somewhere in this ski lodge...

122
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:49,059
What's that?

123
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,019
String?

124
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,769
It's a long strand of fishing line!

125
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:58,229
There's a broken
rubber band on the end.

126
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,119
Wait!

127
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,859
Was this...

128
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,489
OK! I've figured out
the ringing-doorbell trick!

129
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:09,489
That just leaves
the murder weapon, now!

130
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,919
If I can just find that...

131
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,959
Hair?

132
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:20,169
That's it! I've figured out
the disappearing-weapon trick!

133
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,439
This means that person is the killer!

134
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,139
But how do I tell everyone?!

135
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,809
I can't use Sonoko as a detective;
she barely knows what happened!

136
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:35,109
And I can't use Ran! I can't fool
her afterwards like I can Sonoko!

137
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,649
My best bet is to pretend
I heard everything from Conan

138
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,099
and then use my real voice
to explain it over the phone...

139
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:47,659
No! If I do that with him there,
it'll get into the paper!

140
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:53,119
If my name gets into the paper,
they'll find out I'm alive!

141
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,959
Those men in black
who shrunk me with a pill!

142
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,089
Hold it! No wandering off!

143
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:05,229
The professor's weird phone, huh?

144
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:12,769
Wait! He mentioned that my
Voice-Altering Bow Tie can transmit to it!

145
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:13,629
Here goes!

146
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:22,559
Conan-kun! Your phone's ringing!

147
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,609
Hello?

148
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,939
It's me, Ran! Shinichi!

149
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,069
Shinichi?!

150
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,789
I figured out who killed
the two teachers at that lodge!

151
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,619
Eh?! How?!

152
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:37,579
Conan-kun told me.
Now, I need you to do something.

153
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:38,839
Do something?

154
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,229
Explain the truth
to everyone in my place!

155
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:43,549
Eh?! Me?!

156
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:48,349
Yeah. I'll say it over the phone,
so you just repeat it...

157
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:52,309
No way! You can tell everyone
over the phone yourself!

158
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,939
Oh, OK. You don't have to.

159
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,769
I'll tell the police
when they get there.

160
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,189
Alright! I'll try!

161
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,569
I just put this on my ear
and say what you say, right?

162
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,979
Let's go back
to the others, Conan-kun!

163
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,039
Right!

164
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,999
We're gonna get the person who
attacked Sonoko and Yonehara-sensei

165
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,379
and killed the two teachers!

166
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,939
Thanks, Ran...

167
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,761
Eh?! You figured out who did it?!

168
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,171
Eh?!

169
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:34,881
Yes, and everything else!

170
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:40,351
Incident ♪1, in which Yonehara-sensei
and Sonoko were attacked...

171
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:43,681
Incident ♪2, in which the
strangled Sugiyama-sensei

172
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,311
was set by the
door to ring the doorbell...

173
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,511
Incident ♪3, in which the killer
strangled Shimoda-sensei upstairs

174
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:53,281
and disappeared
with the murder weapon...

175
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:58,241
I've figured out the one
behind these three incidents.

176
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:01,701
And that that person is...

177
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:04,061
is one of you!

178
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,671
is one of you!

179
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:09,501
The killer is one of us?!

180
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,711
A high school girl playing detective?

181
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:16,261
Fine, we'll hear you out.

182
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:20,681
But, are you prepared for
what happens if you're wrong?

183
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:25,601
You'd naturally
be hit with a libel suit.

184
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:29,311
If I put it in the paper and
you're wrong, you'll be expelled!

185
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,771
Expelled?!

186
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:33,931
I assume you're prepared for that?

187
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:35,241
Ran...

188
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:39,101
Don't worry, Ran. I'm with you.

189
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,101
Just leave it to me!

190
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,371
Shinichi...

191
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:47,541
It's all right. If you just
trust me and say what I say,

192
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,501
the truth will be revealed!

193
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:53,091
Well, li'l lady?!

194
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:55,801
You can write it if you want...

195
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:02,761
"Daughter of Great Mori Kogoro
Solves Murder Case at Ski Lodge"!

196
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:03,931
What?!

197
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,221
But, Mori-san!

198
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,351
When the doorbell rang
during Incident ♪2,

199
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:13,101
everyone was here in
the living room but you three!

200
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:16,651
How could we have done that?!

201
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:20,111
Yes, that would
seem impossible. But...

202
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:24,721
...with this fishing line and
the rubber band at the end,

203
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,121
that problem is easily overcome!

204
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,081
A fishing line and rubber band?

205
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:30,891
The trick is simple.

206
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,541
You tie the rubber
band to one end of the line,

207
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,721
wrap the line around
the two pillars by the door,

208
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:42,301
then tie the other end to the rubber
band while making a small loop.

209
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,891
Then, you attach the rubber band to
the stiff Sugiyama-sensei's neck,

210
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:51,271
lean him toward the door,
and support his feet with snow.

211
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:57,231
Naturally, you measure the line so
he'll stop just before the doorbell.

212
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:02,061
Given time, the rubber band
will snap due to the cold

213
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:04,581
and the body will
fall and ring the doorbell.

214
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,791
The fishing line would then blow
away and vanish from the scene.

215
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:18,011
So, the killer murdered Sugiyama-sensei
hours before so he'd be stiff?

216
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:19,681
Yes.

217
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:25,141
The killer most likely called
him out here and killed him

218
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,311
before we arrived.

219
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:31,101
After all, Conan-kun
saw icicles when we arrived.

220
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,891
Icicles?

221
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:37,151
Icicles couldn't have formed unless
someone had been using the heater.

222
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:43,601
That is an interesting trick,
but would it really work that well?

223
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,481
Proof over theory!
Go see for yourself!

224
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:58,711
What is this?!

225
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:04,681
A ski I set up, using the
same trick as I just explained.

226
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:10,351
But, the mystery behind
Incident ♪3 has yet to be solved...

227
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:14,101
I'll explain that
back in the living room.

228
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:17,311
Wow! You're so cool, Ran!

229
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:21,281
Just wait! I'm about
to beat your attacker hollow!

230
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:29,371
Alright, li'l lady. If one of us
is the killer, then let's hear about

231
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:36,541
the mysterious trick used to make
the rope disappear from upstairs.

232
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,721
Mysterious?

233
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:43,561
The killer never intended
to make it vanish to scare us all.

234
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:44,261
What?

235
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:49,721
It only looked that way because
Conan-kun happened to be by the stairs

236
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:52,721
when the murder occurred.

237
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,891
Had he not been there,

238
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:58,731
we would've thought the killer
had fled downstairs with the weapon,

239
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:04,111
allowing them to escape
suspicion as they were still upstairs.

240
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,951
That's why they set the phone off
and had the body found right away.

241
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,811
If it were discovered late,

242
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:17,541
their clever trick to get rid of
the weapon would've been in vain!

243
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:23,261
So, the killer was
one of us three upstairs?!

244
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:28,221
Then explain this
weapon-disappearing trick already...

245
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:32,601
The rope wasn't in
any of the upstairs rooms.

246
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,141
Of course it wasn't.

247
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,851
Because it's still
in the killer's possession!

248
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,561
What?!

249
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:44,721
Impossible!
We searched all three of them!

250
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:46,991
Yes. But not for one thing.

251
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:47,701
What?!

252
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,931
What thing?!

253
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:52,161
Who has it?!

254
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:56,621
Yes. The one who murdered
Sugiyama-sensei and Shimoda-sensei

255
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:57,931
and...

256
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:03,721
...and attacked Yonehara-sensei
and Sonoko was...

257
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:04,591
No way...

258
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:06,771
Hey, what's wrong?!

259
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:07,551
Who did it?!

260
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:12,891
It can't be...

261
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,851
Hurry up and say it!

262
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,811
The killer...

263
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,911
...is you, Yonehara-sensei!

264
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,021
Yonehara-sensei?!

265
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:26,781
No way!

266
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:33,601
She braided her hair like a rope
and strangled Shimoda-sensei with it,

267
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,951
as if it was real rope...

268
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:43,711
But, as long as her hair is, she
couldn't just strangle people with it!

269
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,101
What if it was a wig?

270
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,851
A wig?!

271
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:51,181
This was wrapped around
Shimoda-sensei's neck.

272
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:54,561
This is hair from a wig.

273
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:57,641
Its cuticle has been
removed for easy processing,

274
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,351
so I can tell just by touching...

275
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:05,441
And, with her long hair,
she's the only one capable of this trick!

276
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:12,911
That can't be! I saw her lying right
there when I was being strangled!

277
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:18,431
That was probably
Sugiyama-sensei's body...

278
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,121
Yes. During Incident ♪1,

279
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:29,101
she dressed up his body,
which she hid under her bed, just like her!

280
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:34,511
After luring Sonoko
from the next room over,

281
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:37,681
attacking from behind,
and knocking her out,

282
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,641
she hid the body
under the bed again

283
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,601
and lied down in the same spot.

284
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,511
After making tracks in the snow

285
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:49,221
so we'd think the attacker
ran out the window, of course.

286
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:56,261
Thus, she would look like
a victim of the attacker,

287
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,951
making it easier to get near
Shimoda-sensei, her next target...

288
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:07,511
Yonehara-sensei most likely called
him on his cell phone and said this:

289
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:12,671
"I know who did it.
Let me in and I'll tell you."

290
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:19,261
You are a great detective's daughter.

291
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,601
You're right, this is a wig.

292
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:28,601
But, I only wore it to hide
my hair after I cut it too short.

293
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,321
It doesn't prove anything.

294
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,061
It's no use.

295
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:37,781
There's still proof in
your wig that you're the killer...

296
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:38,741
Eh?

297
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,151
Remember? There were scratch
marks on Shimoda-sensei's neck.

298
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:50,501
So, there should
be some on that wig...

299
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:54,421
Blood that matches
his scratches' perfectly!

300
00:19:55,851 --> 00:20:00,681
Your motive was likely the "Minako"
written on the victims' hands...

301
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:02,351
That's right.

302
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,891
I did it for her.

303
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:10,071
To avenge my student murdered
three years ago, Mochizuki Minako!

304
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:11,901
Murdered?!

305
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:16,611
This time three years ago,
she came to me.

306
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:21,111
She said two teachers were
helping kids cheat on entrance exams.

307
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:28,041
She told me one was Sugiyama-sensei,
but she didn't name the other.

308
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,971
She was shocked
it was one she looked up to,

309
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,821
so she was going
to ask them herself.

310
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:38,431
The next day, she hanged
herself in the volleyball room.

311
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:43,221
But I knew Sugiyama-sensei
and someone else

312
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,431
had killed her to keep her quiet!

313
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:52,861
So, I gathered teachers she
liked and planned this ski tour.

314
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,431
You all know the result. I quickly
learned it was Shimoda-sensei.

315
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,911
But, you didn't have to kill them!

316
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:04,761
As fellow teachers, they had to pay
for betraying and killing a student

317
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,081
who had looked up to them!

318
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:12,061
But, who am I to talk?

319
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:16,671
I troubled Suzuki-san
for my own trick...

320
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:20,441
I'm sorry for being
such a horrible teacher...

321
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,101
Hold on.

322
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:54,751
As agreed, I'm gonna write an article
about that great detective work,

323
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,521
High School Detective Girl.

324
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,821
Do whatever.

325
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,881
Umm, Ran...

326
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:12,711
Shinichi...

327
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,841
Shinichi!

328
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:23,241
Two hours later, the blizzard
stopped and the police finally arrived.

329
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:27,661
I managed to stop the criminal,

330
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:31,291
but there was no stopping

331
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:37,351
the large teardrops spilling from
the eyes of the gentle detective...

332
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:50,081
Mitsuhiko's radio scanner picked
up a kidnapper talking on the phone!

333
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,581
If we don't locate the kid's
father and the kidnapper right away,

334
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,791
something bad'll happen!

335
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:58,751
We'll catch the kidnapper!

336
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,091
That's definitely his father!

337
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,261
And the kidnapper is...

338
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,431
...in those apartments!

339
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:12,461
On the next Conan...
"The Kidnap Locating Case."
