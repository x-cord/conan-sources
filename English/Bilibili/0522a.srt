00:00:01.882 --> 00:00:02.982
A year ago,

2
00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:08.182
I, Shinichi Kudo solved a murder case at East Okuho Village.

3
00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:11.182
A letter saying that a deduction miss that I made

4
00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:14.582
was found was delivered to me via Heiji Hattori.

5
00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:17.282
"Makoto Okuda (19)" -We went over to East Okuho Village

6
00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:20.482
to meet with the sender Mr. Makoto Okuda, but...

7
00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:23.182
Makoto's whereabouts was presently unknown.

8
00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:27.182
And, for some reason,

9
00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:30.782
the villagers seemed to have feelings of enmity against Shinichi Kudo.

10
00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:33.282
I went alone to the mountain cabin

11
00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.782
where Makoto had arranged to meet me.

12
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.482
Excuse me.

13
00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:42.082
This thing I'm feeling...

14
00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.382
It can't be...

15
00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:45.382
I made it thinking to secretly try it on him

16
00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:48.182
when he comes to spend the night here next time.

17
00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:50.382
That medicine is the miracle drug

18
00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:51.682
that could maybe change his body

19
00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.382
that had become that of a child due to APTX 4869

20
00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:55.382
to the body of the high school student that it used to be.

21
00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:57.582
Shinichi?

22
00:00:57.582 --> 00:00:58.782
Shinichi!

23
00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.382
Shinichi...

24
00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:06.682
Is that my name?

25
00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:08.982
Don't tell me that Shinichi...

26
00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:10.382
Lost his memory?

27
00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.582
That drug is only a prototype.

28
00:01:12.582 --> 00:01:14.582
There may be a slight discrepancy

29
00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:18.182
but the longest the effect will continue is more or less 24 hours.

30
00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:19.682
Twenty four hours?

31
00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:22.482
You've got to make sure he regains his memory by then

32
00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.682
or else we're in big trouble.

33
00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:28.282
Let's take Shinichi to that murder site too then.

34
00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:31.182
He just may remember something.

35
00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:33.982
Shinichi Kudo there deduced this case to be

36
00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:37.882
a forced double suicide that Mr. Hinohara committed.

37
00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:41.382
What the heck is Kudo's deduction blooper?

38
00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:44.882
The motive for the Mr. Hinohara committing forced double suicide

39
00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.982
was because his doctor declared that he had cancer

40
00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:49.382
and he was full of despair.

41
00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:51.782
"Misato Kawauchi (36)" -The problem arose when Mr. Kudo

42
00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:54.782
publicized the truth a year ago.

43
00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:57.482
She told him that although he did have cancer, the tumor was benign,

44
00:01:57.482 --> 00:01:59.882
and it would be completely cured with surgery.

45
00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:01.982
Hearing this, the former he seemed very happy.

46
00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:03.582
What?

47
00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:07.582
Hey, Kudo. What the heck is going on?

48
00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:10.582
Mr. Kudo, I know what you're up to.

49
00:02:10.582 --> 00:02:13.382
The truth that you're trying to hide

50
00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:16.882
the fact that you cannot speak of.

51
00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:21.382
Did I do it?

52
00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:25.882
Did I... kill her?

53
00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:27.582
Hold up for a while,

54
00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:29.782
until I find the real culprit and let you out of here.

55
00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:35.282
I've got to solve the case completely before sundown at all cost.

56
00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:38.082
Impossible crime.

57
00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:41.482
A mysterious murder trick, but...

58
00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:44.382
Shinichi would...

59
00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:46.182
I'm sure that Shinichi would find a way.

60
00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:50.482
Death...

61
00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:51.482
Please.

62
00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:53.882
Return Shinichi back to normal.

63
00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:09.482
Death.

64
00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:13.382
A crisis is gracefully revived.

65
00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:15.482
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

66
00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:17.282
The unbelievable truth that Heiji discloses.

67
00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:20.182
Ran's tears doesn't stop as she watches Shinichi.

68
00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:21.782
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:23.682
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.682
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

71
00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:14.984
Sorry, Ran.

72
00:05:14.984 --> 00:05:16.484
Go on home ahead.

73
00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.084
Oh, hey.

74
00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:25.584
I'll catch up with you right away!

75
00:05:25.584 --> 00:05:26.984
Shinichi!

76
00:05:28.384 --> 00:05:30.384
He's going away.

77
00:05:30.384 --> 00:05:31.684
Shinichi's...

78
00:05:32.684 --> 00:05:34.384
Shinichi's going away.

79
00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:37.784
No. Don't go.

80
00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:43.084
Shinichi!

81
00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:57.884
"Shinichi's True Colors and Ran's Tears"

82
00:06:01.484 --> 00:06:03.484
Where am I?

83
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.784
I remember.

84
00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:12.084
I found Death in the forest and I went after him

85
00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:13.784
then I slipped.

86
00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:17.984
My wounds are treated.

87
00:06:21.384 --> 00:06:23.084
Who on earth?

88
00:06:27.884 --> 00:06:29.084
Ran!

89
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:30.384
I found Ran!

90
00:06:30.384 --> 00:06:32.084
-What? -Kazuha.

91
00:06:33.084 --> 00:06:35.284
Are you all right?

92
00:06:36.384 --> 00:06:38.984
What's with the bandages?

93
00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:42.584
I fell in the forest and passed out.

94
00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:45.584
It seems that someone brought me here and treated my wounds.

95
00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:49.384
I'm sure it was the owner of this hut

96
00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:52.684
so we've got to thank him when he gets back.

97
00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:56.484
No, the owner of this hut doesn't seem to be a nice person.

98
00:06:56.484 --> 00:06:57.984
What?

99
00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.784
The transceiver?

100
00:06:59.784 --> 00:07:01.784
Heiji, where are you?

101
00:07:01.784 --> 00:07:03.384
In the next room.

102
00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:06.384
Come over here, will you? The place is a mess.

103
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.684
Come over you say,

104
00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:09.884
but the door is closed off with a wooden board.

105
00:07:09.884 --> 00:07:13.284
Go outside once and come in through the window.

106
00:07:13.284 --> 00:07:14.984
Yes, I guess so.

107
00:07:20.884 --> 00:07:23.284
Hey, what's this?

108
00:07:23.284 --> 00:07:25.384
This place is full of the pictures

109
00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:27.284
and articles of the detective kid.

110
00:07:27.284 --> 00:07:32.084
Yes. It seems that whoever it is, is really infatuated with Kudo.

111
00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.784
To the point of wanting to kill him.

112
00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:36.384
His picture is slashed up.

113
00:07:36.384 --> 00:07:40.784
Ran, didn't you really see the person who carried you here?

114
00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:44.584
No, all I saw was Death in the forest.

115
00:07:44.584 --> 00:07:46.184
Death?

116
00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:47.184
Are you serious?

117
00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:52.584
It seems that the owner of this hut is that what you may call "Death".

118
00:07:53.684 --> 00:07:54.784
Look at this.

119
00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:58.184
It's gray hair made of polyester used to make wigs.

120
00:07:58.184 --> 00:08:01.984
The hair of Death that you saw was also white, wasn't it?

121
00:08:01.984 --> 00:08:06.484
Yes, but he didn't look like such a bad person,

122
00:08:06.484 --> 00:08:07.784
although I was scared.

123
00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:08.984
I guess so.

124
00:08:08.984 --> 00:08:11.584
After all he seems to have treated Ran's wounds for her too.

125
00:08:11.584 --> 00:08:13.884
Maybe he's up to no good after feigning to be kind

126
00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:16.684
and getting everyone off guard.

127
00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:20.684
Well, but it's true that he's a dangerous character for sure.

128
00:08:22.384 --> 00:08:25.084
There's an empty box for bullets.

129
00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:27.584
Shattered pieces of glass of cracked mirrors.

130
00:08:27.584 --> 00:08:29.584
There are at least 5 to 6 cracked mirrors.

131
00:08:30.684 --> 00:08:33.784
And to top everything off...

132
00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:37.184
The nasty words that are carved on this desk say.

133
00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:40.684
"Failure means death".

134
00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:44.684
Hey, if there's an empty box for bullets, it means...

135
00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:49.684
Yes. It means that Death may be carrying around a dangerous weapon.

136
00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:52.684
Does that mean that the one who stabbed

137
00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:55.184
the newspaper reporter lady

138
00:08:55.184 --> 00:08:56.984
and made it look like Shinichi did it, is Death's doing?

139
00:08:56.984 --> 00:08:58.484
Yes, most likely.

140
00:08:58.484 --> 00:09:00.884
Since he seems to hate Kudo too.

141
00:09:02.684 --> 00:09:05.884
But if so, he would've had to call the lady and Kudo

142
00:09:05.884 --> 00:09:08.784
over to that house and wait for them.

143
00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:10.384
But the shoe prints of the culprit

144
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.684
weren't found anywhere around the house.

145
00:09:13.684 --> 00:09:15.584
It rained all night and the ground was damp,

146
00:09:15.584 --> 00:09:18.284
and yet nothing was found.

147
00:09:18.284 --> 00:09:22.284
Maybe he was already in the house before it started raining?

148
00:09:22.284 --> 00:09:23.384
Idiot!

149
00:09:23.384 --> 00:09:25.184
If so, the culprit could've never made it out of the house

150
00:09:25.184 --> 00:09:28.084
without leaving any footprints behind.

151
00:09:28.084 --> 00:09:30.884
I checked around the house last night

152
00:09:30.884 --> 00:09:33.784
because of the case that happened a year ago

153
00:09:33.784 --> 00:09:35.684
and found that in order to go in and out of the house,

154
00:09:35.684 --> 00:09:37.484
you have to walk on the ground somewhere around the house

155
00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:39.084
no matter how you do it.

156
00:09:39.084 --> 00:09:42.984
Besides, before the police and ambulance came this morning,

157
00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:45.484
we searched through the house,

158
00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.484
but found nobody there, right?

159
00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:49.384
True.

160
00:09:49.384 --> 00:09:54.584
Right. Who called the police and ambulance?

161
00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:55.884
Did you hear anything on it?

162
00:09:55.884 --> 00:09:57.184
Yes.

163
00:09:57.184 --> 00:09:58.884
Both calls seem to have been made

164
00:09:58.884 --> 00:10:01.784
by the same young man who sounded like he had a bad cold.

165
00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:02.884
What?

166
00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:04.984
Couldn't that have been Shinichi?

167
00:10:04.984 --> 00:10:08.884
In fact, the person who called the newspaper reporter,

168
00:10:08.884 --> 00:10:10.884
Mrs. Kawauchi at the inn she was staying at,

169
00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:13.084
was also said to have been a young man who sounded like he had a bad cold.

170
00:10:13.084 --> 00:10:17.384
The man who called them said that his name was Shinichi Kudo.

171
00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:19.784
You mean Kudo called that lady

172
00:10:19.784 --> 00:10:22.684
and called the ambulance and police as well?

173
00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:28.184
Could it be that he's pretending to have amnesia,

174
00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:30.384
but actually thinking of something?

175
00:10:30.384 --> 00:10:32.584
Mrs. Kawauchi said something similar to what you just said too.

176
00:10:32.584 --> 00:10:33.584
What?

177
00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:37.484
That remark that Mrs. Kawauchi made last night still bothers me.

178
00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:40.184
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

179
00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:43.784
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

180
00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:47.084
After that, I went to Mrs. Kawauchi's inn to ask her about it,

181
00:10:47.084 --> 00:10:49.384
and she answered me.

182
00:10:49.384 --> 00:10:52.484
She said that Mr. Kudo is just faking he has amnesia.

183
00:10:52.484 --> 00:10:55.484
And that he has something up his sleeve.

184
00:10:55.484 --> 00:10:56.984
I see.

185
00:10:56.984 --> 00:10:59.384
The lady said what she did last night

186
00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:02.084
hoping to get more information on Kudo.

187
00:11:02.084 --> 00:11:04.684
At any rate, there's no mistake

188
00:11:04.684 --> 00:11:06.884
that this is the house of a dangerous character.

189
00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:08.484
We've got to call the police over here right away.

190
00:11:08.484 --> 00:11:10.184
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:13.084
I know we can somehow get out of the forest,

192
00:11:13.084 --> 00:11:15.984
but I'm not sure if we'll be able to make it back here again.

193
00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:18.884
Then, we'll make a bonfire again

194
00:11:18.884 --> 00:11:20.684
and use the smoke to guide us.

195
00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:22.184
Bonfire?

196
00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:23.384
Yes.

197
00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:25.884
You saw the bonfire near the stone

198
00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:28.184
that looked like a tombstone, didn't you?

199
00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:29.884
That's what was burning.

200
00:11:29.884 --> 00:11:32.184
He was just probably getting dinner ready,

201
00:11:32.184 --> 00:11:35.884
when we showed up. So, he probably got up and fled.

202
00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:39.884
Could it be that the culprit fled from the little window

203
00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:41.984
by the ceiling of the next room?

204
00:11:43.984 --> 00:11:45.484
You mean that window.

205
00:11:45.484 --> 00:11:49.084
But, isn't it a bit too small for an adult to make it out of there?

206
00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:55.084
The shoe prints of a child's shoes.

207
00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:56.684
It's Kudo.

208
00:11:56.684 --> 00:11:59.884
I'm sure he was summoned here by that letter

209
00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:01.784
"Mr. Shinichi Kudo" -and confined here.

210
00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:05.184
So, he escaped from that window.

211
00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.984
But who on earth confined him?

212
00:12:07.984 --> 00:12:13.084
The whereabouts of Makoto Okuda's been unknown for the past six months.

213
00:12:13.084 --> 00:12:17.184
I'm sure Makoto's been killed.

214
00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:21.184
Is Makoto Okuda dead or alive?

215
00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:22.484
Hold it, hold it.

216
00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:25.784
Let me think it over from the start once more.

217
00:12:25.784 --> 00:12:28.984
The slashed up pictures of Kudo.

218
00:12:28.984 --> 00:12:32.384
It seems that the culprit really hates him.

219
00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:34.284
And the words on the desk.

220
00:12:34.284 --> 00:12:35.584
The culprit is trying to do something

221
00:12:35.584 --> 00:12:37.784
even if it means taking his own life.

222
00:12:37.784 --> 00:12:40.084
Is he planning to take revenge on Kudo?

223
00:12:40.084 --> 00:12:44.084
There was an empty box for bullets in the next room.

224
00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:47.484
The culprit most likely is armed with a gun.

225
00:12:47.484 --> 00:12:50.684
I'm sure he had many chances to shoot Kudo if he wanted to.

226
00:12:50.684 --> 00:12:53.384
Why didn't he do anything?

227
00:12:53.384 --> 00:12:56.984
The lady called Kawauchi was stabbed with a knife.

228
00:12:56.984 --> 00:13:00.184
How on earth is he planning to use the gun?

229
00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:03.684
And, another thing that's bothering me is...

230
00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:06.584
the mirror that was shattered to pieces.

231
00:13:06.584 --> 00:13:09.584
Why did he have to crack so many mirrors like that?

232
00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:12.184
Don't tell me that...

233
00:13:13.784 --> 00:13:15.384
Don't tell me that he...

234
00:13:26.781 --> 00:13:30.081
While you go out and call the police,

235
00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:33.081
I'd like you to check on something for me.

236
00:13:36.981 --> 00:13:40.481
But, how on earth am I going to check on something like that?

237
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:42.081
Don't worry.

238
00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:46.681
This will do it, I guarantee.

239
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:49.981
Will this be enough?

240
00:13:49.981 --> 00:13:51.181
I guess so.

241
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:54.281
That'll be enough for us to see the smoke from far away too.

242
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.081
And we won't have to go around in circles getting lost in the forest.

243
00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:59.781
I wonder what sport consists of going around in circles,

244
00:13:59.781 --> 00:14:02.681
you know, that Mr. Hinohara used to do?

245
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:05.981
I think it's some kind of field and track sports.

246
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.781
Remember, I told you that we asked the person

247
00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:12.481
at the inn about Death, right?

248
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:16.581
We asked that person what sport Mr. Hinohara was into,

249
00:14:16.581 --> 00:14:17.981
and was told that although he wasn't sure of what it was called

250
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:20.281
but said it was something that spun round and round.

251
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:21.681
Spin round and round?

252
00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:25.281
Field sports that would include spinning something

253
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.681
would either be hammer throwing or discus.

254
00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:30.681
Oh, right, he also mentioned that Mr. Hinohara was good at quoits.

255
00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:31.881
Quoits?

256
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:37.181
It seems that his son, Daiki was bragging about it to everyone.

257
00:14:37.181 --> 00:14:39.681
He goes around saying that his father was really good at quoits

258
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:42.681
an always got a perfect score.

259
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:45.281
Perfect score?

260
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.181
-It's that police officer. -Darn!

261
00:14:58.781 --> 00:14:59.781
Hey!

262
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:02.981
What's up? What's wrong?

263
00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:08.481
Death...

264
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:12.781
Death suddenly appeared before my eyes then...

265
00:15:19.081 --> 00:15:21.281
I suddenly passed out.

266
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:26.581
Hey, the mouth of the holster of the gun is open!

267
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:30.181
Don't worry.

268
00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:31.781
Your gun hasn't been taken.

269
00:15:32.981 --> 00:15:35.781
But, why only the gun?

270
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.081
You mean he bought the bullets but didn't own a gun?

271
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:42.581
I wonder... I can't say for now yet.

272
00:15:42.581 --> 00:15:45.381
But, I more or less have an idea of the case.

273
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:49.081
Later for the hut.

274
00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:51.281
Let's get everybody together at Mr. Hinohara's house

275
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:54.181
and solve the mystery, shall we?

276
00:15:58.181 --> 00:16:00.481
A High School Detective from Osaka?

277
00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:02.581
Heiji Hattori?

278
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:06.781
Are you saying that you're going to solve the mystery

279
00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:11.981
of how Mrs. Kawauchi was stabbed here this morning?

280
00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:14.481
Yes, exactly.

281
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:17.881
Before that...

282
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:21.781
If possible, I'd like you to bring along the owner

283
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:24.281
of the of the mysterious footprints that left

284
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:26.581
from the backdoor over here with you.

285
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:28.881
Of course, I brought him along

286
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:31.181
the owner of the footprints.

287
00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:36.181
Shinichi Kudo, it's you.

288
00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:38.681
What's with the blood on your clothes?

289
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:39.781
Hey, hey...

290
00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:43.281
Don't tell me that Shinichi's the culprit?

291
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:46.581
Of all the footprints left in front of this house,

292
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:48.881
if you exclude the footprints of us

293
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:51.781
who have an alibi because we were back at the inn

294
00:16:51.781 --> 00:16:53.481
and those of Mrs. Kawauchi,

295
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.481
the only footprints left would be his.

296
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.281
Blood of the victim is splattered on his clothes,

297
00:16:57.281 --> 00:16:58.881
his fingerprints are on the murder weapon...

298
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:01.981
No matter how you look at it, he's the murderer.

299
00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:06.981
That's true.

300
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:08.981
Because he is the killer.

301
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:20.481
In other words,

302
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:24.081
no trick was used in committing the crime.

303
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:25.081
What?

304
00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:27.081
Heiji.

305
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.981
What are you up to?

306
00:17:29.981 --> 00:17:31.581
Is this some kind of strategy?

307
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.181
It's not a strategy.

308
00:17:33.181 --> 00:17:36.281
I'm saying that this guy called Mrs. Kawauchi out by phone

309
00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:38.281
and stabbed her.

310
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:44.181
Hold it.

311
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:49.381
You insisted this morning that he'd never stab anybody.

312
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:52.381
I... I was scared.

313
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:54.281
That newspaper reporter said that

314
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:59.481
she'd expose the blunder that I made a year ago.

315
00:17:59.481 --> 00:18:03.181
She threatened me saying that she'd shatter the fame

316
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:05.781
and pride that I'd established up to now.

317
00:18:08.081 --> 00:18:12.181
I didn't know what it was about, but...

318
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.881
I was so scared that I inadvertently...

319
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:26.581
Who is he?

320
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:31.781
No. He's not Shinichi.

321
00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:34.581
The Shinichi that I've be waiting for is...

322
00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:36.681
The person that's been filling my heart.

323
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:38.981
The Shinichi that I've been longing for is...

324
00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:56.181
It's just as you say, Kazuha.

325
00:18:58.181 --> 00:19:00.481
I can't...

326
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:02.581
I can't stop my tears from falling.

327
00:19:12.349 --> 00:19:15.949
Did you really call the newspaper reporter, Mrs. Kawauchi here

328
00:19:15.949 --> 00:19:17.449
and stab her?

329
00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.949
Yes. I did it.

330
00:19:21.949 --> 00:19:24.549
I just can't believe it.

331
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:28.849
Your deduction a year ago was fantastic.

332
00:19:28.849 --> 00:19:30.649
You saw through the trick in the wink of an eye

333
00:19:30.649 --> 00:19:35.049
and paved the way to solving the case with lightning speed.

334
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.849
Why would a person like you, do something like this?

335
00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:39.649
You're over evaluating me.

336
00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:43.449
I'm not God.

337
00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:46.849
I hate people and make mistakes too.

338
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:51.549
It seems that a year ago

339
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:53.849
I wrongly made a culprit out of Mr. Hinohara

340
00:19:53.849 --> 00:19:56.249
who was innocent.

341
00:19:57.949 --> 00:20:02.249
Maybe you don't remember because you've lost your memory.

342
00:20:02.249 --> 00:20:04.449
But as far as that incident is concerned, there was legitimate evidence.

343
00:20:04.449 --> 00:20:05.649
Excuse me.

344
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:09.149
The test results have been reached

345
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:11.049
so I thought I'd report it.

346
00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:12.149
Test results?

347
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:15.249
That boy from Osaka asked me to get it.

348
00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:19.049
He asked me to check if the murder weapon knife

349
00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:22.549
and the piece of chain inside the lucky charm pouch that the boy had

350
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:24.849
matched or not.

351
00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:29.049
And, what about the result?

352
00:20:29.049 --> 00:20:31.849
Just as you said, they didn't match.

353
00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:35.849
All right! It's just as I deduced!

354
00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:38.649
You mean that lucky charm, right?

355
00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:41.649
What does it have to with the knife?

356
00:20:41.649 --> 00:20:44.349
What on earth didn't match?

357
00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:48.949
It's what all humans are bestowed with

358
00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:50.849
from the heavens when they are born,

359
00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:53.849
an emblem that stays with you till the end of your lifetime.

360
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.849
Since there is no one with the same,

361
00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:01.849
when it comes to criminal investigation,

362
00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:05.649
it is considered to be one of the most reliable evidence.

363
00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:09.449
Fingerprints, isn't it?

364
00:21:09.449 --> 00:21:10.449
Yes.

365
00:21:10.449 --> 00:21:13.849
Who is he?

366
00:21:13.849 --> 00:21:15.149
Death?

367
00:21:17.749 --> 00:21:19.249
Stand back.

368
00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:23.749
A gun?

369
00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.749
No use.

370
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:38.949
Cut it out.

371
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:42.149
Enough with the costume party already.

372
00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:45.049
Costume party?

373
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:46.849
What're you talking about?

374
00:21:46.849 --> 00:21:50.949
Yes. If any trick was involved in this case

375
00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:53.249
it's his face.

376
00:21:53.249 --> 00:21:56.249
I mean it's unthinkable that the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

377
00:21:56.249 --> 00:21:59.049
would ever stab anybody.

378
00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:02.249
The first thing that bothered me was

379
00:22:02.249 --> 00:22:06.049
the attitude that Mouri's daughter took.

380
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:08.849
Despite the Kudo she'd been waiting for all this time

381
00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:12.049
appearing before her,

382
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:14.549
she acted as if she didn't know him and displayed a cold attitude.

383
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:17.049
Normally, she would've clung to him and not let go, right?

384
00:22:18.349 --> 00:22:22.149
And the more so, if he has amnesia,

385
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:26.149
at first I thought she was just hiding her embarrassment,

386
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:28.949
but after I checked the hut of the culprit in the forest, I found out why!

387
00:22:28.949 --> 00:22:30.549
Culprit's hut?

388
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:33.549
Yes, the pictures of Kudo that are pinned up on the wall

389
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:35.649
were all slashed to pieces,

390
00:22:35.649 --> 00:22:37.849
and a great number of mirrors were cracked

391
00:22:37.849 --> 00:22:39.549
with the shattered pieces scattered over the floor.

392
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:44.149
There could be only one reason that the guy who hates Kudo to the point

393
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:48.149
of slashing his pictures would crack mirrors to pieces.

394
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:52.949
He couldn't stand seeing the face of Kudo

395
00:22:52.949 --> 00:22:55.449
that was reflected in the mirror.

396
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:59.149
Don't tell me that...

397
00:22:59.149 --> 00:23:03.449
Yes, he underwent plastic surgery

398
00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:06.849
and changed his face to that of this green-horn detective...

399
00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:14.649
stupid high school detective.
