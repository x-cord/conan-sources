1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,340
We all came out to pick bamboo shoots

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,140
along with Dr. Agasa,

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,740
but his car broke down

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,040
and we ended up being stranded in the mountains.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,340
We walked over to a villa district seeking shelter from the rain

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,240
and were lured to a certain villa

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,240
by the melody of a piano playing, stepped foot into it.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,940
Although there are traces of someone having been there,

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,840
no one is in sight.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,140
Eerie sentences are written in the diary that is left behind.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,740
It seems that someone kidnapped a boy and confined him to the villa.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,540
But, after the kidnapper's identity is revealed,

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,640
it seems the kidnapper decides to take the boy's life.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
We've got to find the boy quickly!

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,240
Then, the villa is suddenly overtaken by a blackout,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,440
when the sound of the piano playing is heard again.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,340
Oh no. The kidnapper is still in the villa.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,840
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,340
You must be true to yourself.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,940
The mystery of the diary is solved.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,240
What is the true identity of the genius pianist?

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,940
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:57,557
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 2)"

26
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:01,657
That's right! I found a picture!

27
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,357
A family picture.

28
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:08,657
They seem to be a musical family.

29
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:11,557
The date on the picture is a year ago.

30
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,457
Maybe the child in the middle of the picture

31
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:15,957
is the one who was kidnapped?

32
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:19,357
No. Because the child in the picture is a girl besides.

33
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:21,157
He's right. The one in this picture

34
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:24,957
is probably the owner of this villa or...

35
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:27,757
the kidnapper, no doubt about it.

36
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:28,957
The kidnapper?

37
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,257
No!

38
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:38,457
I'm sure that the key to the case is hidden in this diary.

39
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,057
April 20th, sunny.

40
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,557
After talking to him I found out that he's quite a nice boy.

41
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:48,957
He laughs a lot and plays a lot.

42
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:53,357
I'm not sure if he understands the situation he's in

43
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,157
but there's no doubt that this child

44
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,257
had been oppressed on a daily basis.

45
00:03:57,257 --> 00:04:00,857
Either way, only two more days to go, and it'll be over.

46
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:04,057
April 22nd, cloudy.

47
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:07,357
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven.

48
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:09,457
Melodies that make your heart quiver.

49
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,357
I'm jealous of the talent of the genius born in the same era.

50
00:04:13,357 --> 00:04:16,257
Although they're not songs that are appropriate to play in this situation,

51
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,657
they help me forget the passing of time.

52
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:22,157
Just one more day. Please let it pass without incident.

53
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:26,757
April 23rd, rain. No good.

54
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:30,557
It seems as if this boy somehow knows who I am.

55
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:34,357
If this is revealed, it would be a hindrance in the future.

56
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,757
Although I feel sorry for him,

57
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:38,457
I guess I've got no choice but to kill him.

58
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:40,557
The last thing written in the dairy is...

59
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,257
April 24th, rain.

60
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:48,457
I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me.

61
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,657
First, what bothers me is

62
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:55,357
why the entry for April the 21st left out.

63
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:58,557
On April 20th, it's written two more days to go,

64
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:02,857
and on April 22nd it reads one more day.

65
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:06,857
They're connected as if the 21st never was.

66
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:11,457
Moreover, the last entry, April 24th, rain is also strange.

67
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:14,457
This red stain is probably from wine that was spilled

68
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:17,057
but the pages dried pages are stuck together,

69
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,857
so somebody would've had to write in it

70
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:20,957
more than an hour before we found this.

71
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:22,957
Why does it read rain?

72
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,657
An hour hasn't passed yet since we got here

73
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,157
and it began to rain.

74
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:30,557
Besides, this stain.

75
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:33,457
Some sentences are slightly uncovered by the stain after all.

76
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,557
It goes to show that it was wet once,

77
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,257
then wet again for some reason.

78
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,157
Why?

79
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:47,257
The tips of the staples in the middle are out of alignment.

80
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:50,157
And the holes are also slightly bigger.

81
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:54,057
And, two pages are sticking out of the edge of the diary.

82
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,157
There's a trace of something

83
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:02,757
having been written on the page next to the one sticking out.

84
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,857
Hey, Conan?

85
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:23,857
What are you doing rubbing the lead of the pencil against the diary?

86
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,257
-Oh, that's... -Monster Getter's...

87
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,957
Treasure map!

88
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,557
What's going on?

89
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,257
I still don't have proof, so I can't say for sure, but...

90
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,457
I guess we'll figure out the answer

91
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:39,057
if we go and check out the room with the piano.

92
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,057
Nobody's here.

93
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,857
I guess the sound of the piano playing

94
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:04,157
was a CD playing just like you said.

95
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,157
If it were the radio cassette player,

96
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:08,257
it would move on batteries even during the blackout.

97
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:11,657
What?

98
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:14,057
Our things are gone.

99
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:16,557
-No. -No joke?

100
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:21,257
And, what about your deduction?

101
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:24,157
Aren't we supposed to figure something out here?

102
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:29,657
So I thought but...

103
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,557
I'm completely lost.

104
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,857
Maybe...

105
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,757
we've really got trouble.

106
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,157
Hey, Conan!

107
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,657
Don't tell me you're going to

108
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:43,657
play the piano at a time like this?

109
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:45,957
The seat of the piano is not right for you.

110
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:48,357
It was perfect for me, though.

111
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:52,357
I think you turn the dial that is under this cover

112
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:55,257
and adjust the height of the seat?

113
00:07:56,757 --> 00:08:01,157
And? Is the creepy player of the piano dangerous?

114
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:05,757
Yeah, a very dangerously outstanding genius.

115
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:09,657
That people would resent his birth.

116
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:12,957
A dangerously outstanding genius?

117
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:16,057
Is... is this person the one we are up against?

118
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,457
Sort of...

119
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:24,557
Okay! The height of the chair is just about right.

120
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:26,657
Okay, Ayumi, play the piano

121
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,857
and sing with everyone, will you?

122
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:33,557
A super peppy and cheerful song.

123
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,557
Here goes!

124
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,557
"I stepped on a cat, I stepped on a cat,"

125
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,557
"I stepped on a cat, and it scratched me"

126
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,457
"The cat scratched me, the cat scratched me,"

127
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:49,657
"the cat was scared so it scratched me"

128
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:53,557
"Bad, bad cat"

129
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:56,157
"Let's cut off its claws"

130
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,357
Why don't we quit playing

131
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:01,257
hide-and-seek already?

132
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,757
Whoever you are?

133
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:14,757
Don't worry, we're on your friends.

134
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,157
Wow, amazing.

135
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,357
It's just as Conan said!

136
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:24,657
It was really a child!

137
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,957
The lights are back on.

138
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:32,257
Okay, so we're all ears.

139
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:35,257
First, tell us your name

140
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,057
and age.

141
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:50,512
My name is Keita Onoda. I'm 7.

142
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:53,212
7? Then, you're in first grade?

143
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,412
"Keita Onoda (7)" -Yep!

144
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:57,112
Haido Elementary 1st grade, class 3!

145
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,612
You're a 1st grader just like us?

146
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:03,612
But, how did you figure out that he was a child, Conan?

147
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:06,612
First the names Bach, Mozart, Chopin

148
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,112
and Beethoven that were written in the diary.

149
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,412
Melodies that make your heart quiver.

150
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:12,612
A genius born in the same era.

151
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,112
I envy that genius. These sentences mean...

152
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:19,512
Chopin was born 60 years after Bach died.

153
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:23,412
So, he couldn't be a genius who was born in the same era, right?

154
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:26,912
It was a mystery who was being indicated here,

155
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:30,412
but when I looked at this picture that Ayumi picked up, it hit me.

156
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:35,712
That the one who was kidnapped was a genius piano player the same age

157
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:39,112
as the girl in the picture.

158
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,612
The kidnapper probably kidnapped the boy

159
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:43,212
and confined him in his own villa, so that his daughter

160
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,212
who is going to participate in the Beckahm International Music Contest

161
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,512
or something that is to be held

162
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,612
at the end of April, gets to win the contest.

163
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:50,412
His own?

164
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:52,512
You mean this is the villa of the kidnapper?

165
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,112
Yeah, because the room with the piano in the picture

166
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,212
is the same room we're in right now.

167
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,412
According to what's written in the diary,

168
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:01,612
is the one who kidnapped you

169
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:04,912
the father of the girl in the picture?

170
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:07,612
Yeah, he's Chiaki's father.

171
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:08,712
I met him for the first time,

172
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:12,912
but I knew his face. Chiaki showed me his picture.

173
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:15,912
But, I wasn't kidnapped!

174
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:19,412
Chiaki's father saved me!

175
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,212
The contest was drawing close

176
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:23,512
so I had to practice the piano day

177
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:25,712
in and day out and I couldn't have any fun for a long time!

178
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,312
That's why you did things that you were usually

179
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,112
not allowed to do without being scolded,

180
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,412
like eating snacks while walking along the corridor,

181
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:35,112
playing on the cart and get carried away playing games.

182
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,212
Yep!

183
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:39,812
Riding the cart through the corridor really feels good!

184
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:43,612
Then, who was the tall person I saw?

185
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,012
This boy was probably leaning over the handle

186
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,712
of the cart and looking inside.

187
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,112
I see!

188
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,212
Food was messed up on the kitchen table

189
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,912
because you got hungry and the man

190
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:59,412
who brought you here fled and disappeared, right?

191
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:01,812
Yep! I ate the ham, bread

192
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:03,612
and fried chicken that were in the refrigerator.

193
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:05,712
Because I can't cook.

194
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:08,412
This room with the piano sure is nice and neat.

195
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,812
That's probably because he was told by

196
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,812
his parents not to mess up this room no matter what.

197
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,812
Yep! Mommy told me

198
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:19,012
that the God of Music is in the piano room.

199
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:21,312
That's why you returned the seat of the piano back

200
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:23,512
to its originally height after you finished playing the piano?

201
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:24,612
Yep!

202
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,212
When all of you got here, at first,

203
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,612
I was so surprised that I forgot to do it.

204
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:31,612
I see. That's why you were flustered.

205
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,112
Because although you were sure that the piano player

206
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:35,212
was a child, the height of the piano chair

207
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,912
was not adjusted to child size.

208
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:41,812
Yeah, because I didn't think you could change the height of the chair.

209
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:45,212
But, did the culprit really flee?

210
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:47,012
According to the diary, the culprit wrote,

211
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:50,512
"I've got no choice but to kill him because he knows me".

212
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:53,312
Then, on the next day, it reads, "Sonny, forgive me".

213
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:56,412
It's true that if both days were connected,

214
00:12:56,412 --> 00:13:00,712
it would seem as if he had no choice but to kill,

215
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,512
and so did, but both pages weren't connected.

216
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:07,212
Because he switched the pages.

217
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,012
He did so because he ran out of paper

218
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,112
and drew this treasure map in the diary,

219
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:17,412
then he ripped the page off!

220
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:22,112
See, there are two pages that

221
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,312
are sticking out from the edge, aren't there?

222
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:25,612
True.

223
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:28,412
That's proof that the pages were switched!

224
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:30,112
Just what do you mean?

225
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:34,812
This diary is the type that is stapled together in the middle.

226
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:38,312
If all the pages are the same size, when the diary is closed,

227
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:40,112
depending on the thickness of how many

228
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,212
pages are stacked up, the edges will stick out.

229
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,712
The diary is made so that the edges

230
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:47,612
that are sticking out are cut to even them out.

231
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:51,312
The result is, the outer pages are slightly

232
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:53,812
larger than those in the middle.

233
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:57,712
That's why if you bring the outer pages to the middle,

234
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,312
it sticks out like this!

235
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,612
The reason why the staple tips on the middle page

236
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:05,412
are not aligned together is because of this as well.

237
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,312
Since he pried the staples apart once and switched the page

238
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:12,112
and pressed them back down, causing the staples to misalign.

239
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:15,112
The page in question where he drew the treasure map,

240
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:19,812
is on the right hand side of the April 24th page with the wine stain.

241
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,512
And on the backside of the 24th

242
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:25,112
the contents of April 23rd should've been written.

243
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:27,412
But if only that page were to be removed,

244
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,512
when the owner decides to write the diary for the following day,

245
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:32,812
he would most likely realize that the diary for April 23rd is gone.

246
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:35,812
That's why the April 21st page

247
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:38,712
was placed after the April 23rd page.

248
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,112
Then, strokes were added to the number 21

249
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,612
to change it to 24.

250
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:45,712
Finally, wine was spilled onto the page, like the other page.

251
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:50,812
I see. If the April 21st page was really written there,

252
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:54,912
the page written behind it would be for April 20th.

253
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:57,812
What we thought was the diary for the 23rd that read,

254
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:00,812
"I've got no choice but to kill him"

255
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,512
was actually written on April 20th.

256
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,512
Yeah, in other words...

257
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,512
It began with "I've got no choice but to kill him" on April 20th

258
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,212
and continued on to "After talking to him,

259
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,712
I found him to be quite a nice boy", on the 21st.

260
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:15,612
Then comes the page about Bach and Mozart on April 22nd.

261
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,712
Then to the April 23rd page that was torn off

262
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:20,712
and finally, the last page, April 24th,

263
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,912
"Sonny, I'm sorry, please forgive me".

264
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:26,312
If what was written on the page of the 23rd that was removed,

265
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,512
described the feelings of regret

266
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,112
he felt for the crime he committed, it could be that,

267
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,712
first, he thought that he had no choice but to kill the boy,

268
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:35,512
but his intent for murder gradually waned.

269
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:37,112
So, the diary shows that he decided

270
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:39,612
to leave the boy here and flee!

271
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:43,212
But, how brilliant to think of removing the page!

272
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,412
You could've just ripped it!

273
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,312
If I rip it, he'd find out one day.

274
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:49,312
My big brother who became

275
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:52,212
an intermediate school student last year taught it to me!

276
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:56,412
When I had to write a lot of notes on a musical score for homework,

277
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,012
he told me I could cheat my way through

278
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:01,212
if I switch the pages with the pages of notes that I wrote before.

279
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:05,212
And? Do you have the page you ripped off?

280
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:06,912
Yep.

281
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:14,112
No good. I can't go through with it after all.

282
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:16,512
He, like me, is striving to become a musician.

283
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,312
The thought of sending his talent to the grave

284
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,012
deserves me none other than death.

285
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,812
I've made up my mind.

286
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:24,812
Hey! Did the man tell you where he was going?

287
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:25,812
Nope.

288
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:28,212
He just said that mommy would come to pick me up soon,

289
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:30,712
so don't let anyone into the house till then,

290
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,112
and left.

291
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:34,412
Come to think of it,

292
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,212
that picture was floating in the hot water

293
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,612
that came flowing out into the corridor.

294
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,112
The bath tub!

295
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,312
Hot water is flowing out from the space under the door.

296
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,212
He's probably trying to commit suicide by soaking his wrist

297
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:52,212
that he had cut into the tub with water.

298
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,612
If he keeps the water running, it'll prevent the blood from clotting

299
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,312
and make it easier to die from exsanguination.

300
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,212
That's when the picture he was holding flowed out.

301
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:05,812
Darn, it's locked!

302
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:11,612
No good. It won't budge with the strength of a child.

303
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:13,712
Besides, the width of the corridor

304
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:16,212
is too narrow for me to use my Super Kick Shoe.

305
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,212
On top of that the corridor is soaking wet

306
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:20,312
that I wouldn't be able to brace my feet either.

307
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:22,312
Okay then...

308
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:35,612
What're you doing, Conan?

309
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,012
Marking the wall like that.

310
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:40,712
Will you go get my shoes from the front entrance?

311
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:43,712
Hurry!

312
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,412
Listen. Stand back, you guys.

313
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,312
Go for it!

314
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:06,912
Awesome!

315
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:08,912
The floor is soaked with water!

316
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:16,912
He's passed out, but he's still breathing.

317
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,012
His wound is shallow

318
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:20,312
and he hasn't bled as much as expected.

319
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,512
With immediate treatment, he may still make it.

320
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:27,012
The hot water flowed out to the corridor

321
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:30,212
because the towel drifted to the drain and is blocking it.

322
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,512
Hey! Get me the slender can

323
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,112
of shaving cream by the basin!

324
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,812
Oh, okay!

325
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:48,212
I'll wrap his arm around with this to stop the bleeding.

326
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,612
Then all we have to do is get him to a hospital.

327
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:53,312
But, we children could never carry an adult out.

328
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,712
No need to worry.

329
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:58,812
I'll drive him over to the hospital.

330
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,312
Dr. Agasa!

331
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:03,512
It's amazing how you figured out we were here!

332
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:07,912
Your knapsacks were lined out by the front entrance too.

333
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,412
By the front entrance?

334
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:13,412
I put it there because I wanted you to leave as soon as possible.

335
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:14,812
Besides, on the way here

336
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:16,312
when I was driving along the mountain path,

337
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,612
I heard of what happened from this lady

338
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:22,812
that was stalled because her car ran out of gas.

339
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:28,912
-Keita? -Mommy!

340
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:30,512
Keita!

341
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:37,212
I'm glad. You're okay.

342
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,712
Yep. I'm just fine!

343
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,412
Thanks to Chiaki's father saving me,

344
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,212
I could do a lot of things I always wanted to do.

345
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:47,712
I really had a lot of fun!

346
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:52,112
Wrong, Keita.

347
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:55,112
That man didn't save you.

348
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:58,912
No, he may have saved Keita.

349
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:04,912
It's been a long time since I've seen him smile like this.

350
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:12,512
Maybe the one who was confining him

351
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,712
by saying, practice...

352
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:20,712
was me, his very own mother.

353
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:47,412
And, what happened to the kidnapper after that?

354
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:49,312
Yeah. After he was discharged from the hospital,

355
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:52,112
it seems he went straight to the police and turned himself in.

356
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,812
Well, since he went as far as to

357
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,512
prepare the coffin that he planned to put Keita inside,

358
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:59,412
he probably doesn't have a chance to plead extenuating circumstances.

359
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:01,912
But, thanks to Keita's mother's testimony

360
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:05,512
the case was spared being publicized.

361
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:07,912
The kidnapper himself was the one who

362
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:11,412
called the boy's mother over by mail too.

363
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,212
But, I'm worried about the girl name Chiaki

364
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,412
that was in the picture.

365
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:20,312
Yes, because her father had become a criminal.

366
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:21,912
It seems that they're not going to tell Chiaki

367
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:24,512
about it until after she's grown up.

368
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,612
It seems that her parents

369
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:28,312
got a divorce a half a year ago too, besides.

370
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:32,912
And? Did the girl Chiaki win the contest?

371
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:36,012
Well, I haven't heard anything on that.

372
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:39,812
What? You didn't enter the contest, Chiaki?

373
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,812
I talked it over with mommy and decided not to enter.

374
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:48,712
I was so worried when you disappeared,

375
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:51,612
that I couldn't think about the contest at all.

376
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:53,112
Oh...

377
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,112
But, what a surprise that

378
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,312
you were playing with Daddy at the villa.

379
00:22:57,312 --> 00:23:00,212
Mommy became really kind to me after that.

380
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,212
She stopped telling me over and over to practice!

381
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:05,412
But, when they stop telling you to practice,

382
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:07,712
don't you feel like playing all the more? The piano!

383
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:11,812
Yep! Let's do a four-hand performance next time!

384
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:14,812
Let's play Mozart's sonata for two pianos!

385
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:16,712
Okay, promise!

386
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:20,712
Parents don't understand the hearts of their children.

387
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:24,912
Why was he playing just that one song?

388
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,412
He says he heard the piece on

389
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,712
the video of his big brother's graduation.

390
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:31,912
Each time the Air on G String began,

391
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,712
graduates left the room one after the other.

392
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:39,812
So, he thought that we would leave, just like them.

393
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,912
Or...

394
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:47,812
maybe he himself wanted to graduate...

395
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:52,312
from the pressure of being a genius.

396
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,812
"Next Episode" -You're going to Great Britain?

397
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:04,512
I've got so many places I want to go to that.

398
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,212
I can't decide!

399
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,912
I'll bet Shinichi would be just as excited

400
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:11,012
as Conan is right now.

401
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:13,412
This?

402
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,912
To think that

403
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,012
someone would die in front of all those children.

404
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:20,512
A massacre?

405
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:23,412
Here in Great Britain?

406
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:24,812
Next Conan,

407
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:28,550
"Holmes' Revelation, Holmes' Apprentice"

408
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,939
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,839
"Sherlock Holmes"

410
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,239
It's a hint that Shinichi would love.

411
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,439
I think so too.

412
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,393
Of course I love it.
