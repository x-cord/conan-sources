1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:04,624
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event together

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:06,124
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:08,124
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:12,624
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:17,124
A dark shadow closes in on Haibara.

6
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:22,224
And the deduction quiz that is carried out in the train

7
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:25,124
changes into a locked room murder!

8
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:30,524
Aim for a 100% solution.

9
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:33,124
Clear all mysteries and codes.

10
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,024
The car that disappeared during the locked room murder.

11
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:37,024
The suspicious testimonies of the passengers.

12
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,224
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:32,462
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Tunnel)"

16
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:37,162
Murder?

17
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:40,062
You mean, this is a real murder?

18
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:44,762
Yeah. Somebody shot him right through his temple.

19
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:48,062
But this room was chain locked,

20
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:50,862
so you had to break the door down to get in, didn't you?

21
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,962
So, wouldn't that make it suicide?

22
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:54,662
Although it's still a mystery

23
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:56,762
how the door was locked since...

24
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:00,062
there are no burns around the gun shot of the temple.

25
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:03,062
That's proof that he was shot from a distance!

26
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:05,462
When someone shoots his own head with a gun,

27
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:08,562
the gun should be pressed against the head, you see.

28
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:11,862
But, could it be that he got scared

29
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,962
just before shooting himself and pulled the gun away?

30
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:16,062
I don't think so.

31
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,962
See the silencer on the tip of the gun?

32
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,762
I think it's impossible to shoot himself

33
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:24,362
with such a long thing attached to the gun.

34
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:26,762
And besides, see, on the sofa opposite,

35
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,862
there looks to be a trace of a gun being fired on it.

36
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,062
Huh?

37
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:34,162
The murderer probably, in order to make it look like a suicide,

38
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:35,862
put discharge residue on the victim's hand and sleeve,

39
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,662
made him hold the gun

40
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:39,662
and fired an extra shot.

41
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,962
Of course discharge residue would also be found on the murderer,

42
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:44,862
but it can easily be removed by washing his hands,

43
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:45,962
and as to his clothes,

44
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:48,762
he probably already threw it out the window.

45
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,462
But, well, it's for sure that the killer

46
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,162
is still on this train.

47
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:55,062
We won't let him get away.

48
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,662
For the time being, you guys go back to your room

49
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:01,662
-with Ran and the others. -Huh?

50
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,762
What? We'll help out with something too!

51
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:07,162
-Me too! -Stay out of this!

52
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:09,762
Lock your room until I get back

53
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:13,162
and no matter who comes around, don't ever open the door!

54
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,862
What's that drastic attitude about?

55
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,862
You look frightening.

56
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:18,762
Huh? Oh, like I was saying...

57
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:20,162
It's dangerous because a murderer

58
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:22,962
is still loitering around, you see?

59
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,762
Then, take care of the children, will you?

60
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,362
Okay. I got it.

61
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:30,262
But, I'll call Dad either way and have him come too.

62
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:31,662
Excuse me.

63
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,862
What's this about, all this fuss?

64
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,862
Don't tell me that the deduction quiz this time

65
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:37,362
has already started?

66
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:39,562
Oh, no. Rather than a quiz,

67
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,462
a real murder seems to have occurred.

68
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,362
A real murder?

69
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,462
My, how frightening.

70
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:49,162
A real case is no good. It's too bloody.

71
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:50,662
At any rate, conductor!

72
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,362
Please stop this train right away,

73
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,162
and tell all the passengers not to leave their rooms

74
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:55,462
until the police arrive!

75
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,862
Yes!

76
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:59,462
Attention all passengers.

77
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:02,462
Since an incident has occurred on board,

78
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,162
the schedule of this train has been changed

79
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:05,862
and we are contemplating whether or not

80
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:07,362
to stop at the nearest station.

81
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,362
We are very sorry to inconvenience you,

82
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:11,762
however, until further instructions,

83
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:13,662
please stay in your rooms

84
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,462
and try as much as possible not to go outside.

85
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,262
What a bad feeling.

86
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:19,862
This bad feeling that I've been having from a while ago.

87
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,362
And that attitude of his a while ago.

88
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:25,762
What is this anyway, what's going on?

89
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:41,562
Huh? You're on board too?

90
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:43,762
-Amuro! -Yes!

91
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:46,062
I was lucky and was able to get myself a ticket, you see.

92
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:50,062
I met Mr. Mouri a while ago in the dining room too!

93
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:54,862
Hey, Ran, who's this good looking guy?

94
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:56,562
A detective who wants to be Dad's disciple

95
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:58,662
that I told you about a while ago.

96
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,062
Oh, so he's the one.

97
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,662
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

98
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:04,962
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,962
I hear that something happened on board.

100
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,462
Do you know anything about it?

101
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:12,162
Well, a murder's been committed.

102
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:15,562
Sera and Conan are back at the site right now.

103
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:16,962
Oh.

104
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:21,162
If so, I would think it best to leave it to Mr. Mouri?

105
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:25,762
It looks to be that the heavens are on our side.

106
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:32,362
What? It won't stop until Nagoya?

107
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:34,662
I told you to stop it at the nearest station and yet...

108
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:35,862
But, you see.

109
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,262
Just one word from the owner of this train,

110
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,062
Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki

111
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,562
and it's no questions asked.

112
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:42,262
The one who is audacious enough

113
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,962
to commit a murder on board my train,

114
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,162
shall be arrested right before my eyes.

115
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:49,262
So saying, it seems he's waiting for the train to arrive in Nagoya.

116
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,662
I mean, is there any limit to that old man's power?

117
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,662
Well, no need for worry.

118
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,662
Before we arrive at Nagoya Station,

119
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:59,662
I, the renowned Detective Poirot Mouri,

120
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:03,162
will magnificently pierce through the truth

121
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:06,762
of this Bell Tree Express murder incident and solve it!

122
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,862
Please do so at all costs!

123
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,462
By the way, conductor.

124
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:15,762
When did you last see the victim, Mr. Murobashi?

125
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:19,562
It was when I was in front of Mr. Noto's room A.

126
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:23,762
Since I heard the bell, I went in front of room A,

127
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,162
and was scolded by Mr. Noto

128
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:27,962
saying that he didn't call.

129
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,162
At that time, Mr. Murobashi opened the door of his room

130
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,462
and was shooting glances towards us.

131
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:36,162
Was it really Mr. Murobashi?

132
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:37,462
Yeah.

133
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:40,062
He seems to have been on the phone with someone though.

134
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:45,462
Okay, shall we go see what Mr. Noto has to say, Poirot?

135
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:47,962
Yeah, right!

136
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,562
Yeah, back then

137
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:55,462
I also heard Mr. Murobashi's voice through the door.

138
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,662
I was surprised because I didn't think

139
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:00,162
that he was in the room next to mine.

140
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:03,062
But, why did you lie saying that

141
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,562
you didn't ring the bell when you did?

142
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,762
Like I've been saying, I didn't call

143
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,862
but the conductor came anyway!

144
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:12,162
But the lamp on top of the door should light up

145
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:13,362
when you ring the bell,

146
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:15,362
so I don't think he made a mistake.

147
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,862
The thing is, the bulb of room A was burned out.

148
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,862
So, despite the bell ringing,

149
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:24,562
none of the lamps of the rooms were lit.

150
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:26,562
I just happened to think it was Mr. Noto's room

151
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,162
so I knocked.

152
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,162
And? After that?

153
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:33,362
Right after the door of room A and room B were closed,

154
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,562
the bell rang and the lamp of room E,

155
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:39,262
Ms. Idenami's room turned on so I went over but...

156
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:44,862
Yes. I did ring the bell and called the conductor

157
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:47,662
because I heard strange noises in my room.

158
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,662
The sound was caused by the alarm of this wristwatch.

159
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:53,762
I found it stuck between the space of the sofa!

160
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:57,262
I'm sure that the janitor or somebody forgot it here.

161
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,962
That's...

162
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:02,462
If you called the conductor to make him examine the room,

163
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:03,562
it could be at that time

164
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,462
that the culprit entered the victim's room.

165
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,162
After all, the conductor guarding the corridor

166
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,662
would be gone.

167
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:12,962
Examine? I called him to complain!

168
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:15,362
I found this on my own a while ago!

169
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:19,762
I don't like others stomping on my property, you see.

170
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:22,162
Oh. Which means that

171
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,962
although you were in the corridor all the while,

172
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,362
you didn't see any suspicious person

173
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:28,062
go into the victim's room, conductor?

174
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:29,962
Come to think of it...

175
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:32,262
When I was listening to Ms. Idenami's complaint,

176
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:34,562
the door on the very end was opened

177
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,862
and I felt as if somebody was glancing this way

178
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:39,162
through the door.

179
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,762
The room at the very end would be room A.

180
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:46,062
Just before seeing that suspicious person,

181
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:48,362
Ms. Komino who came out of room D

182
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:50,362
with her maid pushing her wheelchair along,

183
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,962
went over that way

184
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:55,362
so maybe those two witnessed something.

185
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,862
Ms. Komino, eh?

186
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,562
The door of room A?

187
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:05,362
When we passed by there, no such door was opened.

188
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:08,262
Of course we didn't see the suspicious person

189
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:11,062
who was near the door either.

190
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:12,962
Isn't that right, Ms. Sumitomo?

191
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,562
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:15,662
The only door that was opened

193
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:18,462
was that of Ms. Idenami's room

194
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:21,062
where she was shouting.

195
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:25,562
Then maybe the door was opened after Ms. Komino passed by.

196
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:28,962
On the way to room B,

197
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,162
we passed the two old ladies by the door

198
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,662
leading to car number 8.

199
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:37,362
But we didn't see the door of room A open either.

200
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,162
Are you sure it was really opened?

201
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,262
Oh, come to think of it,

202
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:42,962
just before you boys came along,

203
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,362
Mr. Ando in room C

204
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:48,462
came to check things out so maybe...

205
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,962
Yeah. Ms. Idenami shouting

206
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:54,362
could be heard all the way to my room,

207
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,162
so I left the room to go check things out.

208
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:59,162
I wondered what all the fuss was about.

209
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:02,362
But, I can't really say if the door of room A

210
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,262
was opened then or not.

211
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,862
After all, it's in a different direction from room E.

212
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:10,062
On top of that, back then, the train went through a tunnel

213
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,962
and there was no light coming in through the window.

214
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,162
The corridors were dimly lit too.

215
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:16,662
Come to think of it, that's right.

216
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:18,962
You didn't see anything?

217
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:21,862
After all, you came along right after I left the room, right?

218
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:24,362
Nope. We didn't see anything.

219
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,662
By the way, you passengers in car number 8,

220
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:31,162
seem to strangely know each other's rooms and names.

221
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:32,662
But, are you acquaintances?

222
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:34,262
Yes. Sort of.

223
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:37,662
Every year we all come on board this mystery train, you see.

224
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:38,762
They are our regular customers

225
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:42,862
who reserve this first class car every year, first thing.

226
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:45,762
Moreover, they all reserve the same room.

227
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,462
Oh.

228
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:51,562
Which means, in other words,

229
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:55,562
it could be that you merely made a mistake, conductor?

230
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:59,362
No. I'm pretty sure that I saw what I saw.

231
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,662
I see, I got it!

232
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,062
You're the one, aren't you?

233
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:05,562
The one who let the culprit secretly into room B.

234
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:06,562
Huh?

235
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,462
Although you say it's a locked room murder,

236
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,362
I'll bet there's a hidden door

237
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,162
or something leading to the next room?

238
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:15,862
There is no such door on this train!

239
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:19,062
Then, you gathered the passengers of room A, C, D and E

240
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:20,562
into room B

241
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:21,962
and you made of all of them

242
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:25,262
take a shot at the victim one by one, no?

243
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:27,262
What on earth are you talking about?

244
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:29,662
According to my deduction, that's how it goes!

245
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,362
That's ridiculous.

246
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:34,862
That's the same as that of the Orient Express!

247
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:38,762
I mean, the victim was only shot once.

248
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:43,262
What? You sent it to the Mouri Detective Agency?

249
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,362
You mean the picture of the camp that we went to last week?

250
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:49,162
Yes, because I wanted to thank

251
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:51,262
the lady who saved us back then.

252
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:52,362
So I thought a famous detective

253
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:55,862
would be able to find out who she was.

254
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:56,962
If it's that movie you're talking about,

255
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:59,062
I watched it together with Dad!

256
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,362
It would be difficult to find her just by her voice and face,

257
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,762
but Dad said that if we upload it on the web,

258
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:05,262
somebody may know her.

259
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,762
That lady was wearing the pass ring

260
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:09,262
of the mystery train,

261
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:12,062
so we were saying that we may run into her here, right?

262
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,262
I haven't seen her yet.

263
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,562
It can't be.

264
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:21,162
What's this uneasy feeling going through me.

265
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:23,062
It can't be...

266
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:25,662
It can't be that they...

267
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:39,112
-"Nagoya Station" -Listen! All of you!

268
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,012
As soon as the train arrives, charge on board!

269
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:45,112
Nab the murderer in the flash of lightning,

270
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:47,612
and bring him to me ASAP!

271
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:50,012
Answer me, will you? Answer me!

272
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:52,212
Advisor Suzuki.

273
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,412
Please don't give out commands to my men on your own.

274
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:57,012
Please leave this case to us,

275
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,612
-the Aichi Prefectural Police. -What?

276
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,812
A train with our name Suzuki on it,

277
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:02,912
was turned into the site of a murder, you know!

278
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:05,312
And you insist that I just sit and wait around?

279
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,212
After the murderer is arrested,

280
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:09,912
I'll hang him by the neck and suspend him

281
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:11,512
from the tower of the Nagoya Castle!

282
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,912
That's ridiculous.

283
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,712
It seems that there was an uncalled for murder,

284
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:20,312
but luck's seems to be turning in our favor, boss.

285
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:23,612
Yeah. After all, that "iron snake"

286
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,012
is going to deliver her to us non-stop.

287
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:30,612
I just got word from Vermouth just now.

288
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:33,912
That she confirmed Sherry in the train.

289
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:37,612
Then, Vermouth and Bourbon are watching her now.

290
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:42,012
I could care less whether they catch her or kill her.

291
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:43,612
The point is whether that lady

292
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,812
is in the stomach of the "snake" or not.

293
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:49,712
Sherry, if you're swallowed by the snake,

294
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:53,512
Nagoya will be last stop.

295
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,612
Well, at any rate,

296
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:02,612
in room B, where the victim Mr. Murobashi was,

297
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,712
the door was chain locked,

298
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:05,712
and if this conductor

299
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:08,012
who was here in the corridor right through

300
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:09,112
while the murder was committed,

301
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:12,312
didn't see any suspicious person go in or out of room B,

302
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,212
couldn't this be concluded as Mr. Murobashi

303
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,712
having committed suicide?

304
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:18,412
But there were no burns around

305
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:20,112
the gun shot wound of the temple.

306
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:22,012
On the sofa opposite the corpse,

307
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:24,712
there were traces of a gun being fired, weren't there?

308
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:26,712
All the passengers on this mystery train

309
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,712
are mystery lovers!

310
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:29,812
If he was going to die anyway,

311
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,312
he deliberately left traces of being murdered

312
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:35,012
and wanted to turn his death into a mysterious one.

313
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:36,112
I see,

314
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:39,612
just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

315
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:41,712
Call me Poirot today.

316
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:44,612
But... that man called Murobashi,

317
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,712
switched rooms with Ran and the others

318
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,312
and was all for the deduction quiz,

319
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,012
cooperating with you, right?

320
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:52,712
Would somebody like that commit suicide?

321
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:55,012
It seems that the instruction card

322
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,412
for the deduction quiz is fake too.

323
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,512
True.

324
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,012
It looks exactly like the usual instructions card,

325
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:06,312
but the contents differ from the trick

326
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:07,712
that we were told of.

327
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:11,112
Just as I thought. Somebody for some reason,

328
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:14,412
moved Mr. Murobashi over to this first class car.

329
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:15,512
Most probably because

330
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:17,312
Pops and the others came unexpectedly

331
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,412
to stay in room B of this first class car

332
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,212
that Mr. Murobashi always used to reserve.

333
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,712
If so,

334
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:25,512
is it a trick that can only be carried out in this car?

335
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:28,912
Is there anything to this first class car?

336
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:30,712
Huh? What do you mean by anything?

337
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:33,712
Well, the same passengers used to reserve

338
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:36,412
the same rooms from A to E every year, right?

339
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,912
Yes.

340
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:41,812
This Bell Tree Express was completed five years ago

341
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,712
but from what I hear, Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki

342
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,812
built this first class car

343
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,612
because a rich friend of his requested it.

344
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:50,212
Something about his friend

345
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:52,512
being a great fan of the Orient Express,

346
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,912
and wanting to relax with his family here.

347
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:56,312
Therefore, he requested only the rooms in this car

348
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:57,812
to be made spacious.

349
00:16:57,812 --> 00:16:59,712
Then were all those passengers a while ago,

350
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,612
the family of the rich man?

351
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:02,712
No.

352
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:04,912
I hear that the family, due to a big fire,

353
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:07,312
a month before the first run, virtually all died.

354
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,912
So, there is only one member of the family

355
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:10,712
among the passengers.

356
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,312
Who is that?

357
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,912
Ms. Komino, in room D.

358
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,012
If I remember correctly,

359
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:19,012
she is the aunt of the rich man who passed away.

360
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:21,312
That incident is on the web!

361
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:24,012
-Huh? -Because of a fire that broke out

362
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,012
during the birthday party of that rich man,

363
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,312
the people who died back then

364
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,212
were his family and 12 guests who were there.

365
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:32,712
It was written that the people who were saved were,

366
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:35,012
Ms. Komino, whose name was just mentioned,

367
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,812
her maid, Ms. Sumitomo and four guests.

368
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,412
Could it be that the four guests

369
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:43,112
were the ones we just met a while ago?

370
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,412
It seems that the fire

371
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,912
was due to some kind of electrical trouble,

372
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:50,312
but nothing definite has been found yet.

373
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,612
The murder that occurred this time,

374
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,512
had something to do with revenge for what happened back then,

375
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:56,012
it's sure starting to sound like

376
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:58,312
that story of the Orient Express!

377
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,412
I guess we'll have to go back and ask the people

378
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,212
what they have to say about this!

379
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,912
Talking about electricity,

380
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:07,112
why didn't you change the bulb of room A

381
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:09,112
despite it being burned out?

382
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,612
Behind this first class car is the cargo car,

383
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,412
and spare bulbs are always supposed to be there,

384
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:16,012
but I couldn't find any.

385
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,812
Then, are you the one conductor,

386
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,812
who checks things out before the train starts off?

387
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,412
Yeah, we, the two or three of us,

388
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:23,612
check whether the water of the rooms are okay

389
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,212
or things like that.

390
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:26,712
Come to think of it, I heard that

391
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:30,312
one conductor's uniform was missing from this car.

392
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,712
Huh? Is anything bothering you?

393
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:39,212
Oh...

394
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:41,512
I saw the article about the fire too,

395
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,212
but couldn't find out anything yet.

396
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:45,512
Well, why don't we take our time working on this?

397
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,112
I'm sure our opponent is panicked too

398
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:50,512
since you can't possibly flee on board a train

399
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:53,012
that's going at a speed of 80km an hour!

400
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,212
True.

401
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:02,412
What shall I do

402
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:06,712
if the Organization has really come after me

403
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,412
and is on board this train?

404
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:14,612
Can't possibly stay here anymore.

405
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,212
Mail?

406
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,512
An address that I don't know...

407
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:27,912
who is it?

408
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:33,512
Are... are you ready?

409
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:35,712
Vermouth?

410
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,312
You got mail?

411
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:49,312
-Who is it from? -Isn't it from Conan?

412
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:52,312
No. It's just some ad mail.

413
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:57,612
Oh, Ai, where are you going?

414
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,512
To the restroom. I may be awhile because I'm going to

415
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,912
drink my cold medicine too, while I'm at it.

416
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,912
I'll go with you...

417
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:09,512
Let her be! You're just a nuisance to her!

418
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,012
But, she...

419
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,612
all the way to this room

420
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,612
was hanging onto the hem of my top.

421
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:17,912
She looks to be worried about something.

422
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,312
I think it's best that I stay with her.

423
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,712
Huh?

424
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:26,612
Ai? Where are you?

425
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:47,012
I'll see you again on your 19th birthday, then.

426
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,512
Bye-bye.

427
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:54,312
Oh, and, I think it's about time that I told you.

428
00:20:54,312 --> 00:21:00,012
The fact is, mother is making a horrifying drug right now.

429
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,312
All the people back at the lab are delighted

430
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,812
that it's a dream drug.

431
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:08,012
Mom and Dad put our hopes in it and call it

432
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:13,812
the silver bullet!

433
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:16,412
But, in order to complete that drug,

434
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:21,312
Mom and Dad must live apart from you two.

435
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:25,312
Please understand, Shiho.

436
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,812
I'm sorry, Mother.

437
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:31,712
I didn't know

438
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:36,212
that this drug was not supposed to be made.

439
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,012
But in order not to get everyone involved,

440
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:43,612
I have no other choice but to rely on this drug right now.

441
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:01,312
Just as would be expected of you sisters,

442
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:04,112
I can tell exactly what you're bound to do.

443
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:10,912
So, come along with me, to my area.

444
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,812
No, not now.

445
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:24,212
I can't afford to be killed looking like this.

446
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:54,312
Weren't the tools

447
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:56,712
for the locked room murder trick in there?

448
00:23:56,712 --> 00:24:01,012
Will you let me take a movie of you running, Pops?

449
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:03,612
Your maid is a pretty fast runner,

450
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:06,212
but has she been doing any kind of sport?

451
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,912
That wristwatch that you said you found in the room,

452
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:12,112
has it gone off since?

453
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:15,912
I got a glimpse of it when Mr. Murobashi's body was found.

454
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:18,012
Next Conan,

455
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:22,112
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Crossing)"

456
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,612
Next Conan's Hint:

457
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,812
"Space Between The Chain Lock"

458
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,712
Eels over rice...

459
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:44,812
Don't tell me that...

460
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:47,112
-Solitaire playing with words. -Hey...
