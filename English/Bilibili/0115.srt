1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,958
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:07,088
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:09,998
Today's all deduction!
Let's change our view of people sometimes!

4
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:11,868
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:13,918
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:16,168
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:59,421
Thanks to Ran's plan to
bring her parents back together,

8
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,181
we came to a midsummer beach.

9
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:08,501
But a girl we met fell into critical
condition after a sea snake bit her.

10
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:15,341
This was no accident! It's a
criminal act disguised as an accident!

11
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,011
"The Scuba Diving Murder Case (Part 2)."

12
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,171
Queen Hotel, Izu

13
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,451
What? Bring her insurance
card to the hospital right away?
Queen Hotel, Izu

14
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,911
What? Bring her insurance
card to the hospital right away?

15
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:33,091
The hospital staff
says it'd be best to have it,

16
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,301
plus I feel all alone...

17
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:40,881
Kiwako always takes it when traveling,
so it should be somewhere.

18
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,591
But never mind that! How is she?!

19
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:48,971
She's still in the Intensive Care Unit.

20
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,841
I think her condition's gotten worse.

21
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:56,301
The doctors keep rushing in and out,
but they won't tell me anything.

22
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,401
Do you think she might die?

23
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,511
You idiot! What kind of crap is that?!

24
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,991
I'll get her insurance card and
be right there! Just wait quietly!

25
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,581
You and Kiwako are
in the same room, right?

26
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,461
Yeah.

27
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,471
Oh no! The card key is still in the room!

28
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:20,841
I forgot it when she asked me
to get a bath towel from our room.

29
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:21,591
What do we do?

30
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,801
It locks automatically,
so we can't get inside.

31
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,841
Sheesh.

32
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:31,171
I'll call the front desk from our
room and have 'em bring a spare key.

33
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,481
Yes, that's right. Room 406. Yes. Yes.

34
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,991
Thanks. Sorry for the bother.

35
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,151
Hey!

36
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,411
W-What is it, kid?
Don't scare me like that.

37
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:53,951
You all went scuba
diving around noon, right?

38
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,131
Yeah.

39
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:58,301
Did you catch anything?

40
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,041
Like fish.

41
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,211
No, I didn't get anything this time.

42
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,341
What about the others?

43
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,011
I dunno.

44
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:09,801
We're familiar with these waters,
and we all did our own thing,

45
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,221
so I'm not sure who did what.

46
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:16,921
I think Masahiko and Kiwako-chan
wore matching wetsuits

47
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:19,191
and did their diving
at the same spot, though.

48
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,021
They're really close!

49
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:26,341
Yeah. Them and Hiroshi
are all childhood friends.

50
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:29,821
They've always had fun
together, since they were kids.

51
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,161
They're all classmates?

52
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:35,671
No, Hiroshi and Masahiko
are the same age as me,

53
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:39,121
but Kiwako-chan is one year younger,
the same age as Harumi-chan.

54
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:47,301
To be honest, I planned to quit
this club my second year of college.

55
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,391
But I changed my mind
when Kiwako-chan's group joined.

56
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,391
I guess it was love at first sight.

57
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:55,951
Huh?!

58
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,771
How stupid!
Why am I telling all this to a kid?

59
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,191
Wait a minute!

60
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,111
Does that mean--?

61
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:11,171
That person and that person...
Could it be?!

62
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:17,391
There you are.

63
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,771
Thank you.

64
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:19,501
Let's see...

65
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,761
Insurance card, insurance card...

66
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:32,431
Geez! Here's where you left it!

67
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,301
I assume this is your card key?

68
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,391
Yeah.

69
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:42,901
Can you help me?
I can't find Kiwako's insurance card.

70
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,991
Did she maybe forget it?

71
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:50,111
Inside the towel at the bottom of the bag.

72
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,481
Just look.

73
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:58,011
The towel at the bottom of the bag...

74
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,211
H-Here it is! How did you know?!

75
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:06,351
My grandmother taught it to me
when I was a kid, and I taught them.

76
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,921
That's childhood friends for ya!

77
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,801
I'm not the only one.
Masahiko knows it, too.

78
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,341
Say, Detective. You have a car, right?

79
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:22,511
Yeah. It's a rental.

80
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:27,261
Then could you drive
us three to the hospital?

81
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,901
Yeah, no problem.

82
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:32,131
Then let me come, too!

83
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,921
I'm worried about Kiwako-san...

84
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:38,761
Don't be stupid.
Five people can't fit in that tiny car.

85
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,201
It's all right.

86
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:44,421
It's all right.
I can drop her off at the hospital.

87
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:48,391
What are those suitcases for, Mom?!

88
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:54,841
Oh, you can't tell? As soon
as I drop you off, I'm going home.

89
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,551
Wait, Mom!

90
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,431
I don't want to share the same
space with this lunkhead anymore.

91
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,301
Hey, Eri.

92
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,631
What?

93
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,021
We need to talk later.

94
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,441
Oh? What about?
I can't wait to find out.

95
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,301
Come on!

96
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:21,671
You're going too fast, Mom!

97
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:26,881
Sheesh. You don't have to sulk
because he didn't notice your ring.

98
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:30,091
It's not the ring. It's the incident.

99
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,631
The incident?

100
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:37,671
Not everything adds up yet,
but this is clearly a murder case.

101
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:38,551
Murder?!

102
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,851
And I'm angry at him
for not even realizing it!

103
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:49,711
Yes. It's a murder case,
and I have an idea who's responsible.

104
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:52,041
There's just one
thing I don't understand...

105
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:56,871
Why did that person do that then?

106
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,991
What could it be?

107
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,991
Do you mean the incident?

108
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,171
No, what he wants to tell me.

109
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,501
He said we have to talk later.

110
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,211
Oh, yeah.

111
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:13,171
Divorce... Custody rights... Or perhaps...

112
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:15,921
Mom...

113
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:22,101
It's probably nothing at all.
He's only testing me.

114
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:24,931
Testing?!

115
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,501
It's always the same.

116
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:30,331
He gets me worked up
and then watches me squirm.

117
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:31,901
He's so self-conceited!

118
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,821
Now I see! So that's what the deal is!

119
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:40,781
Ran. Sorry, but I can't stand it anymore.

120
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,491
Mom!

121
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:52,501
No question about it!
That person is behind this!

122
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,204
West Izu Hospital

123
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,214
Masahiko! I brought it!
West Izu Hospital

124
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,174
Kiwako's insurance card!

125
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:04,574
Everyone!

126
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,714
So, how's her condition?!

127
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,454
How is she, Brother?

128
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:13,144
I don't know. She's still in the ICU.

129
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:16,274
Let me know when you find out how she is.

130
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:21,694
You're leaving, Mom?!
But Dad said he has to talk with you!

131
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:27,574
Talk? Do I really need to
lend my ear to that lady-killer?

132
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:31,284
Oh, really?! You're fans of mine?

133
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,034
Dad!

134
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:37,704
What a lost cause.
Maybe I should give the guy a hand.

135
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,554
Say, Nurse.

136
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,164
Yes?

137
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,544
I have a favor to ask.

138
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:47,764
Wait, Mom!
He can't help it! He's famous!

139
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:53,594
He's all smiles at a time like this!
I've had enough of his callousness!

140
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,454
But that's because--

141
00:09:57,244 --> 00:10:06,914
Paging Kisaki Eri and Matsuzaki
Harumi from the Queen Hotel.

142
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:09,154
Please come to the hospital
director's office immediately.

143
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:10,744
Mori Kogoro is waiting.

144
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:11,754
Alright!
Mori Kogoro is waiting.

145
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:12,494
Mori Kogoro is waiting.

146
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:14,454
Me?

147
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,454
Are you okay?!
Mori-san!

148
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,094
Wait! Little boy!

149
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:28,924
I'm sorry! I'll bring it right back!

150
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:31,994
Director

151
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:35,354
Why did you call us here like that?!
Director

152
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:39,114
If you have something
to tell me, just say it already!

153
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,664
Mom...

154
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,064
Yikes...

155
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:45,704
Umm, I can come
back later if I'm in the way.

156
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,954
I'm concerned about Kiwako, too.

157
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:50,414
So you are concerned about her?

158
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,784
Can't say I blame you.

159
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:57,454
After all, the difference between murder
and attempted murder hangs in the balance.

160
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:01,164
Yes. That wasn't an accident.

161
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,954
It was a premeditated act meant to kill.

162
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:11,174
Someone purposely had
the sea snake bite Kiwako-san.

163
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,134
Matsuzaki Harumi-san...
that someone was you!

164
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:17,514
You can't be serious!

165
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,064
The fang marks.

166
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,574
Fang marks?

167
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:23,494
Sea snakes have rather small heads.

168
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:27,944
If one bit a human, it'd be
somewhere small, like a fingertip.

169
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:31,994
Yet, Kiwako-san's fang marks
were on the back of her hand,

170
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,904
where a sea snake couldn't have bitten her.

171
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:41,074
When rushing to help, she held the
head of the snake she had hidden,

172
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:45,674
forced its mouth open,
and had it bite down as if it had attacked.

173
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:48,254
Isn't that right, Harumi-san?!

174
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:54,414
I see. You pretended to play
dumb but actually saw through it all.

175
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,284
Then tell us this, Great Detective.

176
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,224
How can you be sure it was Harumi-san?

177
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:04,274
Couldn't any of
the others have done it too?

178
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:08,984
Besides, it was by sheer chance
that Kiwako-san started to drown.

179
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:13,154
And what if it wasn't by chance?

180
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:16,614
What if Kiwako-san
had done it on purpose?

181
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:19,864
On purpose? What for?

182
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,284
It's natural for lovers to want
to know the other's true feelings.

183
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:29,034
To arouse the other's interest,
one might get close to another person,

184
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:32,344
or even purposely
not wear a wedding ring...

185
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,304
Then, you're saying Kiwako-san...

186
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:36,784
Yes.

187
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:42,664
Kiwako-san pretended to drown
to test Masahiko-san, her fiancé.

188
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:47,394
To see if he would come to her rescue,
even though he can't swim.

189
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:55,324
As proof, she murmured this
after confirming that he tried to help...

190
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,204
"That's a relief..."

191
00:12:57,204 --> 00:13:03,454
But they're getting married
next week. Why do that now?

192
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:06,744
She wanted to be extra sure.

193
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,924
She was irritated that
her fiancé didn't even bat an eye

194
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:13,384
when she clung to this famous celebrity.

195
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:19,594
And then she executed the fake
drowning plan they made in advance.

196
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:21,534
"They"?

197
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,054
Yes. Two people.

198
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:30,484
For the plan to work, someone had to
tell Masahiko-san right away.

199
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:37,534
It'd be a disgrace if someone
else on the beach rescued her first.

200
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:41,994
And that other person was you, Harumi-san.

201
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,454
The signal for the start of the
plan was probably when she said...

202
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:50,874
Could you get a fresh
beach towel from our room?

203
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,004
Or so I'd assume. After that...

204
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:56,674
Later, Harumi! Don't forget!

205
00:13:57,574 --> 00:14:01,554
...Is something else she said,
so that sounds about right.

206
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:06,434
But Harumi-san tried to
stop her from going into the water!

207
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:11,394
Besides, she wouldn't have
done that in front of a famous detective!

208
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:15,314
That's why she tried to stop her.
Because I was right there watching.

209
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:19,654
You don't have to do it today.
Can't you go tomorrow?

210
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:21,654
I'll be fine!

211
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:26,114
But Kiwako-san continued
with the plan anyway.

212
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:31,864
Unaware that Harumi-san
had another, more sinister plan in store.

213
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,084
Y-You can't be serious...

214
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:37,574
Upon returning to her
room to get the bath towel,

215
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:40,914
Harumi-san concealed
her sea snake in her pouch

216
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,894
and went back to the seaside restaurant.

217
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:51,974
Then, at the proper time,
she signaled Kiwako-san to falsely drown.

218
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,574
Then, when rushing
to help with everyone else,

219
00:14:54,574 --> 00:15:00,744
she took out the hidden sea
snake and had it bite Kiwako-san.

220
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:04,574
But what's your plan, Great Detective?

221
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:09,584
The murder weapon is gracefully
swimming in the Pacific Ocean.

222
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:14,074
Without a weapon,
this case won't stand up in court.

223
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:19,594
I already told you. She placed
the sea snake in her waist pouch.

224
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:24,284
What's more, whether
out of confidence or confusion,

225
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:27,284
she never left our side after the incident.

226
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:31,914
It should still be there in her pouch:

227
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:36,064
adhesive tape with black-banded
sea krait scales still attached!

228
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:37,284
Tape?

229
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,324
Yes.

230
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:43,244
Simply stuffing it in would make
it seem unnatural when taking it out,

231
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,204
and there'd be a chance
it could bite her fingers instead.

232
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:52,994
She most likely taped the snake
down in several spots in the pouch

233
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,364
and left only the
snake's head sticking out.

234
00:15:56,364 --> 00:16:01,134
That way, she could pull it
out and have it bite in an instant.

235
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:05,844
Then the wing-like things
I saw on the snake were...

236
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:08,324
Probably some of the tape.

237
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:12,564
The rest of the tape is
probably still inside her pouch.

238
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,894
Inside her pouch?

239
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:18,954
But we still don't know
for sure she put a snake in--

240
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,774
We do. Because of her card key.

241
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,704
As soon as I saw her compact,
wallet, and everything

242
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:30,414
on top of the card key
she left in the room, it hit me

243
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:34,874
that she might've emptied her
pouch and put something else in it.

244
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:40,334
But why would she harm Kiwako-san?!
She's her brother's fiancée!

245
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,914
This is purely speculation,

246
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:49,304
but I wonder if Harumi-san
might've liked Masahiko-san.

247
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:54,104
No... loved him. A lot.

248
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:59,194
Don't be silly, Dad! She and
Masahiko-san are brother and sister!

249
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:02,704
No. They probably aren't.

250
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:09,614
If they were, all four in their group
would've been childhood friends.

251
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:13,624
Especially given that she's
the same age as Kiwako-san.

252
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:17,954
Then they're step-siblings
from when their parents remarried?

253
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,794
Yes. Probably.

254
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:24,754
Seeing as Hiroshi-san calls her
"-san" even though she's younger,

255
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:28,864
they were probably
in college when it happened.

256
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,844
No. It was my second year in high school

257
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,814
when my mom remarried
and I first met Masahiko-san.

258
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:43,164
He's a little helpless
but nice, and I fell for him.

259
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:46,744
I never had anyone
like him around me before.

260
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:50,244
But Kiwako-san was always by his side.

261
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:57,284
Whenever she spoke about
his childhood, I'd get very sad and angry.

262
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:02,214
It was like she was saying,
"You don't know anything about him!"

263
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:08,174
My only choice was to hide
my feelings and call him my brother.

264
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:14,184
Their sudden engagement
and marriage was a huge shock.

265
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:19,744
To top it all off, she came to
me with that plan, knowing how I felt.

266
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:22,104
Almost as if she was mocking me.

267
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:24,244
Pretending to drown?

268
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:26,824
Please? Can you do it?

269
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:29,574
And then you devised your own plan?

270
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:30,744
Yes. That's right.

271
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:36,614
I didn't want to hand
Masahiko-san over to her! So I...

272
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:37,624
So I...

273
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:45,594
I'm so stupid, aren't I?
Doing that would only make him sad...

274
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,864
I'm really so stupid...

275
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,514
You're Toda Kiwako-san's friends, correct?!

276
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:03,394
We managed to administer
an antitoxin just in time!

277
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:06,494
A few more days and she'll be just fine!

278
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:08,864
It's all thanks to
your emergency treatment!

279
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,204
It was nothing!

280
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:12,364
That's wonderful news, Kiwako!

281
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,204
W-Where's Harumi?

282
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:15,994
She's here! Harumi!

283
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:27,844
C'mon! Why so bashful?

284
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:30,384
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:37,664
I didn't know how you felt...

286
00:19:37,664 --> 00:19:44,354
I had no idea, until I saw your
serious look when you rushed to me.

287
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,064
Kiwako...

288
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:54,074
Yet, I asked you for that favor...
I'm really sorry! I regret it!

289
00:19:54,074 --> 00:20:01,204
What are you saying?!
I tried to... I tried to...

290
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,954
W-Wait! Did something happen?!

291
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:14,744
It's nothing. I was punished
for testing the heart of another.

292
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:17,614
That's why a sea snake bit me.

293
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,934
That's all.

294
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:56,254
That was amazing
detective work again, Dad!

295
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:59,704
Sometimes I can't
remember anything at all...

296
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:03,624
Plus, it sounds like
you noticed what Mom did.

297
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:08,754
Oh? Noticing but pretending
not to know is all the worse.

298
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,254
Mom!

299
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:11,754
What's she talking about?

300
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:14,134
Look at you playing dumb again!

301
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,954
She's talking about the ring!

302
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:16,964
Ring?

303
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:18,594
Oh, that's--!

304
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:21,004
Oh.

305
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:22,684
You mean this?

306
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:25,554
No way!

307
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:31,274
I found it under the
beach umbrella you were using.

308
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:36,234
How did you know I lost my ring there?!

309
00:22:36,464 --> 00:22:43,124
Don't be stupid. Nobody dries
their hair with their glasses on.

310
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:46,534
That was evidence you
were looking for something.

311
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:52,754
People really only lose contacts,
earrings, and rings on beaches.

312
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:58,294
So the sand on your knees was
because you were looking for the ring!

313
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,724
I get it! You wanted
to tell her about the ring!

314
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:05,084
The old guy did notice!

315
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:08,684
Geez. If only he was always that sharp.

316
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,294
Besides, could you be any more obvious?

317
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:16,664
Drinking tea with your left hand,
wringing your hands nervously...

318
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,504
I couldn't help it...

319
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:22,404
Mori Kogoro-san!

320
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:23,654
Hi!

321
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,504
Dad! Hey, Dad!

322
00:23:34,504 --> 00:23:37,044
Mom! Mom!

323
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:39,794
Mom!

324
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:43,594
Alright! Next time for sure!

325
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,164
It'll never, ever happen.

326
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,704
They match perfectly!

327
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:11,414
I wonder why the ones in chapters
one through six are all slightly off.

328
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:15,044
He obviously copied an earlier signature.

329
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:17,084
Why would he do that?

330
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:21,084
Because he didn't want to write it anymore...

331
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,554
...or he couldn't anymore?

332
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:27,764
That means Shinmei-sensei
might already be dead, doesn't it?

333
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:29,754
On the next Conan--

334
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:33,134
"The Mystery Writer
Disappearance Case (Part 1)."
