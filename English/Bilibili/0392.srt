1
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.640
Today's case involves Officer Takagi.

2
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.240
An unimaginable alibi trick.

3
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.840
Will the police be able to outwit the killer?

4
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.840
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:59.025
I've to a lot of things to buy today, so be prepared, okay?

8
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:00.425
Yes.

9
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.825
She sure is in a good mood.

10
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.825
It sure feels good today!

11
00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.725
Yes. True.

12
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:18.225
-Conan? -I'll be right back!

13
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.625
I'm sorry to bother you many times.

14
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.625
I'd like to confirm the time and situation of

15
00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.625
when the body was found again.

16
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.125
The time was yesterday at 8 am.

17
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.225
The president didn't show up for the morning assembly before work

18
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:33.825
so you went to call him.

19
00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:35.125
Yes, sir!

20
00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:36.125
This way, please.

21
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.425
The president's room is in another building?

22
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:39.925
Yes, it's beyond the office.

23
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:44.325
You found President Katsugoro Kitamura lying there on the floor.

24
00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:45.625
Yes, sir. That's right.

25
00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:51.925
President.

26
00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:53.225
Excuse me.

27
00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:57.525
President, is there going to be no morning assembly today?

28
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:01.925
President!

29
00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:05.325
President?

30
00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:10.525
President!

31
00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:18.025
"Mysterious 20 cm Height Discrepancy"

32
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.625
Did you notice anything at that time?

33
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.725
Not that I can remember.

34
00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.725
The culprit was already arrested, right?

35
00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:27.025
Why are you investigating things again?

36
00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:28.325
You don't have concrete evidence?

37
00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:31.725
Yeah. Rather we found out something totally absurd.

38
00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.625
Hey, what's that absurd thing that you found out about?

39
00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.525
Conan?

40
00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:37.625
Conan!

41
00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.025
Conan, you can't just run off like that.

42
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:40.425
Ran?

43
00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:41.925
I'm so sorry!

44
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:44.225
And what's that absurd thing that you were talking about?

45
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.125
Yes. Well...

46
00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:50.125
The victim is Mr. Katsugoro Kitamura, age 47.

47
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.725
He is the president of this factory.

48
00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:54.625
The estimated time of death is

49
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.425
between 4 pm to 10 pm.

50
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.725
Soon after the body was found,

51
00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.225
a cordon was set up.

52
00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:04.225
The following day, which is yesterday,

53
00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:05.725
the suspect was taken custody at the police.

54
00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:08.725
However...

55
00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:15.925
The suspect is Yuichi Minamida, age 47.

56
00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.325
He is an owner chef of a small western food restaurant

57
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:19.725
and...

58
00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:22.325
I was a classmate of the victim in high school.

59
00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:24.025
"Yuichi Minamida (47)" -It's true that I went

60
00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:26.225
to Kitamura's place yesterday.

61
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.225
But, I didn't do it.

62
00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:32.125
You had a debt of three million yen that you owed Mr. Kitamura.

63
00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:33.825
He refused to extend the deadline for your repayment,

64
00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:36.225
so you were cornered and stabbed him.

65
00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:39.225
-That's the story, isn't it? -Do you have evidence?

66
00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:42.325
Are my prints on the knife that is the murder weapon?

67
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:44.625
They didn't detected any fingerprints

68
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:47.025
but the knife was discovered in his home.

69
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.125
In other words, the fingerprints were wiped off completely

70
00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.925
after the murder was committed.

71
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:56.625
Inspector.

72
00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:05.525
Beside owing Mr. Kitamura money,

73
00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:08.425
you have another strong motive to kill him, don't you?

74
00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:15.825
Mr. Kitamura was after your shop and your land.

75
00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:19.725
He spread rumors about the sanitation standards at your shop,

76
00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:21.725
which sent you into a financial rut.

77
00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:24.825
Three months ago, he lent you three million yen.

78
00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:31.825
"Katsugoro Kitamura (47), Factory President"

79
00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:34.625
Minamida, after finding out what Mr. Kitamura was actually after,

80
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.625
was enraged and told the people around him how vexed he was.

81
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.125
On the day of payment,

82
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.925
which is also the day the murder was committed, at 1 pm,

83
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.925
Minamida appeared at this office to see Mr. Kitamura.

84
00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:48.725
It's already 3 pm, just how long do you intend to stay here?

85
00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:50.525
Please! Just another three days...

86
00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:52.025
No, two days will do.

87
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:54.725
I lent you the cash because of the good old times.

88
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:57.825
If you don't have the cash, give me the deed to the land.

89
00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:59.325
Kitamura!

90
00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:04.625
What the...

91
00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:05.825
Excuse me, president!

92
00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.525
We're having some problems with the machine.

93
00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:11.725
Okay! Go on ahead!

94
00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:14.025
Yes, sir. Thank you.

95
00:06:15.225 --> 00:06:17.825
Geez! I guess I have no choice.

96
00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:19.925
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:21.925
I know just what you're after!

98
00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:23.225
Let go of me!

99
00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:25.125
You schemed it from the very start!

100
00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:27.625
-Let go! -You were after my land to begin with!

101
00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:30.925
So what?

102
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:33.725
Leave your deed here and get lost.

103
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.025
You darn loser!

104
00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:40.725
I think those words made Minamida make up his mind.

105
00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:44.825
He waited for Mr. Kitamura to return.

106
00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:55.225
But Minamida...

107
00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:59.225
Yes, he did come back after about 30 minutes.

108
00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:01.425
I started to negotiate with him once again,

109
00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:03.925
and stayed there until around 6 pm in the evening,

110
00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.825
but was eventually kicked out of the room.

111
00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:09.525
What? A person who can testify to that?

112
00:07:09.525 --> 00:07:11.525
I don't know.

113
00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:14.525
I see! You've got all the circumstantial evidence,

114
00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:15.925
but no concrete evidence.

115
00:07:17.925 --> 00:07:20.925
I'm sure this is what Pops would say.

116
00:07:23.725 --> 00:07:26.525
You haven't told me about the absurd thing yet!

117
00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:28.325
The absurd thing is

118
00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:30.925
the height difference between the suspect and Minamida.

119
00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:32.225
Height difference?

120
00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:33.525
What do you mean by that?

121
00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.525
He's pretty tough to handle.

122
00:07:37.525 --> 00:07:38.525
Besides...

123
00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:42.625
The strange confidence I sense from him bothers me too.

124
00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.525
Inspector!

125
00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:47.025
I got an absurd report from the forensic officer.

126
00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:52.325
The height of the victim Kitamura is 166 cm

127
00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:54.625
and Minamida is 186 cm.

128
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:57.125
Minamida is 20 cm taller.

129
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.825
If so, then what?

130
00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:03.625
In the case that a tall person stabs a person shorter than he is,

131
00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:07.325
the angle of the knife would usually be from diagonally above.

132
00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.525
On the other hand, if a short person stabs someone taller than himself,

133
00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:12.525
it would be from diagonally below.

134
00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:15.225
The knife that was stabbed into Kitamura's chest was

135
00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:17.125
from diagonally below. In other words...

136
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.625
It's impossible for Minamida who is 20 cm taller

137
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.825
to have committed the crime.

138
00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:24.825
No way.

139
00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:27.225
So, I had the forensic officers use the angle of the knife

140
00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:28.325
to calculate backwards

141
00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:31.225
and come up with the height of the killer.

142
00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:33.025
-And? -Yes, sir!

143
00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:36.225
The results came out to be that the person is 110 cm.

144
00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:37.325
-What? -What?

145
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:39.225
110 cm?

146
00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:41.725
Isn't that the height of a child?

147
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:45.425
I get it!

148
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.425
If the killer stabbed from below where there are stairs,

149
00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:49.125
even with Mr. Minamida's height,

150
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.725
he'd be able to stab from below.

151
00:08:50.725 --> 00:08:53.525
The scene of the murder was a one-story building, with no stairs,

152
00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.825
and there were no traces of the body being moved.

153
00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:58.825
Then! He probably attacked the victim when he was off his guard?

154
00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:00.625
Oh! Just what do you think you're doing?

155
00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:03.325
He sank down low on the spur of the moment and stabbed?

156
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:06.025
Takagi. You just stabbed me, didn't you?

157
00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:09.125
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:13.025
Inspector! I think that the killer is Minamida too.

159
00:09:13.025 --> 00:09:16.025
But, the victim was stabbed from the front.

160
00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:18.725
So, it's hard to believe that he was attacked when he was off his guard.

161
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.825
Moreover, a week before the incident,

162
00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:23.625
Minamida sprained his ankle.

163
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.025
I wonder if he can make a surprise attack with his leg in a cast.

164
00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:29.025
He would never be able to do something like that.

165
00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:30.725
He may have been threatened with the knife

166
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:33.225
and forced to go up somewhere, and stabbed from below.

167
00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:35.025
That's not possible.

168
00:09:35.025 --> 00:09:37.925
The victim, Mr. Kitamura is a ranking judo belt owner,

169
00:09:37.925 --> 00:09:40.325
so he wouldn't be intimidated by Minamida sticking a knife at him.

170
00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:43.025
Everyone around him says Mr. Kitamura was probably strong

171
00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:45.025
enough to attack Minamida instead.

172
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:47.325
True, no matter how you look at it.

173
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:50.625
Does that mean the difference in height is what's protecting Minamida?

174
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:53.325
What? You've got another picture!

175
00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:55.325
No, Conan!

176
00:09:57.725 --> 00:10:01.525
What? This man's wearing glasses?

177
00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.225
He's not wearing them in the other picture.

178
00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:06.025
Oh, these are reading glasses.

179
00:10:06.025 --> 00:10:09.225
Reading glasses are something you wear when reading something, right?

180
00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:12.325
Does that mean that Mr. Kitamura was attacked

181
00:10:12.325 --> 00:10:14.725
when he was reading something?

182
00:10:14.725 --> 00:10:17.625
But there's nothing like that in this room.

183
00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:21.725
Right, the thing that Mr. Kitamura was supposedly reading back then

184
00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:23.325
is nowhere in sight.

185
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:25.325
The problem is that something is gone

186
00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:27.825
and Minamida took it with him.

187
00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:30.225
Oh! You're right on, Officer Takagi!

188
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:32.125
What on earth could it be?

189
00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:35.425
We still don't know why he took it with him.

190
00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.025
Hey, are these slippers the president's?

191
00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:39.625
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:42.825
What about when Mr. Minamida came the day before yesterday?

193
00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:44.725
Of course he was wearing them.

194
00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:47.025
Mr. Minamida was barefoot though.

195
00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:51.225
But, why are the slippers over here like this?

196
00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:53.525
They probably came off from the impact when he was stabbed!

197
00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:55.625
Impact?

198
00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.725
But isn't it strange that they came off from the impact

199
00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.325
when he was stabbed?

200
00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:02.325
What?

201
00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:04.725
Because they're nicely in place

202
00:11:04.725 --> 00:11:08.025
just as if someone had put them in place, right?

203
00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:10.025
I haven't touched them!

204
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:12.725
The slippers have been this way since the body was found.

205
00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:16.125
They came off.

206
00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:20.125
If not so, Mr. Minamida took them off after he killed the victim?

207
00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:22.525
Why would he go out of his way to do something like that?

208
00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:24.025
You think so, don't you?

209
00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:27.425
Or maybe Mr. Kitamura took them off himself?

210
00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:28.925
That's it!

211
00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:32.225
But, why would he do something like that?

212
00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:33.925
I can't figure it out!

213
00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:36.725
Stabbed from the front diagonally below.

214
00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:37.925
Height difference.

215
00:11:44.025 --> 00:11:45.825
A ladder?

216
00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:46.925
What?

217
00:11:49.025 --> 00:11:50.425
What did he do?

218
00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:54.525
President Kitamura.

219
00:11:54.525 --> 00:11:56.325
What did he do?

220
00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:57.525
With the ladder?

221
00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:02.325
This is it!

222
00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:07.125
But wait, why did Minamida think up something like this?

223
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:10.025
Why would an ordinary chef think up the trick of disguising his height

224
00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:12.425
by doing something like this?

225
00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:13.525
Why?

226
00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:23.447
What were you waiting for?

227
00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:30.947
At first, we thought it was a crime committed on the spur of the moment.

228
00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:33.647
But after watching you, we've come to understand

229
00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:36.647
that it was a carefully thought out murder.

230
00:12:36.647 --> 00:12:41.747
If so, there's got to be a reason why you stayed in the president's room

231
00:12:41.747 --> 00:12:44.247
from 1 pm to 6 pm.

232
00:12:44.247 --> 00:12:46.647
You had another purpose other than asking him

233
00:12:46.647 --> 00:12:48.847
to extend the time of repayment of the debt.

234
00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.547
Five hours in the president's office.

235
00:12:50.547 --> 00:12:54.047
Just what were you waiting for?

236
00:12:56.347 --> 00:12:57.747
A miracle.

237
00:12:57.747 --> 00:12:58.947
I guess.

238
00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:10.247
Officer Takagi.

239
00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:12.047
I've found out something absurd!

240
00:13:12.047 --> 00:13:14.047
But, this is only a deduction.

241
00:13:14.047 --> 00:13:16.947
I need evidence that will lead him to confess. Evidence.

242
00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:18.047
What?

243
00:13:19.247 --> 00:13:22.147
Something absurd?

244
00:13:22.147 --> 00:13:24.447
Another absurd thing.

245
00:13:24.447 --> 00:13:26.847
I hope it's not bad news.

246
00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:28.847
Ten years ago, there was a series of random killings

247
00:13:28.847 --> 00:13:31.047
within the Minato Police Station.

248
00:13:31.047 --> 00:13:32.847
The person who was arrested back then

249
00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:36.047
was Yuichi Minamida who was a company employee!

250
00:13:38.247 --> 00:13:39.947
Although Minamida denied this,

251
00:13:39.947 --> 00:13:42.547
the prosecutor had confidence and indicted him.

252
00:13:42.547 --> 00:13:47.747
But the evidence that his lawyers submitted saved Minamida.

253
00:13:47.747 --> 00:13:49.247
That proof was the angle of the stab wound

254
00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:51.247
that the random killer left behind.

255
00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.847
It was proven that with his height,

256
00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:55.947
Minamida wouldn't have been able to stab anyone at that angle.

257
00:13:55.947 --> 00:13:59.447
Moreover, during his hearing a new killer was arrested.

258
00:13:59.447 --> 00:14:00.947
And the case was solved.

259
00:14:02.447 --> 00:14:05.747
Which means that Minamida knew from the start

260
00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:07.347
that the height difference between him

261
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.347
and the victim would serve as evidence in court?

262
00:14:09.347 --> 00:14:12.847
I see! That's why he thought up this trick.

263
00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:15.147
Right. In this case,

264
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:17.947
a trick involving height difference was used!

265
00:14:17.947 --> 00:14:20.947
A trick using height difference is involved.

266
00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:26.347
And what kind of trick is that, Officer Sato?

267
00:14:26.347 --> 00:14:28.547
I haven't figured it out yet.

268
00:14:28.547 --> 00:14:31.847
I'll go report this to Inspector Megure.

269
00:14:31.847 --> 00:14:34.147
Officer Takagi, go back to headquarters right away too!

270
00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:39.547
I'm going back to headquarters then.

271
00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:41.347
Thank you so very much!

272
00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:42.347
No problem.

273
00:14:42.347 --> 00:14:46.047
Hey, you said Mr. Kitamura's height is 166 cm.

274
00:14:46.047 --> 00:14:49.747
It that really tall for an adult or too short?

275
00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:52.347
I want to become an adult quickly too,

276
00:14:52.347 --> 00:14:53.847
because it's inconvenient being a child.

277
00:14:53.847 --> 00:14:57.647
When things are in high places, I've got to use a ladder.

278
00:14:58.747 --> 00:15:00.847
Adults are lucky at that point

279
00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:03.247
because they don't have to use a ladder.

280
00:15:03.247 --> 00:15:04.647
A ladder.

281
00:15:04.647 --> 00:15:06.947
That's not really true.

282
00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.947
When cleaning the air conditioner and changing light bulbs,

283
00:15:09.947 --> 00:15:12.447
even Dad uses a ladder.

284
00:15:12.447 --> 00:15:13.747
Light bulbs?

285
00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:16.647
If the light bulbs were out at that time...

286
00:15:16.647 --> 00:15:17.747
No way.

287
00:15:17.747 --> 00:15:20.647
You mean the lights so conveniently went out back then?

288
00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:25.147
Conan!

289
00:15:25.147 --> 00:15:29.247
My mother used to always say, "Turn on the lights when it gets dark."

290
00:15:29.247 --> 00:15:30.447
Conan!

291
00:15:30.447 --> 00:15:34.147
She used to say that we'll ruin our eyes if we read in dark places.

292
00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:35.947
In dark places. A book?

293
00:15:39.347 --> 00:15:41.347
Reading glasses and...

294
00:15:41.347 --> 00:15:42.547
light bulbs.

295
00:15:45.147 --> 00:15:46.447
Slippers!

296
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.547
I see!

297
00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:51.847
You guys get going home too! Okay?

298
00:15:54.647 --> 00:15:56.847
All that I need now is proof to make him confess what he did.

299
00:15:58.047 --> 00:16:01.247
Officer Takagi! He seems to have hit upon an idea!

300
00:16:03.647 --> 00:16:05.247
Mr. Yuichi Minamida.

301
00:16:05.247 --> 00:16:07.247
The thing that you waited for five hours

302
00:16:07.247 --> 00:16:10.547
in Mr. Kitamura's president's room

303
00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:12.647
was sundown, right?

304
00:16:12.647 --> 00:16:14.247
Sundown?

305
00:16:17.847 --> 00:16:21.047
Why would I have to wait for sundown?

306
00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:25.547
Because that's when Mr. Kitamura turns on the lights of the office.

307
00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:29.047
But the chandelier did not turn on that day.

308
00:16:29.047 --> 00:16:34.147
Mr. Kitamura, who wanted to check out what was wrong, climbed a ladder.

309
00:16:34.147 --> 00:16:35.947
You took this opportunity

310
00:16:35.947 --> 00:16:41.447
to stab Mr. Kitamura who is 20 cm shorter than you from below.

311
00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:43.247
Ridiculous.

312
00:16:43.247 --> 00:16:46.847
Are you saying that the bulbs just happened to go out on that day?

313
00:16:46.847 --> 00:16:49.247
Are you saying that I knew the bulbs were going to go out?

314
00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:51.747
The bulbs didn't go out.

315
00:16:51.747 --> 00:16:52.947
You loosened them!

316
00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.547
What do you think you're doing?

317
00:16:56.547 --> 00:16:58.547
I know just what you're after!

318
00:16:58.547 --> 00:16:59.547
Let go of me!

319
00:16:59.547 --> 00:17:01.547
You schemed it from the very start!

320
00:17:01.547 --> 00:17:04.247
-Let go! -You were after my land to begin with!

321
00:17:14.347 --> 00:17:15.947
Eating, going to the restroom,

322
00:17:15.947 --> 00:17:16.947
if you stick it out for five hours,

323
00:17:16.947 --> 00:17:18.747
you had all the opportunity in the world to wait for Mr. Kitamura

324
00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.247
to leave the office.

325
00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:21.347
You probably loosened the bulbs

326
00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:23.347
when he left to go check on machine trouble.

327
00:17:23.347 --> 00:17:26.747
Mr. Kitamura left the room for 30 minutes.

328
00:17:26.747 --> 00:17:27.947
How can you be sure that

329
00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:31.747
Kitamura would check the bulbs of the chandelier himself?

330
00:17:31.747 --> 00:17:35.047
He's so haughty, it's more likely that he'd call one of his employees.

331
00:17:35.047 --> 00:17:36.447
In order for him not to do so,

332
00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:38.947
you handed over some important documents

333
00:17:38.947 --> 00:17:42.047
after it started getting dark.

334
00:17:42.047 --> 00:17:44.247
His reading glasses told us so.

335
00:17:44.247 --> 00:17:46.447
What? Reading glasses?

336
00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:51.747
The dead body was wearing reading glasses.

337
00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:53.147
He was reading something,

338
00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:56.147
no rather, it's evidence that he was trying to read something.

339
00:17:56.147 --> 00:18:00.347
That something was also very important to the killer.

340
00:18:00.347 --> 00:18:03.147
It was the deed for the land,

341
00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:04.847
where your shop is that Mr. Kitamura wanted, wasn't it?

342
00:18:07.947 --> 00:18:10.147
So, you've finally decided to give this to me.

343
00:18:24.347 --> 00:18:26.847
It's not a black out.

344
00:18:26.847 --> 00:18:28.947
Darn it! Not again.

345
00:18:28.947 --> 00:18:30.847
Why at a time like this?

346
00:18:32.347 --> 00:18:34.747
You set it up so that he checked the light himself

347
00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:37.247
because he would find calling one of his employee is a waste of time.

348
00:18:38.747 --> 00:18:41.247
What's this?

349
00:18:41.247 --> 00:18:43.147
They're just loose.

350
00:18:49.647 --> 00:18:51.747
You admit to your crime, don't you?

351
00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:59.447
His reading glasses and slippers will probably serve as evidence

352
00:18:59.447 --> 00:19:01.247
that Mr. Kitamura climbed the ladder.

353
00:19:01.247 --> 00:19:05.347
But that's not proof that I loosened the bulbs.

354
00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:07.647
Takagi.

355
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.447
Officer Takagi.

356
00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:12.947
Hey, hey.

357
00:19:14.147 --> 00:19:15.147
Oh, yes!

358
00:19:15.147 --> 00:19:16.547
It's me, Mouri.

359
00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:19.147
Mr. Mouri!

360
00:19:19.147 --> 00:19:21.147
I heard about the case from Ran.

361
00:19:21.147 --> 00:19:24.147
Did Minamida confess?

362
00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:25.647
A little bit more.

363
00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:30.047
He demanded that I show him proof that he rigged the chandelier.

364
00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:31.847
Not having proof is the proof.

365
00:19:31.847 --> 00:19:34.747
What? Just what do you mean?

366
00:19:34.747 --> 00:19:36.547
Yes...

367
00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:40.447
I see! I understand, I'll do so right away!

368
00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:42.747
Inspector! I'm going to check with the forensic officers!

369
00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:46.447
Hey, Takagi! Takagi!

370
00:19:46.447 --> 00:19:49.347
What on earth is on his mind, anyway?

371
00:19:49.347 --> 00:19:52.447
Okay! This is it for now!

372
00:19:52.447 --> 00:19:54.447
-For now? -Yes.

373
00:19:57.047 --> 00:20:01.247
Mr. Minamida, all culprits make mistakes.

374
00:20:01.247 --> 00:20:03.647
There was one more thing besides the glasses and the slippers.

375
00:20:03.647 --> 00:20:05.047
After committing the murder,

376
00:20:05.047 --> 00:20:08.047
you wiped off your fingerprints from the knife, the murder weapon.

377
00:20:08.047 --> 00:20:12.747
At the same time, you naturally wiped off your fingerprints

378
00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:14.447
from the bulbs that you loosened.

379
00:20:16.647 --> 00:20:20.647
Yes, the fact that it's not there may sometimes serves as proof.

380
00:20:20.647 --> 00:20:23.147
I checked again with the forensic officer

381
00:20:23.147 --> 00:20:24.347
whether any fingerprints were found on the chandelier.

382
00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:27.747
No fingerprints were found whatsoever.

383
00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:30.747
Mr. Kitamura's fingerprints that were supposed to be there weren't either.

384
00:20:32.247 --> 00:20:34.347
I confirmed with his bereaved family too.

385
00:20:34.347 --> 00:20:38.047
The bulbs of the chandelier also went out a month ago,

386
00:20:38.047 --> 00:20:41.247
and it seems Mr. Kitamura himself changed the bulbs.

387
00:20:41.247 --> 00:20:42.747
And yet, no one's fingerprints were found.

388
00:20:42.747 --> 00:20:45.747
This is proof that someone obviously rigged the bulbs.

389
00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:47.747
The trick that you used of making Mr. Kitamura climb the ladder

390
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.647
and stabbing him from below

391
00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:53.147
is the same trick of height difference and angle of the stab wound

392
00:20:53.147 --> 00:20:56.547
that served as proof to your innocence 10 years ago, Mr. Minamida.

393
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:59.947
On the contrary, this time lead to accusing you as the killer.

394
00:21:06.547 --> 00:21:09.247
Ten years ago, I was innocent.

395
00:21:09.247 --> 00:21:13.947
But my company fired me as soon as I was arrested.

396
00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:16.547
My father was the only one who believed me.

397
00:21:16.547 --> 00:21:19.847
The shop was the dream of my father who died a year ago.

398
00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:22.647
It's his dream that I had to take over and protect.

399
00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:26.447
Kitamura tried to take that away from me!

400
00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:28.547
He's the real criminal!

401
00:21:28.547 --> 00:21:32.147
But, no matter what reasons you may have,

402
00:21:32.147 --> 00:21:33.847
what value is there to a dream that you must protect

403
00:21:33.847 --> 00:21:35.647
at the expense of someone's life?

404
00:23:12.847 --> 00:23:14.147
-At Sanchome! -At Sanchome!

405
00:23:14.147 --> 00:23:15.147
There's a black demon!

406
00:23:15.147 --> 00:23:16.747
What did he just say?

407
00:23:20.047 --> 00:23:21.147
-I don't know! -Yes!

408
00:23:21.147 --> 00:23:22.147
This is the Mouri Detective Agency.

409
00:23:22.147 --> 00:23:24.147
Officer Takagi, what's up?

410
00:23:24.147 --> 00:23:26.747
Yes! Thanks to you, he confessed!

411
00:23:26.747 --> 00:23:28.047
What? Confessed?

412
00:23:28.047 --> 00:23:29.847
-We're back! -What?

413
00:23:29.847 --> 00:23:31.547
Minamida? What?

414
00:23:31.547 --> 00:23:33.647
Thank you so very much!

415
00:23:33.647 --> 00:23:34.847
Goodbye.

416
00:23:36.547 --> 00:23:38.847
What is he talking about?

417
00:23:38.847 --> 00:23:40.647
Hey, what's the matter, Pops?

418
00:23:42.947 --> 00:23:46.647
He said Minamida confessed and thank you.

419
00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:48.047
All right.

420
00:23:48.047 --> 00:23:50.647
Don't tell me something happened again without my knowing?

421
00:23:51.747 --> 00:23:54.547
It's pretty interesting being a detective!

422
00:23:54.547 --> 00:23:57.247
I agree with you, Pops!

423
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.847
"Next Episode"

424
00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:04.147
Police.

425
00:24:05.347 --> 00:24:07.447
A kidnapping case.

426
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.247
The time limit is 5 pm.

427
00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:11.547
There's only an hour and a half to go!

428
00:24:11.547 --> 00:24:15.047
Maybe the real purpose behind this kidnapping is...

429
00:24:15.047 --> 00:24:16.847
What the...

430
00:24:16.847 --> 00:24:18.847
There's another mastermind.

431
00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:20.647
If so, something is odd.

432
00:24:24.247 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "A Mock Kidnap... Case"

433
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.374
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:32.374 --> 00:24:34.874
"Oil"

435
00:24:34.874 --> 00:24:36.274
I received cookies today.

436
00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.474
-What? From who? -You want some?

437
00:24:37.474 --> 00:24:39.474
-That's not what I mean. -I'm not giving you any.
