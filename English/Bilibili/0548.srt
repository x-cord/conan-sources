1
00:00:01,491 --> 00:00:03,191
The president of a game company,

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:06,891
Mr. Kazuyoshi Onda was shot to death.

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,591
"Ryosuke Oomine (24)" -And a man called Ryosuke Oomine

4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,891
emerged as the prime suspect.

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,891
Oomine takes a girl hostage at the shopping mall

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,891
in order to flee.

7
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,291
I, who just happened to be there

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,191
successfully rescued the girl

9
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:25,591
but ended up as the culprit's hostage in her place.

10
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,991
Oomine brushes the police away

11
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,891
and hides in the basement of a certain building.

12
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:35,591
I confirmed that Oomine didn't have a gun on him...

13
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:38,691
and attempt to escape.

14
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:43,891
We were suddenly fired at by someone with a gun in the dark.

15
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,391
Oomine, protected me from the gun fire,

16
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,491
despite risking getting hurt himself.

17
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:51,691
Is he really a murderer?

18
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:55,391
There could be something more

19
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:58,491
behind the President Onda murder case.

20
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,791
When Detective Takagi almost spotted us,

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,591
Professor Agasa sped by as per our request.

22
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,591
Because of him, we were saved.

23
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:11,791
Yes, I can't afford to let them arrest him now.

24
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,891
Not until I get to reveal the truth

25
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,891
that is hidden.

26
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,391
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

27
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:27,691
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

28
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,491
A queer kidnap case,

29
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,091
I, the hostage discloses who the real culprit is.

30
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,691
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,391
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:37,391
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,839
"Two Days with the Culprit (2nd Day)"

34
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,539
Conan!

35
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,139
Are you all right?

36
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,039
I'm worry.

37
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,539
Ran!

38
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,739
I'm glad. That you've come back safely, Conan.

39
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,039
You!

40
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,839
Ran, wait!

41
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,339
He may not be the culprit.

42
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,439
"Received Call: Oomine"

43
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,939
Go ahead and answer it.

44
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,839
Isn't that what you're here for?

45
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,839
It's me.

46
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,439
Oomine?

47
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,039
Who are you?

48
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,539
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

49
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,939
Kogoro Mouri?

50
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,739
-Put Kanayama on the phone! -Hey, don't move!

51
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,339
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,339
Let me hear Conan's voice, first.

53
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,639
Don't be ridiculous, you!

54
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,539
Conan is fine! You don't have to worry!

55
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,739
Ran, don't tell me you've been taken hostage, too!

56
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,439
No.

57
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,539
Hurry up and put Kanayama on!

58
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,239
What going on?

59
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,839
Here, he says to put you on.

60
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,139
Okay.

61
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,139
"Kanayama Seiichi (24)" -Oomine.

62
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,439
"Game Creator" -You idiot! We're in big trouble,

63
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,839
so answer the phone, will you?

64
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,339
Sorry, sorry.

65
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,939
I'll give you the address, so bring a car over!

66
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,439
Ask Momoko to do it.

67
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,239
Get the address.

68
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,739
The cops came because I was waiting for Momoko at the market.

69
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:11,839
Momoko?

70
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,039
Just bring a car, will you.

71
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,239
I'm getting out of Tokyo.

72
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,539
The address is...

73
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:22,339
Just tell him that it's Dr. Agasa's house.

74
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:25,139
Dr. Agasa's house?

75
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,339
Don't tell me that Dr. Agasa's being held hostage too?

76
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,739
Okay, here goes.

77
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:33,439
Momoko is the woman

78
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,839
that was talking on that a while ago?

79
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,339
She's Onda's secretary.

80
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,539
We used to drink a lot together, with Oomine, too.

81
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,539
Please go, Mr. Mouri.

82
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,739
I don't have to go, do I?

83
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,239
Did you have that pistol from before?

84
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:00,739
I bought it on the internet.

85
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:04,239
I was told it was loaded with blank and yet...

86
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,339
Blank?

87
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,639
A gun mania remodeled an old metal gun

88
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,139
and was selling it.

89
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,139
But it's not the kind you can really fire.

90
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,239
"Homemade Gun Sale" -The bullets are blank that look

91
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,839
just like real bullets.

92
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,039
So, I ordered 1 revolver

93
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,539
and three blank bullets.

94
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:26,239
I just took it with me to threaten Onda.

95
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,839
"Caution" -It even said that the bullets are blank...

96
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,539
"Do not fire at people." -on the instruction sheet.

97
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,439
But, it turned out to be real when you fired it?

98
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,439
Yes.

99
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,839
And what did you do with that pistol?

100
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,839
I threw it away.

101
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,839
I thought that I was in bad trouble.

102
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,039
I haven't heard any news

103
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,939
reporting that the gun was found though.

104
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,539
Why don't we go there?

105
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,539
Don't be ridiculous!

106
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,439
I'm getting out of here when the car comes!

107
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,339
Kanayama!

108
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,539
Dad!

109
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,639
Renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri

110
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
has captured the murderer Ryosuke Oomine!

111
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,539
I sure hope it turns out that way.

112
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,739
Mr. Oomine may have been taken advantage of by someone.

113
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:53,439
Just what are you talking about, brat?

114
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,239
It seems that the bullet that was fired from Mr. Oomine's gun

115
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:58,039
was a blank.

116
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,639
We need to find the gun that he fired, right?

117
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,039
Come to think of it, the gun hasn't been found yet.

118
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:08,939
Okay, let's look for it!

119
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,739
First let's try going to the building where you threw the gun away.

120
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,539
You heard the gun hit something after you threw it, right?

121
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,039
Right.

122
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,439
If so, it's most likely that

123
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,239
it hit the wall of the building.

124
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,139
There it is.

125
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,939
This way!

126
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:38,239
The scratch is still new.

127
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:42,539
There's probably no doubt that the gun hit here.

128
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,539
If it hit here, it wouldn't bounce too far, right?

129
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,339
Right.

130
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,839
Some parts are damp.

131
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,339
Someone must've walked around.

132
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:56,939
Could it be that...

133
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:00,439
If someone tried to frame Mr. Oomine,

134
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,439
maybe the real culprit came to retrieve it?

135
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,939
When you threw the gun away,

136
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,439
weren't they doing something at the building?

137
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:11,939
To think that I would be able to meet

138
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,139
the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri.

139
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,739
It's such an honor!

140
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:17,439
I'm sure glad that I work as a security guard!

141
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,339
Oh, is that right? Lucky you, lucky you.

142
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,439
I actually want to become a detective myself.

143
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,439
I'll quit this job right away,

144
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,939
so would you please use me as your assistant, sir?

145
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:32,539
This is a device for wiping windows, isn't it?

146
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,739
Yeah, don't dare touch it, brat.

147
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,939
What's with that remark of yours, mister?

148
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:40,339
Oh, I'm sorry!

149
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,639
Does this go up and down along the rail of the building?

150
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,539
Exactly, little mister.

151
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,139
Is it fully automatic?

152
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,239
Exactly.

153
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:54,939
Did you wipe the windows last night?

154
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,239
Yes, I did.

155
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:59,239
The windows over there by the corridor.

156
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:01,939
I do it at night

157
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,939
because if I do it in the day time, the soap drips

158
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,939
and causes inconvenience to the tenants.

159
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,939
The reason for the wet ground

160
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,039
is the soap from the window wiping device.

161
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,039
There it is.

162
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,239
Detective Mouri, please.

163
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,639
Here it is!

164
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:29,539
When Mr. Oomine threw the gun,

165
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:32,439
the automatic window wiping device was operating.

166
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,539
The gun that Mr. Oomine threw

167
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:42,339
fell right on the window wiping device that came right below it.

168
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,339
Then, together with the window wiping device

169
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,139
that came back to the roof

170
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,739
after it finished its session and fell here.

171
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,139
This is very well made

172
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,739
but it's a fake.

173
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,539
Because there's gunpowder in the cartridge.

174
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:11,239
Which means that if you fire it, a gunshot will sound,

175
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,439
but the bullet will shatter from the impact.

176
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,539
Then, why did President Onda die?

177
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:19,039
Isn't it because someone shot him?

178
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,939
-What? -The real killer who was hiding somewhere

179
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,739
in the park...

180
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:33,239
fired his gun the instant...

181
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,039
Mr. Oomine fired the blank

182
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,039
and killed President Onda.

183
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,939
I see.

184
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,739
Then, there are three suspects for now.

185
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,639
Game creator, Seiichi Kanayama.

186
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:54,039
The president's secretary, Momoko Uemiya

187
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,739
and vice president, Satoshi Kanda.

188
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:01,639
Kanayama was on bad terms with Onda because of money matters.

189
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,339
Uemiya probably had relationship problems with him.

190
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,939
And Kanda is said to have been going through power harassment.

191
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,539
But, didn't President Onda have many problems

192
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,339
regarding his work?

193
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,239
Oh, right.

194
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:19,739
I mean, stop being cheeky, you brat!

195
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,139
How did you find the website of the guy

196
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,339
that sold you the gun on the internet?

197
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,139
Well. You see...

198
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,539
What're you hiding? Be honest and spit it out!

199
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,839
It's Momoko.

200
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,439
What?

201
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,139
Momoko said that I should possess a gun or something

202
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:44,439
because Onda was a candidate for the Olympic games in Judo.

203
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,339
Therefore, she told me about the gun mania website.

204
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,939
I see.

205
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,139
Keep out of this! Children's time is over.

206
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,939
Doc.

207
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,839
I've got one more place

208
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,339
I want to go to.

209
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,439
Why is it you have so many spare keys?

210
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,039
When I came to Tokyo,

211
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,839
I was working as security guard for this building.

212
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,439
I made the keys back then.

213
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,139
At that time...

214
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,439
What was that sound?

215
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:39,339
I see.

216
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:40,539
Hey!

217
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,539
So that's how it was.

218
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,939
Hey, what're you doing, kid?

219
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:05,539
Who knew that you used to work as a security guard here?

220
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:10,639
Knayama, Momoko, and vice president, Mr. Kanda.

221
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,039
What kind of person is Mr. Kanda?

222
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,639
He looks after Kanayama a lot.

223
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,839
"Satoshi Kanda (32)" -He used to take me drinking a lot

224
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,839
along with Kanayama.

225
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,239
He's kind person.

226
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,339
Have you ever acted on stage?

227
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,239
What kind of question is that, out of the blue?

228
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:45,378
"OnDack"

229
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,578
"President's Office"

230
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,778
Hey, we can't have you come in...

231
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:50,778
Mr. Mouri?

232
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:53,778
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

233
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:56,178
I heard from Mr. Kanayama

234
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,778
that you meet Oomine at Dr. Agasa's residence.

235
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,078
Yes, sir.

236
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,678
Inspector, Oomine is not the culprit.

237
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:06,178
The real culprit is someone else.

238
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,978
What are you saying?

239
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:11,478
Could you call Ms. Momoko Uemiya?

240
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,678
"Momoko Uemiya (24), Onda's Secretary"

241
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:18,078
So the actors have all lined up here.

242
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,978
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

243
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:23,178
Let me explain in order.

244
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:25,978
First, this case started with the trouble

245
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:29,578
between President Onda and Mr. Kanayama.

246
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:33,178
The game software that Mr. Kanayama made was a great hit,

247
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:35,678
and yet despite the big profit that was gained,

248
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,978
the cause of the trouble was because

249
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:42,678
President Onda didn't pay Mr. Kanayama much.

250
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:45,578
Mr. Kanayama who was outraged

251
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,478
bad mouthed President Onda to Mr. Oomine.

252
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:51,178
After hearing about this, Oomine offered

253
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,878
to threaten President Onda.

254
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:57,278
Then, Momoko Uemiya comes along.

255
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,578
Mr. Kanayama and Ms. Uemiya are colleagues at the same company,

256
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:03,378
and they used to go with each other at one time.

257
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:07,378
Oomine was in love with Momoko.

258
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:11,378
Are you're saying that I got him into this?

259
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:13,078
Exactly.

260
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:14,878
Don't be ridiculous!

261
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:18,578
You told Oomine of the gun mania website

262
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,978
that sold guns...

263
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,278
I got advertisement mail from that website,

264
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:24,778
that's why I told him about it,

265
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:26,678
that's all there was to it.

266
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,378
Cut it out!

267
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,678
Oomine? Conan!

268
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:36,678
Don't move! I'm going to blow this kid up!

269
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:39,378
Please don't make a fuss because he'll shoot me!

270
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:43,378
Bastard! I could've showed everybody what I can do, and yet...

271
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,778
Gather by the wall! The wall!

272
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:49,478
Let me go!

273
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:59,078
Don't! It's dangerous!

274
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:13,078
You're being to reckless, Mr. Kanda.

275
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,378
I... I guess I got carried away.

276
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:18,778
Thanks to the brat, it's gotten out of hand.

277
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,478
Oomine, resign yourself.

278
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,578
Wait, please!

279
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:33,078
I haven't finished talking yet.

280
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,578
Mr. Mouri?

281
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:37,778
How far did I go?

282
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:40,178
You were saying that Ms. Uemiya was a suspect.

283
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,978
That's not right!

284
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,278
What?

285
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:44,478
But, you just said so...

286
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:47,078
The important point is who will benefit most

287
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:50,678
from President Onda dying.

288
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:54,178
I get no cash even if the president were to die.

289
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:55,878
It's not me, either.

290
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:57,778
After all, I reported to the police

291
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:00,278
that I got a call from Mr. Oomine!

292
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:04,678
Then, the only one left is you.

293
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:07,378
What? Why're you looking at me?

294
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,878
You're gallant, aren't you?

295
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:11,678
Because you had the guts to pounce on Mr. Oomine

296
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:13,078
who is wanted for murder

297
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:15,878
and possesses a gun on top of that.

298
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:19,678
Well, I was desperate to save everyone.

299
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,078
Isn't it because you knew

300
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:24,178
that Oomine's gun was filled with blank?

301
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:27,678
That's because you're the one

302
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:31,078
who sold the blank bullets and gun to Mr. Oomine.

303
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:33,378
The one who killed President Onda

304
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,478
is you, Mr. Kanda!

305
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:39,778
No way. What a crazy thing to say!

306
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:44,378
President Onda power harassed you.

307
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,478
Isn't that right, Mr. Kanayama?

308
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:50,678
Mr. Kanda became the target of the president's bullying.

309
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:53,578
After finding out that Mr. Kanayama

310
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,578
had a grudge against the president,

311
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:59,478
you schemed to take advantage of his fact.

312
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:01,078
If Mr. Onda disappears,

313
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:03,778
you'll become the president.

314
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:06,278
As a gun mania, you remodeled the metal model gun

315
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,978
that you had hidden,

316
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,578
made a website to sell the gun

317
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:14,678
and sent the mail address to Momoko.

318
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,078
Just as you intended,

319
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:19,578
Momoko sent the address of the website to Mr. Oomine.

320
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:22,178
Mr. Oomine bought the remodeled gun

321
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,278
and blank bullets from you.

322
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:26,978
As for the blank, you probably remodeled the bullets

323
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:31,078
that you secretly brought back from abroad.

324
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:35,278
And at the same time that Mr. Oomine shot the blank...

325
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:41,278
you fired a real bullet using the other remodeled gun that you made!

326
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:47,578
After that, you needed to retrieve Mr. Oomine's gun

327
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:51,178
to hide the fact that his gun was loaded with blanks.

328
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:02,278
You desperately went to look for the gun

329
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:04,578
but you couldn't find it.

330
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,478
Where do you think it was?

331
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:17,578
It was on the automatic window wiping machine

332
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:22,178
and carried all the way up to the roof.

333
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,578
I see.

334
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:25,678
It's a great deduction.

335
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:28,578
However, do you have proof?

336
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:30,978
That I remodeled a gun

337
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,778
or even went to search for it.

338
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:35,478
If you went to search for the gun,

339
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:37,478
the soil around the building

340
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:39,278
and the soap from the window wiping machine

341
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,578
should be on your shoes.

342
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:44,778
And one more thing,

343
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,678
the culprit has a wounded right finger.

344
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:55,878
Mr. Oomine who took Conan hostage

345
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:59,178
was shot at in the basement of the building.

346
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,678
But, remodeled guns

347
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:02,778
are not all that strong to begin with.

348
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:09,678
Here, this.

349
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,978
Oh, thank you.

350
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,978
-There's blood on it. -Yes.

351
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:16,678
If you check the blood,

352
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:19,978
you'll find that it's vice president Kanda's.

353
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:35,578
Compensate for what you did and re-do your life once again.

354
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:37,878
Sorry, that things had to turn out this way

355
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:40,778
just because of me.

356
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,678
It's okay.

357
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:45,878
I guess it's a good chance

358
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:48,678
to go straight!

359
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:50,378
That's good.

360
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,378
-Really? -Yep.

361
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,478
What's the matter?

362
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:02,978
The case has already been solved.

363
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:04,778
Oh, good work.

364
00:22:04,778 --> 00:22:07,478
Oh, well...

365
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,278
You must've been scared, Conan.

366
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:35,978
No big deal.

367
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:37,678
Since you went through a frightening experience.

368
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:40,978
I'll make something delicious for you to eat today.

369
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:41,978
Thank you.

370
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:44,378
Found the brat!

371
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:47,878
Well, you really come in handy.

372
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:50,578
If we go to along with an grade school kid,

373
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:53,378
we get to eat Miracle Mille Crepe at Patisserie Matsui

374
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,778
for half price!

375
00:23:55,778 --> 00:23:57,078
I... I've got something to do,

376
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:59,278
so if you will excuse me.

377
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,178
Hold it!

378
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:04,478
I would sure like you to half price your crazy ideas.

379
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:06,578
I can get points for this, too!

380
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:11,378
"Next Episode" -Wow, fantastic!

381
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,678
The sushi's going around.

382
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:15,178
Don't move!

383
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:17,178
I'm going to tell the police later

384
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:19,178
if any of you move from where you are.

385
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:21,278
I thought that Mr. Mouri was the one

386
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:23,378
attracting bad cases,

387
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,478
but it could be you.

388
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:29,278
Not letting anybody pick up the poisoned dish.

389
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,378
A method in which only the victim is targeted.

390
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:37,602
Next Conan, "Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 1)"

391
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,955
Next Conan's Hint:

392
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:57,155
"Clockwise"

393
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:58,255
What is clockwise?

394
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:00,055
Which way does it turn, right or left?

395
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:01,755
Either which way.
