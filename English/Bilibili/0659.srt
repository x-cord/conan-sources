1
00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.074
Giant Gomera's "Treacher"!

2
00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:37.874
Sure was good, wasn't it?

3
00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:40.874
Yep! Gomera was super awesome!

4
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.074
Just a while more and the Kokkaigijidon (Diet) building

5
00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:45.074
would've been squashed slim!

6
00:00:45.074 --> 00:00:48.174
It's called Kokkaigijido, not "don".

7
00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:49.574
I mean,

8
00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:52.174
they were saying the one they played the other day was going to be final.

9
00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:54.274
Gomera really keeps going, doesn't it?

10
00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:57.974
I hear that they'll be playing the "Revolution" in six months.

11
00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.774
Well, I'd like to see it, if you ask me, though.

12
00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:06.674
Okay, then. We'll eat lunch at a family restaurant and...

13
00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:08.074
Where are the children?

14
00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:11.174
They were here till just a while ago.

15
00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:15.274
Hey! What're you guys doing?

16
00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.374
Conan, come and look!

17
00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:21.674
Fantastic!

18
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:27.374
Wow! There are a load of boxes of plastic models and figurines.

19
00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:30.674
There's a figure of Sprite Emera of Gomera too!

20
00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.974
It's the car of some freak for sure!

21
00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.574
-You're right. -Amazing.

22
00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:39.074
There are scratch marks around the keyhole.

23
00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:40.274
Don't tell me that...

24
00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:43.174
A car thief?

25
00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:44.574
Conan?

26
00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:48.274
What's with the smell of paint thinner?

27
00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:51.474
Where is it?

28
00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:52.674
This smell...

29
00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:53.874
Where's it coming from?

30
00:01:56.474 --> 00:01:58.774
"Die" -This is...

31
00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:19.474
If all cases were men,

32
00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.174
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

33
00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.974
That police detective officer's love suddenly accelerates

34
00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:24.874
during a joint investigation of car thefts.

35
00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.474
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:28.374
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:30.674
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:03.356
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 1)".

39
00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:09.056
Huh? What's going on?

40
00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:10.756
I wonder what happened.

41
00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:14.856
"Die" -What the...

42
00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:15.956
This is...

43
00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.556
My God!

44
00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:19.456
Who are these brats?

45
00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:22.556
What right do you have riding other people's cars?

46
00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:24.656
I... I'm sorry!

47
00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:26.456
Car thief!

48
00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:30.656
The word "Die" is written with red spray on the ceiling!

49
00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:33.756
Hey, hey, this is the police detective's car.

50
00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:35.156
Police detective?

51
00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:36.456
Huh?

52
00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:38.456
Conan?

53
00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:39.856
Officer Chiba?

54
00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:42.456
You mean this freak's car is yours, Chiba?

55
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:43.956
Freak?

56
00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:46.656
Because we saw loads of boxes of figurine

57
00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.956
lined up through the rear window.

58
00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.856
So, you came back to the car saying that you forgot something,

59
00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:55.456
just so you could take all this out of the bag and line them up?

60
00:04:55.456 --> 00:04:57.956
Sorry. I went out of my way to buy them,

61
00:04:57.956 --> 00:04:59.856
so I wanted to show them off.

62
00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:05.556
But "Die" on the ceiling is not comfortable.

63
00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:09.256
Don't tell me it's someone who hates the police.

64
00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:12.456
Maybe the culprit hates Officer Chiba?

65
00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:15.656
Because it doesn't look like an officer's car anyway.

66
00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.156
At any rate,

67
00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:19.556
I guess I'll contact Yumi of the Department of Transportation.

68
00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:25.456
What? There've been three incidents today already?

69
00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:27.656
A car thief using the same method?

70
00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:30.956
Yes, you're the fourth victim, Officer Chiba.

71
00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:34.256
Entitled, the Oil-Based Red Swoosh Spray!

72
00:05:34.256 --> 00:05:37.356
Oil based red swoosh?

73
00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.456
Because it's swooshed with oil-based spray paint?

74
00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:43.156
I tell you, you become target because you're an officer

75
00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:46.856
and yet you go on a shopping spree for things like these with your friend.

76
00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:48.356
I just came to keep him company shopping

77
00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:50.756
because it's my day off today.

78
00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:54.256
But, you like things like these too, don't you?

79
00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:57.056
I won't deny it, but...

80
00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:02.756
See, even our newcomer is laughing at you.

81
00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:05.156
I... I'm sorry!

82
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:09.456
Really, you haven't changed, Officer Chiba.

83
00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:13.956
Hey, doesn't that officer look familiar?

84
00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:15.156
Really?

85
00:06:15.156 --> 00:06:19.556
But Yumi called her new-comer,

86
00:06:19.556 --> 00:06:23.156
so I think she newly came to the Metropolitan Police Department.

87
00:06:23.156 --> 00:06:25.456
Masked Baiya.

88
00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.756
Baiya?

89
00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:30.256
This is the title of the SFX drama that Officer Chiba filmed

90
00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.856
when he was in grade school, right?

91
00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:35.956
It was playing at the end of the video, no?

92
00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:38.856
Thank you, Masked Baiya!

93
00:06:40.356 --> 00:06:41.356
Right!

94
00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:42.856
Twin tale!

95
00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:45.556
She's Officer Chiba's first love, right?

96
00:06:49.256 --> 00:06:53.056
But Chiba said he was brushed off, no?

97
00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:54.256
Right.

98
00:06:54.256 --> 00:06:57.556
Something about she finally got together with someone she loved

99
00:06:57.556 --> 00:07:00.156
and didn't even come to the class reunion.

100
00:07:00.156 --> 00:07:02.456
I wonder if she got married or something.

101
00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:05.556
No, judging from the looks of it,

102
00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:07.356
it seems that she's saying that

103
00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:10.456
she was able to become a police officer just like him.

104
00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:12.456
And, the reason why she didn't come to the class reunion was because

105
00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:16.756
she thought that Officer Chiba had forgotten about her.

106
00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:20.956
You mean, Officer Chiba mistakenly thought that he was brushed off?

107
00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:24.556
Yeah. Moreover, it seems that he doesn't even realized

108
00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:27.056
that the person in front of him

109
00:07:27.056 --> 00:07:30.556
is his first love, Naeko Miike either.

110
00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:34.556
My God, I wonder why all the police officers around us,

111
00:07:34.556 --> 00:07:37.256
that is, Officer Takagi and Inspector Shiratori too

112
00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.756
all mature so slowly and are dense as well.

113
00:07:38.756 --> 00:07:41.956
They're always in need of help and are super idiots.

114
00:07:41.956 --> 00:07:44.856
Well, maybe they're busy investigating

115
00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:48.256
and can't be bothered with things like that.

116
00:07:48.256 --> 00:07:49.356
You think so?

117
00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:51.656
How should I know? Don't ask me.

118
00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:55.056
I guess we shouldn't say much anymore.

119
00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:57.456
Either she tells the truth,

120
00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:01.756
or we just wait till Officer Chiba remembers her.

121
00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:04.856
Then, you're sure that nothing was stolen?

122
00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:07.056
No, nothing in particular.

123
00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:09.356
-Right? -Yes.

124
00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:13.356
Which means that the possibility of some freak being targeted

125
00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:14.656
cannot be ignored yet.

126
00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:15.756
What?

127
00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:18.756
Only the cars of freaks are being attacked?

128
00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:22.756
Please show him the picture of the first car that was victimized.

129
00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:23.756
Yes!

130
00:08:24.656 --> 00:08:26.856
This is the car.

131
00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:28.656
An Ita car.

132
00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:29.956
It's really well-drawn.

133
00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:34.156
Yeah. It's Emo-chan of Maho JK 48!

134
00:08:34.156 --> 00:08:37.656
Huh? What of this car is Italian?

135
00:08:37.656 --> 00:08:39.856
It's a Japanese car, no matter how you look at it, isn't it?

136
00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:42.256
No, not that Italian (Ita) car.

137
00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:44.656
It's an "Itai" (ouch) car, that's why it's called Ita car!

138
00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:47.356
Since the Moe character is printed on the car,

139
00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:50.256
the general public who sees this think it hurts,

140
00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:52.456
therefore, it's called Ita car, right?

141
00:08:52.456 --> 00:08:53.756
Yeah.

142
00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:56.856
Are the other cars that were attacked all Ita cars?

143
00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:59.256
Well, not really.

144
00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:03.156
The car beyond in the picture hasn't been attacked.

145
00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:04.656
And...

146
00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:08.356
what about the first and second cars that were attacked?

147
00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:09.456
Yes!

148
00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:12.256
The car of a salaried man on his way back from golf

149
00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:15.956
and a flashy remodeled hot rod owned by a hot rodder.

150
00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.756
I wonder of it's the work of a person

151
00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:19.656
attacking cars at random, just for fun?

152
00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:23.956
But, judging from the word "Die" written on the ceiling,

153
00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:28.156
it looks as if the victims may have something in common.

154
00:09:28.156 --> 00:09:31.756
This is the picture of the three victims.

155
00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:33.556
Do they look familiar?

156
00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:34.856
I wonder...

157
00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:37.156
If so, why don't you go help with

158
00:09:37.156 --> 00:09:39.856
the investigation of the car burglars too, Officer Chiba?

159
00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:41.456
Who? Me?

160
00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:46.056
You may remember something important while investigating.

161
00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:48.556
Besides, we'll help you too!

162
00:09:48.556 --> 00:09:50.156
Right.

163
00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.856
I mean, Officer Chiba, you're off duty and have a load of time.

164
00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:54.356
It's not that I don't have anything to do, you know.

165
00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:57.256
Hey, are similar car burglaries

166
00:09:57.256 --> 00:09:59.256
all happening in this area?

167
00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:00.456
Yes.

168
00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:03.956
I think all of them happened in the parking area within Beika-cho.

169
00:10:03.956 --> 00:10:06.256
Then, we'll go with Yumi

170
00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:09.956
to check out the parking areas on the west side and ask questions,

171
00:10:09.956 --> 00:10:11.856
so Officer Chiba, you go with that woman officer

172
00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:14.156
and check out the parking areas to the east.

173
00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:16.356
I mean, well...

174
00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:18.256
Okay, okay, then off we go and get out of here!

175
00:10:18.256 --> 00:10:20.256
This way, this way.

176
00:10:20.256 --> 00:10:22.856
So, what shall I do?

177
00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:25.256
Well, Officer Chiba won't be able to use his car for a while anyway

178
00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:28.656
since the forensics are checking it now.

179
00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:31.856
Just go on and walk home.

180
00:10:31.856 --> 00:10:32.856
Okay.

181
00:10:38.856 --> 00:10:42.756
Hey, why are we tailing those two?

182
00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:46.356
Weren't we going to check out the parking areas in the west side?

183
00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:50.056
Be quiet. They'll notice if you talk so loud!

184
00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:51.656
You may be from the police,

185
00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:53.156
but you're really a bit off, aren't you?

186
00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:55.356
You see...

187
00:10:55.356 --> 00:10:57.456
They're going inside the building!

188
00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.756
It's the basement parking of the department store.

189
00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:01.656
What shall we do? Should we go after them?

190
00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:02.856
How stupid.

191
00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:04.856
If they go in through the same entrance,

192
00:11:04.856 --> 00:11:06.956
it's inevitable that they could run into each other inside.

193
00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:08.056
We've no choice,

194
00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:10.856
let's go into the parking lot from inside the department store.

195
00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:16.756
Doc, watch the cars that go in and out of here, okay?

196
00:11:16.756 --> 00:11:17.756
Hey.

197
00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:22.156
Really, this is just too much.

198
00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:25.956
Nobody's here.

199
00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:28.156
I wonder if they already left.

200
00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:31.656
No, there's nothing yet from Doc,

201
00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:34.756
so I think they should be somewhere in this parking lot yet.

202
00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:36.456
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

203
00:11:36.456 --> 00:11:38.656
"Noriko Shigei (36), Housewife" -This is not a playground, you know?

204
00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:41.056
If you're going to play hide-and-seek, do so in the park!

205
00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:44.756
A car could suddenly move and you could get run over, you know!

206
00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:45.956
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.256
What elementary do you go to?

208
00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:49.956
And, your names?

209
00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:51.956
-Well... -Come, come now.

210
00:11:51.956 --> 00:11:55.256
"Akitoshi Fukuchi (41), Office worker" -It's just hide-and-seek.

211
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.856
I've got a daughter their age too.

212
00:11:57.856 --> 00:12:00.456
They're going through a playful age.

213
00:12:00.456 --> 00:12:02.156
Children go through dangerous experiences

214
00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:04.356
because the parents are the way you are!

215
00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:05.456
Hey.

216
00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:09.956
"Takero Nawa (22), Free-lancer" -What're you guys doing near my car?

217
00:12:09.956 --> 00:12:12.556
Don't you go touching it with your dirty hands!

218
00:12:12.556 --> 00:12:13.556
Get lost!

219
00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:18.856
Here it is, your cell phone.

220
00:12:18.856 --> 00:12:20.756
I'll take it to you now.

221
00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.956
What a hot rod.

222
00:12:22.956 --> 00:12:25.856
Let's go out from here.

223
00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:28.556
I think it's wiser to wait here with Dr. Agasa

224
00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:30.756
until the two come out of here.

225
00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:35.256
But, they sure are late.

226
00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:39.856
It's been 30 minutes already since you've come back here and yet.

227
00:12:39.856 --> 00:12:45.256
Maybe Officer Chiba remembered who the woman officer was?

228
00:12:45.256 --> 00:12:46.556
I see.

229
00:12:46.556 --> 00:12:49.356
They're getting carried away being lovey-dovey, maybe?

230
00:12:49.356 --> 00:12:53.356
I'd have like to see Officer Chiba blushing in surprise!

231
00:12:56.156 --> 00:12:58.056
What was that sound just now?

232
00:12:58.056 --> 00:13:00.056
It sounds like a crash.

233
00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:01.456
Could it be the parking lot?

234
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.456
Smoke?

235
00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:14.556
Are you all right?

236
00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:16.056
Officer Chiba!

237
00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:17.556
What happened?

238
00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:19.056
I wonder.

239
00:13:19.056 --> 00:13:20.856
I heard a loud sound so I ran over here

240
00:13:20.856 --> 00:13:22.656
and found him lying on the ground.

241
00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:25.556
It seems he was hit from behind.

242
00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:31.256
"Die"

243
00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:34.956
Is this a car thief?

244
00:13:44.848 --> 00:13:46.148
Hey, Conan.

245
00:13:46.148 --> 00:13:48.048
What happened to what anyway?

246
00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:49.948
I don't know the details yet.

247
00:13:49.948 --> 00:13:51.148
Huh?

248
00:13:51.148 --> 00:13:54.148
This man is the kind man

249
00:13:54.148 --> 00:13:56.448
that stood up for us a while ago, right?

250
00:13:58.148 --> 00:14:00.048
He's coming to!

251
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.848
Are you all right?

252
00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:04.648
Can you tell us what happened?

253
00:14:04.648 --> 00:14:05.748
Yes.

254
00:14:05.748 --> 00:14:08.748
I came to this department store

255
00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.548
to buy my daughter a doll that she asked for,

256
00:14:10.548 --> 00:14:12.148
but it was sold out.

257
00:14:12.148 --> 00:14:13.948
But I was hit from behind

258
00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:19.848
just as I was about to leave to go elsewhere to look for it.

259
00:14:19.848 --> 00:14:22.648
I got off the car to complain,

260
00:14:22.648 --> 00:14:27.548
but I felt faint and lost consciousness.

261
00:14:27.548 --> 00:14:32.848
I think that I hit my head somewhere when I was hit from behind.

262
00:14:32.848 --> 00:14:35.648
Hey, what the hell's going on?

263
00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:39.448
My friend's saying that he can't get inside the parking lot!

264
00:14:39.448 --> 00:14:42.148
This parking lot's closed off for now.

265
00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:44.848
Huh? Why'd you do something like that?

266
00:14:44.848 --> 00:14:47.248
It's just a mere accident no matter how you look at it!

267
00:14:47.248 --> 00:14:49.348
The one who's to blame is one of the two drivers

268
00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:52.248
who was driving the car that crashed, right?

269
00:14:52.248 --> 00:14:56.748
But nobody was in the driver's seat that crashed from behind.

270
00:14:56.748 --> 00:14:58.648
Hey, what's going on?

271
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.348
I came back to get my wallet,

272
00:15:00.348 --> 00:15:03.348
and why's my car emitting smoke?

273
00:15:03.348 --> 00:15:05.048
So, it's your car?

274
00:15:05.048 --> 00:15:08.348
Yes! It's a new car that I just bought last year!

275
00:15:08.348 --> 00:15:11.248
Who on earth did something like this?

276
00:15:11.248 --> 00:15:13.148
Wait.

277
00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:16.248
Hey! Even the airbag is out?

278
00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.948
No, no! Don't touch the car yet!

279
00:15:21.348 --> 00:15:24.548
I see, that's the story.

280
00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.048
So, Officer Chiba and the new-comer

281
00:15:27.048 --> 00:15:30.748
were investigating the car theft in this parking lot.

282
00:15:30.748 --> 00:15:33.548
But, they heard a loud sound and ran over to check on it.

283
00:15:33.548 --> 00:15:36.248
Then, they found Mr. Fukuchi over there lying on the ground

284
00:15:36.248 --> 00:15:37.748
after being hit from behind.

285
00:15:37.748 --> 00:15:39.648
However, nobody was in the car

286
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:42.048
that crashed from behind already at that time.

287
00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:46.448
But, the word "Die" that the car thief always left behind

288
00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:50.448
was written on the windshield with red spray paint.

289
00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:55.148
But is it true that somebody you don't know drove your car?

290
00:15:55.148 --> 00:15:57.248
It's true that there are scratch marks by the keyhole

291
00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.548
showing that the door had been forced opened.

292
00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:03.848
The car key is still stuck in the key cylinder.

293
00:16:03.848 --> 00:16:05.148
That's probably

294
00:16:05.148 --> 00:16:06.348
the spare key that I had hidden

295
00:16:06.348 --> 00:16:09.348
between the sun visor above the driver's seat.

296
00:16:09.348 --> 00:16:12.148
It's because you hide it in a place like that.

297
00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:14.248
That and the underside of the bumper

298
00:16:14.248 --> 00:16:17.248
are the first places car thieves check.

299
00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:19.048
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

300
00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:21.248
Well, no...

301
00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.648
I saw it in a movie!

302
00:16:23.648 --> 00:16:28.548
And? You didn't see the driver of the car who hit you?

303
00:16:28.548 --> 00:16:31.248
No, because I lost consciousness

304
00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:33.348
as soon as I got out of the car.

305
00:16:33.348 --> 00:16:34.848
It would've been good if the surveillance camera here

306
00:16:34.848 --> 00:16:37.448
caught the culprit on the monitor, but...

307
00:16:37.448 --> 00:16:40.148
It seems to have been going through maintenance just then.

308
00:16:40.148 --> 00:16:41.948
No need to worry.

309
00:16:41.948 --> 00:16:44.048
Right after we rushed over here,

310
00:16:44.048 --> 00:16:46.748
we notified the police and told them not to let anyone

311
00:16:46.748 --> 00:16:49.948
into this parking lot from inside the department store.

312
00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:52.348
Moreover, Agasa and Ai are on guard checking

313
00:16:52.348 --> 00:16:55.948
to see if anyone goes out from here to the corridor too.

314
00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.648
I think the car thief...

315
00:16:58.648 --> 00:17:02.848
is still inside this parking lot!

316
00:17:02.848 --> 00:17:04.548
Right, Ai?

317
00:17:04.548 --> 00:17:08.448
Right. No one has come out from the parking lot.

318
00:17:08.448 --> 00:17:11.248
Of course no one has gone in either!

319
00:17:11.248 --> 00:17:12.548
I see!

320
00:17:12.548 --> 00:17:16.648
In other words, if we the police who are investigating this parking lot,

321
00:17:16.648 --> 00:17:19.448
can't come up with anyone...

322
00:17:19.448 --> 00:17:23.348
the culprit is among the three of you here!

323
00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:25.048
The three of us?

324
00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:28.748
I'm a victim who was hit from behind by the culprit, you know.

325
00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:32.748
I'm a victim whose car was messed up by the culprit too, you know!

326
00:17:32.748 --> 00:17:35.448
Beside, don't you think it's strange?

327
00:17:35.448 --> 00:17:37.848
Don't car thieves do they job inconspicuously

328
00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.448
so that nobody notices?

329
00:17:39.448 --> 00:17:41.448
Why would they go doing something conspicuous

330
00:17:41.448 --> 00:17:43.348
like crashing into other people's cars?

331
00:17:43.348 --> 00:17:45.048
Beats me.

332
00:17:45.048 --> 00:17:47.548
Maybe he found the key in the car,

333
00:17:47.548 --> 00:17:50.448
so he was going to steal the car and split,

334
00:17:50.448 --> 00:17:55.448
but he crashed into Mr. Fukuchi's car that came rushing out in reverse?

335
00:17:55.448 --> 00:17:57.148
But, I don't think that's possible,

336
00:17:57.148 --> 00:18:00.448
because of the word "Die" is written on the windshield.

337
00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:01.648
If it were mere theft,

338
00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:03.548
the wallet that was in the car would've been taken too.

339
00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:06.148
Besides, I don't think you can get out of here

340
00:18:06.148 --> 00:18:07.848
without parking lot ticket.

341
00:18:07.848 --> 00:18:09.448
How should I know?

342
00:18:09.448 --> 00:18:11.948
Ask the culprit, will you?

343
00:18:11.948 --> 00:18:13.048
More than that,

344
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:16.348
haven't you witnessed any suspicious people?

345
00:18:16.348 --> 00:18:17.948
No, not in particular.

346
00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:20.048
Come to think of it, what were you doing

347
00:18:20.048 --> 00:18:21.648
for nearly 30 minutes?

348
00:18:21.648 --> 00:18:23.648
You were along, just the two of you, right?

349
00:18:23.648 --> 00:18:25.848
Were you talking to each other?

350
00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:27.648
Talking about what?

351
00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:31.048
I was just investigating this parking with her!

352
00:18:31.048 --> 00:18:33.748
Because she suggested that we should check

353
00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:36.548
the cars that have been attacked.

354
00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:38.048
You keep referring to her as "her".

355
00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:41.148
Didn't you get her name yet?

356
00:18:41.148 --> 00:18:43.148
Come to think of it,

357
00:18:43.148 --> 00:18:44.848
I haven't yet.

358
00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:48.248
Right! My name is...

359
00:18:48.248 --> 00:18:50.348
About this car theft...

360
00:18:50.348 --> 00:18:52.448
Is the place where the word "Die" is written,

361
00:18:52.448 --> 00:18:54.648
always at random?

362
00:18:54.648 --> 00:18:56.348
No.

363
00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:59.848
Until now, it was always on the ceiling.

364
00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.848
This was the first time it was written on the windshield.

365
00:19:01.848 --> 00:19:04.748
Then, maybe somebody copied the culprit.

366
00:19:04.748 --> 00:19:07.248
No, it's not a copy-cat crime.

367
00:19:07.248 --> 00:19:10.148
The spray can that was used in the burglaries up to now

368
00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:13.448
was found on the floor of the car.

369
00:19:13.448 --> 00:19:15.748
The car with the word "Die" on it

370
00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:17.548
hasn't been made public yet, so...

371
00:19:19.048 --> 00:19:21.048
Hey, Conan!

372
00:19:22.448 --> 00:19:24.548
We were doing pretty good, and yet...

373
00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:26.348
Don't get in our way!

374
00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:28.348
Pick up vibes, will you?

375
00:19:29.848 --> 00:19:33.748
But still, why was Mr. Shigei's car attacked?

376
00:19:33.748 --> 00:19:37.148
There was no freakish things in the car though.

377
00:19:37.148 --> 00:19:38.948
Freakish?

378
00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:42.348
I mean toys, dolls and the like.

379
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.548
Why would I have to buy things like that?

380
00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:46.848
As for dolls...

381
00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:49.148
there were a lot in the car over there!

382
00:19:49.148 --> 00:19:51.048
Huh?

383
00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:52.448
You can say that again!

384
00:19:52.448 --> 00:19:54.748
It's full of stuffed dolls!

385
00:19:54.748 --> 00:19:57.748
But, they're scattered all around.

386
00:19:57.748 --> 00:20:01.148
I was hit, so it got scattered.

387
00:20:01.148 --> 00:20:05.148
My daughter usually lines them out nicely on display.

388
00:20:06.848 --> 00:20:09.448
But, I can't figure it out.

389
00:20:09.448 --> 00:20:12.048
If this were to have been done by the same culprit...

390
00:20:12.048 --> 00:20:14.548
why did he attack this car?

391
00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:18.848
And change the place where he sprayed the paint...

392
00:20:18.848 --> 00:20:20.548
Moreover, to move and hit it from behind,

393
00:20:20.548 --> 00:20:21.948
to the extent of wanting to damage it,

394
00:20:21.948 --> 00:20:25.348
was it because he was outraged by this car?

395
00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:31.848
The backseat discolored by the sun.

396
00:20:31.848 --> 00:20:35.348
Don't tell me that this is why the car was attacked.

397
00:20:37.248 --> 00:20:39.648
I'd like to make a declaration.

398
00:20:39.648 --> 00:20:43.348
As a result of careful investigation...

399
00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:47.248
there was no one other than you three, after all!

400
00:20:47.248 --> 00:20:51.448
This means that the culprit is among you, right?

401
00:20:51.448 --> 00:20:52.548
No.

402
00:20:52.548 --> 00:20:54.748
Why am I, who was hit from behind

403
00:20:54.748 --> 00:20:56.748
also included as one of the suspects?

404
00:20:56.748 --> 00:20:58.448
Why not?

405
00:20:58.448 --> 00:21:00.748
There's a possibility that you deliberately hit the car,

406
00:21:00.748 --> 00:21:04.348
and passed out, making it look as if you were the victim.

407
00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:07.148
Give me a break!

408
00:21:07.148 --> 00:21:09.848
My wife and daughter are waiting for me to come home.

409
00:21:09.848 --> 00:21:11.148
Same here,

410
00:21:11.148 --> 00:21:14.248
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

411
00:21:14.248 --> 00:21:15.848
I got to hurry home too,

412
00:21:15.848 --> 00:21:17.548
or my parents will get on my back.

413
00:21:17.548 --> 00:21:20.148
Don't tell me, you give a hoot about your parents?

414
00:21:20.148 --> 00:21:23.848
Yeah. They happen to be school teachers, you know.

415
00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:25.748
And, they didn't say anything

416
00:21:25.748 --> 00:21:28.748
about that flashy wing on your car?

417
00:21:28.748 --> 00:21:31.548
It doesn't look like your car passed the safety check, does it?

418
00:21:31.548 --> 00:21:34.748
No, they haven't seen it.

419
00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:36.248
Come to think of it,

420
00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:40.248
there was a wing on the third car that was attacked, right?

421
00:21:40.248 --> 00:21:41.548
Yes.

422
00:21:41.548 --> 00:21:44.948
But, your car wasn't attacked, was it?

423
00:21:44.948 --> 00:21:46.548
I wonder why.

424
00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:47.748
How should I know?

425
00:21:47.748 --> 00:21:53.448
The wing on your car is much flashier

426
00:21:53.448 --> 00:21:57.048
and the position of the wing is higher too.

427
00:21:57.048 --> 00:21:59.848
If you check the car that was attacked in more detail,

428
00:21:59.848 --> 00:22:01.648
maybe you'll find something more.

429
00:22:01.648 --> 00:22:02.748
If so,

430
00:22:02.748 --> 00:22:05.548
would you like to look at the pictures taken from a different angle too?

431
00:22:05.548 --> 00:22:08.348
I brought it along in my mini patrol car that's parked outside.

432
00:22:08.348 --> 00:22:10.248
I'll go get it then!

433
00:22:10.248 --> 00:22:11.748
Thank you!

434
00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:15.548
Hey, Officer Chiba, don't you have to go with her?

435
00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:16.548
Why?

436
00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:18.248
If there are a lot of pictures,

437
00:22:18.248 --> 00:22:20.048
it'll be tough bringing them all here, right?

438
00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:23.548
It's the duty of men to help women!

439
00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:26.748
-Come on. -Go on, hurry!

440
00:24:07.848 --> 00:24:09.748
"Next Episode" -You mean they're each other's first love

441
00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.348
and are still in love with each other?

442
00:24:11.348 --> 00:24:13.448
Are you serious?

443
00:24:13.448 --> 00:24:14.548
Yep!

444
00:24:15.448 --> 00:24:17.448
See you.

445
00:24:17.448 --> 00:24:18.948
I've got to stop them.

446
00:24:18.948 --> 00:24:21.448
Don't you remember?

447
00:24:21.448 --> 00:24:23.748
No, I don't remember.

448
00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:26.448
I thought so.

449
00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:30.448
No doubt about it. That person is...

450
00:24:30.448 --> 00:24:31.948
the culprit!

451
00:24:32.548 --> 00:24:33.948
Next Conan,

452
00:24:33.948 --> 00:24:37.048
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 2)".

453
00:24:53.748 --> 00:24:56.148
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:56.148 --> 00:24:58.248
"Rear window".

455
00:24:58.248 --> 00:24:59.448
Let's get the two!

456
00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:01.148
-Together! -Aye!

457
00:25:01.148 --> 00:25:02.748
I think you're wasting your time.
