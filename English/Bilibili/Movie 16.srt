00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,870
Dad, please! The phone's ringing!

3
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,560
Alright, alright.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,770
Hello? Detective Mouri's Agency.

5
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,150
Kogoro Mouri, I presume?

6
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,960
Yes. May I ask who's calling?

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,030
I've placed a bomb at a certain location.

8
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,760
What? A bomb?

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,100
It will explode at exactly 3 PM.

10
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,950
If you wish to stop it,

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,860
you must solve the puzzle
I am about to give you.

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,330
Hey, what's this about?

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,410
If it's a joke, it's not funny!

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,160
I'm calling the police.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,810
What are you laughing at?

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,190
Take a look outside your window.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,170
Outside my window?

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,170
What am I supposed to see?

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,630
No way...

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,670
I don't believe it!

(The Eleventh Striker)

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,410
I'm the high school student detective
Shinichi Kudo.

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,800
I had come to an amusement park with my
childhood friend and classmate Ran Mouri,

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
when I saw a man dressed all in black
making a suspicious transaction.

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,920
I was so focused on witnessing the trade,

27
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,060
that I didn't notice his companion
approaching me from behind.

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,300
The man forced a poison pill
down my throat

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,900
and when I awoke,

30
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,390
my body had shrunk.

31
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,930
If my enemies figured out
that I'm still alive,

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,400
they might come after me again
and those around me would be in danger.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,120
At the advice of Dr. Agasa,
I decided to hide my true identity,

34
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,190
and when Ran happened to ask my name,
I immediately replied Conan Edogawa.

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,480
Then, to gain information on my foes,

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,440
I moved into the home of Ran,
whose father is a detective.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
The Professor's late.

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll bet he can't find his license again.

39
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,680
This always happens.

40
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,300
If we don't hurry,

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,560
we'll miss the chance
to get Hide's autograph!

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
And after we were lucky enough to win the raffle!

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,500
It's our opportunity
to meet real J-leaguers!

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,110
To miss it would be a waste.

45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,770
These three are Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko.

46
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,650
They're my classmates now that I'm small.

47
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,470
It seems the J-League is trending, these days.

48
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, here he comes.

49
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,310
Sorry, children.

50
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,710
I had misplaced my driver's license somewhere.

51
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,900
I knew it.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,110
Unbelievable.

53
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,970
-Professor, you really...
-This man is Dr. Agasa

54
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,230
and this is Ai Haibara.

55
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,960
They're two of the only people
who know my true identity.

56
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you mumbling about over there?

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,110
It's time to go to Sports Land!

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,810
If you dawdle, we'll leave you behind!

59
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,380
You're forgetting something.

60
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,420
Huh?

61
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,430
You know... that.

62
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,500
Oh, I see.

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,120
I may be smaller, but my brain remains the same.
No maze is too difficult for a great detective

64
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,510

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,950
Okay, kids. What do you say we get started?

71
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,370
Okay!

72
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,790
Hey you, number 10.

73
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,380
What's the matter, Conan-kun?

74
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,120
He told me to take a rest.

75
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,110
They're going to practice with four people first.

76
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,160

My name is Yamamori.

80

Amazing. I never thought I'd get to meet
a famous detective like you.

81
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,750
It's a real thrill!

Kaora Koda.

88
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,740
She used to work at the society desk, but got moved
to the sports and celebrity desk this year.

89
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,120
Yamamori-san!

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,690
Now's not the time
for that conversation.

91
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,150
But if she manages to get a few scoops,

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,930
she's been told she can
go back to the society desk, right?

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,350
Huh? Uh, yeah.

94
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,880
Well, I'm praying for your success.

95
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,550
Rather than worry about me,

96
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,710
if the ratings for live soccer matches
don't rise,

97
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,180
I'm told you'll be demoted from bureau chief.

98
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,450
Don't remind me...

99
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,590
I don't suppose you have
any bright ideas, Mouri-san?

100
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,440
Huh?

101
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,500

104
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,080
Yes! You can have me on
as a guest with Yoko-chan.

105
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
Your ratings will go up for sure.

106

Yoko-chan, huh?

107
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,480

It's true!

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,050
We take our eyes away for a second and...

112
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,590
Wow!

113
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,760
I guess they learn faster
when trained by pros.

114
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,460
Say, Ran...

115
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,940
I'll bet you're not interested in soccer.

116
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,540
That's not true!

117
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,700
I watch it on TV with Conan all the time.

118
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,240
But you've never tried it yourself.

119
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,420
I guess not. But there was that one time
in junior high

120
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,580
when Shinichi accidentally
kicked a ball my way...

121
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,230
That's right! That time, he--

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,530
Wh-What's wrong, Ran?

123
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,180
Oh, nothing.

124
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,010
Huh? That guy over there.

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,030
There's no doubt.

He's the miraculous lone striker, Kazumasa Nakaoka!

127
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,150
The miraculous lone striker?

128
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,330
Yeah. Three years ago,

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,060
Nakaoka was the one who led Haido High school
to the national championship.

130
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,370
He was signed by the Spirits

131
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,940
and was poised to be
the future face of the franchise,

132
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,640
but one month after the final,
he had a motorcycle accident

133
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,530
and has been absent
from the soccer scene ever since.

134
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,950
So then, if he's here now...

135
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,280
Yes. He might still

136
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,080
have some longing to play again.

137
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,440
Okay everybody! You've all improved a lot!

138
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320

142
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,700
Right!

143
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,870
Well, I finally get a chance.

144
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,650

The name's Ryosuke Sakaki.

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
Ah! The God of own goals!

149
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,860
Own goals?

150
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,550
Yeah! This guy put the ball in his own net
during our final league match.

151
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,410
As a result, Beika University missed out
on their first championship in five years!

152
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,010
So you knew about that...

153
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,430
Of course I do!

154
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,330

Huh? Wait, how many years ago was that?

156
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,630
10 years.

157
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,610
It was pretty traumatic for me.

158
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,820
I still have nightmares about it sometimes.

159
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,020
Dad...!

160
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,480
You don't have to bring up
old stuff like that.

161
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,350
Huh? Oh, right...

162
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,320
And? What are you up to now?

163
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,930
I work as an instructor at a sports gym

164
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,940
and coach children's soccer.

165
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,070
Oh? That's impressive!

166
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,440
Anyway, there's actually someone

167
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,080
I really want to introduce you to.

168
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,870
This person is a big fan of yours, Sempai.

169
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,330
Can you spare a little time?

170
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,060
Sure.

171
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,090
Thank you very much.

172
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll bring them right away.

173
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,230
What's this all about?

174
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,300
Okay! You win!

175
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,180
Huh? Wow!

176
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,830
So he was really just
an average soccer-loving boy, all along.

Did you have fun, Conan-kun?

178
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,160
Yeah!

179
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,720
Hey there!

180
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,920
Oh, what a hunk!

181
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,720
Whoa! It's the real Higo!

182
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,280
Shinichi Kudo...

183
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,860
Do you know him?

184
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,370
-Uh...
-You're asking about Shinichi?

185
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,690
You know Shinichi?

186
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,700
Yeah.

187
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,050
I went to see one of his games once

188
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,110
and stopped to talk with him, afterward.

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,620
This boy looks just like him.

190
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,000
Especially his kicking form.

191
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,530
Oh, uh... well that's because Shinichi Nii-chan
taught me how to play.

192
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,910
Is that so?

193
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,910
I knew it. You learned from him.

194
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,060
Keep playin' soccer, Kid!

195
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,460
Sure!

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,670
Wow...

197
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,620
You got a pat on the head from Higo!

198
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,140
I'm jealous...

199
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,710
Seriously! You should never
wash your hair again!

200
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,150
Huh? You think so?

201
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,070
Hey! What are you--

202
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,730
You should wash it, after all.

203
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,860
Huh?

204
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,010
I wanna rub his head, too!

205
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,940
Stop it! Not you!

206
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,380
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mouri-sempai.

207
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,040
Do you have a moment?

208
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,460
Sure.

209
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

210
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,710
This is the president
of a small factory in Haido-cho,

211
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,230
as well as the team's sponsor and chairman,

212
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,000
Keiichiro Motoura.

213
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,890
(Keiichiro Motoura, aged 43, local factory owner)

214
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,470
I'm Motoura.

215
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,870
I've heard a lot about you.

216
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,220
Oh, well thank you.

217
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,540
Motoura-san is a big fan of yours, Sempai.

218
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,050
When I told him you were here, he was desperate to meet you.

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,580
Is that so?

220
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,030
There's a certain photo
that I'd like you to look at.

221
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,630
Me?

222
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,230
Yes. Please have a look at this.

223
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,790
Huh? Sure...

224
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,560
Show it to us, too!

225
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,580
Yeah, we wanna see!

226
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,380
Unbelievable...

227
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,260
Huh? Him again...

228
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,480
Conan-kun, have a look, too!

229
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,750
Uh, okay...

230
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,660
And this is...?

231
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,470
My son, Tomofumi.

232
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,650
Please have a look at the other photos, too.

233
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,550
He looks like he's having fun.

234
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,780
Is your son with you, today?

235
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,920
The truth is...

236
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,880
Tomofumi-kun passed away from illness

237
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,930
in this August.

238
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,100
He was in fourth grade.

239
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,500
I see...

240
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,830
Tomofumi was born with physical ailments

241
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,130
and his doctor had warned us
to avoid strenuous exercise.

242
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,350
So then, this photo is...

243
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,950
He begged me to let him play soccer

244
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,380
so I talked the organization into letting him join a team.

245
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,480
The coach became fond of him and this was the one time
that he was allowed to play in a match.

246
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,620
He scored a goal in that game.

247
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,830
This is the moment he scored?

248
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,960
Wow!

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,850
So he was good at soccer, then.

250
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,680
Is this the last one?

251
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,330
By the way, why did you
want to show these to me?

252
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,290
Oh, I just wanted you to see

253
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,520
how my son lived.

254
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm sorry for spoiling the mood.

255
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,660
You'll excuse me.

256
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,460
To all those participating
in the J-league workshop,

257
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,830
the second half...

258
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,100
The mood's gotten pretty solemn.

259
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,820
Yeah.

260
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,150
What does solemn mean?

261
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,160
I know what you need at times like these.

262
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,950
Don't tell me...

263
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,010
He's not going to...

264
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,450
A quiz is just what we need
to put a smile on everyone's faces.

265
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,630
The rest of you can join in, too.

266
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Because of a certain soccer term,

267
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,480
they say that cars driven by soccer players

268
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,030
have doors that stay shut tight.

269
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,910
What term am I referring too?

270
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,220
1. Offside

271
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,970
2. Handball

272
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,030
3. Corner kick

273
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,460
4. Yellow card

274
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,120
I think this one might be pretty difficult.

275
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,850
Conan, do you know?

276
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,000
-Yeah. The answer is--
-Number 2.

277
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,930
Hand like in door handle.

278
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,540
The door locks tight, so the handle doesn't work, right?

279
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,570
In other words, no handle.

280
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,980
No hands.

281
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,750
Correct!

282
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,020
Wow!

283
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,310
Endo!

284
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,980
You're not just good at soccer,

285
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,450
you're smart too!

286
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,150
Yo!

287
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,510
Sorry I'm late.

288
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,430
Takahiro! What took you so long?

289
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,740
-Who's he?
-Sorry, I overslept.

290
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,220
That's Sanada.

291
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,660
He was promoted from the youth team, this year.

292
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,820
He's the backup for Higo at lone striker.

293
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,020
Missing the first half? Really?

294
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,530
You've got some nerve.

295
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm just not good with kids.

296
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,570
Hey, brat.

297
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm nobody's back up.

298
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,720
(Takahiro Sanada, aged 18, Member of Big Osaka)
I'm a super-sub. Got it?

299
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
Leave him alone, Sanada.

300
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Hide-san...

301
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,820
You should know I consider you my rival.

302
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,900
Huh?

303
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,650
How about we settle things in our next match?

304
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,720
You'll have to get on the pitch first.

305
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,370
But of course.

306
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,920
A declaration of war, huh? This is great.

307
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,060
We'll be airing the final match
between Spirits and Big

308
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,860
on our network.

309
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,360
We'll build plenty of buzz, too.

310
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,060
I'm praying for your success! Both of you.

311
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,220
Huh?

312
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,990
Hey! No peeking.

313
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,080
Why?

314
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,560
I don't have anything, yet.

315
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,350
You're so stingy!

316
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,820
(Suginami Athletic Park, December 3rd, Shiodome Arena)
I'll let you know when I have the photos.

317
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,610
-KK? What does that stand for?
-Hey Hide, I thought you had to leave early?

318
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,760
Oh no!

319
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,010
Sorry, Sanada.

320
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,660
We'll resume in the final match.

321
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,450
See you at Toto stadium!

322
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,520
Hide looks cool running, too.

323
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,920
I've never been one for running.

324
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,010
Me neither.

325
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,670
We could never play in the J-League.

326
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,810
That's not true.

327
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,400
There are a lot of players
in the J-League who can't run fast.

328
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,850
Really?

329
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,440
If you run slow,

330
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,730
you just have to take your first step
sooner than other players.

331
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,100
To do that, however,

332
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,790
you have to read the game well

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,850
and develop your decision making.

334
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,160
Right. In other words, your brain needs to be

335
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,080
faster than your legs.

336
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,820
There are a lot of players

337
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,960
who develop other skills like that

338
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,860
and play well despite lack of pace.

339
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,480
Even what looks like a weakness

340
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,820
can be made into a strength

341
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,710
if you find the right way to use it.

342
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,420
I see.

343
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,680
The words of a professional
carry more weight.

344
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,170
Oh...?

345
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,190
Is there anything else you want to ask us?

346
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,400
-Me!
-Yes?

347
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,260
Teach us the secret to a good free kick.

348
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,180
Hey, you!

349
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,530
Don't push your luck, kid!

350
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,320
I don't mind at all.

351
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,090
We still have a little time left.

352
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,750
Shall I show you a few things?

353
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,730
-Really?
-Alright!

354
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,300
You stand directly over the ball

355
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,600
and rather than kick it,
you kind of scrape it up off the ground.

356
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,220
Goal!

357
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,190
(Toto Stadium)
Yasuhito Endo scores from a free kick!

358
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,740
Gamba Osaka lead in the 4 minutes
of the first half.

359
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,710
Awesome! That was just like the free kick
he taught us!

360
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,050
Hey, Conan!

361
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,870
Just who are you cheering for?

362
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,940
Edo is the old name for Tokyo.
You can't cheer for Osaka!

363
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,190
Yeah, yeah.

364
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,950
Here. Put this on

365
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,030
and cheer for the Spirits.

366
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,410
Huh? But don't you need--

367
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,920
Don't worry. I bought a new one.

368
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,940
Big Osaka?

369
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,270
I knew it. You--

370
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,590
Don't get the wrong idea.

371
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,080
I just like the colors.

372
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,880
You don't fool me.

373
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,240
No way...

374
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,440
I don't believe it!

375
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,510
Shall I continue, then? Your task is
to solve the puzzle I'm about to give.

376
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,600
What?

377
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,480
A blue boy and a blue zebra,

378
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,110
rain from above,

379
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,110
a person from below, with their left hand
indicates the tree on the left.

380
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,450
(A blue boy and a blue zebra, rain from above,
a person from below) Slow down! Their left what?

381
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,160
With their left hand
indicates the tree on the left.

382
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,320
With their left band--

383
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,720
Hand! Not band!

384
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,860
Hand as in door handle!

385
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,800
With their left hand,
indicates the tree on the left.

386
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,660
Now... let the game begin.

387
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,000
You bastard!

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,020
If you lose the game,

389
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,910
many people will die.

390
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,970
(A blue boy and a blue zebra, rain from above, a person from below,
with their left hand indicates tree on the left.)

391
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,000
Why are you doing this?

392
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,630
Tell me what you want!

393
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,760
You'll know soon enough.

394
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,460
Now then, I pray for you success.

395
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,910
Hold it! This isn't enough!

396
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,850
Give me a hint, will you!

397
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,090
Beika is next.

398
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,760
Next Beika.

399
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
Wait! Hello? Hello?

400
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,180
Dad....

401
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,070
Damn it, they hung up.

402
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,920
A blue boy and a blue zebra,

403
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,600
rain from above,

404
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,950
a person from below, with their left hand

405
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,770
indicates tree on the left.

406
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,480
And then the hint is...

407
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,100
Beika is next.

408
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,460
Next Beika.

409
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,190
I've read it a million times
and it still doesn't make sense.

410
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,380
Inspector Megure!

411
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,140
We've finished analyzing the bomb!

412
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,290
The bomb was made

413
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,600
from plastic explosives

414
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,230
and was triggered to go off by phone.

415
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,570
I see.

416
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,340
We're very lucky

417
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,790
that there were only minor injuries.

418
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,740
Who knows what will happen
with the next bomb!

419
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,350
There's only one hour and five minutes
until the bomber's specified time limit.

420
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,720
Before then,

421
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,750
we have to solve this puzzle, somehow.

422
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,060
That's it... I've got it!

423
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,340
The bomb is located

424
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,570
in Haido Park!

425
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Haido Park?

426
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,950
The key is in the hint, "Beika is next. Next Beika."

427
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,650
What does it mean, Mouri-kun?

428
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,490
The stop before Beika station on the Toto Circle line.

429
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,950
In other words,
it's either Haido Station or Midoridai station.

430
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,020
Haido Park is nearby Haido station

431
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,790
and it has a big fountain.

432
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,710
A fountain?

433
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,580
So that's rain from above...

434
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,930
Yes. And beneath the fountain

435
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,230
is a statue of a boy and a zebra.

436
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,790
What about the rest, then?

437
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
We'll know more when we get there.

438
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,170
Alright!

439
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,420
It's a counter-attack!

440
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,670
Go!

441
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,680
Awesome!

442
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,030
Over here!

443
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,820
Make way!

444
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,330
Excuse us. Please make way.

445
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,120
We're sorry!

446
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,410
There it is.

447
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,170
You're right, there's a marble statue.

448
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,480
But that isn't a zebra.

449
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,530
It's a mule, isn't it?

450
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,490
The bomber mistook it for a zebra!

451
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,900
It's not blue, either.

452
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,810
It must have looked blue to him!

453
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,070
Just wait. I'll show you.

454
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,150
Mouri-san! What are you...?

455
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,090
I'll find the bomb, right away.

456
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,250
Fine. Let's close down the park, then.

457
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,740
Everyone here will need to evacuate.

458
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,560
Right.

459
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,660
A blue boy and a blue zebra,

460
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,440
rain from above,

461
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,620
a person from below, with their left hand

462
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,080
indicates the tree on the left.

463
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,310
Over there!

464
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,330
The bomb is beneath that tree on the left!

465
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,470
Beneath that tree...

466
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,630
Okay. Leave the rest to us.

467
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,120
Mouri-kun, you should leave the park immediately.

468
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,230
Right.

469
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,140
Now then, the Spirits are down a goal.

470
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,010
Uemura runs with the ball on the left side.

471
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,470
He plays it toward the middle!

472
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,540
It's an inch-perfect cross!

473
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,730
Akagi's header...

474
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,830
Goal!

475
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,160
Goal! Goal!

476
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,410
The duo of Akagi and Uemura combine

477
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,920
to bring the Spirits level!

478
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,200
Alright!

479
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,800
They sure make a good pair!

480
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,430
With Hide and Naoki, we've got
a golden front two.

481
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,700
There was no bomb?

482
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,920
Unfortunately not...

483
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,620
-It wasn't beneath the tree on the left.
-What about the other one?

484
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,600
The tree on the right...

485
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,380
We dug there too, just in case.

486
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,390
There were no signs nor traces of a bomb.

487
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,420
We'll have them keep checking the other trees.

488
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,950
But it could be

489
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,920
that the location indicated by the bomber's puzzle

490
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,530
isn't here, after all.

491
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,580
But that's absurd!

492
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,190
There sure are a lot of people.

493
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,860
Well, everyone goes to the food stands at halftime.

494
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,250
If we don't hurry up, the second half will start.

495
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,110
(Ran Mouri)
It's from Ran.

496
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,430
Sorry guys, I need to go to the bathroom.

497
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,330
Please, Shinichi. Pick up!

498
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,190
Hello. This is Kudo.

499
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,550
I am unable to come to the phone right now.

500
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,010
-Please leave a message after the beep.
-Why does this happen every time?

501
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,310
Shinichi! My dad's office

502
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,930
received a bomb threat.

503
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,760
But there's a puzzle that we can't crack

504
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,840
and we have no time.

505
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
Ran, it's me!

506
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,160
Shinichi!

507
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,170
Tell me the puzzle.

508
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,450
I'll tell you now.

509
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,830
And then, the hint is "Beika is next."

510
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,360
Next Beika?

511
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,510
We were warned the bomb
would go off at 3:30.

512
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,450
We only have forty minutes left, Shinichi!

513
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,070
I understand. Please give me a little time.

514
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,620
A blue boy and blue zebra,

515
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,180
rain from above,

516
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,210
a person from below, with their left hand

517
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,230
indicates the left tree.

518
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,850
Strange. It seems familiar.

519
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,950
Damn it. It's right on the tip of my tongue...

520
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,100
Everyone! Do you know the mascots for the Spirits and Gamba?

521
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,430
The Spirits' mascot is Zebra-kun!

522
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,430
He's a special zebra, right?

523
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,090
And then, what's the Gamba mascot?

524
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,310
I know! It's blue, right?

525
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,160
His name is Gamba Boy.

526
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,940
Wow! You guys know a lot!

527
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,360
Gamba Boy works hard to get the win.

528
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,910
A zebra... Gamba Boy...

529
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,070
That's it!

530
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,840
Down there!

531
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,150
The blue boy and the blue Zebra

532
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,200
are the mascots for Gamba and the Spirits!

533
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,130
Damn it! How could I miss something so simple?

534
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,280
Wait, don't tell me...

535
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,650
The location of the bomb

536
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,450
is right here in this stadium!

537
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,360
Wait...

538
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,370
There was a hint, wasn't there.

539
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,850
So that's it.

540
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,470
I understand.

541
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,520
Rain from above it the kanji "amekanmui".

542
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,030
"A person from below" is the kanji "ninnyo".

543
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,020
"The left hand" is the kanji "Tehen".

544
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,890
"indicates" is exactly that, an indication.

545
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,150
"The left tree" is the kanji "kihen".

546
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,180
If I put the radicals from these four kanji together,

547
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,850
and the kanji "shimesu" for indicate,

548
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,460
I get "denkokeijiban". A digital signboard!

549
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,410
Then I add the hint, "Beika is next,"

550
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,700
"next Beika".

551
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,540
It indicates a digital signboard

552
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,750
inside the train cars of the Toto circle line.

553
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,670
(Beika is next.)

554
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,140
There's no doubt.

555
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,190
The bomb is attached to the digital scoreboard
here at Toto Stadium!

556
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,270
This is awful. I have to check that board, quick!

557
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,210
Conan is taking too long, even for him.

558
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,110
Yeah. I wonder if he got lost.

559
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,240
Professor...

560
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,600
Professor! Give me your car keys!

561
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,700
Conan-kun?

562
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,030
Where have you been?

563
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,830
The second half is about to start!

564
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,480
Forget all that. Professor, quickly!

565
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,260
And the second half kicks off.

566
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,850
After an impressive equalizer during additional time,
the Spirits have leveled the score.

567
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,800
No substitutions to start the second half.

568
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,880
Can Spirits pick up where they left off
and sustain their attack?

569
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,270
Meanwhile, Gamba also have made no substitutions.

570
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,500
Damn it!
Is there no way for me to get up there?

571
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,040
There!

572
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,580
Come on!

573
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,780
What's a child doing up there?

574
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,770
I've gotta make it!

575
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,730
That was close...

576
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,540
It's Rafinha taking on Tiara...

577
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,480
Rafinha lays it off for Endo,

578
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
who switches play to the opposite side.

579
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,840
Paqueilla!

580
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,360
A cross is lifted into the box.

581
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,090
There's a fierce battle in front of goal!

582
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,970
Damn it. If it's not anywhere here, that means...

583
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,800
Akagi has the ball at his feet
and is pressed hard by Endo.

584
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,390
Akagi plays it back
and now Ishimura plays it long to the front line.

585
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,900
Nagata fights for the ball.

586
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,430
The Spirits win the second ball
and play a one-two.

587
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,630
Akagi with the ball at his feet...

588
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,240
He beats two defenders!

589
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,290
After assessing the scene,
he lifts one into the box!

590
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,510
Punched away by the goalkeeper!

591
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,180
What?

592
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,520
Don't tell me...

593
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,850
Kudo-kun!

594
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,640
Oh no!

595
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,220
What was that?

596
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,500
The Spirits players

597
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,550
are furious with the referee!

598
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,620
Darn!

599
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,020
It's a penalty!

600
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,910
He ran into the defender on purpose!

601
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,460
Definitely, right?

602
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,030
Haibara-san?

603
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,550
He places the ball on the penalty spot.

604
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,700
And of course, the kicker is...

605
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,210
Yasuhito Endo!

606
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,510
He converts the penalty! It's 2 to 1.

607
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,390
Gamba reclaim the lead!

608
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,730
Nice timing, Haibara.

609
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,400
Kudo-kun, what are you doing up there?

610
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,200
Genta and the others aren't nearby, right?

611
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,090
No, it's safe.

612
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,400
A bomb?

613
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,990
Yeah. Although, I haven't confirmed it yet.

614
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,290
But there's a high probability
that it's attached to this stadium's scoreboard.

615
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,020
Sorry, Haibara. I'll have to call you back.

616
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,510
Wait a second! Kudo-kun? Kudo-kun!

617
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,260
There they are.

618
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,360
Right on the beams that hold up the scoreboard...

619
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,030
Wait a minute, but that means...!

620
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,340
The bomber aims to make it crash?

621
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,580
Huh?

622
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,010
Hello? Kudo-kun, is that you?

623
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,900
Shinichi!

624
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,620
Yes... right. What?

625
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,710
The bomb is attached to the scoreboard
at Toto Stadium?

626
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,520
Toto Stadium?

627
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,250
The scoreboard?

628
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,590
Yes.

629
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,700
Please evacuate the Spirits supporters

630
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,990
on the home end of the stadium.

631
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,100
Understood.

632
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,690
These bombs are fairly simple,

633
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,530
but I don't have time to disarm them all.

634
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,190
What do I do?

635
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,300
I have to think. There's must be something,

636
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,680
a way to fix this...

637
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,220
Damn it!

638
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,650
If I can't disarm all the bombs, I'll--

639
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,690
Where do you get off hanging up on--

640
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,050
Sorry! But listen carefully
to what I'm about to say!

641
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,370
I was right. There are bombs set up here.

642
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,030
At 3:30 PM, the bomber intends to drop the scoreboard

643
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,090
over the heads of the Spirits supporters.

644
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,790
You can't be serious! There's only 30 minutes left!

645
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,000
Right. They should start
evacuating the supporters soon.

646
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,670
You have to make sure Genta and the others

647
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,860
don't do anything stupid!

648
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,900
Got it.

649
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,830
But what about you, Kudo-kun?

650
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,010
I'll do everything I can
to stop the scoreboard from falling.

651
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,870
The Spirits once again go forward in search of a goal.

652
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,230
Ishimura plays it in the box!

653
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,100
There's a struggle for the ball!

654
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,410
Itazawa blocks the shot!

655
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,800
The ball falls to the feet of Uemura!

656
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,210
Off the crossbar! The ball is still loose...

657
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,660
Akagi scores!

658
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,280
-His second goal of the day!
-Alright!

659
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,030
Spirits have leveled!

660
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,990
We finally tied the score!

661
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,790
Hey Genta, that hurts!

662
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,270
Huh? Something's wrong.

663
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,670
Eh? What do you mean?

664
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,700
Look over there!

665
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,590
What's this, now?

666
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,890
Soccer association officials
are explaining something to the referee.

667
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,020
What's going on?

668
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,410
The match isn't over yet!

669
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,710
Oh, Haibara-san!

670
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,650
Did you see that?
Hide scored with a diving header!

671
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,160
Ai-chan?

672
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,290
What's wrong?

673
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,420
Everyone, your attention please.

674
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,560
An emergency alert has been issued.

675
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,000
What's this all about?

676
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,540
-Does Shinichi have something to do with this?
-All spectators

677
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,700
seated on the Spirits end,
please follow the instructions of the staff

678
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,330
-and evacuate your seats immediately.
-There's a bomb. Attached to the scoreboard.

679
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,420
Kudo-kun is...

680
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,900
H-How can that be?

681
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,430
Repeat.

682
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,200
All spectators seated on the Spirits end,

683
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,660
please follow the instructions of the staff

684
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,670
-and evacuate your seats immediately.
-Something is definitely wrong.

685
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,830
But what could it be? Don't you want to know?

686
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,200
Shall we go get a closer look?

687
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,260
You must not.

688
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,150
Until Edogawa-kun gets back,

689
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,220
you're staying put right here.

690
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,590
He'll take care of it.

691
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,970
I just hope he actually makes it back.

692
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,380
Okay!

693
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,930
No good! I took too long!

694
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,660
No matter what, I have to protect this crossbeam.

695
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,650
Ten minutes until the time limit...

696
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,930
Damn it... am I going to make it?

697
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,240
We will now guide you
away from your seats.

698
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,700
You may take your time,

699
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,290
but please keep moving without gaps opening
with the people in front of you.

700
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,480
Please follow instructions and proceed safely

701
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,600
to the center of the pitch.

702
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,470
You may take your time,

703
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,360
but please keep moving without gaps opening
with the people in front of you.

704
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,580
What could have happened?

705
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,280
I have no idea.
Sure doesn't seem like a minor incident.

706
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,900
All members of the media, please proceed
immediately to the center of the pitch.

707
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,610
We can't just move right away!
We're carrying heavy equipment, you know!

708
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,220
You're in danger. Please leave your belongings behind.

709
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,640
Huh? You've got to be kidding!

710
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,680
There's no way I'm leaving my camera!

711
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,600
Why don't you just tell us what's going on?

712
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,500
I'm trying to--

713
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Hey, you! Wait!

714
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,620
Please come back!

715
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,820
The Internet!

716
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,280
Post what I'm sending you online, now!

717
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,830
Got it? I'll take full responsibility.

718
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,000
All I need from you

719
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,160
is to do as I say!

720
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,230
You hear me?

721
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,980
This is going to be great.

722
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,140
This is Areas D3 and D4.

723
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,220
Evacuation completed.

724
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,470

725
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,190

726
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,970
Section G, evacuation confirmed!

727
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,340
Everyone, please!

728
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,980
You need to go further down the pitch!

729
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,870
Please continue moving forward!

730
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,600
We ask for everyone's cooperation!

731
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,260
Please hold hands with your children!

732
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,780
35 seconds left...

733
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,200
There's only one left.
But I guess this is as far as I go.

734
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,400
Please! You have to hold!

735
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,540
Wh-whoa!

736
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,080
Kudo-kun...

737
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,970
Alright!

738
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,750
Our ratings will go through the roof!

739
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,630
Wow. What was that?

740
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,810
The scoreboard blew up!

741
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,080
This is it. I finally have a big scoop!

742
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,630
This is an announcement from Toto stadium.

743
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,620
-As of this moment...
-Back away slowly!

744
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,970
-Slowly please!
-our staff are instituting safe evacuation procedures.

745
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,100
Don't push! Everything's fine, now!

746
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,060
-The explosions have stopped!
-To ensure the safety of everyone,

747
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,640
please evacuate the stadium.

748
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,860
We will guide you one by one
to an emergency exit.

749
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,260
Please stay calm and follow
the instructions of the staff.

750
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,460
It stopped?

751
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,510
Please! You have to hold!

752
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,770
Oh no! It's going to collapse!

753
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,440
Run!

754
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,130
-Now what?
-What do we do?

755
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,890
Is it an earthquake?

756
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,190
Everything's fine! Please stay calm!

757
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,740
Hey, what is that?

758
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,990
Something's about to drop!

759
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,060
What's that?

760
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,450
It's the scoreboard!

761
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,960
This is bad. We have to run, now!

762
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,000
It's impossible.

763
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,880
Everyone's frozen in panic.

764
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,570
Damn! We're too late!

765
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,050
Shinichi!

766
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,600
Hey! It stopped!

767
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,440
Wow! It's a miracle!

768
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,670
Just a little longer. Be strong!

769
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,920
Pull!

(Seiji Miyane), (Hiromi Kawata)
Good afternoon.

773
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,580
It's Sunday, November 21st
and this is Information Live Miyaneya.

774
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,600
Yesterday, a terrible incident
occurred at a J-League match.

775
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,290
The slightest mistake could have led
to a major disaster

776
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,440
after an explosion occurred
during the match.

777
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,140
Please have a look at this footage.

(Miyaneya. J-League supporters targeted?

779
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,180
Yesterday, in the midst of a match
between Tokyo Spirits and Gamba Osaka,

780
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,350
an incredible incident occurred

781
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,930
after a scoreboard suddenly exploded.

782
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,650
Fortunately, the incident ended

783
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,030
with no casualties...

(The puzzle from the bomber?) (A challenge to Detective Mouri's Agency?)
The backdrop of the bombing

785
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,320
is said to involve
the famous detective Kogoro Mouri

786
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,740
and we now take you to a live feed

787
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,330
from in front of his office.

788
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,450

(Miyuki Tabuta) (A challenge to Detective Mouri?)

790
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,660
Hello, this is reporter Miyuki Tabuta reporting live
from in front of Detective Mouri's Agency.

791
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,350
After solving the bomber's puzzle,

792
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,640
Detective Mouri is now
the savior of the J-League,

793
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,810
but before the stadium explosion occurred,

794
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,160
the culprit engineered a similar incident

795
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,000
-here in front of these offices.
-Welcome, Inspector.

796
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,540
I'm sorry you had to meet me here.

797
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,730
But then, I can't take a single step outside
without being hounded by reporters.

798
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,110
Somehow, they think you're the one
who solved the puzzle, Mouri-san.

799
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,150
But then, as always,

800
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,770
Kudo-kun asked me not to mention his name.

801
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,040
Excuse me, we don't want to leave you standing.

802
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,320
Please, have a seat.

803
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,190
-Oh, thank you.
-Me too!

804
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,360
-Hey, kid...!
-Now that we're here, Mouri-kun...

805
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,390
I'm told you realized something about the bomber?

806
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,320
Yes. Well, actually it wasn't me,

807
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,430
it was the boy here.

808
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,830
Conan-kun?

809
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,420
He's been pestering me with questions

810
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,180
about the call from the bomber.

811
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,430
I wanted to tell Shinichi Ni-chan.

812
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,990
He's been really concerned.

813
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,610
And then, what is that you realized?

814
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,760
It's something the bomber said to Oji-san.

815
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,260
Not band, hand!

816
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,460
Hand as in door handle!

817
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,660
I'd heard that same phrase somewhere before.

818
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,790
Do you know the answer, Conan?

819
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,010
-Uh, yeah. It's--
-Number two!

820
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,490
Hand as in door handle.

821
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,590
You're right, that is strange.

822
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,750
You wouldn't normally say something like
"hand as in door handle," would you?

823
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,900
Right? The bomber was frustrated when Oji-san
asked him to repeat himself,

824
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,940
and he said it unconsciously,

825
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,620
because it was a phrase he'd heard before.

826
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,900
In that case, the culprit made a mistake.

827
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,060
Anyway, who are the people who heard what Endo said?

828
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,470
With the exception of the J-leaguers
who played in the match and ourselves,

829
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,700
there are four suspects.

830
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,620
Shinzo Yamamori,

831
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,490
Kaoru Koda,

832
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,630
Ryosuke Sakaki,

833
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,550
and Keiichiro Motoura.

834
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,950
Those four are who I would consider
to be the prime suspects.

835
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,450
There's one more.

836
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,430
Someone who was sitting alone
on a bench nearby.

837
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,820
Kazumasa Nakaoka.

838
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,170
Wait, the same Kazumasa Nakaoka
from the snow match at the National Stadium?

839
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,810
You've heard of him, Takagi-kun?

840
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,760
Yes. Three years ago, my nephew

841
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,030
invited me to a match with him.

842
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,310
The match was scheduled to start at 2:05,
but there was a big delay because of a snow storm.

843
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,420
If I remember it correctly,
kickoff finally took place at 3:40 PM.

844
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,710
That match was 0-0 after 90 minutes
and went into extra time.

845
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,750
There were only four minutes left
before it would go to penalties

846
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,950
when Nakaoka scored the winning goal.

847
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,200
Incredibly, the match ended at 5:50 PM.

848
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,520
So if we add Nakaoka, that makes five suspects.

849
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,890
Well, I suppose it's possible that the bomber
used the same phrase by chance.

850
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,730
Assuming their motive really was to challenge me,

851
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,200
that soccer workshop would be the only time
that I've met anyone or seen anything unusual.

852
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,680
I see.

853
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,180
We'll begin investigating those five immediately.

854
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,160
(Trigger device)

855
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,570
We did a quick look into the five people

856
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,140
that Conan-kun mentioned.

857
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,540
Shiratori-kun...

858
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,590
Yes, sir. First, Yamamori-san.

859
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,570
As a result of the bombing incident,

860
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,610
(Information Bureau Chief)
his ratings improved

861
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,920
(Shinzo Yamamori, aged 51)
and he's escaped being demoted from Bureau Chief.

862
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,400
He owes it all to the bombing.

863
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,280
Next is Koda-san.

864
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,880
Her photos from yesterday were a big scoop

865
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,380
(Explosion at Toto Stadium) (J-League targeted)
and she's gotten closer to returning to the society desk.

866
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,050
Once again, owed to the bombing.

867
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,750
Next, Sakaki-san.

868
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,980
At the present moment,

869
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,510
we're unable to find a motive
for why he would blow up the stadium.

870
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,620
However, if we consider the motive
to be a challenge to you, Mouri-san...

871
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,560
I've heard that you ridiculed him
because of an own goal

872
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,840
that happened when he was in college.

873
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,850
Oh! You're "Own Goal Takaki"!

874
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,430
I wouldn't call it ridiculing...

875
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,620
Plus, he laughed about it, too!

876
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,260
Well, there are times when people
appear to be laughing, but inside...

877
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,290
Next up is Motoura-san.

878
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,370
His only son, Tomofumi had a seizure

879
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,250
after watching the TV broadcast
of the J-League all-star game,

880
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,770
which took place at Toto Stadium.

881
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,690
He was taken by ambulance to Toto Hospital,

882
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,670
but efforts to treat him failed
and he passed away.

883
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,520
Toto Stadium and an ambulance...

884
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,670
Huh? What is it, Mouri-kun?

885
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,430
Oh, something seems familiar about all this.

886
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,360
Really?

887
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,640
Well, sort of...

888
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,270
and sort of not.

889
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,980
I guess it's just my imagination.

890
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,930
I wish he'd make up his mind.

891
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,200
The last suspect is Nakaoka-san.

892
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,250
(Kazumasa Nakaoka, 21, former star of his high school soccer team)
Three years ago, in February,

893
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,230
he had his motorcycle accident,
and immediately underwent surgery.

894
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:19,540
He continued with rehabilitation
for a half year, but his left leg never recovered

895
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,950
and the Spirits canceled the contract they had planned.

896
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,040
It was the Spirits, huh?

897
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,340
Yes. After that, he quit soccer altogether
and traveled alone to South America.

898
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,980
He returned to Japan a year later in August
and went back to his parents' home in Gunma.

899
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,150
Since then, he's apparently been involved
with biker gangs and living an unsavory lifestyle.

900
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,170
In conclusion,

901
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,050
Yamamori-san and Koda-san

902
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,190
had a motive to bomb Toto Stadium,

903
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,340
and were in an easy position to carry it out,

904
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,960
but it's hard to believe they went that far.

905
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,300
Sakaki-san also may have been ridiculed
for scoring an own goal,

906
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,770
but that hardly seems like enough
for him to want to challenge you in this way.

907
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,850
I told you. I didn't ridicule him.

908
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,050
The one who bothers me most

909
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,400
is Motoura-san, whose son had his seizure

910
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,990
after watching a J-League match
that was happening at Toto Stadium.

911
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,490
Yes, I agree.

912
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,890
But it doesn't seem reasonable

913
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,790
that he would blame the J-League, does it?

914
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,830
The match isn't directly related to his son's death, right?

915
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,580
Well, I suppose.

916
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,730
That leaves Nakaoka-san.

917
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,240
According to Inspector Yamamura
of the Gunma Prefectural Police...

918
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,240
he's really been raising hell around here.

919
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,520
How do I explain it?

920
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,720
It's like a wounded wolf

921
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,910
has come looking for a place to die.

922
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,340
Or something like that.

923
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,450
He couldn't become a J-Leaguer
because of a bike accident. That was his own fault.

924
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:48,220
Even so, it's not hard to imagine that he would
resent the Spirits for reneging on their agreement.

925
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,910
For that reason, we have decided
to keep a close eye on Nakaoka.

926
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,700
You there, on the motorcycle! Stop!

927
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:18,990
Cut the crap already!

928
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,560
Why are you following me?

929
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,610
Who said we were following you?

930
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,930
Do you think I'm stupid?

931
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,540
You've been staking out the shop all afternoon!

932
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,350
What did I do, huh?

933
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,460
Now...

934
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,000
We're only here to make sure

935
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,020
that you haven't done anything.

936
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,280
That's logic only a policeman could love,

937
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,530
Give me a break!

938
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,520
Kazuma Nakaoka!

939
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,820
You're under arrest

940
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,650
for attempted assault and obstruction of justice.

941
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,690
(Detective Mouri's Agency)
What? You arrested Nakaoka-san?

942
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,540
Oh, uh... while we were on stake out last night,

943
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,000
he lost his cool and tried to punch me.

944
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:06,000
This morning, after he'd calmed down,
we had a chance to question him.

945
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,330
But honestly,

946
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,420
it doesn't seem like he
holds any grudge toward the Spirits.

947
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,430
What?

948
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,690
How can that be?

949
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,180
Well, when we got to the topic of them not signing him...

950
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,050
Talk about a bad guess!

951
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,850
I'm grateful to the Spirits,

952
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,130
not resentful.

953
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,600
Don't lie to us!

954
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,350
What do you mean by that?

955
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,140
This information was never released
to the media, but...

956
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,250
It wasn't Spirits who backed out on our deal.

957
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,780
I was the one who asked them

958
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,730
to forget the whole thing.

959
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,060
What?

960
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,790
After my bike accident,

961
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,400
the Spirits paid for my surgery and rehabilitation.

962
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,600
And while my left leg never fully recovered,

963
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,910
they still offered to give me a contract.

964
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,430
They wanted me as an option at forward,

965
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,890
even if were only for 15 minutes a match.

966
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,560
Then why did you...?

967
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,430
My pride wouldn't allow it!

968
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,590
A player incapable of being
on the pitch for 90 minutes

969
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,160
has no right... no right to play soccer at all!

970
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,810
Let alone become a pro J-leaguer!

971
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,730
We've already confirmed his story with the Spirits.

972
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,910
We also received this from the manager
of the store where he works part time.

973
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,610
It's reportedly a photo
Yamaoka sent from South America.

974
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,760
He certainly looks like a different person
from what Inspector Yamamura described.

975
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,350
There's a message on the back.

976
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,850
Dear Boss, I guess I can't quit soccer after all.

977
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,140
I see.

978
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,390
Despite his appearance,
it seems that he likes children a lot.

979
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,120
He might be a decent person who really loves the game.

980
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,100
But if Nakaoka-san isn't the culprit,

981
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,050
then who could it be?

982
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,200
That reminds me...

983
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,470
Suginami Athletic Park,

984
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,600
6 PM, K.K.

985
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,590
Who is K.K.?

986
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,310
Now then,

987
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,680
I'm here at the appointed time, but...

988
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,010
Who could K.K.--

989
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,620
Wait, that's--

990
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,910
Morning! Up pretty early, aren't you Kid?

991
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,870
Good morning!

992
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,230
I see. K.K is King Kazu!

993
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,430
The initials referred to Kazuyoshi Miura!

994
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,810
-Um, excuse me...
-Can I help you with something, boy?

995
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,610
Do you know Kaoru Koda?
From the Nichiuri Shimbun Newspaper.

996
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,900
Kaoru Koda? Nichiuri?

997
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,900
Oh, her! I don't know how she found out,

998
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,960
but she learned that I sometimes
trained at this spot

999
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,030
and asked if she could take photos.

1000
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,870
Is that so?

1001
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,260
But I said no.

1002
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,830
I'm a professional, you see.

1003
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,550
Rather than pictures of me training,
I want her to take photos of me

1004
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,770
when I play.

1005
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,310
Especially when I score a goal.

1006
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,430
So then, this has nothing to do with the incident.

1007
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,460
Oh, by the way,

1008
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,230
do you like soccer, little boy?

1009
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,190
Yeah!

1010
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,240
Well then,

1011
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,590
do you want to join me?

1012
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:35,910
Yeah!

1013
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,610
You're pretty good, kid.

1014
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,240
Thanks!

1015
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,650
Okay, run!

1016
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,530
Now let's try a shot.

1017
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,300
Golazo! Nice goal!

1018
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,280
That was a good strike, kid.

1019
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,380
Thank you very much!

1020
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,970
It's cold out here...

1021
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,550
Unbelievable... where did Conan go now?

1022
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,100
A delivery at this time of morning?

1023
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,180
I hope it's not another threat!

1024
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,040
Oh, it's just a letter for dad.

1025
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,360
(To Detective Mouri)

1026
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,410
This is...

1027
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,840
Hey there, little boy.

1028
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,240
Yes?

1029
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,730
Thanks for helping me out this morning.
I needed someone to practice with.

1030
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,670
No, the pleasure's mine!

1031
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,810
As a reward, take this.

1032
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,920
A wristband!

1033
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,670
Thank you very much!

1034
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,220
You're the second to have one.

1035
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,020
I think I gave the last kid

1036
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,680
a red wristband.

1037
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,090
Huh?

1038
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,400
It must have been 14 or 15 years ago.

1039
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,850
I practiced in the park
with someone right around your age.

1040
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,950
He had a pretty good strike, too.

1041
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,420
Is he a J-Leaguer now?

1042
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,960
Who knows...

1043
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,870
I didn't ask his name.

1044
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,880
But if he's still playing soccer,

1045
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,740
he might really be a J-leaguer.

1046
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,160
Get home safe!

1047
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,420
Thanks!

1048
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,610
Okay! See you next time!

1049
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,560
Hey!

1050
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,400
Watch where you're going! That hurt!

1051
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,570
Yamamori-san...

1052
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,170
Oh, Kaoru-chan.

1053
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,430
Sorry about that. I was in a hurry.

1054
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,710
We're both pretty busy since that incident, eh?

1055
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,430
I'm not as busy as you.

1056
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,700
That carefree smile
means you're onto something new, doesn't it?

1057
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,700
Hmm, I wonder.

1058
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,560
Well, I'm praying for your success.

1059
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,890
As long as you don't get the jump on me, that is.

1060
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,360
I know, already.

1061
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,670
Anyway, I'm in a hurry, so...

1062
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,800
Hey, wait a second!

1063
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,980
That woman... What's she up to?

1064
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,120
Wait, this notebook is...

1065
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,610
(OY. December 3rd, Shiodome Arena)

1066
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,360
To Detective Mouri,

1067
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,080
this isn't over.

1068
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,950
Next time, even more people

1069
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,500
will witness the explosion

1070
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,270
and share a moment of terror.

1071
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,220
Detailed instructions will arrive
at a later date. I'm praying for your success.

1072
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,350
A parcel arrived this morning

1073
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,980
in the office mailbox.

1074
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,320
When I took it out, I found that card.

1075
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,550
I see.

1076
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Um...

1077
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,280
Do you really think that's from the bomber?

1078
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,850
It might be someone's idea of a prank.

1079
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,740
No, I think it's likely from the culprit.

1080
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,830
Last time, we made the contents of the puzzle public,

1081
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,750
but we withheld the final words of the message.

1082
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,580
The final words...

1083
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,610
I'm praying for your success.

1084
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,890
I see.

1085
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,290
"I'm praying for your success."

1086
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,910
Yes. And this note ends the same way.

1087
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,180
Damn it. He's playing us for fools!

1088
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,560
But then, there was no puzzle this time.

1089
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,900
There wasn't. But there's still a hint.

1090
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,040
This portion of the message.

1091
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,050
Next time, even more people

1092
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,620
will witness the explosion.

1093
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,900
I think it means that next time,
the bomb will be placed

1094
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,980
somewhere even more people are gathered.

1095
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,910
There were 80,000 people in Toto Stadium last time.

1096
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,910
So then, next time will be somewhere
with more than 80,000 people gathered.

1097
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,420
Any idea where that could be?

1098
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,140
I've got it!

1099
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,500
Where then, Chiba-kun?

1100
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,370
Right here. Look at that poster.

1101
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,260
On December 3rd, at Shiodome Arena,

1102
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,610
there will be a concert with popular musicians.

1103
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,440
They even call it the 100,000 Concert.

1104
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,710
December 3rd?

1105
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,450
Wait a second, Yoko-chan will perform
at that concert, too!

1106
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:35,760
That's right, Yoko-chan--
I mean Yoko Okino, will appear there.

1107
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,930
You're not going to actually let her appear?

1108
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,030
I don't think it's up to us.

1109
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,130
So, a concert hall where someone
close with Mouri-san will perform

1110
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,840
is the next target.

1111
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,850
It can't be a coincidence.

1112
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,820
But that means the culprit really is

1113
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,270
someone who is angry at you, Mr. Mouri.

1114
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,830
But who among those five

1115
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,990
would have a grudge against Mouri-san?

1116
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,230
Excuse me...

1117
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,910
This has nothing to do
with the grudge against Mouri-san,

1118
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,890
but the organizer of that concert

1119
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,600
is Nichiuri TV, where Mr. Yamamori works.

1120
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,220
On the evening of the concert,
the news show that he produces

1121
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,040
is scheduled to broadcast
some of the performances live.

1122
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,360
I see. If the explosion happens
during that broadcast,

1123
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,290
his ratings will go up for sure.

1124
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,120
Yamamori, huh?

1125
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,570
Now that you mention it, he...

1126
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,040
Well, I'm praying for your success.

1127
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,070
I'm praying for your success. Both of you.

1128
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:35,220
Damn it...

1129
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,060
I see. If the phrase is a habit of his,
he may be including it unconsciously.

1130
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,150
And then, there's Koda-san.

1131
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,920
She may have a personal reason

1132
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,200
to hold a grudge against Okino-san.

1133
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,860
What? A grudge against Yoko-chan?

1134
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,060
According to her co-workers,

1135
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:56,120
she's been following Okino-san constantly
but her management guards against scoops.

1136
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,870
She's said to have complained
that she couldn't get a single photograph.

1137
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,980
That reminds me, that notebook of hers...

1138
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,460
(Suginami Athletics Park, 6:00 AM. K.K, S vs A, O Y
December 3rd, Shiodome Arena)

1139
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,390
Say, during the soccer workshop,

1140
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,610
I had a chance to look at Kaoru-san's notebook.

1141
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,030
The words OY, December 3rd,
Shiodome Arena

1142
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,230
were written down.

1143
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,320
What?

1144
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,940
OY. Aren't those Yoko-chan's initials?

1145
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,050
You little creep!

1146
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,860
-How could you keep something like that quiet?
-Dad, calm down!

1147
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,960
Now now, Mouri-san.

1148
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,350
We don't know yet if Koda-san really is the culprit.

1149
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,590
But then, with this evidence,

1150
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,770
two of our suspects are back in play.

1151
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,240
As for the other suspects...

1152
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,940
Say, Ran-chan!

1153
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,690
Do you know exactly when that card
from the culprit was placed in your mailbox?

1154
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,380
At the very least,

1155
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,550
when I looked into the box last night,

1156
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,830
it wasn't there.

1157
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:47,960
Then it must have been placed there after that.

1158
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,950
And that means Nakaoka isn't the culprit, right?

1159
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:51,900
Exactly.

1160
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,250
Why is that?

1161
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,020
We still have him in custody.

1162
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,180
He'll be released this afternoon, though.

1163
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:02,720
By the way, Ran-kun...

1164
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,310
What about the parcel that was also in the box?

1165
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:06,660
Oh, right.

1166
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,660
The parcel arrived early this morning.

1167
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,060
It was sent on behalf

1168
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,480
of all Tokyo Spirits supporters.

1169
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,260
Inside, there was a thank you message

1170
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,080
and a necktie.

1171
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,530
Oh, I apologize.

1172
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,310
The envelope seemed to have

1173
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,250
some glue leaking from its edge.

1174
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,850
Don't worry about that.

1175
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,270
-Thanks.
-Not at all.

1176
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,560
Well, whatever the case, it looks like a grudge
against the J League or Tokyo Spirits

1177
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,360
isn't the real motive.

1178
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,530
We'll take another look

1179
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,550
at Shinzo Yamamori and Kaoru Koda!

1180
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,770
Looks like something's bothering you.

1181
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,350
Yes. The concert under threat

1182
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,790
is on December 3rd.

1183
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,060
The same day as the final match
of the J-League season?

1184
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,780
Right. It seems strange, doesn't it?

1185
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,760
On top of that, why would the bomber

1186
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,810
send a message that makes it so easy

1187
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:04,910
to narrow down the location?

1188
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:05,930
(Next time, even more people will witness
the explosion and share a moment of terror.)

1189
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:10,470
At this rate, security will be tighter
and won't that just make it more difficult to pull off the crime?

1190
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,760
When you put it that way, you're right.

1191
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:17,520
Do you think the culprit is confident
they'll be able to set or carry in the bomb,

1192
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,830
no matter how tight security gets?

1193
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,530
Perhaps...

1194
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,380
Or maybe there's somewhere
other than Shiodome arena

1195
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,310
where more than 80,000 people will be gathered.

1196
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,100
Or the culprit is simply lying.

1197
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,310
No, criminals who do this sort of things

1198
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,350
almost never lie.

1199
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,980
I can say that with confidence.

1200
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,400
If there is deception...

1201
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,470
If there is deception?

1202
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:45,630
It would a trick with words,
meant to mislead us.

1203
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:49,600
Your source for sports and entertainment news!

1204
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,740
First up, the J-League.

1205
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,990
On Saturday, December 3rd,

1206
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,080
the season finale
will take place as scheduled.

1207
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:58,450
Due to the recent explosion at Toto Stadium,
the league considered canceling all matches,

1208
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,350
but in a press conference just now,

1209
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,570
Chairman Ohigashi announced that they will go on.

1210
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,560
Kickoff for all final matches
will be December 3rd at 3:30 PM.

1211
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,530
On that same Saturday, December 3rd,
there's another event starting at 3:30 PM.

1212
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,540
"Power of Music in Shidome Arena,"

1213
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,300
also known as the 100,000 Concert.

1214
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,430
This event is...

1215
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,810
(Shiodome Arena)
This is an announcement

1216
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,400
for all guests attending tonight's event.

1217
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,210
Upon entering the arena...

1218
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,610
We apologize for the inconvenience, but...

1219
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,470
Thank you very much.

1220
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,750
Please make two lines in front of the inspection gate!

1221
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,410
(Yoko Okino)
Well then, Yoko-chan!

1222
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,910
I'll see you later.

1223
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,580
Have a great show.

1224
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,260
Excuse us.

1225
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,730
-Is everything ready for the live broadcast?
-Yes, everyone's on standby.

1226
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,640
You never know what will happen when you're live.

1227
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,540
Tell them to remain alert.

1228
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,600
Yes, sir.

1229
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,130
Say, Inspector...

1230
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,080
Do you really think the explosion

1231
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,240
will be at Shiodome Arena?

1232
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,320
Huh?

1233
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,330
-Well, you know--
-We've already been over this!

1234
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,740
There are no other events
where more than 80,000 people will gather.

1235
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,900
It has to be Shiodome Arena.

1236
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,100
Stupid kid...

1237
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,530
That's why I told Ran
to take you to the movies.

1238
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,110
Tell us, Conan-kun... Is there something
bothering you about our conclusion?

1239
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:21,220
Well, it's just that today's also
the J-league finale.

1240
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,540
Don't you think it's strange that it happens
on the same day as the concert?

1241
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,450
That does seem strange...

1242
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,020
It's just a coincidence!

1243
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,500
If you keep taking us off track,
you'll get in the way of the investigation.

1244
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,530
No...

1245
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,760
Just in case, we also decided

1246
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,680
to ask for increased security at the matches.

1247
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:41,370
I believe the kickoff

1248
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,580
is at 3:30 PM.

1249
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,590
It's about to start.

1250
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,820
Well fans,

1251
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,860
(National Stadium)
with a win today, Tokyo Spirits will be crowned champions.

1252
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,690
On the other hand, if Big Osaka are defeated,
they will be relegated.

1253
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,080
It's a match neither team can afford to lose.

1254
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,880
The referee whistles for kickoff
at exactly 3:30 PM.

1255
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,440
Oh! It's started!

1256
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,880
Looks like we haven't missed much.

1257
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:07,160
Say, Sonoko, why did you lie
and say we were going to the movies?

1258
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,680
Oh, sorry about that.

1259
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,930
If I said we were going to a soccer match,

1260
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,400
I thought your father would stop us.

1261
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:18,460
But this is the last day of the year
when I'll get to lay eyes on Higo in action.

1262
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,390
Go! You can do it, Higo-san!

1263
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,130
(J-League Headquarters)

1264
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,320
We let Higo score...

1265
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,980
I wish I could eat something, too...

1266
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,380
If it's just a little, I'll allow it.

1267
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,840
Well then, I'm off to the concession stand.

1268
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,400
What happened to Higo?

1269
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,880
He's holding his thigh.

1270
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,530
Oh no, he fell down!

1271
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:47,870
Is he okay...?

1272
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:51,170
Oh, looks like Higo's being subbed.

1273
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,300
The more skilled the player,

1274
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,870
the more they're targeted.

1275
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,320
I've changed my mind. No food.

1276
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:01,060
Sanada! Start warming up!

1277
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,320
I did that ages ago.

1278
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,210
Good. Go out there and get a goal.

1279
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,310
Yes sir.

1280
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,740
Sorry... Takahiro, I'm counting on you.

1281
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,330
Just leave it to me.

1282
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,400
You can rest a whole year if you want, Sempai.

1283
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,640
Shut up!

1284
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,770
Just get out there!

1285
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,630
Sanada has taken the pitch

1286
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,620
in place of Higo.

1287
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,910
What is it?

1288
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,640
Well? How does everything look there?

1289
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,720
-Anything unusual happened?
-Not really.

1290
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,090
I doubt there are 80,000 people here, either.

1291
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,330
What about the kids?

1292
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:42,200
Man, we really get to watch all ten matches at once!

1293
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,620
It's awesome!

1294
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,640
Sure is.

1295
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,080
We can share the suspense of every match
at the same time!

1296
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,230
It's amazing.

1297
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,590
Well? Did you hear them, Edogawa-kun?

1298
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,370
"Share the suspense at the same time"...

1299
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,680
Could the bomber's objective be...

1300
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,290
Asuza-chan!

1301
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,700
It's fine. She works at the cafe downstairs.

1302
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,510
Sorry to bother you, but there was a phone call
from someone with a weird voice.

1303
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,770
What?

1304
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,610
The caller said that they left you a message

1305
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:18,300
in the phone booth on 2nd street.

1306
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,510
What!

1307
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,160
(Warning)

1308
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,120
(A bomb has been planted at all 10 J-League stadiums)

1309
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:40,980
Warning.

1310
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,380
A bomb has been planted

1311
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,720
at all 10 J-League stadiums!

1312
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:47,330
-What!
-Damn... I knew it!

1313
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,590
The bombs will explode

1314
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,270
at the time the match has ended.

1315
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,820
There will be no additional time.

1316
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,240
However, it wouldn't be fun
if you had no chance.

1317
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,980
So here it is.

1318
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,140
In the second half, if the teams
attacking the home goal

1319
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,790
carry out the play I instruct here,

1320
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,860
you will be able to stop the explosion.

1321
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:10,630
As a signal that the bomb has deactivated,
the lights of the scoreboard will blink twice.

1322
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:12,950
The scoreboard, again?

1323
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,350
However, the instructions may only be given

1324
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,680
to each team's manager and ace striker.

1325
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,340
No other players can be allowed to know.

1326
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,580
If I notice anything strange during the matches,
like spectators being evacuated

1327
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,200
or a search for the bombs taking place,

1328
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,740
the bombs will explode instantly.

1329
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,730
Have each team's ace striker

1330
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,890
wear a red wristband on their left wrist.

1331
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:42,510
Now then, the play that will allow
the bombs to be stopped...

1332
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,560
Huh? What is it?

1333
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:51,440
has already been included within this message.

1334
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,280
What?

1335
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,500
Note that even if the bombs do not explode,

1336
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:01,740
you are not to search for them until 35 minutes
have passed from the end of the match.

1337
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,560
If you do not obey,
I cannot guarantee the safety of the spectators.

1338
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,460
Kogoro Mouri! If you want to stop me,

1339
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,780
you must become the 11th striker

1340
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,260
and come to me!

1341
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,410
I'm praying for your success.

1342
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,120
Damn it. There's that line again.

1343
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,330
This guy pisses me off!

1344
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,230
Just as I thought. A language trick
that's meant to mislead us.

1345
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,720
We've been misled.

1346
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,180
All of today's matches are synchronized
to start at the same time.

1347
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,400
If we add up all the spectators at each match,

1348
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:33,400
it's much more than 80,000.

1349
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,820
You're right.

1350
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,910
The warning letter didn't say they would all
be in one place.

1351
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,210
Takagi, what time does regulation end?

1352
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,980
Umm, 5:15 I think.

1353
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,960
Oh no! We only have one hour!

1354
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,030
What is it, Sato-kun?

1355
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,240
The first line of the message

1356
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,200
only says warning

1357
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,840
and it seems like they stapled the paper

1358
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,150
before they wrote it.

1359
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:27,160
Huh?

1360
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,810
If you look closely,

1361
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,700
the red ink spelling the character "su"

1362
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,420
extends all the way to the top of the staple.

1363
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,630
I see.

1364
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,450
But the problem is...

1365
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:42,030
Why would they staple the paper
before writing the message?

1366
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,460
A staple...

1367
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,380
A red ink mark right on the middle of it.

1368
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,690
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

1369
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,440
I see. So that's it!

1370
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,570
I've got it!

1371
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,520
I know the play they're demanding.

1372
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,810
What is it, Conan? Did you figure something out?

1373
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,090
Say,

1374
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,310
the rectangle that's drawn around the message

1375
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,620
looks almost like a soccer pitch, doesn't it?

1376
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,260
Huh?

1377
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,370
What are you babbling about?

1378
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,900
If this rectangle is the pitch,

1379
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,030
then the staple must be the goal.

1380
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,730
I mean, a staple is shaped similar

1381
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,100
to a soccer goal, right?

1382
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,670
Can I see that?

1383
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:28,410
And then, the straight line
through the character "su"

1384
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:31,210
is extended toward the staple goal, isn't it?

1385
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,040
If so, this is...

1386
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,230
the movement of the ball.

1387
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,880
So then, they're demanding
that the goal be scored down the middle?

1388
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,460
Wait a second, Inspector.

1389
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,890
To score a goal,

1390
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,890
you have to put the ball
between the posts.

1391
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:48,000
But if that were the case, they would have
drawn the line before stapling,

1392
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,830
and it would extend beyond the staple.

1393
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,700
But what actually happened

1394
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,270
is that the line was drawn
after the paper was stapled

1395
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,580
and the line stops
when it reaches the staple.

1396
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,230
I see.

1397
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,930
If the red ink
on top of the staple itself

1398
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:04,990
is meant to be the soccer ball,
that would be the center of the crossbar.

1399
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:07,720
So the bomber is demanding

1400
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,870
that they play a shot off the center
of the crossbar!

1401
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:14,030
Okay! It's time to contact
each J-League club.

1402
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,150
Right.

1403
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:19,830
Yes, this is Megure.

1404
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,050
This is Shiratori.

1405
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,130
I'm almost certain
we know who the culprit is.

1406
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:25,990
What? You know who the culprit is?

1407
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,030
A bomb?

1408
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,560
Is this for real?

1409
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,750
Yes. It was the police who contacted us.

1410
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,810
What do you think? Can you do it?

1411
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,210
If you can't, tell me now.

1412
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,780
No one will blame you for saying no.

1413
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:52,340
I'll ask someone else--

1414
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
Who?

1415
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,280
Eh?

1416
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,520
Who is this other person?

1417
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,680
Who else are you going to ask?

1418
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:02,910
The bomber said it had to be the ace striker, right?

1419
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,250
I may not be the team's ace,

1420
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:09,060
but with Higo off, I'm the only one
who can be called a striker.

1421
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:10,580
Aren't I?

1422
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,740
Sanada...

1423
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,750
Anyway, I'll manage somehow.

1424
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,880
Plus, if we stop the bomb,

1425
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,800
I'll be a big star, won't I?

1426
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,740
I'll bet the chicks will be crawling
all over me.

1427
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,340
Sanada...

1428
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,020
Put this on your left wrist.

1429
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:34,220
Oh, uh... I'm just trembling
with excitement, that's all.

1430
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,680
I'm counting on you, Sanada.

1431
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,150
Yes, sir!

1432
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,800
Do you think Tokyo Spirits
will be champions?

1433
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,800
No way. It'll be Kashiwa Reysol.

1434
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,580
Here come the players!

1435
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,840
Second half kicks off!

1436
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,830
I couldn't wait any longer!

1437
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,800
I'm excited for the second half.

1438
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,890
I suppose.

1439
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,650
Hello?

1440
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:05,310
Haibara, listen carefully.

1441
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,840
The bomber
is targeting the J-League, after all.

1442
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,020
The ace striker wearing a red wristband...

1443
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,970
Got it. If anything strange happens,
I'll let you know.

1444
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,040
Please do! I'm on my way to meet the culprit--

1445
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,960
Sorry. I'll have to call you back.

1446
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,860
Huh? Wait, Kudo-kun!

1447
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1448
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,350
You know where to go, right?

1449
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,170
Yes.

1450
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,270
Are you ready, Mouri-kun?

1451
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,650
What the--

1452
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,990
What are you doing in here?

1453
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:39,420
It can't be helped. Just go!

1454
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:40,500
Yes sir.

1455
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,540
What did you say?

1456
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,660
Professor, quiet down!

1457
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,250
S-Sorry.

1458
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,450
So who would each team's ace striker be?

1459
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,510
Look for the red wristbands.

1460
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,200
According to Kudo-kun,

1461
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:01,570
the bombs will go off at 3:15,
the end of regulation time.

1462
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,700
Isn't there some way to evacuate everyone?

1463
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,780
It's not possible.

1464
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,640
If we do, the bomb will be set off remotely.

1465
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,600
We have to rely on the J-leaguers, then.

1466
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,820
Yes.

1467
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,560
The lives of everyone
in those stadiums are with them.

1468
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:20,000
With the ten strikers, that is.

1469
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,210
Okay.

1470
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:33,870
He hit it!

1471
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,760
What?

1472
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,730
Sanada just hit the goal post!

1473
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,160
Are you sure, Conan-kun?

1474
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,920
Yes. The radio commentary
just said the same.

1475
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,570
Good. Then the National Stadium is safe.

1476
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,130
No, we don't know yet.

1477
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,520
I left instructions to call this car

1478
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,640
when the deactivation signal
on the scoreboard was confirmed.

1479
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,890
So then, it hasn't...?

1480
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,990
Why? I hit it, didn't I?

1481
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:57,720
Hey! Sanada!

1482
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,570
Track back!

1483
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:00,560
Oh no!

1484
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,080
Damn it, Sanada!

1485
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,530
What are you doing?

1486
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,890
You suck!

1487
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,210
Sonoko, sit down!

1488
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,960
How could Higo get injured like that...

1489
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,950
What was the point of coming
all the way to see him?

1490
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:19,670
Sanada! If you miss again, we won't forgive you!

1491
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,180
What's going on? In every stadium,

1492
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,750
they're hitting the crossbar.

1493
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,750
They haven't scored a goal or anything,

1494
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,760
so why are they so happy?

1495
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:43,120
These strikers are the best of the best.

1496
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:47,410
Even under these extreme circumstances,
they all manage to hit the crossbar.

1497
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,890
Yes. It's truly amazing.

1498
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:54,910
Inspector! We've confirmed deactivation
at the Cerezo vs. Tochigi match.

1499
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,560
Roger.

1500
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,830
Yes!

1501
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,350
That leaves four stadiums.

1502
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,210
Right.

1503
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,590
I see him!

1504
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,030
Mouri-san, too?

1505
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,970
What's going on?

1506
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,390
Why so many of you?

1507
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,430
We have little time,
so we'll cut to the chase.

1508
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,580
I considered it significant
that when your late son Tomofumi died,

1509
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,070
he was carried by ambulance to a hospital

1510
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,230
nearby Toto Stadium,
where the explosion took place recently.

1511
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:28,770
I took the liberty
of researching.

1512
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,540
That day, at Toto Stadium,

1513
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,050
the J-League All Star Game was underway

1514
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,510
and when the ambulance carrying Tomofumi

1515
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:40,190
took a route that passed by the stadium,

1516
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,850
the road was blocked by excited fans

1517
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,490
and the ambulance couldn't move for a short time.

1518
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,470
I'm told that the fans

1519
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:53,240
beat the ambulance with their hands
and megaphones in an uproar.

1520
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,820
On top of that, the person leading the crowd...

1521
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,190
I remember!

1522
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:00,360
Yes. It was you, Mouri-san.

1523
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,540
What?

1524
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,130
It's true.

1525
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,760
That day, I went wild at the horse races,
and came home drunk.

1526
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:29,090
Damn it... I had forgotten
until just now.

1527
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,390
So the one being carried
by that ambulance

1528
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,510
was your son...

1529
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:38,500
The ambulance was delayed for...

1530
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:40,940
Only about two minutes, I believe.

1531
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,890
It's impossible to say
that was the reason Tomofumi died.

1532
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,220
Still...

1533
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:50,820
Still, if it weren't for the stupid behavior
of those people,

1534
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:53,160
Tomofumi might have been saved.

1535
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:58,420
I love soccer, just like my son did.

1536
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,510
The J-League, too, of course.

1537
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:04,390
However, Mouri-san and those other idiots...

1538
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,750
I cannot forgive them!

1539
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,410
Which club were the fans from?

1540
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:16,690
I don't know. I couldn't see outside.

1541
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:21,170
All I know is that Kogoro Mouri and those fans
stopped the ambulance from moving.

1542
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,960
I see.

1543
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,750
It's because you didn't know
which club they supported

1544
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:28,660
that you planted bombs in every stadium.

1545
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:29,800
Huh?

1546
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,910
Motoura-san...

1547
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:35,050
After solving the bomber's puzzle

1548
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,190
and speaking to Coach Sakaki,

1549
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,580
we're now certain.

1550
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:40,290
You're the culprit.

1551
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,510
What do you mean, "culprit"?

1552
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,960
How did Takafumi score his goal?

1553
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,570
Eh? Well, he hit
the center of the crossbar

1554
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:51,820
and the ball rebounded
into the back of the net.

1555
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:54,890
The solution to the culprit's puzzle

1556
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:58,490
was for every team to strike
the center of the crossbar.

1557
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,400
How about it, Motoura-san?

1558
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,590
I keep telling you,

1559
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:20,380
I don't know what you mean by "culprit,"
"puzzle" or any of this.

1560
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:21,900
Motoura-san...

1561
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,330
The story about the ambulance

1562
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,940
doesn't end there.

1563
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,280
When Mouri-san and the others
stopped the ambulance,

1564
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,530
they were trying to help someone.

1565
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,640
It's true.

1566
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,390
That day, I saw an old man
collapse from the heat

1567
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:42,770
and I tried to help by calling 119
and performing first-aid.

1568
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,610
We were waiting for an ambulance to arrive.

1569
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,370
It's finally here!

1570
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,410
Everyone, make room!

1571
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,870
The ambulance is here!

1572
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,130
Damn it, that stupid ambulance.

1573
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:00,690
It's going the wrong way!

1574
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,660
Hey! Over here!

1575
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,990
After that, the ambulance I called arrived

1576
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,960
and the old man was saved.

1577
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:11,680
Is that so?

1578
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:17,100
Even if it was a misunderstanding, I am deeply sorry
for stopping the ambulance carrying your son.

1579
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,250
You have every right to hold a grudge.

1580
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:23,870
However, for you to involve innocent people is wrong!

1581
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,870
Motoura-san...

1582
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,340
Please deactivate the bombs now.

1583
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,100
Just as Mouri-san said,

1584
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,150
what you're doing is wrong.

1585
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,540
Whoa! Hold on a second!

1586
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:36,320
What is all this about?

1587
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:38,030
It's not you, then?

1588
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,430
You didn't plant
those bombs in the stadiums?

1589
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,490
Well?

1590
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,940
Something isn't right.

1591
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,960
Inspector, Shiratori... may I have a moment?

1592
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,140
This isn't getting us anywhere.

1593
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,850
Do we have any more solid proof?

1594
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,830
There's only ten minutes left
until the time limit.

1595
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,070
I know what's bothering me!

1596
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,130
I knew it. The culprit...

1597
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,860
Detectives, let's put an end to this.

1598
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,440
I understand now

1599
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,520
why you came to see me.

1600
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,340
However, I am not involved!

1601
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,610
I don't think Motoura-san
is the culprit, either.

1602
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,150
After all, the culprit would be very eager
to see how each match ends, right?

1603
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,390
But Motoura-san

1604
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,440
hasn't even looked at his watch, once.

1605
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:59,280
Even when you all weren't watching.

1606
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,560
Are you sure, Conan-kun?

1607
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,930
I was watching him the whole time.

1608
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,550
Unbelievable...

1609
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:12,690
But then, if the way to stop the bombs
is to take the same shot that Tomofumi did,

1610
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,210
that can't be a coincidence.

1611
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,890
Why...?

1612
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,990
Damn it... We've come this far,
but now we're back to square one.

1613
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,090
Inspector!

1614
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,720
There's only one location left.

1615
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,870
What?

1616
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,590
If the bomb at the National Stadium,
where the Spirits and Big Osaka are playing, stops...

1617
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:26,960
we're all clear.

1618
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:29,380
So they did it!

1619
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:32,230
Motoura-san, would you mind
turning on your TV?

1620
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:33,900
Certainly.

1621
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,680
Only five minutes remain in the match.

1622
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,080
Big Osaka's striker

1623
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,540
is Sanada, right?

1624
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,730
It's not Higo? Damn it...

1625
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:43,210
There's no time left.

1626
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:45,630
We'll have to rely on Sanada
to stop the bomb.

1627
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,280
The only thing I can do now
is to determine the real culprit, fast!

1628
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,910
This is...

1629
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:57,500
This is the same photo
that was on Motoura-san's cell phone.

1630
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:58,850
Huh?

1631
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,010
In this picture, Tomofumi-kun

1632
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:03,990
isn't looking at the camera.

1633
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,340
Who is he waving to?

1634
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,460
Say! the person
with the video camera in this photo

1635
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,780
is you, right, Motoura-san?

1636
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,670
Yes. I was taking video and the photo was taken
from the other side by my wife.

1637
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,480
That's this video camera, right?

1638
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,830
May I watch the video?

1639
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,490
Sure, if you like.

1640
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,620
Thanks!

1641
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:31,890
If my reasoning is correct,

1642
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,360
I'll see them.

1643
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:35,980
I knew it.

1644
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:37,700
There!

1645
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:38,930
So it's them, after all.

1646
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,360
Wasn't that a foul?

1647
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,360
Indeed.

1648
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,730
It's a perfect position.

1649
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,090
Motoura-san,

1650
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,900
please turn the volume up.

1651
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:47,980
Okay, sure.

1652
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,640
Oh! Sanada is brought down!

1653
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:55,650
Big Osaka have earned a free kick!

1654
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,140
With only two minutes left,

1655
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,870
-it's a free kick from a perfect position.
-Sanada, stay calm!

1656
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,890
-It looks like Sanda will take it.
-Deep breaths!

1657
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:04,460
Sanada has yet to take advantage

1658
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,690
of the chances he's had, today.

1659
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,300
The team is truly on the brink.

1660
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,330
Can he save Big from relegation?

1661
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:23,790
It's in!

1662
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:26,490
Big Osaka has equalized

1663
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,830
in the final minutes!

1664
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,700
Well?

1665
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,190
Did he hit the right spot?

1666
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,180
It's hard to tell from TV.

1667
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,440
Hey! Cut it out!

1668
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,720
Now it's Spirits who are on the brink!

1669
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,430
We're about to reach the end
of 90-minute regulation!

1670
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,020
What? It didn't work?

1671
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,930
We're past the appointed time.

1672
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,230
Why hasn't the bomb gone off?

1673
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,050
Maybe the culprit made a mistake.

1674
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,930
No, I'll bet the reason it didn't go off

1675
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,760
is because it deactivated
the first time he hit the bar.

1676
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,550
I'll bet the scoreboard is broken.

1677
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,080
Either way, lucky for us!

1678
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:16,140
Now our problem is figuring out
who the culprit is.

1679
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,840
I keep telling you. It's not me!

1680
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,340
If that person is responsible,

1681
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,170
then the culprit and this boy must be...

1682
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,020
Say, Oji-san...

1683
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,210
Did anyone else ever ask you

1684
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:33,820
about how Takafumi died?

1685
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,220
Well...

1686
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,150
Now that you mention it,
I heard my wife tell someone.

1687
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,710
But I don't know who it was.

1688
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,410
Then the culprit must be them.

1689
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,090
But they...

1690
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,310
This paper craft that Tomofumi made...

1691
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,250
The glue has come off.

1692
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,740
The envelope seemed to have glue

1693
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,540
leaking from its edges.

1694
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,030
Oh no!

1695
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,550
What are you doing?

1696
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:07,010
I'm certain who it is!

1697
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:10,330
That means the timer
really hasn't been deactivated.

1698
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,630
Damn it...

1699
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,310
Huh?

1700
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,440
Hello?

1701
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,070
Kogoro Mouri, I presume.

1702
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,090
It can't be!

1703
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,100
You bastard! Where are you?

1704
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:28,510
It seems you have no chance of reaching me where I am.

1705
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:29,800
What did you say?

1706
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,000
You are not worthy

1707
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:34,130
to be the eleventh striker.

1708
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,740
The referee whistles for time up!

1709
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:43,970
This year's champions are Kashiwa Reysol!

1710
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,500
This is awful. If I don't hurry,
I won't make it!

1711
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,580
Hey, is everything okay?

1712
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,780
Forget about me. What are you all doing here?

1713
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,580
We heard everything from the Professor.

1714
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,590
You can't just go by yourself!

1715
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,400
This is no time to look cool!

1716
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:04,710
You guys...

1717
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,230
It's easy for us

1718
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:07,600
to figure out where you are, Conan.

1719
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,250
Right, Ai-chan?

1720
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,330
Unbelievable.

1721
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,920
Professor, hurry to Toto Stadium!

1722
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,200
You got it.

1723
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:23,740
Hit the gas, Professor!

1724
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:25,020
There's no ti--

1725
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,080
I understand.

1726
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,900
But then, why Toto Stadium again?

1727
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,810
Isn't it under repair?

1728
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,830
That stadium was where
this whole case started

1729
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,810
and the final goal.

1730
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,440
Oh! It's Ran-san and Sonoko-san!

1731
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,450
What?

1732
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,710
I was watching the closing ceremony,

1733
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:46,300
(Today's "Miss Supporter") and look at this! Ran Nee-chan
and Sonoko-san were in the audience.

1734
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,160
So they were at the National Stadium!

1735
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,490
Well, they should be okay there.

1736
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:55,000
The more important thing
is to find the culprit.

1737
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,130
You guys watch and make sure

1738
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:05,570
that no one suspicious comes.

1739
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,440
I'm going to search for the bomb.

1740
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:08,690
-You got it!
-Okay!

1741
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:27,320
If you're waiting for Kogoro Oji-san,
he won't be coming.

1742
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,440
I'm the only one here.

1743
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:35,630
Oh, and about the security staff you knocked out.

1744
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,200
I let them all go.

1745
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,840
The police will be here soon.

1746
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,250
I figured out the trick
you used for the card in the mailbox.

1747
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:46,290
You put the card in

1748
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:48,370
on the day you blew up Toto Stadium.

1749
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,610
Before you called Kogoro Oji-san,

1750
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,360
you put the card in the mailbox

1751
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,100
so that it would stand up
at the very back.

1752
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,910
With the way the box is built,

1753
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,720
unless you looked really hard,
you wouldn't see the card.

1754
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:08,690
If other mail items get put in, the person
who opened the box would only see those.

1755
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,650
And then, on that day,

1756
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:15,630
you sent another parcel in the name
of the Spirits supporters, right?

1757
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:18,470
It was just small enough that it could fit
in the mailbox

1758
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,050
but too big to go all the way in.

1759
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,950
Then you put glue

1760
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,850
on both edges of the envelope.

1761
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,950
The one you sent by mail.

1762
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,370
Of course, the delivery person

1763
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:32,980
will make sure the parcel doesn't fall out

1764
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:36,270
by pushing it all the way
to the back of the box.

1765
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,730
Then the glue that was hanging
off the envelope

1766
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,220
stuck to the card that you stood
at the back of the box.

1767
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,150
When the parcel was pulled out,

1768
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,280
the card fell in front of the box,

1769
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,450
as if it had just been delivered.

1770
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,140
That way it would look like

1771
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:54,500
the card was put in
after the last time the box was opened.

1772
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,320
It was a perfect way to forge an alibi.

1773
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,630
But then, on the contrary,

1774
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,370
in times like these, the person
with the perfect alibi is the culprit.

1775
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,740
Isn't that right?

1776
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,960
You, who had been arrested

1777
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,660
and held in jail,

1778
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,730
had the perfect alibi.

1779
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,790
Former ace striker
of Haido High school,

1780
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:16,300
Kazumasa Nakaoka.

1781
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,120
You're a pretty smart kid.

1782
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,150
What did you say your name was?

1783
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:23,050
Conan Edogawa.

1784
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,160
Private Detective.

1785
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:29,790
No one seems to be coming.

1786
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,090
Right.

1787
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:32,460
In that case,

1788
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:35,720
we should help look for the bomb, too!

1789
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,190
Right?

1790
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:38,830
The dome is pretty big, anyway.

1791
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,250
It'll be faster, if we all search together.

1792
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,610
No can do. It's dangerous
inside the dome.

1793
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,160
Until Edogawa-kun gets back--

1794
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:48,260
Hey, wait! You guys!

1795
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,310
Get back here!

1796
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:52,290
Detective Boys, move out!

1797
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:56,140
Oh no, we'd better get them back, quick.

1798
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,640
Professor, wait here!

1799
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,850
Leave the kids to me!

1800
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,870
Keep the engine on

1801
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,950
so you can follow the culprit,
if he tries to run away!

1802
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,710
So, when did you first meet Tomofumi?

1803
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,910
How did you know about me and Tomofumi?

1804
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:18,180
I saw you on the video Motoura-san took.

1805
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:21,290
You were there,

1806
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,010
waving hello to him.

1807
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,520
You must have met him

1808
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,360
in your senior year of high school.

1809
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,930
On the ground of Haido Park.

1810
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,710
I'll bet you were training by yourself.

1811
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:34,210
How could you...

1812
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,280
The dormitory you stayed at

1813
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,890
as a Haido High student

1814
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,930
was near Haido Park.

1815
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,060
Since I heard you were from Gunma,

1816
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,800
I imagined you must have lived in a dorm.

1817
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,080
Nakaoka-san,

1818
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,320
you talked to Tomofumi
while he was watching you practice, right?

1819
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:54,740
Just like Kazu did for you, all those years ago.

1820
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,910
Hey, Kid. You like soccer?

1821
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:00,350
Yeah!

1822
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,360
Yes.

1823
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:09,620
Tomofumi and I first met in Spring of my senior year.

1824
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,980
Just as you said, it was while I was practicing at Haido Park.

1825
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:19,250
Alright!

1826
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,970
Tomofumi was born with physical ailments
and couldn't handle strenuous exercise,

1827
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:42,030
but he gradually started practicing with me.

1828
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:55,510
Our time practicing alone together

1829
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,740
lasted until that winter.

1830
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,200
During that time, I progressed
through the high school tournament,

1831
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,530
scored a goal at the National Stadium,

1832
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,180
and celebrated with him.

1833
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,800
Oh, that's right.
I've got something for you, Tomofumi.

1834
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,680
Keep it for the day you play
in a match and score a goal.

1835
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,090
Thanks!

1836
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,680
But that February, you had your motorcycle accident

1837
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,760
and your time with Tomofumi ended there.

1838
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,390
Correct.

1839
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:34,370
My six months of rehabilitation, after my surgery,

1840
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,280
didn't go well and I left for South America.

1841
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:40,010
Then, this June,

1842
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:42,830
I visited Haido Park for the first time in a while.

1843
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,420
Tomofumi!

1844
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,290
Tomofumi was in fourth grade

1845
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:51,920
and had joined a soccer club in Haido.

1846
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,330
Because of his ailments,

1847
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,500
he only cheered the team on
from the bench,

1848
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:01,930
but he had been told by the coach
that he could play a few minutes in the next match.

1849
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:06,040
I promised him that we would celebrate

1850
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:08,430
if he scored a goal in that match.

1851
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:12,330
And then, he fulfilled his promise.

1852
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:15,550
Tomofumi scored a goal in the match.

1853
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,190
When I saw that,

1854
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,150
I thought about trying to start over again.

1855
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:22,210
But then...

1856
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,920
So then, you decided to get revenge

1857
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,800
on Kogoro-san and the other fans.

1858
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,400
Yes.

1859
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,560
How did you get your hands on the bombs?

1860
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,100
Some of the people I met in South America

1861
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,600
were professionals in that area.

1862
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:55,480
You planted the bombs in nine stadiums.

1863
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,250
But the tenth wasn't at the National Stadium,

1864
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,880
it was here at Toto Stadium.

1865
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,970
The one you planted at the National Stadium
had a dummy sensor, didn't it?

1866
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:10,280
That's why it didn't respond
when Sanada hit the bar.

1867
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,840
You avoided the National Stadium

1868
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,320
because it was sacred ground for you.

1869
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:19,050
On the other hand,
you planted the bomb here

1870
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,910
at Toto stadium

1871
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,630
on the pitch where you
had wanted to play

1872
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:27,040
and set it to go off at 5:50 PM.

1873
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:32,830
Once the old man Kogoro got here,
you intended to die along with him.

1874
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,220
Just now at 5:50 PM.

1875
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:41,800
The same time as when Haido High became champions
on the snowy pitch of the National Stadium.

1876
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:47,230
That's why you didn't write 5:50 PM.

1877
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:50,450
Instead, you wrote "at the time the match has ended".

1878
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,110
Yes, that's right.

1879
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:55,000
That championship match

1880
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,830
was the end of my days as a soccer player.

1881
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:59,300
So the end of my life will be here.

1882
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,020
Nakaoka-san,

1883
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:04,810
you said that anyone
who can't be on the pitch for 90 minutes

1884
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,740
doesn't deserve
to play the game at all, right?

1885
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,680
You're wrong about that.

1886
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,220
What?

1887
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:12,520
With his weak body,

1888
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:15,690
Tomofumi could only play a short time.

1889
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,100
Did he not deserve to play?

1890
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:21,800
If you can only be on the pitch
for 15 minutes,

1891
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:24,800
shouldn't you find a way
to make the most of it?

1892
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,230
What does a kid like you know?

1893
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,760
I suppose that's true.

1894
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:33,540
But I'll bet a real J-Leaguer
would say this.

1895
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,650
You don't know the true meaning of the game.

1896
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:40,310
Even what looks like a weakness

1897
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,190
can be made into a strength
if you find the right way to use it.

1898
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:45,370
What's more, Nakaoka-san...

1899
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,400
there's something else you don't know

1900
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,440
That's...

1901
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,470
Wow! You all did great!

1902
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:00,030
(Search History. Top News.) (Searching for signal\
I wonder how it went at Shiodome Arena

1903
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:04,280
(Please charge your battery.)
Oh no, my battery's almost dead.

1904
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,430
You're lying!

1905
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:09,960
Kogoro Mouri and those fans

1906
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:11,800
were trying to rescue someone?

1907
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:13,650
That's a rotten lie!

1908
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:16,110
It's not a lie. It's the truth.

1909
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,330
Nakaoka-san...

1910
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,600
You really think you can fool me
with that stupid story?

1911
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,950
Don't! If you do that,

1912
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:24,810
You'll only make Tomofumi sad!

1913
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:28,010
I'm sorry, but there's no turning back now.

1914
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:29,960
Don't do it!

1915
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,530
Whoa, this seems serious!

1916
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,750
Let's split up and look.

1917
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,020
Oh no!

1918
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:42,010
Genta-kun! Ayumi-chan!

1919
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,240
Wait for me!

1920
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,330
This is bad.
If we don't get everyone out soon...

1921
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,160
Now there's only one way

1922
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,600
to shut off the last bomb.

1923
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,200
Take a look at the scoreboard.

1924
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:56,500
It's pointless now,

1925
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,420
but the plan was to test the striker

1926
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:02,520
with explosions occurring once a minute.

1927
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,510
When this last one goes off,

1928
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,460
the bombs set in every part
of the stadium will all blow

1929
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,740
and this will all be over.

1930
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,670
That murderous detective will die
with the other fans.

1931
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,380
The old man and the fans will die?

1932
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:18,480
Sorry kid, but you made one mistake

1933
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,620
in your deductions.

1934
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:22,790
You mean it's not here?

1935
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:26,400
That's right. The stadiums
in my warning letter

1936
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,780
don't include this one.

1937
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:29,510
At that time,

1938
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:32,260
I no longer had any bombs
here at Toto Stadium.

1939
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:35,660
So this isn't the 10th stadium.

1940
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,220
It's the 11th!

1941
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:40,290
Then, the 10th stadium is...

1942
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,130
the National Stadium!

1943
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,280
That's why you ordered them

1944
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,810
not to search for the bomb
until 35 minutes had passed.

1945
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,270
You did that so they wouldn't find
the bomb at the National Stadium?

1946
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:56,200
Yes. The trigger for the bomb
at the National Stadium is synchronized with this bag.

1947
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,150
The explosion will happen at the moment
I scored my goal. Four minutes from the final whistle.

1948
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:02,830
It's the sacred ground that I dedicated my life to.

1949
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:04,590
So I will take it with me

1950
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:06,250
as my life ends!

1951
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,700
You're certain, Mouri-kun?

1952
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,670
Yes.

1953
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:35,040
The bomber said he'd settle
the score with me, here.

1954
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,510
Very well.

1955
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:38,740
I'll check the surveillance cameras
from the security room.

1956
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:39,850
You stay here.

1957
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:40,870
Roger that.

1958
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,500
Higo-san! You're so cool!

1959
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:46,070
Higo-san! I love you!

1960
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,540
Oh, he looked this way!

1961
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:51,460
(Shinichi Kudo) (Charge your battery) (Shutting down)

1962
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,690
I wonder who that was...

1963
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:58,340
Damn it! Why would she hang up?

1964
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:02,590
Please! Ran! Answer!

1965
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,680
You have reached
an automated voicemail system.

1966
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:06,450
Why, Ran?

1967
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:07,940
You'd better get out of here, kid.

1968
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:09,560
I have no grudge against you.

1969
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:12,040
The only one who can stop the bombs

1970
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,950
is the 11th striker.

1971
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,400
But he's already lost the battle

1972
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,590
and isn't even here.

1973
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,860
In just two minutes,
I'll have my revenge.

1974
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,100
This makes up a little
for what happened to Tomofumi.

1975
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,480
Don' t kid yourself!

1976
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,670
You ran away
when your dream was threatened,

1977
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,780
and you're merely using Tomofumi's death

1978
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:30,950
as an excuse to take out your anger on others!

1979
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:31,680
What did you say?

1980
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,640
Setting limits on yourself that no one demands

1981
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:36,340
and giving up on your dreams,
you're but a coward!

1982
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,810
Listen, you child, I--

1983
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,920
You're the child!

1984
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,150
Blaming your troubles on everyone else,

1985
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:47,250
saying that everything that doesn't
fit your story is a lie to justify yourself.

1986
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:49,110
You're nothing but a selfish brat!

1987
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,950
Don't you get it?

1988
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:52,990
The thing that you're trying to destroy

1989
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:55,820
is the very game of soccer
that Tomofumi loved!

1990
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:59,870
You're going to destroy Tomofumi's memory
along with everything else!

1991
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,660
Haven't you realized that yet?

1992
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,620
He's right, Onii-chan.

1993
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:10,930
Tomo...fumi!

1994
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,980
Why do you have that wristband?

1995
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:17,750
That's the one I gave to Tomofumi.

1996
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,080
No, wait...

1997
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:20,380
It can't be!

1998
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:23,800
It's nobody's fault!

1999
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:26,270
So just let it go, Onii-chan!

2000
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:27,720
But that's...!

2001
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:31,120
Are you saying I'm wrong, Tomofumi?

2002
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,710
I... I just wanted to avenge you

2003
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:36,140
and go where we could be together.

2004
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:38,430
So why, Tomofumi?

2005
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,630
Why do even you deny me?

2006
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,990
Nakaoka-san...

2007
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,490
There's no time left.

2008
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:47,460
Tomofumi, run!

2009
01:38:58,290 --> 01:38:59,480
Damn it!

2010
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,730
Stop it!

2011
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,730
I don't care what you say.

2012
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:07,040
You think I'm just going to give up?

2013
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,650
It's not possible. Not for a child like you.

2014
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:10,690
Shut up!

2015
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:13,120
I'll stop that bomb, no matter what!

2016
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:18,790
Come on!

2017
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,270
The goal is mine!

2018
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:40,310
No...

2019
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:42,730
That's the only ball I had.

2020
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:46,030
No, even if I had others, I couldn't...

2021
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:48,230
What now?

2022
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,170
That was the third explosion, which means
I have less than two minutes left.

2023
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:53,920
What do I do?

2024
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:55,510
The debris is in the way!

2025
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:57,500
I can't aim directly for the goal post...

2026
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,020
What do I do?

2027
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,200
I have no more balls left...

2028
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,010
What do I do?

2029
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,600
Conan-kun!

2030
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,370
Don't tell me...

2031
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:07,960
Ayumi!

2032
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,460
We came to help!

2033
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,000
Hurry up and get out of here!

2034
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,170
It's going to blow!

2035
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:13,680
Conan-kun!

2036
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,820
Mitsuhiko!

2037
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:18,190
Genta!

2038
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:19,430
Conan!

2039
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,130
You guys have to run, now!

2040
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:23,970
There's no way to stop the bomb

2041
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:25,550
and I'm out of balls!

2042
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:27,130
If a ball is what you need,
I've got one!

2043
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:29,060
The ball Hide signed?

2044
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:31,140
I don't really understand
what's going on,

2045
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,300
but if this ball can stop the bombs...

2046
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,040
Let's do it, Mitsuhiko!

2047
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:37,010
Are you sure you want to use that ball?

2048
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:39,080
You better receive this pass!

2049
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,820
Okay! Ayumi-chan! It's all yours!

2050
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,810
Get this ball to Conan-kun!

2051
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,560
Here I go!

2052
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,800
One-two-three!

2053
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,500
I see it!

2054
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,120
Hey, get back here!

2055
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,010
Got it.

2056
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:58,900
Good job, Ayumi!

2057
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,650
Now pass it to Conan-kun!

2058
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:03,560
But how?

2059
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,760
He's so far away...

2060
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,230
I can't kick a ball that far!

2061
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:08,200
You just have to get it over the debris!

2062
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:10,430
Remember what we learned at the workshop!

2063
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:13,360
You kids...

2064
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:16,490
Here it comes, Conan-kun!

2065
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:27,820
Oh no!

2066
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,610
Unbelievable.

2067
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,210
Causing trouble until the very end.

2068
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:35,540
Haibara-san!

2069
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:36,700
Alright!

2070
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,190
Ai-chan, please!

2071
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:40,500
Pass that ball to Conan-kun!

2072
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:44,950
Okay.

2073
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:48,710
Kudo-kun, this ball carries everyone's feelings.

2074
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:50,490
You better receive it!

2075
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:00,210
You all are the greatest.

2076
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,520
What the hell... What is with these kids?

2077
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:07,240
At a time like this...

2078
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:10,380
do they really think they can stop these bombs?

2079
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:27,930
Hurry! There's no time!

2080
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:34,530
It's too late. There's not even a minute left.

2081
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,240
I can't aim for the goal post
with all this debris,

2082
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,280
but if I try that shot...

2083
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,070
Think back.

2084
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,170
I learned it at the soccer workshop.

2085
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,480
Endo's free kick.

2086
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,740
It can make it!

2087
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,640
You stand directly over the ball

2088
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,360
and rather than kick it,

2089
01:43:11,690 --> 01:43:13,270
you kind of scrape it off the ground.

2090
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:16,660
Take this!

2091
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,900
Come on!

2092
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,690
It... it can't be done.

2093
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,700
You can't curve it enough from that angle!

2094
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,110
What!

2095
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:31,560
Curve!

2096
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,390
Did it work?

2097
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,360
You did it, Conan-kun!

2098
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,920
Conan-kun!

2099
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,250
You're something else, kid.

2100
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:28,060
The 11th striker

2101
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,580
was you.

2102
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:32,050
Conan Edogawa.

2103
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:01,420
Who'd have thought that the bomb

2104
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:04,020
was where we were at the National Stadium.

2105
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:05,490
Yeah...

2106
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:07,570
By the way, what was the story?

2107
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:08,690
What story?

2108
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:13,620
You said something about
