1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,410
Invited by Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,010
Ran and I came to Yadori Village in Shizuoka

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,510
to help unearth the buried treasures of Tokugawa.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,210
However, that night,

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,810
the gigantic legendary monster, Nue appeared

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,110
and Mr. Yatsukatsu Someji was murdered.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,210
Furthermore, Mr. Michiki Tanzawa was also murdered in his hotel room.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,210
And...

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,610
What're you guys doing there?

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,310
Weren't you told to stay put in your rooms?

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,710
But, we were worried about the doggie.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,810
When the Nue cried a while ago,

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,710
the dog barked and we heard it scratching the wall.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,410
Now that you mentioned it, the first time the Nue cried...

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,310
The dog barked.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,810
But when that monster appeared...

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,310
It didn't bark!

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,410
So, that's what it was.

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,810
I'm beginning to see the picture.

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,810
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,510
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,010
After solving the Nue mystery,

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,110
what will Heiji tell Kazuha?

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,810
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,010
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,910
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,809
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Solved Edition)"

28
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:15,709
Heiji!

29
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,909
We brought what you asked for.

30
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,909
Three sets of sheets from an unused room,

31
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,909
a deck brush, a mop and a tool box.

32
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:29,809
A cardboard box and spray paint that was used to remodel the hotel.

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,609
We also borrowed a permanent marker

34
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,909
and sewing set from Ms. Masuko,

35
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,309
as well as glue and knife from Mr. Tsurumi.

36
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,809
Great work.

37
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,009
Thank you.

38
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:41,509
That's right and...

39
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,909
We found some old pictures in the drawer of the desk

40
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,709
of the room we moved to.

41
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,409
Isn't that a picture of the team that excavated the hidden treasure

42
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,309
16 years ago?

43
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,909
And...

44
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,509
I could be wrong

45
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:00,709
but the foreigner who's in the center of the picture...

46
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,309
Doesn't he look a bit like Mr. Tsurumi?

47
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:06,109
True.

48
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:08,409
And?

49
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,809
What are you going to do with these things?

50
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,609
What else?

51
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:16,309
We're going to lure...

52
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,909
That beast out one more time.

53
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,009
-What? -What?

54
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,009
Just what do you think you're doing, Heiji?

55
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,509
There's not even a tinge of the feeling of love.

56
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,809
You can say that again.

57
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,209
Ouch.

58
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,409
Hurry, Kudo.

59
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,909
We don't have all day, you know!

60
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:44,809
Yeah! Because this trick only works during the night.

61
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,409
Yeah. That's right.

62
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,609
Don't you have other things you've got to worry

63
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,709
about at the break of day?

64
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,909
I don't I tell you.

65
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:07,309
How dare you disturb me when I'm fast asleep.

66
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,909
It's still four in the morning.

67
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:13,909
But, Mr. Hattori told me

68
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,909
"Densuke Takekuma (58)" -to ask you all to come in front of the hotel

69
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,709
because he figured out the identity of the crane.

70
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,409
Identity of the Nue?

71
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,109
No joke?

72
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,209
Come to think of it,

73
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,709
it seems that the forensic officers and my men

74
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,809
"Fumie Masuko (46)" -were secretly doing something.

75
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,309
"Novelist" -My, without tell you about it, Inspector?

76
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,309
Yes.

77
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,809
Look at that.

78
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:33,809
It's the same.

79
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,809
"Stay out, danger!"

80
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:45,409
It's burning like back then when the monster appeared.

81
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,909
The sign board is erected too.

82
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,009
What is this weird sound?

83
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:58,009
It's this, this!

84
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,909
This is...

85
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,009
the cry of the Nue.

86
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,509
Heiji, where are you?

87
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,509
Help!

88
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,409
I'm over here.

89
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,609
Over where?

90
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,209
Over here, here.

91
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,209
I'm right here!

92
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:40,109
Heiji's grown humongous?

93
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,909
Wrong, idiot.

94
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,009
Come over here and look closely.

95
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,909
But, in front of you, Heiji...

96
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,809
Is a black monster.

97
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,009
It's no monster.

98
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,009
Look.

99
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:58,909
It's just a plain dong wearing the fur of a bear.

100
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:04,609
We found it way inside the storeroom.

101
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,909
Look. It's even got the tail of a snake on it, right?

102
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,409
Just come over here, will you?

103
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,609
You'll see what I mean if you come.

104
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,609
Go over to you, but...

105
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,309
We'll go over, but don't step on us and crush us, okay?

106
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,609
What?

107
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:28,209
No, what is this?

108
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,409
What's going on?

109
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,409
We sewed the sheets together

110
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,109
and drew windows on them using extreme perspective,

111
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,709
and suspended it from this window.

112
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,209
For the protruded parts we cut

113
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,309
and pasted pieces of cardboard onto the sheets,

114
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,709
then used spray paints to make them the same color as the wall.

115
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,109
Since that tree is in the way, you can't see the building.

116
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:52,309
If there's a fire and smoke rise,

117
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,209
even the trees behind can't bee seen.

118
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,109
Moreover, as dark as it is at night,

119
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,409
it's no wonder we were all fooled.

120
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:01,909
Officers,

121
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,709
you can go on and extinguish the fire.

122
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,109
Thanks for helping out.

123
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:13,609
The forensics and my men were helping them out

124
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:17,409
putting this trick together without telling me?

125
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,709
The finishing touch is this sign board!

126
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:28,309
The dog was trained to carry away this little sign

127
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,409
when he heard the Nue cry.

128
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,909
The real sign with giant teeth marks

129
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:37,709
was left on the ground next to Mr. Someji's body.

130
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:41,609
This way, it would look as if the giant monster,

131
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,109
after killing Mr. Someji,

132
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:46,809
left the sign behind and vanished somewhere.

133
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,309
As proof of this,

134
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:52,109
the dog barked when it heard the Nue's cry, right?

135
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,009
The dog was barking because it wanted to go to the sign,

136
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,009
but couldn't.

137
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,109
But...

138
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:00,909
As for the first and second time the Nue cried,

139
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:05,209
maybe you could rig the cell phone to do this but...

140
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,309
Even after that, when Mr. Tanzawa was poisoned to death,

141
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:09,709
it cried again.

142
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,009
Back then, everybody gave you their cell phones,

143
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,609
so that no sounds could be made, right?

144
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,909
How would you explain that cry?

145
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,609
You mean this sound, right?

146
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:23,309
If you wet the wine glass with water

147
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,109
and trace the edge of the wine glass strongly with a moist finger...

148
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,909
I saw that on TV.

149
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,509
In other words,

150
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,109
the only person who could've hung the painted cloth

151
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,009
with windows drawn on it from where she was,

152
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,409
as well as create the sound

153
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,009
is the one who was in the room on the second floor

154
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,909
that asked the village head to bring wine.

155
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:47,909
There's nobody besides you that could've done it!

156
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,275
You're the only one who could've done it,

157
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,175
Ms. Fumie Masuko.

158
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,975
Nobody else but you.

159
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,375
Being an art university graduate,

160
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,575
you'd be able to draw realistic looking windows on the cloth.

161
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,875
When we chased the monster around the back of the hotel,

162
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,975
this area was burning

163
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,775
so you could've thrown the cloth into the fire

164
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,975
to erase evidence.

165
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:28,175
Well, we did find the burnt remains of it, though.

166
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:32,375
But when did you draw the windows?

167
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,375
She drew it beforehand and...

168
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,075
Probably hid it in this room?

169
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,775
Beforehand?

170
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:43,175
Somebody used to come here sometimes to feed the dog, right?

171
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,675
I'm sure it was Ms. Masuko!

172
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:49,975
Because she had to train the dog to pull out the sign board too.

173
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:54,675
Maybe she's also the one who planted the tree to carry out her trick.

174
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:57,875
But, when the fire broke out the second time,

175
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,175
she was in her room, wasn't she?

176
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,875
How did she start the fire?

177
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,475
Metal sodium.

178
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,575
Metal sodium?

179
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,775
If you wrap it around in burnable paper or grass

180
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,575
and pour water over it,

181
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:15,275
chemical reaction will occur and make it super hot.

182
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,275
When we extinguished the first fire,

183
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,875
Ms. Masuko had a bucket.

184
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,075
If she had that in the bucket

185
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,475
she could've have pretended to put out the fire

186
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:25,675
and sprinkle it all over in front of the hotel, right?

187
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,075
But...

188
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,875
how did she bring the water?

189
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,975
You said yourself, didn't you, village head?

190
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,375
That you heard something like the sound

191
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:37,275
of a cap of a carbonated drink blow off when the fire broke out.

192
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,375
Open a hole in the cork cap.

193
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,075
Then poke a hole in the spare cartridge

194
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,575
of the ball point pen with its ink removed,

195
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,475
then wrap the cork with a paper tape, adjust the size,

196
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:48,575
fit it exactly onto the mouth of the bottle of the carbonated drink

197
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,175
and shake it super vigorously.

198
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,175
Then you can eject the water to the targeted place

199
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,875
even if it's quite a distance away.

200
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,975
Eject the water to the targeted place?

201
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,775
That's impossible...

202
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:01,775
See?

203
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:02,975
True!

204
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,375
That's amazing.

205
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,875
I could've made it too if I used the extra carbonated soda

206
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,475
and cork of the wine that you bought.

207
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:15,475
Ms. Masuko had the paper tape, ball pen and all to you see!

208
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:18,675
Besides, if you face it upwards,

209
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,275
cover the bottle with your finger, then let go.

210
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,575
See, it'll reach the window at the very top super easily.

211
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,675
The window at the very top...

212
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:30,375
So, Mr. Tanzawa who was poisoned to death...

213
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,775
Right.

214
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:35,975
Attach a two pronged poisoned dart to the cork.

215
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:38,375
Then shake the bottle while holding down

216
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,175
in between the forked part with your finger.

217
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:43,475
Then, when Mr. Tanzawa sticks his head out of the window,

218
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,775
let go of your finger to eject the needles.

219
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:45,975
Then you can poison him to death.

220
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,475
If a string is attached to the poison needles,

221
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,375
they can be retrieved immediately too.

222
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,675
In other words, this is how you committed the crime.

223
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,975
First, after you hang the cloth with the windows drawn on it,

224
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:00,575
out of your second floor room,

225
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,575
you wrote Mr. Someji a letter or something

226
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:05,175
and told him to come out to the back of the hotel and killed him.

227
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,975
Then you left claw marks on his back,

228
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:09,675
and put the sign board with the gigantic teeth marks on it

229
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:11,775
near the corpse,

230
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:15,675
switched the real sign board with a little one,

231
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:19,575
sprinkled kerosene in front of the hotel and set fire.

232
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,975
And just as everyone came out in front of the hotel,

233
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,575
you created the cry of the Nue with you cell phone,

234
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,075
called this dog that was wearing the fur of a bear out,

235
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,375
and made him hold the sign board in his mouth

236
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,775
just like you trained him.

237
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,375
Then, you made him go around

238
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,775
to the back of the hotel to go back inside.

239
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,375
This was the first case.

240
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,775
Then you pretended to put out the fire

241
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,875
while you were actually sprinkling metal sodium in front of the hotel.

242
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,175
You ejected the carbonated soda so it wouldn't wet us,

243
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,475
who were outside on guard, and set fire.

244
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,375
The second case is when you fired the poisoned needles

245
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:52,375
at Mr. Tanzawa who stuck his face out to look at the fire.

246
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,775
The first was a tiger, and the next a snake

247
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:58,175
You made it look as if he was indeed killed by the Nue.

248
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:00,575
Well, as for the knife you killed Mr. Someji with,

249
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,875
you probably disposed of in the lake or something.

250
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,275
But as for the needles that killed Mr. Tanzawa,

251
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,475
since the forensics still haven't found it,

252
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:12,075
you probably have it in the cartridge of the ball pen.

253
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:15,375
You could've made a two-pronged dart

254
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,075
by tying sewing needles to a toothpick.

255
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:20,275
You're lucky that the poisoned needles

256
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:24,175
poked right into Mr. Tanzawa's chin.

257
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,475
It wasn't luck.

258
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,675
My aim was perfect.

259
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:33,975
I tried time and time again,

260
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,875
so that I would be able to aim perfectly

261
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,775
no matter where he stuck his face out.

262
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:42,175
You're admitting you committed the crime?

263
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,475
But... Why did you kill the two?

264
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,175
Because they left him to die.

265
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:59,175
A member of the excavation team of the hidden treasures of Tokugawa,

266
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:02,375
as well as my husband,

267
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,375
Charles Abel.

268
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,775
Then, don't tell me that...

269
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,375
those two were also members of the excavation team?

270
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,175
Yes. At the time of the cave-in accident,

271
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:18,075
the ones that left my husband to die were those two.

272
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,875
My husband was still alive then, and yet...

273
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,975
But...

274
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,175
It couldn't be helped, could it?

275
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:30,975
Because he wrote the word Nue on the paper.

276
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,575
That wasn't Nue.

277
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,675
He wrote iron, right?

278
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:44,475
Charles actually wanted to write that he found a iron hairpin.

279
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,675
But being a foreigner he never saw one.

280
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,475
So, after writing "iron",

281
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:52,975
I think he wanted to show the word written on the paper

282
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:56,275
and ask the excavators what it was.

283
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:59,375
He wrote very slowly using a permanent marker,

284
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,975
so the ink smudged and bled through the back side.

285
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,775
Therefore, the other members mistakenly thought

286
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:05,775
that he wrote the word Nue.

287
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:08,175
I see.

288
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,675
You took advantage of the fact that they mistook him

289
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:13,975
and lured the two over here, right?

290
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:15,775
By writing them a letter

291
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,775
saying that Charles may have found an iron jar.

292
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,375
An iron jar?

293
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,275
Did you forget?

294
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:23,475
The light of dawn seeps through.

295
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:26,375
The light of the sunset shines on 2,000 such jars

296
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,175
filled with 1,000 gold coins.

297
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,375
This nursery rhyme. If there are 1000 coins in the jar,

298
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,975
that's some treasure.

299
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:37,975
So, lured by that the two came along.

300
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,775
Not even aware that they were going to be killed.

301
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:45,475
Yes. I was planning to let them go if they didn't show up but,

302
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:48,675
they had the nerve to come over.

303
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,175
By the way, you called the detective to make him testify

304
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,675
that the monster really existed.

305
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,475
And you also told him to bring his young girlfriend along

306
00:16:56,475 --> 00:17:01,675
so that she would see the creepy hiragana practice book and panic.

307
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,375
After she panicked and asked to have the room changed you figured that...

308
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,975
Mr. Tanzawa would want to move to the room

309
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,075
with Charles's belongings inside,

310
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:10,175
so he might find more clues on the iron jar.

311
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,575
Therefore, you assumed that he would move over

312
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,075
to the room exactly above yours,

313
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,575
making it easier to poison him to death.

314
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,575
Then, why did you invite me,

315
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:21,875
a reportage writer that has nothing to do with this?

316
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
That's probably because...

317
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,475
Ms. Masuko is...

318
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,175
your mother.

319
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,475
I think she wanted to show you

320
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:34,775
that she was avenging your father's death.

321
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,275
That dog liked you a lot probably

322
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:43,375
because you looked a lot like its owner who died.

323
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:48,675
No joke? Are you serious?

324
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:52,175
Ridiculous. No way.

325
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:55,175
I read your poor reportage

326
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,975
and called you over just in fun.

327
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:07,775
So, go on and write a good reportage this time...

328
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,875
about a stupid lady who tried to take advantage

329
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,975
of the legend of a monster,

330
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,875
and got a taste of her own medicine.

331
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:26,075
It's just like in the legend.

332
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:29,275
According to an account,

333
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:34,175
Nue is the transformed figure of Yorimasa Minamoto's mother

334
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:39,175
who wanted to give him credit for an achievement.

335
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:13,375
Aren't you Ran and Conan?

336
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,075
Yes.

337
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:20,275
This is a grave case, and yet, where is Mr. Mouri?

338
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,575
He's not here.

339
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:25,075
I mean did you just realize now?

340
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:27,275
Hey, Conan.

341
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,075
Have you seen Kazuha?

342
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:34,075
Yeah, she went along with Heiji towards Kurogane Ooike.

343
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:38,775
But, I think you should leave them alone for now.

344
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:41,175
Watch how I do things carefully, okay!

345
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:42,875
He was saying...

346
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:56,375
What is it, Heiji, calling me out to a place like this?

347
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,675
If you're planning to show me another strange monster,

348
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,475
I've already had enough of it!

349
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,575
No, stupid.

350
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:06,175
I'm only going to say this once, so listen well, okay!

351
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,675
Well, Kazuha...

352
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:35,675
The surface of the water of the lake

353
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:37,675
is shining golden in the light of the morning sun

354
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,175
and it's so pretty!

355
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,775
So this was what he was talking about!

356
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,775
What?

357
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:46,975
The light of dawn seeps through.

358
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:49,075
The light of the sunset shines on 2,000 such jars

359
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:52,575
filled with 1,000 gold coins.

360
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,075
This is a nursery song! Kurogane means iron!

361
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:57,475
In other words, this lake is an iron jar.

362
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,975
When the sunrise and sunset shine on the lake,

363
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:01,775
it glitters gold, and the ripple of the waters

364
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,775
look as if gold coins had been scattered.

365
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:06,175
That's what the song meant.

366
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,175
That's not what I came here for.

367
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:23,575
Until we went to Ebisu Bridge, I didn't realize it but...

368
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:27,275
It seems as if I...

369
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,475
You know... sort of like... you know about you...

370
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,075
All civilians evacuate to a safe place!

371
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,075
What?

372
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:38,075
We will begin strategy for capturing the Nue as of now!

373
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,875
Self Defense Force?

374
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,475
They really came!

375
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,575
Well, if they're coming it's probably the air force

376
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:55,475
from the Hamamatsu Air Force Base?

377
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,375
And? What about me?

378
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,875
Just like you said,

379
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,875
I mixed the egg and the porridge tasted delicious.

380
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,575
Just an uninteresting story.

381
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:11,775
Right? Porridges taste better if you mix them?

382
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,775
Ran!

383
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,375
What did Heiji say to you?

384
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:25,375
Heiji told me that it was more delicious if the eggs are mixed.

385
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,175
I told you!

386
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,575
Mixing the eggs in the porridge make them taste better.

387
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,875
"Novelist Fumie Masuko arrested" -You're really going for it, aren't you?

388
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,675
My future...

389
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,675
Husband.

390
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:51,375
"Ooka Momiji (17), second year of Kyoto Prefectural High School"

391
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,675
"Next Episode"

392
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:59,375
Oh my, no what shall we do?

393
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,475
Don't tell me that something bad's going to happen again.

394
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,175
The gods are telling us commoners,

395
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:08,575
that something bad is going to be happening.

396
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:11,575
There is no need for detectives to intrude.

397
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:14,775
What?

398
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,775
Next Conan,

399
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:24,375
"A Mysterious Prophetic Statue of Buddha"

400
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:27,218
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:29,318
"Badger"

402
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:31,718
-May I say something? -Go head.

403
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:33,518
The porridge spilled over.
