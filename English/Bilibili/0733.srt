1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,940
Congratulations, Masaru.

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,740
Congratulations.

3
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,940
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

4
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,840
are slashed by the light of deduction.

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,740
Gunshots fired at the bride and groom.

6
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,640
Solve the mystery of the impossible crime.

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,740
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:35,186
"The Wedding Reception and Two Gunshots"

11
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,086
The food is pretty good.

12
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:54,986
But, I wonder if it was really okay for people like us

13
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:57,586
who don't know them at all to come here?

14
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,786
It's okay, it's okay.

15
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:01,586
If I came here alone,

16
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:04,186
what table do you think I would've had to sit at?

17
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:07,386
All the ladies and gentlemen are pert...

18
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,186
Besides if I come to a place like this alone,

19
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:13,386
people who want to introduce their sons,

20
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:16,486
approach me one after the other,

21
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,186
I wouldn't be able to enjoy my meal.

22
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:24,286
The daughter of a financially wealthy family has it tough too.

23
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,886
Right. I'm sure that Yu experienced the same thing too.

24
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,386
To think that he would fall in love at first sight

25
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,686
"Masaru Hatakeyama (28), Groom" -with a woman who was working

26
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,286
"Miho Ito (26), Bride" -as a manager of the villa.

27
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:36,386
-How romantic. -How romantic.

28
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:41,886
Ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:44,586
I hate to stop you in the middle of your cheerful chatting.

30
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:49,386
I would like the guests to present their speeches now,

31
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:53,186
but before that I have an announcement to make.

32
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:58,286
Although the groom, Masaru and his bride Miho went through

33
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:02,486
a solemn marriage ceremony at the church just a while ago.

34
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:05,586
The fact is, they have already submitted their marriage certificate

35
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,586
to the city hall the day before yesterday.

36
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,386
What?

37
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:11,386
Did you know about it, mother?

38
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,686
"Yuko Hatakeyama (62), Mother of the groom" -No, I didn't know either.

39
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,986
How dare they do something like that on their own.

40
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:21,786
Ladies and gentlemen, please give them a big hand once again.

41
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,486
Geez.

42
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:29,786
There's no more wine.

43
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:30,886
"Kenshiro Hatakeyama (64)" -Hey, Alisa!

44
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:32,086
"Masaru's uncle" -You're drinking too much!

45
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,486
"Alisa Hatakeyama (25), Masaru's cousin" -Shut up.

46
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:37,086
I came here only because you insisted that I come here, Dad!

47
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:40,886
I guess she was one of the girls that wanted to be Masaru's bride too.

48
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:44,086
Excuse me, you want wine?

49
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,186
I'll go get one for you.

50
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,686
Yoshibumi.

51
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:51,086
"Tatsuya Ishihara (37)" -You're the younger brother of the bride,

52
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:53,286
"Masaru's brother-in-law" -let someone else do it.

53
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,586
"Yoshibumi Ito (25)" -No, I'm not at home at places like this.

54
00:04:56,586 --> 00:05:00,686
"Miho's younger brother" -I feel more comfortable moving around.

55
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:05,386
He should at least stay still in place at least today.

56
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,886
A manager of a villa can be nothing more than a manger after all.

57
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,186
"Rikako Ishihara (34), Masaru's older sister" -I tell you.

58
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,286
To think that a woman like her

59
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:14,686
gets to use the assets of the Hatakeyama family at will.

60
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:17,786
I'm sure dad is crying in sadness from his grave.

61
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:22,886
Then, here is a speech from the Uncle of the groom,

62
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:26,986
president of the Hatakeyama Bank, Mr. Kenshiro Hatakeyama

63
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,786
wishing the couple happiness.

64
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,586
What's the matter, Conan?

65
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:34,986
I've got to go to the restroom.

66
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,086
Sonny.

67
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,186
What's the matter?

68
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,386
Are you looking for the restroom?

69
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,386
Yes.

70
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,886
Do you know where it is?

71
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,786
I'm fine.

72
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:51,186
You came together with the girl

73
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,386
from the Suzuki Financial Group, didn't you?

74
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:58,186
Yes. You're the manager for this villa, aren't you, sir?

75
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,186
Yes.

76
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:03,386
My mother and father were managers of the villa here

77
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,786
when it was first built.

78
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:09,486
But, they both died in an accident.

79
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,786
What were they doing before that?

80
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,186
They owned a farm.

81
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:17,486
But, this area was plagued with disasters caused by monkeys and boars,

82
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:21,586
they quit the farm and became managers for the villa.

83
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,386
Weren't you going to the restroom, sonny?

84
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,786
I forgot!

85
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,786
See you.

86
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,386
Of course I can.

87
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:38,486
Hi, there.

88
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:41,586
Do you like the food?

89
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:44,986
Yes, I've eaten to my heart's content.

90
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,786
I'm glad.

91
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,786
When we return from our honeymoon,

92
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,986
why don't you three come over to our house in Tokyo.

93
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:54,886
Of course we will,

94
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,686
but don't forget to bring us back souvenirs.

95
00:06:57,886 --> 00:06:59,986
Okay, I'll remember to do that.

96
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,886
Shouldn't you be looking after the bride?

97
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:06,486
Staying by two beauties like us may get her jealous.

98
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:09,786
No, I won't.

99
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,886
Because I trust Masaru, you see.

100
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:14,186
Wow, hot, hot.

101
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:17,886
Miho, you don't look too well?

102
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:20,986
Yes. I'm a bit tired.

103
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:23,386
Then, you can leave the rest to me.

104
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:25,786
I think you'd better go back to the hotel and rest.

105
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,686
-Yoshibumi. -Yes, sir.

106
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,286
Do you drink?

107
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,686
No, I can't drink.

108
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:35,886
Then, will you drive Miho to the hotel in my car?

109
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:36,886
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:49,386
Shall we get going too?

111
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,586
I guess so.

112
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,186
Then, let's say bye to Masaru.

113
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,986
Where's Masaru?

114
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:56,486
He said he got a call from Miho

115
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:59,486
and went out about 10 minutes ago.

116
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,286
Bad news.

117
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:03,786
What's the matter?

118
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:07,086
The parking lot where the wagon is...

119
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,586
The groom is lying on the ground!

120
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:10,886
What?

121
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:11,886
No joke?

122
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:14,586
-What? -It can't be.

123
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:28,086
He's been shot at point blank range.

124
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:29,886
Masaru!

125
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,186
Hold it!

126
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,486
Don't go near him till the police arrive!

127
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:34,486
Conan.

128
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,086
Ran.

129
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:37,586
Call the police right away!

130
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:38,986
Yes!

131
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,486
Is it true that Masaru's lying on the ground?

132
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:43,586
Uncle.

133
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,186
What's that sound?

134
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,186
It seems to have come from the other side of the river.

135
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:52,686
Yes, it came from the hotel side.

136
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:53,786
Don't tell me...

137
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,486
Miho! Miho!

138
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,936
I see.

139
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,736
Then, when you heard that gunshot like sound,

140
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:46,136
those who are here now, except for Conan, were all here back then too?

141
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:48,836
Yes, sir. We got a call from,

142
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:52,536
Conan telling us to all wait here for the police to arrive.

143
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:56,036
Okay, let's go to the other site.

144
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,036
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

145
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,936
What are you doing, Officer Takagi?

146
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:24,236
I'm searching to see if I can find the belongings of the perp.

147
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,436
I've found it!

148
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:31,136
There seems to be no mistake that this is the murder weapon.

149
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:33,836
Excuse me! Will you take a picture of this?

150
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,736
Bamboo?

151
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,736
Why would something like this be here?

152
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:45,236
Tatsuya, I hate to say something like this

153
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:47,136
at a time like this but...

154
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:50,736
What's going to happen to the stocks that Masaru owns?

155
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:54,536
I'm really worried about the employees getting worried over it.

156
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:57,736
Well, he has no children,

157
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:00,336
so there's no doubt that his siblings,

158
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,136
that is, mother and I get to have it.

159
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:07,536
No. If Masaru dies before Miho,

160
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,636
all the estate that Masaru owns,

161
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:13,736
at the moment he dies should fall into Miho's hands.

162
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,236
Just what do you mean?

163
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:17,936
Didn't you hear what the MC said last night?

164
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:21,036
The two are already married.

165
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:24,536
Then, what happens to Masaru's estate?

166
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:27,936
If Miho died after Masaru,

167
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,736
then the estate would go to the one

168
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:33,236
who has the right to inherit her estate.

169
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:36,436
Oh no. That's ridiculous.

170
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,836
I won't ever approve of something like that!

171
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:43,636
Approve or not, it's the law.

172
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,736
There can't be such a ridiculous law!

173
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,936
I'm sorry to have asked you to gather here at a time like this.

174
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:57,136
Mother's extremely shocked,

175
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:59,536
we're letting her rest in her room.

176
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,136
I understand.

177
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,636
Out of all the participants last night,

178
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,836
we've sent everyone who had a definite alibi

179
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:10,336
at the estimated time of death of both victims home.

180
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:13,036
Are you suspecting us?

181
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,636
No, it's just that you all are very closely connected

182
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:19,136
to the two who have passed away.

183
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:21,136
I understand you being upset,

184
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:23,736
but, we'd like to ask for your cooperation.

185
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:30,436
Tatsuya and I were near Masaru's corpse at the time Miho was killed.

186
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:34,136
We have alibis as far as Miho's death is concerned.

187
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:38,736
Yes, the bullets that were removed from the bodies of the two,

188
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:43,636
were both fired from the gun that was found in the garden.

189
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:48,936
In other words, we think that the same perp committed both crimes.

190
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,436
Which means that we...

191
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,836
But, during that time, Rika and Alisa,

192
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:56,536
you both were back at the hotel, weren't you?

193
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:58,836
Are you saying that I'm the murderer?

194
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:01,436
Well, well, please don't get excited.

195
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:04,136
We're just talking of probabilities.

196
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,836
Since it's just been a short while since the incident,

197
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,536
we have no idea of the motive of the perp

198
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,136
who killed the bride and groom one after the other.

199
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,836
I'd like to ask you,

200
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,636
Yoshibumi, younger brother of the bride.

201
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:20,236
Yes

202
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:24,236
According to our investigations from last night up to now,

203
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,636
you seem to be in debt of a few million yen

204
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:29,836
from several money lenders.

205
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,436
Well, that's...

206
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:38,036
Please tell me if you do or not.

207
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:40,636
Yes, it's true that I do.

208
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,736
But, I didn't kill anybody.

209
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:46,136
Why should I kill my older sister?

210
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:48,836
She's the only family I have.

211
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:54,936
Officer Chiba, what are you doing?

212
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,236
Conan.

213
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,736
I was checking the surveillance camera.

214
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:02,536
Because if it's the camera set up on the inside of the entrance,

215
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:06,036
the area around the garden should be included, right?

216
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:10,136
That's why I was looking at all the recordings from last night

217
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:12,836
but no one seems to have come near the garden.

218
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:16,436
Then why was the gun found there?

219
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:20,236
Maybe it was thrown from the top window of the hotel.

220
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,636
What're these four dents?

221
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:40,636
Last night, I got a call saying

222
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,836
that the streetlight over there was out.

223
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:44,936
Did you see something back then?

224
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:47,736
Now that you mentioned it...

225
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:58,436
At about what time was that?

226
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:02,236
I think it was about...

227
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:06,136
I got the call about 9:40 pm,

228
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,836
so I think it was about 9:45 pm.

229
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:11,636
9:45 pm?

230
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:13,436
What on earth does that mean?

231
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,836
9:45 pm...

232
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,736
That's almost right after Miho left the villa.

233
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:23,736
That's 30 minutes before we found Masaru's corpse.

234
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,636
So, that's the story.

235
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:34,936
But if so, what about that...

236
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,236
Hey, sonny.

237
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,636
A child shouldn't be walking around outside so late at night.

238
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,436
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:45,536
There are a lot of hungry monkeys around here

240
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,236
so you'll get bitten, you know!

241
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:51,836
I see. If that's used...

242
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:54,836
We have no reason to kill Masaru!

243
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:57,036
I'll bet you deep down inside you were planning

244
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,736
to push Masaru out of the way

245
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,036
so that your hubby could get to the top of the Hatakeyama group.

246
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:02,936
I know about it, you see!

247
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:06,336
Don't be ridiculous, you stupid lass.

248
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:09,836
I'll bet you were vexed not being able to be Masaru's bride.

249
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,536
On top of that, when Masaru saw what you did

250
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:13,136
to Miho you also killed him, isn't that right?

251
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:14,836
I wonder who's the stupider one!

252
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:17,736
Masaru was killed first, you know.

253
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:20,736
Did greed send you out of your mind?

254
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:26,236
How unsightly, cut it out!

255
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,236
-Inspector Megure. -Yes.

256
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:31,936
We're going home...

257
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:36,136
Sonoko? Don't tell me the usual's come?

258
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:41,536
I don't want to butt into other people's business,

259
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:42,636
but if I keep my mouth shut,

260
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:45,136
the one who's going to be most delighted is the perp, right?

261
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:49,936
Sonoko, are you saying that you've figured out who the perp is?

262
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:52,236
Right.

263
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,336
If the police did their job like they should have,

264
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:58,736
I didn't have to stick my nose in, you see.

265
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:03,436
Rikako you said one thing that's right.

266
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:07,736
Miho was killed first.

267
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,936
What?

268
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:11,536
But, the only people who returned to the hotel

269
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,536
before everyone else are Rikako and Alisa.

270
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,536
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

271
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,336
Neither did I!

272
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,836
I know it's not you two.

273
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:22,336
The time the crime was committed

274
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:25,436
was right after Miho returned to the cottage.

275
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:28,636
That's why she didn't change clothes.

276
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:33,736
You probably drove Miho over by car and killed her right there, no?

277
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,136
Yoshibumi?

278
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,736
Just what're you talking about?

279
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:42,336
You have a lot of debts.

280
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,536
When your older sister got married,

281
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:47,536
you thought that you'd be able to repay your debts,

282
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:51,136
but things didn't go as you expected.

283
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,236
That's why you put something inside your sister's drink.

284
00:17:55,236 --> 00:17:59,136
You took her to the cottage after she started feeling sick

285
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,336
and killed her with the gun that you had hidden

286
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:05,936
muffling the sound with a cushion or something.

287
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:10,136
After that you called Masaru out using Miho's cell phone,

288
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:13,036
and killed him just as you did Miho.

289
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,136
Wait a minute please.

290
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,536
What about the gun that was the murder weapon?

291
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:21,836
It was found in the garden of the hotel, wasn't it?

292
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:26,636
I was with all of you and Masaru till the police arrived, wasn't I?

293
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:29,736
I didn't have time to get rid of the gun.

294
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:32,536
That's what bothered me the most.

295
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:35,936
Why did the perp dispose of the gun in a place like that?

296
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,836
But, I figured it out.

297
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:41,736
The gun wasn't disposed of there,

298
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,736
but rather, that it just fell there.

299
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:46,936
The villa and the hotel are located

300
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,936
almost completely opposite each other with the river between them.

301
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:52,336
But, after killing Masaru,

302
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:56,036
it would be humanly impossible to throw the gun to the opposite bank.

303
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,436
So that's when you used that...

304
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,336
Why would I do something like that?

305
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,936
Why not?

306
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:12,636
Didn't Rikako and the others just say a while ago?

307
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:16,036
In order to make it look as if Masaru's estate

308
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:17,736
is once inherited by Miho,

309
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:23,236
it had to look as if Miho had died after Masaru did at all costs.

310
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:24,336
In order for it to look that way,

311
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:29,236
the gun needed to be found on this side of the river no matter what.

312
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,336
That's only your imagination.

313
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,336
Do you have proof?

314
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,236
Don't you remember seeing a man holding a ladder?

315
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,936
The hotel employee man who came to fix the fluorescent light

316
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,436
in front of cottage,

317
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:46,636
saw a silhouette of a figure come bursting out of that room.

318
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:50,336
And, that was before Masaru was killed.

319
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:53,936
In other words, Miho was the one who was killed first.

320
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:58,536
Then, what about the gunshot that everyone heard at the parking lot?

321
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:02,436
That gunshot was indeed the pinnacle of the alibi

322
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,736
you established by racking your brains.

323
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,936
Please come in.

324
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,036
You remember seeing this, don't you?

325
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,436
It was found in the shed of your house.

326
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:17,136
There's no reason you don't.

327
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:19,736
What's that?

328
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,536
A Suzume Odoshi.

329
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:24,536
It keeps away sparrows that come to eat rice grains in autumn

330
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:28,136
using fireworks.

331
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:32,536
It seems that this is used to keep monkeys away in this area.

332
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,836
While I'm at it,

333
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:39,236
I might as well let you know that it was set go sound only once.

334
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:42,436
The sound that you all heard was this.

335
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:46,036
Darn.

336
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,436
Sis, is to blame.

337
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:52,436
She became a member of the family who has assets of so many billions

338
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:55,736
and yet says that she plans to give me nothing.

339
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:58,836
Have you heard of such a ruthless story?

340
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:33,936
Ran is completely had it.

341
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,936
Well, after something like that happening,

342
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:38,236
I guess it's only natural.

343
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:41,236
Ran, let's have something good to eat tonight,

344
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,636
and cheer up.

345
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:45,236
I'll make you dinner if you like.

346
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:47,936
I watched a TV program some days ago

347
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:52,236
explaining how to make great tasting curry!

348
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:56,936
No, no. Don't be silly, curry is a high calorie food.

349
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,736
After such a sad incident at the wedding,

350
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:03,536
I weighed myself when I got home

351
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:06,736
and found that I gained 2 kg. Isn't it shocking?

352
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:08,136
Two kilograms, you know!

353
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,736
That's why she was depressed?

354
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,636
Ran!

355
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:16,636
-Good morning. -Good morning.

356
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:20,436
Sonoko, you don't look too happy.

357
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:23,536
Listen to this. I got home from the wedding

358
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:26,536
and weighed myself to find that I gained 3 kg.

359
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:28,236
I gained 2 kg.

360
00:23:28,236 --> 00:23:30,636
I've got to somehow lose weight by summer.

361
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,736
Or we won't be able to wear swimsuits.

362
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:37,236
But you're going to be weighed at school before that, aren't you?

363
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:39,936
Ran, what shall we do?

364
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:43,436
Exercise. Let's run, Sonoko!

365
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:44,736
Here goes!

366
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:47,736
Well, well.

367
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:50,536
I lost weight from worry.

368
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:54,636
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

369
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:57,036
It's indeed a day for flower viewing.

370
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,436
"Super lucky"

371
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,036
Super lucky?

372
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:03,836
Bad news, Shinichi!

373
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:05,036
It's a homicide!

374
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:08,636
It seems that I've witnessed a murder!

375
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:14,336
A 5 yen coin painted black with a Sharpie...

376
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,336
Kurobei!

377
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:18,236
Next Conan Special,

378
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:21,636
"Tribute to Jodie and the Flower Viewing Trap".

379
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:39,736
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:41,436
"5 yen coins".
