1
00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.941
Eisuke Hondo, searches for his older sister

2
00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:06.041
who looks exactly like Kir of the Black Organization,

3
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.741
more commonly know as Rena Mizunashi.

4
00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.441
We find out that his father had been an informant for the CIA,

5
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.641
who seems to have been killed by Rena Mizunashi four years ago.

6
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:20.141
After Eisuke had visited the hospital

7
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:23.041
where Rena Mizunashi was lying in a coma,

8
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.441
no one had been able to get a hold of him.

9
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.441
Moreover, we find out that

10
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.641
a member of the Organization is hiding in the hospital.

11
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:33.741
There's no reason why they would leave a boy

12
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.441
who knows the boss' address,

13
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:38.941
and is trying to approach them, doing as he pleases.

14
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.341
Well, if you're worrying about what's become of NOC's kid,

15
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.341
it's no use.

16
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.141
Sizzling hot suspense.

17
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:02.941
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

18
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.741
A member of the Organization hides in the hospital.

19
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:06.841
The dangerous risk of disclosing their identity!

20
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.441
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.241
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.541
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:50.171
"Red and Black Crash: Raid"

24
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:52.671
"Haido Central Hospital"

25
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:01.471
Oh, wait, sonny!

26
00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:03.171
I finally found you!

27
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:04.471
I've been looking for you.

28
00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:05.971
Looking for me?

29
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.871
Did you recall something about the man we talked about a while ago?

30
00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:13.571
No, I just remembered something about the boy wearing glasses!

31
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.271
His name was Eisuke, wasn't it?

32
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.871
Yes, right.

33
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.171
Just as I thought!

34
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.371
He's the boy who went through surgery back then!

35
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:22.871
Huh?

36
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.871
I knew he looked familiar.

37
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.571
If I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure that

38
00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:31.471
he's the boy who underwent surgery at the hospital I worked for before.

39
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.371
Then, was that a hospital in Osaka?

40
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:36.971
Because I heard from Eisuke that right after his mother died,

41
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.071
he moved to Osaka and got into an accident.

42
00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:43.771
No. He underwent surgery at a hospital in Tokyo.

43
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:46.071
Of course not here, but at another hospital.

44
00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:48.971
His mother accompanied him then,

45
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.171
so I think it was before he moved?

46
00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:53.071
Huh, his mother?

47
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:55.671
And? What kind of surgery did he go through?

48
00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:58.571
Well, he... Eisuke...

49
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.971
had leukemia.

50
00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:04.471
Gee, but after going through such a big surgery,

51
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:06.671
if he got in an accident again,

52
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:09.971
talk about haunted with bad luck, that boy.

53
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:16.971
Good news!

54
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:18.971
The people who have been admitted to the hospital

55
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:20.271
between the 18th and 21st

56
00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:22.171
for illnesses or wounds that are not very serious

57
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:26.271
and are men, have been narrowed down to three.

58
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:28.871
The first one is Mr. Chotaro Shinki,

59
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.671
who was admitted on the 18th for a broken right leg.

60
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:34.371
Pardon the unclear image

61
00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:37.471
because I rushed to film him in secret.

62
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:39.471
The 2nd one is Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda

63
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:42.771
who was admitted on the 19th for a sprained neck.

64
00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:46.071
And the third is Mr. Chugo Nishiya

65
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:49.871
who was admitted on the 21st for acute hip pains.

66
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:51.971
All three men requested private rooms,

67
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:54.871
and no one seems to have come to visit them.

68
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:59.671
Which means that they don't know yet that Rena Mizunashi is here,

69
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.671
or that we're sheltering her.

70
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:03.871
I guess not.

71
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.871
If they already know,

72
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:09.571
they would have sent in several members

73
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:11.471
disguised as friends and visitors

74
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:13.771
to check on the number of FBI agents and our positions.

75
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.471
At any rate, inform the agents

76
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.471
who are guarding Rena Mizunashi's room about this.

77
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:21.171
Tell them to make sure they know exactly

78
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:22.771
what the three men look like.

79
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:24.071
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.971
How's she doing?

81
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.271
She's still unconscious.

82
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.671
I want you to look at something.

83
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.471
A picture?

84
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:45.671
Huh? Members of the Organization are in this hospital?

85
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:50.971
Yes, the suspicious ones are these three.

86
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:53.971
If one of these men approaches this room,

87
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.471
ward him off somehow.

88
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.471
Don't ever make the mistake of letting him inside

89
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:00.471
this room of Sleeping Beauty, okay?

90
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:05.371
"Haido Central Hospital"

91
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.971
If you push the nails of the feet strongly, like so,

92
00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.671
and apply painful stimulation.

93
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.371
If the patient is conscious,

94
00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:19.171
she should awaken or frown.

95
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.371
It seems to be that she is still in a coma.

96
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:25.571
I see.

97
00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:27.871
Well, if we perform the brainwave test

98
00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:30.371
that is scheduled three days later now,

99
00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:32.671
we can find out for sure, I think.

100
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:35.071
No, that's enough, doctor.

101
00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:36.671
I'm sorry to have called you out here.

102
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.871
I wanted to confirm her condition above all.

103
00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:43.671
I would really like to hear why you're so anxious about it but won't,

104
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:48.671
because you saved me in LA when I was attacked by a mugger,

105
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:53.471
and I believe that you would never do anything evil.

106
00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:58.171
You haven't told him about anything, I see.

107
00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:01.871
No, the only thing he knows is that we're FBI agents,

108
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:06.271
and that she is a major witness to a certain case.

109
00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:07.671
I just couldn't come out and say that

110
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:10.171
the famous announcer Rena Mizunashi

111
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:14.171
is a member of the dangerous Organization we're pursuing

112
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:17.371
and that her comrade may come in search of her to this hospital

113
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:20.271
disguised as a patient.

114
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:23.671
All the more, for his own safety in the future.

115
00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:26.371
How lucky we are that she's still asleep in a coma,

116
00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:29.271
when things could've been worse.

117
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.871
Even if they were to track down this hospital,

118
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:35.771
it would be too risky trying to take a person

119
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:37.971
who is unconscious out of here.

120
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:43.371
No, we've got to make 100% sure that they won't find her,

121
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:46.271
for the sake of the Hospital Head who offered to cooperate with us too.

122
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:50.071
Yes, even if he were to know nothing about it,

123
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:52.371
cooperating to shelter her,

124
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.471
would make him a target of the Organization.

125
00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:59.671
The problem is how do we find out which of the three men

126
00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:04.171
is the one from the Organization that's hiding here.

127
00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.271
If I were to do things my way, I would take all three of them

128
00:08:06.271 --> 00:08:10.471
to another hospital and torture them to death.

129
00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:12.371
This is Japan.

130
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:14.471
Besides, we couldn't possibly do something like that

131
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:15.971
when we've snuck in here ourselves

132
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:17.771
without informing the Japanese police force.

133
00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:22.271
Moreover, two of the three are innocent ordinary patients.

134
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:26.471
If we approach the suspects carelessly,

135
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:29.671
the Organization will surely figure out that we're FBI agents

136
00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:32.871
and there's a danger of them finding out that she is in this hospital.

137
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:34.971
Then!

138
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.771
Why don't we try using the good method that I thought up?

139
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:39.971
Huh? A good method?

140
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:41.471
I'll tell you about it

141
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:44.771
after we leave this room and go to another room.

142
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:47.971
With two foreign looking people and a man with evil looking eyes

143
00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:49.871
going out of this room at once,

144
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:51.271
because you all stand out, if someone sees you,

145
00:08:51.271 --> 00:08:54.371
rumor will spread fast!

146
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:56.671
There's no one in the corridor now.

147
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:58.271
Okay.

148
00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:00.071
Let's change rooms!

149
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:03.871
Oh, please come too.

150
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:05.571
Huh, me too?

151
00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:08.571
I want you to hear about it too.

152
00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:10.571
It'll only take a minute!

153
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:13.171
Come, quick,

154
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.771
quick.

155
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:19.371
Huh?

156
00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:21.471
I forgot something!

157
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:23.971
Wait here, I'll go get it!

158
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.171
And, did you get what you forgot?

159
00:09:35.171 --> 00:09:37.271
Oh, no.

160
00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:39.671
I seem to have made a mistake!

161
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:42.271
I'm sorry!

162
00:09:48.971 --> 00:09:52.071
Will you go back to the room after all, sir?

163
00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:53.271
Huh?

164
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.371
Because we'll be in big trouble

165
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:58.371
if that announcer suddenly gets up, you see.

166
00:10:14.423 --> 00:10:17.923
You're going to listen to what the three men have to say?

167
00:10:17.923 --> 00:10:18.923
Alone?

168
00:10:18.923 --> 00:10:21.623
Unless I'm alone, they'll figure things out right away.

169
00:10:21.623 --> 00:10:24.123
Being a child, I'm pretty sure the man

170
00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.323
that's a member of the evil Organization will be off his guard!

171
00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:29.923
It may be true, that even they wouldn't expect you

172
00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:32.123
to be as sharp as you are but,

173
00:10:32.123 --> 00:10:35.123
I wonder about whether we can all trust you alone,

174
00:10:35.123 --> 00:10:38.023
to judge which of the men are from the Organization.

175
00:10:38.023 --> 00:10:39.623
It's not going to be only me.

176
00:10:39.623 --> 00:10:42.623
I'm going to have all the FBI members think with me!

177
00:10:42.623 --> 00:10:44.223
I'm going to have you all check

178
00:10:44.223 --> 00:10:46.423
the image and sound on the video camera

179
00:10:46.423 --> 00:10:48.823
that I'll secretly set up on myself.

180
00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:51.123
I think it would be better to hear them out

181
00:10:51.123 --> 00:10:53.423
while you give me instructions, but...

182
00:10:53.423 --> 00:10:57.723
You don't want waves that will be harmful to medical devices.

183
00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.023
Hey, sonny.

184
00:10:59.023 --> 00:11:01.423
I hope you're ready for what you're jumping into.

185
00:11:01.423 --> 00:11:03.623
Doing what you're planning to do,

186
00:11:03.623 --> 00:11:06.723
the guys are going to know what you look like whether you like it or not.

187
00:11:06.723 --> 00:11:10.023
They'll see you as our dog who cooperated with us.

188
00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:13.323
If that happens, the sparks of fire

189
00:11:13.323 --> 00:11:16.023
will not only shower on you.

190
00:11:16.023 --> 00:11:19.823
I'm in the same boat as the head of the hospital we saw a while ago.

191
00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:24.123
I have trust in you FBI agents!

192
00:11:24.123 --> 00:11:26.923
I know that you'll catch the bad guys

193
00:11:26.923 --> 00:11:29.823
and never let them get away!

194
00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:36.523
Okay, are you ready?

195
00:11:36.523 --> 00:11:41.223
I set the mic and camera in the right collar of your jacket.

196
00:11:41.223 --> 00:11:43.523
If they should ever find out...

197
00:11:43.523 --> 00:11:47.423
Shout aloud and you will come and rescue me, right?

198
00:11:47.423 --> 00:11:48.623
Yes.

199
00:11:48.623 --> 00:11:52.523
Then, let's start with Mr. Chugo Nishiya.

200
00:11:58.223 --> 00:12:01.923
Hey, you're the boy staying at Mr. Mouri's place?

201
00:12:01.923 --> 00:12:04.623
Just what're you doing here?

202
00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.423
Nakamichi of the soccer club?

203
00:12:06.423 --> 00:12:08.123
Huh? Do you know them?

204
00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:09.823
No!

205
00:12:09.823 --> 00:12:11.923
I came to visit my friend and got lost,

206
00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:14.023
so I was just asking them for directions!

207
00:12:14.023 --> 00:12:17.223
What happened to your head, Nakamichi?

208
00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:19.223
Oh, this?

209
00:12:19.223 --> 00:12:22.723
I got hit on the head and passed out during club practice.

210
00:12:22.723 --> 00:12:25.223
I thought I was fine,

211
00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:27.023
but the doctor said that he wanted to give me a detailed examination

212
00:12:27.023 --> 00:12:29.523
so I'm being hospitalized for a few days.

213
00:12:29.523 --> 00:12:33.423
It's because you try to act cool and do overhead shots!

214
00:12:35.123 --> 00:12:37.623
Hey, how do you know something like that?

215
00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:41.123
Oh, well, Shinichi used to always tell me about it.

216
00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:42.823
I mean, is there anything else that could happen to you

217
00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:44.723
when you hit your head?

218
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.823
By the way, did you see Eisuke anywhere?

219
00:12:47.823 --> 00:12:50.523
He seems to have come to this hospital.

220
00:12:50.523 --> 00:12:53.823
No, I haven't seen him.

221
00:12:53.823 --> 00:12:56.623
I was admitted to the hospital four days ago.

222
00:12:56.623 --> 00:12:58.923
Eisuke Aizawa of the soccer club

223
00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:00.923
came to see me as soon as I was admitted here, though.

224
00:13:00.923 --> 00:13:02.823
I see.

225
00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:13.023
It seems he somehow finished taking images of all three men.

226
00:13:13.023 --> 00:13:14.623
Good work, Conan.

227
00:13:14.623 --> 00:13:15.823
Yep!

228
00:13:15.823 --> 00:13:18.323
Okay, let's take a look at it then.

229
00:13:18.323 --> 00:13:20.423
First, let's start with Mr. Nishiya

230
00:13:20.423 --> 00:13:22.823
who was hospitalized for acute hip pains.

231
00:13:24.923 --> 00:13:26.323
Hey, kid.

232
00:13:26.323 --> 00:13:27.823
What do you think you're doing in my room?

233
00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:30.923
Oh, I'm sorry, wrong room!

234
00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:34.623
You fell?

235
00:13:34.623 --> 00:13:37.623
Well, just watch!

236
00:13:37.623 --> 00:13:39.323
Hey, kid?

237
00:13:40.223 --> 00:13:43.923
Oh, can you pick my cell phone up for me?

238
00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:47.223
Oh, boy.

239
00:13:54.823 --> 00:13:58.723
Here! It's a little sticky but sorry!

240
00:13:58.723 --> 00:14:00.223
I've got greasy skin.

241
00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:01.723
Thank you!

242
00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:05.923
Sir, do you know how to make calls on the cell phone?

243
00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:08.223
Come to think of it,

244
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:11.923
the guy of the Organization was e-mailing the boss.

245
00:14:13.423 --> 00:14:15.923
I'm sorry, but I'm not a digital person,

246
00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:17.723
so I don't know a thing about it.

247
00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:20.623
Oh, I see, maybe...

248
00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:22.223
What're you doing?

249
00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:25.623
Maybe it's because the curtains are closed.

250
00:14:25.623 --> 00:14:27.223
That's why if I go like this,

251
00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:29.123
I can put some electric waves in here!

252
00:14:29.123 --> 00:14:33.123
Idiot, all you're doing is causing dust to fly all over the place.

253
00:14:34.923 --> 00:14:37.123
Oops, sorry!

254
00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:40.223
So, if you're done with your business, get on out of here!

255
00:14:40.223 --> 00:14:42.423
Hurry before I lose my temper.

256
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:43.823
Okay.

257
00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:46.223
Next is Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda

258
00:14:46.223 --> 00:14:49.323
who was hospitalized for a sprained neck.

259
00:14:59.823 --> 00:15:01.323
Ouch.

260
00:15:01.323 --> 00:15:05.223
What's with you dashing in like that and then falling over nothing?

261
00:15:05.223 --> 00:15:08.123
-Who're you? -I'm sorry.

262
00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:10.923
I came into the wrong room.

263
00:15:10.923 --> 00:15:13.523
I'm sorry, but will you pick that up for me?

264
00:15:13.523 --> 00:15:16.323
Give me a break.

265
00:15:16.323 --> 00:15:18.123
You mean this cell phone?

266
00:15:18.123 --> 00:15:19.723
Used the same method to get in?

267
00:15:19.723 --> 00:15:22.223
I couldn't think of any other way.

268
00:15:22.223 --> 00:15:25.123
Darn, I have a sore neck, you know!

269
00:15:26.623 --> 00:15:28.123
Here.

270
00:15:28.123 --> 00:15:31.623
Huh? What's with you snooping around here and there?

271
00:15:31.623 --> 00:15:36.623
I'm sorry! Your profile looks familiar!

272
00:15:36.623 --> 00:15:37.723
Oh, right!

273
00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:40.223
Do you know how to use the cell phone?

274
00:15:40.223 --> 00:15:42.823
I can't get through no matter how many times I try.

275
00:15:42.823 --> 00:15:44.723
Yeah, I do.

276
00:15:44.723 --> 00:15:46.423
You don't know how to use it?

277
00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:49.423
You can't use the cell phone in the hospital...

278
00:15:49.423 --> 00:15:52.123
I mean this phone doesn't even have a battery in it!

279
00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:55.323
Oh, I see. I dropped the cell phone before coming here,

280
00:15:55.323 --> 00:15:58.023
so it may have come out then.

281
00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.923
Well, you like canned coffee, don't you?

282
00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:05.023
Yeah. I already drank one today too.

283
00:16:05.023 --> 00:16:07.423
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?

284
00:16:07.423 --> 00:16:11.123
I'm sorry, I was trying to see what kind there are but my hand got stuck.

285
00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:13.523
I'll put them back right away!

286
00:16:17.223 --> 00:16:22.423
Last, there's Mr. Chotaro Shinki who broke his right leg.

287
00:16:22.423 --> 00:16:25.423
Huh? Pick that up?

288
00:16:25.423 --> 00:16:26.723
Darn, I can't see how you can ask an old man like me

289
00:16:26.723 --> 00:16:28.323
who has a broken leg to do something like that.

290
00:16:28.323 --> 00:16:31.323
Huh? This is a cell phone!

291
00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.023
Pick it up yourself then!

292
00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:34.923
Huh, why?

293
00:16:34.923 --> 00:16:38.623
I hate insects and cell phones!

294
00:16:39.423 --> 00:16:40.923
Talking of insects...

295
00:16:40.923 --> 00:16:45.523
There's something by your left collar!

296
00:16:45.523 --> 00:16:47.423
Isn't that a spider?

297
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.123
Spider?

298
00:16:49.123 --> 00:16:50.623
What?

299
00:16:50.623 --> 00:16:52.723
Where is it?

300
00:16:56.823 --> 00:16:58.523
Brat, I get it.

301
00:16:58.523 --> 00:17:01.623
You were asked to come here and check on me, right?

302
00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:04.223
He stood up.

303
00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:09.423
Tell the doctor that sent you here that my legs aren't cured yet,

304
00:17:09.423 --> 00:17:12.723
and don't plan on being X-rayed because it's bad for my body.

305
00:17:12.723 --> 00:17:15.923
Tell him that all I want is a medical certificate!

306
00:17:15.923 --> 00:17:19.523
Now that you know, get out of here right this minute!

307
00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:25.623
It looks as though all three of them are feigning it pretty well.

308
00:17:25.623 --> 00:17:30.223
Yeah. We're probably going to have to watch them for a while.

309
00:17:30.223 --> 00:17:34.523
No. All we need to do is watch one of them.

310
00:17:34.523 --> 00:17:37.523
Right, sonny?

311
00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.523
Yep!

312
00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.223
Hey, Shu.

313
00:17:45.223 --> 00:17:47.123
Are you sure that there's only one

314
00:17:47.123 --> 00:17:49.523
suspect that we need to watch?

315
00:17:49.523 --> 00:17:51.023
Yeah.

316
00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:53.523
This boy here found him for us.

317
00:17:53.523 --> 00:17:56.623
He pointed out exactly who the guy is for us.

318
00:17:56.623 --> 00:17:58.723
What do you mean he found the suspect?

319
00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:00.323
I don't mean to offend Conan but,

320
00:18:00.323 --> 00:18:01.923
he fell in front of all three of them

321
00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:03.923
and made them pick up his cell phone.

322
00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:06.323
After checking if the suspects could use the cell phone,

323
00:18:06.323 --> 00:18:08.623
he ran around the room messed it up

324
00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:11.023
and got them angry!

325
00:18:12.623 --> 00:18:15.623
Just how could you specify who the guy is with just that?

326
00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:19.123
It's true that there was only one man

327
00:18:19.123 --> 00:18:22.923
who said he knew how to use the cell phone.

328
00:18:22.923 --> 00:18:24.823
If the guy is a member of the Organization,

329
00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:27.823
wouldn't it be more probable for him to say, "I can't use the cell phone."

330
00:18:27.823 --> 00:18:31.723
Just like Mr. Nishiya who said he was not a digital person.

331
00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:34.023
No, the guy who was admitted to the hospital

332
00:18:34.023 --> 00:18:37.223
because of acute hip pains is not the one.

333
00:18:37.223 --> 00:18:42.923
A guy whose purpose is to look for Rena Mizunashi and hiding,

334
00:18:42.923 --> 00:18:46.723
can't possibly be hospitalized suffering from hip pains all this time.

335
00:18:48.123 --> 00:18:51.323
Moreover, when the boy opened and closed the curtains

336
00:18:51.323 --> 00:18:53.123
and produced dust,

337
00:18:53.123 --> 00:18:57.223
he pinched his nose and tried to hold back sneezing,

338
00:18:57.223 --> 00:18:58.523
but couldn't.

339
00:18:58.523 --> 00:19:01.323
In other words, he was afraid that

340
00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:03.423
sneezing would cause pain to run through his body,

341
00:19:03.423 --> 00:19:06.523
so he tried to sneeze by letting air out through his mouth.

342
00:19:06.523 --> 00:19:08.823
Because if he were to sneeze in the normal way,

343
00:19:08.823 --> 00:19:11.023
pain is sure to flash through his hips.

344
00:19:11.023 --> 00:19:15.123
Yes, I usually do so when I feel like sneezing in public,

345
00:19:15.123 --> 00:19:18.123
but maybe he's just trying to make it look that way.

346
00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:19.823
The only one in that room back then,

347
00:19:19.823 --> 00:19:22.223
was this boy that he didn't know at all.

348
00:19:22.223 --> 00:19:25.623
He had no reason to hold back on sneezing.

349
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:29.023
If he suspected the boy, he would've chased him out of the room

350
00:19:29.023 --> 00:19:33.723
before picking up the cell phone and putting his fingerprints on it.

351
00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:36.123
I see, so the member of the Organization

352
00:19:36.123 --> 00:19:37.523
is pretending to be hurt, in order to stay hospitalized

353
00:19:37.523 --> 00:19:39.523
for an extended period of time.

354
00:19:39.523 --> 00:19:41.723
Yes, I don't know what his condition was upon hospitalization,

355
00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:45.123
but I'm sure he's fully recovered by now.

356
00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:47.323
Come to think of it, Mr. Shinki,

357
00:19:47.323 --> 00:19:50.023
he stood up on his injured right leg.

358
00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:54.223
Yeah. The leg of that old man is already cured.

359
00:19:54.223 --> 00:19:56.923
Mr. Kusuda who is being hospitalized for a sprained neck

360
00:19:56.923 --> 00:19:59.123
is also cured already, isn't he?

361
00:19:59.123 --> 00:20:02.223
In order to look for Conan who kept disappearing from his sight,

362
00:20:02.223 --> 00:20:03.723
he had to look all over the room.

363
00:20:03.723 --> 00:20:05.023
But he did so with ease.

364
00:20:05.023 --> 00:20:07.223
If his neck isn't cured yet,

365
00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:10.423
he'd have to move his entire body around to do what he did.

366
00:20:10.423 --> 00:20:14.023
He also drank up his canned coffee.

367
00:20:14.023 --> 00:20:16.523
Canned coffee?

368
00:20:16.523 --> 00:20:19.523
Well, when drinking out of a can,

369
00:20:19.523 --> 00:20:21.123
you have to lurch your neck backwards and look up

370
00:20:21.123 --> 00:20:22.623
or you can't drink all of what's inside, right?

371
00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:24.823
But, when I knocked the cans of coffee

372
00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.423
that he drank out of on the floor,

373
00:20:26.423 --> 00:20:29.023
nothing spilled out!

374
00:20:29.023 --> 00:20:30.523
They were all empty!

375
00:20:30.523 --> 00:20:34.023
That means he drank it all, right?

376
00:20:34.023 --> 00:20:38.023
He said that he also drank some just a while ago,

377
00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:40.223
so it's not that the contents dried out, right?

378
00:20:40.223 --> 00:20:42.723
Which means that two of them are pretending to be hurt.

379
00:20:42.723 --> 00:20:45.323
Then what's the other man who seems to have nothing to do

380
00:20:45.323 --> 00:20:47.823
with the Organization after?

381
00:20:47.823 --> 00:20:51.923
He's probably after "Hospitalization Insurance", that old man.

382
00:20:51.923 --> 00:20:53.123
What?

383
00:20:53.123 --> 00:20:57.823
There is an insurance bonus for being hospitalized more than 20 days.

384
00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.623
That's why he's refusing to get an X-Ray

385
00:20:59.623 --> 00:21:02.923
and wants to hide the fact that he is already recovered.

386
00:21:02.923 --> 00:21:07.723
In other words, his purpose is insurance money.

387
00:21:07.723 --> 00:21:11.523
But, he could just be making it look that way on purpose, right?

388
00:21:11.523 --> 00:21:17.023
Right, that old man did think that the doctor sent Conan to him.

389
00:21:17.023 --> 00:21:19.123
And if the fact that he's recovered comes to light,

390
00:21:19.123 --> 00:21:20.423
he's probably going to make it look like

391
00:21:20.423 --> 00:21:22.323
he was after the insurance money.

392
00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.223
Right, and that old man

393
00:21:25.223 --> 00:21:28.123
was the only one who didn't even bother to touch the cell phone.

394
00:21:28.123 --> 00:21:31.823
I hate insects and cell phones!

395
00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:32.923
Isn't he suspicious?

396
00:21:32.923 --> 00:21:35.523
It's only natural that he couldn't touch it.

397
00:21:35.523 --> 00:21:40.423
He was wearing a pace maker, the thing to help his heart work!

398
00:21:40.423 --> 00:21:43.523
Going near a cell phone that emits waves

399
00:21:43.523 --> 00:21:45.623
can be life threatening to him.

400
00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:48.223
Well, I didn't have any battery in that cell phone

401
00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.723
to begin with, though.

402
00:21:49.723 --> 00:21:54.023
But, how did you know that the old man had a pace maker on him?

403
00:21:54.023 --> 00:21:57.523
Remember, below the left collar bone of that old man,

404
00:21:57.523 --> 00:22:00.623
there was a protruded area with a trace of a wound, right?

405
00:22:00.623 --> 00:22:02.523
That's the trace of the wound that he had surgery for

406
00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:04.123
when implanting the pace maker!

407
00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:07.123
Then, you lied telling him that there was an insect by his collar,

408
00:22:07.123 --> 00:22:09.523
not to make him stand up but...

409
00:22:09.523 --> 00:22:12.623
to confirm whether he had a pace maker on him!

410
00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:14.023
Yep.

411
00:22:15.423 --> 00:22:16.623
I see.

412
00:22:16.623 --> 00:22:18.523
So that old man who wouldn't be able

413
00:22:18.523 --> 00:22:21.023
to e-mail the boss of the Organization

414
00:22:21.023 --> 00:22:23.823
with his cell phone is marked off.

415
00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:26.723
Yes. The only one left is probably

416
00:22:26.723 --> 00:22:28.823
the man with the sprained neck

417
00:22:28.823 --> 00:22:32.023
who's pretending to have faint spells and nausea from the wound

418
00:22:32.023 --> 00:22:35.523
and is extending his duration of hospitalization,

419
00:22:35.523 --> 00:22:37.823
Rikumichi Kusuda.

420
00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.523
There's only him.

421
00:24:10.923 --> 00:24:12.423
We finally found out about

422
00:24:12.423 --> 00:24:14.723
the members of the Black Organization.

423
00:24:14.723 --> 00:24:18.623
We set a trap and grabbed their tails.

424
00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:23.023
However, Gin found out about it.

425
00:24:23.023 --> 00:24:27.123
Will Rena Mizunashi be taken away by them again?

426
00:24:28.323 --> 00:24:32.823
The unexpected past of the Organization and Akai is revealed.

427
00:24:34.323 --> 00:24:36.623
Next on Detective Conan,

428
00:24:36.623 --> 00:24:40.223
"Red and Black Crash: Awakening"

429
00:24:55.923 --> 00:24:58.023
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:58.023 --> 00:25:00.323
Akemi Miyano.

431
00:25:00.323 --> 00:25:02.823
You people, go on and disclose the identity of the Organization!

432
00:25:02.823 --> 00:25:05.323
Oh, right-on, right-on.
