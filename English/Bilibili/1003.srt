1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,500
Whoops.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,310
It's this one.

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,460
All right! I'm out first again.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,990
The old man's always been good at Old Maid.

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,130
You suck at this game, kid.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,800
Impressive as always, Mori-sensei.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,430
You know what people are thinking.
You have the eyes of a detective.

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,310
I'm just good at this kind of thing.

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,300
I have a sense for picking out losers.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,350
You always lose when you
bet on horses, though.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,670
If only you could pick out the winners.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,110
No, no, no.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,050
If you've got the ability to pick out losers,

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,110
I wish you'd share it with me.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,370
You'd be able to identify
traitors who will betray you.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,080
Like middlemen trying to sell you fish that
have lost their freshness at a high price.

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,130
Of course. Wise words from a sushi chef.

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,590
Right?

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,950
Nice one, Irohazushi.

20
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,350
Why are the four of us going
on a trip together, again?

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,400
Before we left...

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,280
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,580
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,600
A trip for detectives with a shocking lineup

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,280
takes us to an abandoned church
in the middle of a blizzard.

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,190
Always determining the one truth

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,040
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,640
his name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,420
The 36-Cell Perfect Game (Part One)

30
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,000
The 36-Cell Perfect Game (Part One)
"The 36-Cell Perfect Game, Part One!"

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,970
The 36-Cell Perfect Game (Part One)

32
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,010
Mori Detective Agency

33
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,700
Mori Detective Agency
3 Hours Earlier...

34
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,970
Mori Detective Agency
3 Hours Earlier...
What?

35
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,390
You can't come to Nagano anymore?

36
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,240
Seriously? But I just
finished all my urgent work.

37
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,940
All we have left to do is head to
Shinjuku Station with our suitcases.

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,570
Sorry. Sonoko was supposed to come
with us, but she has a fever.

39
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,830
It's probably just a cold,
but I need to go check on her.

40
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,470
And besides, I can't leave
Sonoko to go on a trip.

41
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,510
Aren't you going to Nagano for a job, anyway?

42
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,270
Yeah.

43
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,970
So I invited more appropriate
traveling companions for you.

44
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,630
Appropriate?

45
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,380
That's right. They're both
people you know very well.

46
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,140
Café Poirot waiter and Mori-sensei's
number one student Amuro Toru here.

47
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,400
It's you, huh?

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,310
Does the Public Security Bureau
not have anything better to do?

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,530
Poirot's owner is visiting the
hot springs with a friend.

50
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,500
The café will be closed this
afternoon and all day tomorrow,

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,730
so I can accompany you on your
two-day one-night detective trip.

52
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,330
Does that mean Azusa-san can go, too?

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,300
No.

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,330
I invited her, but she already
has plans for tomorrow.

55
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,890
That's not good.

56
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,240
The client asked that I bring four people.

57
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,210
Perhaps they're serving a fixed
number of plates for meals?

58
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,600
In any case, we need to find
another traveling companion.

59
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,850
Someone who enjoys mysteries
would be best, right?

60
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,860
I don't want to invite Sera
for all kinds of reasons.

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,340
Did you call me?

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,170
Wakita-san from Irohazushi.

63
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,020
Ah, the place next door.

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,790
I brought some sushi over so I could have
Master Kogoro tell me about his cases.

65
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,420
If you're looking for a traveling companion
for an interesting trip, then look no further.

66
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,860
Wh-Wh-What about your job?

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,050
We're going to Nagano for
two days and one night.

68
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,140
I'll just tell the boss that I'm taking today

69
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:33,310
and tomorrow off because
my stomach's acting up.

70
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,620
This guy does whatever he wants, too.

71
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,810
Anyway...

72
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,440
I look forward to traveling you,
Master Kogoro's number one student.

73
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,450
Yes. Likewise.

74
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,830
And that's how we ended up like this.

75
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,340
This sushi is good.

76
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,330
It certainly is.

77
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,960
Sounds like packing the sushi I had
in the bowl was the right choice.

78
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,610
Your eye still hasn't healed?

79
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,370
It was getting better, but it was real itchy.

80
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,040
Scratching it made it even worse than before.

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,370
Wanna see?

82
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,100
Oh, no. I'll pass.

83
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,600
Well? Are you going to tell us about the job?

84
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,740
Ah, right. I hadn't told you yet.

85
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,240
This odd scrap of paper was included
with a letter I received a month ago.

86
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,300
Wh-What's this?

87
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,620
Looks like a code.

88
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,870
The sender's name is Nichihara Taisei.

89
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,300
Apparently his old friend killed himself

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,930
in an abandoned church deep
in the mountains of Nagano,

91
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,380
but he has no idea why.

92
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,850
He thought maybe he'd be able
to figure why he killed himself

93
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,890
if I solved this code that
was left at the body's feet.

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,400
So he hired the Sleeping
Kogoro to decipher this code.

95
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,610
But depending on the contents of this code...

96
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,660
It's possible that we'll discover
that it was actually a murder.

97
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,900
Yeah.

98
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,840
The client said that was a possibility.

99
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,450
Apparently the location has been mostly left
the way it was when he committed suicide.

100
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,180
Mister, you still haven't met the
person who sent you the letter, right?

101
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,120
Nope.

102
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,920
We just exchanged letters
and emails a few times.

103
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,330
They sent me train tickets
and 500 thousand yen, though.

104
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,060
We're supposed to meet him at
the abandoned church after this.

105
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,250
I'm sure you'll receive a warm welcome.

106
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,560
After all, the Sleeping Kogoro
is coming to help him.

107
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,150
Yeah, you're right.

108
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,330
There's no one here to meet us.

109
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,460
Maybe he's not here yet.

110
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,960
Looks like it's not locked.

111
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,150
Parking Lot

112
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,210
Parking Lot
Well, it is an abandoned church.

113
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,870
Parking Lot
Let's wait inside.

114
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,220
Parking Lot

115
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,480
It seems as though quite some time
has passed since it was abandoned.

116
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,000
Ow!

117
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,810
Seems like the kind of place you'd
find evil spirits lurking about.

118
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,070
Please don't. I'm not good
with that kind of stuff.

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,580
It's a good thing Ran didn't come.

120
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,590
Ah, it's a chapel.

121
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,460
It's rather spacious.

122
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,340
Huh?

123
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,420
Are you guys here for Nicchi's
farewell party, too?

124
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,330
Are you guys here for Nicchi's
farewell party, too?
Fujide Raito (27)
High School Teacher

125
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:53,590
Fujide Raito (27)
High School Teacher

126
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,170
Nicchi?

127
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,750
Farewell party?

128
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,470
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,350
Seriously? There's no
way you guys don't know.

130
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,100
Nicchi. He killed himself
here two months ago.

131
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,390
Wada Kohei (28)
Office Worker

132
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,200
Wada Kohei (28)
Office Worker
Are you guys saying you came to this
abandoned church deep in the mountains

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,730
Wada Kohei (28)
Office Worker
during a blizzard without knowing about that?

134
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,460
during a blizzard without knowing about that?

135
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,560
You sure about that?

136
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
Koura Ikue (27)
Office Worker

137
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,570
Koura Ikue (27)
Office Worker
Apparently this place is fairly
famous around here as a power spot.

138
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,030
Apparently this place is fairly
famous around here as a power spot.

139
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,700
That was back when we were
in high school, though.

140
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,460
That's enough chit-chat.
Let's get this over with.

141
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:25,800
Kawasaki Yosuke (28)
Bank Employee

142
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,080
Kawasaki Yosuke (28)
Bank Employee
I made time in my busy schedule to be here.

143
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,200
I made time in my busy schedule to be here.

144
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,200
I couldn't agree more.

145
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,090
Apparently the heat here is broken.

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,280
Nishino Sumiya (27)
Bartender

147
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,720
Nishino Sumiya (27)
Bartender
Let's get this over with
and share some hotpot.

148
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,980
Let's get this over with
and share some hotpot.

149
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,100
We haven't seen each other in a while.

150
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,440
You all know each other?

151
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes.

152
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,740
We were high school classmates.

153
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,110
So, what are we supposed to do next, Fujide?

154
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,860
Huh?

155
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
Aren't you the one who sent that
text telling us to meet here?

156
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,420
No, no, no. I got a text from Wada.

157
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,550
What? I didn't send any text.

158
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,210
Ikue, aren't you the one who
invited us here by text?

159
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,220
What are you talking about?

160
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,130
Aren't we all here because
we saw Kawasaki-kun's text?

161
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,950
I just followed the instructions
in Nishino-kun's text.

162
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,050
I told you, I'm here because
I got a text from Fujide.

163
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,180
Hold on. You all named each other.

164
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:30,440
I see. Is one of you lying and
plotting to surprise the others?

165
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,750
Well, who invited you?

166
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,150
We received a letter from
someone named Nichihara Taisei.

167
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,360
You're joking, right?

168
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
That's not possible.

169
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,380
After all, Nichihara Taisei...

170
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,580
Is the guy we mentioned earlier, Nicchi.

171
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,530
The very man who killed
himself here two months ago.

172
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,090
Wh-What?

173
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,350
Someone gathered all of us here
while concealing their identity.

174
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,380
What was that sound?

175
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,720
Sounds like something collapsing.

176
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,850
It's not the parking lot, is it?

177
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,980
Let's go check it out.

178
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,370
Yeesh!

179
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,690
The deck collapsed, and all the cars
have fallen to the bottom of the ravine.

180
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,070
Maybe one of the supports was rotten.

181
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,160
This church is pretty old.

182
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,590
But I just bought my car. It was new.

183
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,220
Who turns such a dangerous
spot into a parking lot?

184
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,800
We'll have to call the
police or fire department.

185
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,510
That's odd.

186
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:39,970
Parking Lot

187
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,470
Parking Lot
The church building is rather
old, but this sign is brand new.

188
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,760
Parking Lot

189
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,460
Did someone lead everyone to park their
cars there and deliberately trash them?

190
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,700
If that's true, then this
is rather thrilling.

191
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,650
What do you mean?

192
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,160
This situation is the most
cliché of all mystery clichés.

193
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,550
There's likely to be serial murders.

194
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,590
After all, we're trapped in the
mountains during a snowstorm.

195
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,290
Parking Lot

196
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,090
Parking Lot
Seriously?

197
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,220
What do you mean the Nagano
police can't come right away?

198
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,020
Remember the tunnel you passed
through on your way there?

199
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,020
There was an avalanche earlier that
completely blocked that tunnel.

200
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,100
No one can get through.

201
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,410
Seriously?

202
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,060
We'll be able to head there tomorrow,
depending on the weather.

203
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,110
Tomorrow? Can't you remove the
snow now and come right away?

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,070
The weather report has been saying for the past
three or four days that we'd be getting heavy snow.

205
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,120
How many people are with you?

206
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,520
Including me, nine.

207
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,750
What are all of you doing up there?

208
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,900
In any case, we'll head
there as soon as we can.

209
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,700
Please wait inside the
church until we arrive.

210
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,510
What is it, Komei?

211
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,270
I thought I caught a whiff
of gunpowder just now.

212
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,160
Gunpowder? Like a bomb?

213
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes.

214
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,020
If this avalanche was caused by a human,

215
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,190
then I'm worried about the nine of them.

216
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,540
Anyway, they can't come
get us until tomorrow.

217
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,810
Since your cars have been ruined,

218
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,160
we'll have to spend
the night at this church.

219
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,290
How did you guys get here?

220
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,800
By taxi.

221
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,550
We took a taxi to the entrance of the
woods and walked the rest of the way here.

222
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,240
Will you introduce yourselves already?

223
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,550
Who posed as everyone else
and invited us all here?

224
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,560
I-It wasn't me.

225
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,290
It wasn't me either.

226
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,810
Naturally, it wasn't me either.

227
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,070
It wasn't me either, but it's probably not
easy for them to identify themselves now.

228
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,190
Well?

229
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,570
We came here to uncover the truth
behind Nichihara-san's suicide.

230
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,330
Does anybody know which room he died in?

231
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,570
Who knows? I heard about it from a text.

232
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,780
Me, too.

233
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,930
Me, too.

234
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,600
Naturally, so did I.

235
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,340
The person who knows that is probably
the same person who invited us all here.

236
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,090
Maybe we have to solve it after all.

237
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,080
You know, the code included with
the letter you received, mister.

238
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,020
Oh, this thing?

239
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,840
I received some kind of
code-looking thing by text, too.

240
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,020
Look.

241
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,850
This creepy chart full of letters?

242
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,030
I got one of those, too.

243
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,310
I texted them back to ask what it was.

244
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,530
But they said it was a
secret for when we met up.

245
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,910
There are differences in orientation and
whether the letters are written in hiragana or katakana,

246
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,410
but all six seem to have the
same sequences of letters.

247
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,800
The only hint we have to deciphering the code

248
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,760
is this 3x3 block that's been
outlined with a thick line.

249
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,010
More importantly, why don't we
come up with a way to stay warm?

250
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,520
It certainly is cold.

251
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,550
Let's put flammable stuff in the metal drum

252
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,860
that was in the entryway and
warm ourselves using that.

253
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,570
Yeah. This chapel is fairly spacious.

254
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,530
It's drafty, too, so I doubt we
have to worry about lack of oxygen.

255
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:39,040
Then let's share the water and food we have
and make it through this night together.

256
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,460
I brought plenty of snacks.

257
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,290
Let me know if you want any.

258
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,960
I brought plenty of water.

259
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,590
Let me know if you want
something cool and refreshing.

260
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,970
I brought a dozen cases of mints.

261
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,920
I see you still love those, Ikue.

262
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,340
What's wrong with that?

263
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:03,210
I'll pass. I have my own water, and I'll
be fine not eating anything for one night.

264
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,210
And you're the same clean-freak
you've ever been.

265
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,170
Well, I guess I'll go gather
up flammable materials.

266
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,780
I'll join you.

267
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,490
Then I'll prepare the drum.

268
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,410
Perhaps I'll go to the bathroom.

269
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,250
I'll go with you.

270
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,900
But if there's no power, doesn't
that mean there's no water?

271
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,180
The church was abandoned,
but the graveyard is still here.

272
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,430
There should still be water
available for visitors.

273
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,680
If this cold hasn't frozen
the pipes, that is.

274
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,680
Ah, good.

275
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,680
The water's still running.

276
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,170
Hey.

277
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,800
I noticed that you knew
where to find the bathroom.

278
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
Are you familiar with this church?

279
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,910
I'm not the only one.
All of us know this place well.

280
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,690
We often played here as children.

281
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,200
At this church?

282
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,100
Yeah.

283
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,330
Next to the church was the perfect field.

284
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,430
Perfect for what?

285
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,300
Wada texted me.

286
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,770
No subject
We found a strange piece of paper!
Come to the chapel immediately!

287
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,470
No subject
We found a strange piece of paper!
Come to the chapel immediately!
"Come immediately?"

288
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,800
No subject
We found a strange piece of paper!
Come to the chapel immediately!

289
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,380
"If you wish to pay your respects to
me, head to the locations shown below."

290
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,080
"Each person must collect the
condolence message there."

291
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,470
What is this?

292
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,770
Ikue said she was cold, so
we closed the chapel door.

293
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,170
That's when we found this stuck
to the door, along with this code.

294
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,160
Someone's pretending to be Nichihara-kun.

295
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,160
It's creepy, isn't it?

296
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,540
Maybe we should treat it like a game.

297
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,170
It's possible that the person who gathered
us here wants us to entertain us with a game.

298
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,190
Fine, then. I guess we'll play along.

299
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,840
We've got nothing else
to do until help arrives.

300
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,500
Then we'll have to decide who's going where.

301
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,220
Why don't we use these?

302
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,970
They're playing cards.

303
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,230
How about whoever draws the highest number
gets to choose where they want to go first?

304
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,930
If two people draw the same number,

305
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,160
they can choose in the order of
spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs.

306
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,460
Sounds good to me.

307
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,530
Hold on.

308
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,400
There's an odd stain on the top card.

309
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
What if you already know what
it is without turning it over?

310
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,370
I-I haven't done anything like that.

311
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,800
Who cares? It's just a game, right?

312
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,060
It may be a game, but I want to do it right.

313
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,880
Then how about using an
Amidakuji? I've got paper.

314
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,350
That won't work. You can cheat
using the number of lines.

315
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,000
Then how about rock-paper-scissors?

316
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,810
This is just like that time you guys
had to decide who'd be the captain.

317
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,270
You're right.

318
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,380
Then let's do what we did back then.

319
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,900
Kawasaki, you've got a box of tissues, right?

320
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Yeah. I've got one I just finished using.

321
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,590
Ikue, could you tear a paper
into nine even pieces?

322
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,610
Okay.

323
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,170
There. Nine even pieces.

324
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,300
Now we just have to tear it along the folds.

325
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,600
This brings back memories.

326
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,180
Reminds me of back then.

327
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,150
Here's your nine even pieces of paper.

328
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,020
Thanks.

329
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,940
Everyone write their name
down on their piece of paper.

330
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Then we'll put them in this tissue box, and
since I became captain then, I'll draw them.

331
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,940
Everyone good with that?

332

Next, who's going to the toilet?

334
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:41,890
Next, who's going to the toilet?

335
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,960
Let's see...

336
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,700
It's Wada.

337
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,330
Got it.

338
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,460
That's means as the last person,
I'm going to the lounge.

339
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,260
Just to confirm, Ikue is going to the study.

340
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,020
Kawasaki is going to the priest's room.

341
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,710
Fujide is going to the nun's room.

342
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,920
The guy with the mustache
is going to the bath.

343
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,970
The kid with the glasses
is searching this chapel.

344
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,540
The man with the eyepatch
is going to the kitchen.

345
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,170
The blond guy is going to the storage room.

346
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,970
Sound good?

347
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,300
Then let's go find these condolence messages.

348
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,780
So far, this game isn't any fun.

349
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,830
Please be careful, everyone.

350
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,090
We still don't know the true intentions
of the person who gathered us here.

351
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,220
Surely you're not suggesting that someone's
trying to get revenge for Nicchi's suicide.

352
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,380
In that case, their first victim
would probably be Nicchi's wife—

353
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,670
That's not something we should
discuss with outsiders.

354
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,920
You're right.

355
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,500
In any case, let's get this over with.

356
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,430
Right.

357
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,640
If there's a wife among them,
it would probably be Ikue-san.

358
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,850
But they mentioned a captain.
Captain of what?

359
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,440
Hey, kid.

360
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,390
Have you found your condolence message?

361
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,070
Yeah.

362
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,570
This paper was stuck to the
bottom of a pew in the chapel.

363
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,620
I found mine inside a vase in the lounge.

364
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,140
Mine was under the bed in the priest's room.

365
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,210
I found mine on a shelf in the nun's room.

366
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,210
He came immediately to help me find mine.

367
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,700
These codes seem to have the
same sequence of letters, too.

368
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,530
That just leaves Wada-san
who went to the toilet.

369
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,220
Maybe he's using it while he's there.

370
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,860
Seriously? It's been an hour since then.

371
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,710
He's taking way too long.

372
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,110
I'll go check on him.

373
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,610
Shouldn't we all go together?

374
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,620
Yes.

375
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,950
I've got a bad feeling about this.

376
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,270
Well?

377
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,880
What club were you guys in?

378
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,600
Huh?

379
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,010
If you had to choose a captain, you
must've been part of a club, right?

380
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,260
Well, uh...

381
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,830
If you don't want to tell us, that's fine.

382
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,660
Here we are.

383
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,310
Hey, you.

384
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,850
How long are you going to—

385
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,270
Hey!

386
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,090
What the hell is going on here?!
