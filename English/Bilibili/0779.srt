"Haido Central Hospital"

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,740
But poisoning someone who comes to visit you in the hospital.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,740
To be honest, maybe this hospital is cursed.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,640
There was rumor going round that an announcer named Rena Mizunashi

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,140
was hospitalized here.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,240
Then wounded people avalanched in causing chaos.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,040
I also heard that there was a bombing commotion here too.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,040
Officer Takagi!

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,140
Don't you have to return to MPD already?

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh, no!

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,940
Then, you don't know of a man called Rikumichi Kusuda, do you?

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,940
Rikumichi Kusuda?

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,940
Now that you mentioned it,

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,540
a few days before the bombing incident that I just mentioned,

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,440
a damaged vehicle was found near here,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,140
and the owner of that vehicle was a man called Rikumichi Kusuda!

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,540
It was a case full of mysteries.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,540
Inside that damaged vehicle a great amount of splattered blood

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,440
was found all over the vehicle.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,940
Some of the blood stains were less than a millimeter across.

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,940
-According to forensics... -Blood stains less than a millimeter across

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,940
from high speed shooting.

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,240
A pistol?

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,040
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,240
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,940
A strange case occurs at Haido Park.

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,840
A bright red secret starts to spill.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,740

00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:24,615
Hello.

33
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:27,015
Oh, Jodie! What's up?

34
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:30,015
Oh, was it today that we were supposed to go drinking?

35
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:34,115
Have you already gotten used to being an elementary school teacher?

36
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,915
Yes. I'm really popular being their beautiful teacher

37
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,615
who returned from abroad.

38
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,815
"Natsuko Shibuya (28)" -Is what I'd like to say.

39
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:43,415
But it's really a hard work.

40
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:49,315
I'm supposed to meet some parents today after this too.

41
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:50,715
I see.

42
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:53,415
I guess we can't go out drinking tonight then.

43
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,615
No. I'm sorry.

44
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:58,915
By the way, why are you still in Japan?

45
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,915
Your undercover investigation is over, right?

46
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:04,315
Hey, you're the one who invited me out for drinks.

47
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:07,715
I've got my reasons too.

48
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,915
Secrets on the job, right?

49
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,415
Right.

50
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:13,715
I'll call you again then.

51
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:15,115
Your friend?

52
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:18,215
Yes. When she was studying abroad in the US,

53
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,915
she got involved in a case.

54
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,315
I saved her back then.

55
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,115
And that's how I got to know her.

56
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:27,415
I see.

57
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:30,415
She also taught me Japanese

58
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:36,915
and helped me go undercover as an English teacher.

59
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:40,015
I guess you could say she's my best teacher friend.

60
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,615
I see.

61
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,415
And? Who are you waiting for here?

62
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:57,215
Natsuko Shibuya, age 28.

63
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,815
An elementary school teacher.

64
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,215
Who's that?

65
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,015
My client

66
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:08,215
as well as the one who can lead me to the last piece I'm looking for.

67
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:12,015
A woman who could probably help me complete the puzzle.

68
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:15,215
So, what is this piece that you're referring to?

69
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:21,715
That sound just now sounded like someone fell down the stairs.

70
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:48,815
Hey, come on. Let's go!

71
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,915
I don't want to attract attention is a place like this.

72
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,415
She's...

73
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:54,815
Yes.

74
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,315
I guess the puzzle'll be completed soon.

75

"The Scarlet Prologue"

76
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:14,315
"Teitan Elementary School"

77
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:15,715
Hey, Conan!

78
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:19,215
Let's play soccer on the way home.

79
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,215
What?

80
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:21,815
He's gone!

81
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:26,115
He rushed out as soon as the bell rang.

82
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:27,815
Over there.

83
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,915
I wonder if someone came to pick him up by car?

84
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:35,515
I'm sure it's Pops from the detective agency!

85
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:36,715
No, it's not.

86
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:39,915
That car is an expensive foreign car.

87
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:43,715
I don't think Pops would rent a car like that.

88
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:44,915
I see.

89
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:49,015
Oh, then maybe it's Ms. Jodie's car.

90
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:52,115
It's only natural for a foreigner to be driving a foreign car.

91
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:53,515
Come on.

92
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:55,615
Let's leave that deduction freak alone

93
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,915
and head home!

94
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:01,915
Dr. Agasa said he'd buy a delicious cake for us.

95
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:04,415
It seems Edogawa doesn't want any,

96
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,915
so let's eat it up ourselves!

97
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:12,215
-Yes! -Let's do that!

98
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,815
Right.

99
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:17,415
That's definitely the car of the FBI that I've seen before.

100
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:26,715
Your priority purpose is to retrieve the transmitter and wiretap!

101
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,915
Don't hesitate because of unneeded curiosity and righteousness,

102
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:32,615
because then everything is lost!

103
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:35,215
Yeah. I know.

104
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:42,215
But, he hasn't cautioned me of anything,

105
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:44,015
which means something's come up.

106
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:49,315
Something out of my sight.

107
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,715
Ai!

108
00:07:51,715 --> 00:07:53,515
What're you doing?

109
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,115
I'm hungry so let's hurry back!

110
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:58,015
Yep, I'm coming.

111
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:01,715
What kind of cake is it?

112
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,315
Let's eat it together, Haibara.

113
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:05,415
Yes.

114
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:10,915
Rikumichi Kusuda?

115
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,515
You mean the spy from the Organization that snuck into the hospital

116
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,515
where Rena Mizunashi was staying.

117
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:16,515
If I remember correctly,

118
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:18,715
he fled after his identity was exposed.

119
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,015
After Shu caught and cornered him,

120
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:24,415
he shot himself in the head with a gun.

121
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:25,415
Right?

122
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:28,515
-Yeah. -What about that?

123
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:34,415
Please tell the people at the FBI to not leak this information.

124
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,215
One of the guys of the Organization, Bourbon,

125
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,615
Tohru Amuro is sniffing around, you see!

126
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:41,315
Sure thing!

127
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:42,415
What?

128
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:45,815
Did you ask me to come pick you up just to tell me that?

129
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:49,815
Yes because it's easy to wiretap a cell phone.

130
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:53,215
And I have something else I have to tell you too.

131
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,115
Maybe...

132
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,715
Maybe that guy called Amuro is...

133
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,515
Three! Two! One!

134
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,015
Zero!

135
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,315
Oh, sorry.

136
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:15,015
I'm going to pull over and answer it.

137
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:21,415
What? Natsuko's in critical condition?

138
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,615
She fell off the stairs in front of Haido Park?

139
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:26,215
What hospital is she at?

140
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,515
I'll head over right away.

141
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:31,515
Oh, no, I'd like you to come to the crime site.

142
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:33,615
Crime site?

143
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,915
Yes. I'm at the place where she fell off the stairs now.

144
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,115
We found from the call history on her cell phone

145
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:46,515
that she talked to you last night before eight pm.

146
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:47,715
That's right.

147
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:50,815
I called her just around that time.

148
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,115
Hold it!

149
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:54,915
You mean she didn't fall accidentally?

150
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:55,915
No.

151
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:59,915
According to the person who reported it from a nearby phone booth,

152
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:03,815
it seems she'd been pushed down by someone.

153
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:07,215
Hello? Jodie?

154
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,915
I'll be right over!

155
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,815
The place is the stairs in front of Haido Park, correct?

156
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,515
Jodie.

157
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:24,015
Camel? What are you doing here?

158
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:28,315
The cell phone you used to call her last night was mine, remember?

159
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:31,415
Because your cell phone needed to be recharged.

160
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:35,915
That's why the police called me first.

161
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,215
Because the phone history showed that

162
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:40,115
the conversation took place an hour before it was reported.

163
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,815
What? An hour before?

164
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,315
You mean Natsuko didn't fall today?

165
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:48,115
No. She fell last night a little after nine pm.

166
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,115
No purse or cell phone was found among her belongings

167
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,915
so she was unidentified until after noon today.

168
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:57,815
But, we had a hunch that she could be a teacher,

169
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:59,315
so we traced her from there

170
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:03,915
and finally found that the victim was Ms. Natsuko Shibuya.

171
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:09,015
Then her phone was found disposed of inside the park

172
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,315
so we had you come over.

173
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:13,815
And how's Natsuko right now?

174
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:16,415
She's badly hurt with a dented skull.

175
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:20,415
She underwent surgery although she's still unconscious.

176
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,515
Is that so?

177
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:28,415
Natsuko was probably attacked by a mugger on her way home from work

178
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:31,915
and pushed down the stairs, right?

179
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,515
Yes. We're thinking on that line too.

180
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:35,915
Excuse me...

181
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,115
How did you know she may be a school teacher?

182
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:43,315
Because there were a lot of test papers inside the bag

183
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:45,915
that was on the ground near her.

184
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,815
What? Conan, how come you're here?

185
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:52,115
We were taking a drive together.

186
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:53,815
Were those test papers still untouched

187
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:57,115
with no names or answers on them?

188
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,215
Oh, no.

189
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:03,315
The answers were already written in and graded.

190
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:08,515
I think there were papers that scored 100 too.

191
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:12,315
Then I think that she wasn't attacked here.

192
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,415
Because Ms. Kobayashi said that test papers

193
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:20,415
that are already graded can't be taken home!

194
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:24,515
She says it's to prevent leakage of private information!

195
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:29,415
There seems to be teachers who take test papers home to score them,

196
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,415
but if all the papers were graded,

197
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,415
she wouldn't have taken them home, right?

198
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:37,015
Which means she was attacked inside the school?

199
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,215
I get it!

200
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,415
In order to make it look as if she was attacked

201
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,815
on her way back from school,

202
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:45,015
the perpetrator put whatever was on the desk into her bag

203
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,515
to make it look that way.

204
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:48,715
When doing so,

205
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:53,315
the perpetrator without knowing put in the test papers too.

206
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,815
Since she had a dented skull,

207
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:58,515
she may have been struck with a blunt weapon.

208
00:12:58,515 --> 00:12:59,615
Yes.

209
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:02,315
The perpetrator must have thought that if she was pushed off the stairs,

210
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,615
the police would overlook the fact that she was struck.

211
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:08,315
Come to think of it, Natsuko said on the phone last night,

212
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,715
"I'm supposed to meet some parents today after this too".

213
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:13,115
What? Is that true?

214
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,115
Yes.

215
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:15,215
Okay!

216
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:19,615
Check her call history and e-mails once again thoroughly!

217
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:22,815
The people she had promised to see last night

218
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,615
are of prime importance!

219
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:25,715
Yes, sir!

220
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:37,066
"Haido Elementary School"

221
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,166
Inspector Megure! Here it is!

222
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,366
Luminol reaction from on top the victim's desk.

223
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,966
So the crime took place here after all.

224
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,266
And, what about the weapon?

225
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,266
It hasn't been found yet.

226
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:53,666
The perpetrator probably took it away when fleeing.

227
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,666
Last night,

228
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,366
were there any other teachers beside Ms. Shibuya

229
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:01,066
who remained at school?

230
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,266
No.

231
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:05,166
But Mr. Sugamoto...

232
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,366
Didn't you say that you were going to take Ms. Shibuya home?

233
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:09,966
Oh, no.

234
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:12,366
"Yoshiharu Sugamoto (30)" -Well, I thought it dangerous for a woman

235
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:13,666
to walk alone at night.

236
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,566
But when I came back here

237
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,966
to see if she'd be ready to go,

238
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,566
she wasn't here.

239
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,466
Around what time was that?

240
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:25,166
I think it was a little after 8:30 pm.

241
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:29,166
So I asked security to lock up and headed home.

242
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,866
Where and what were you doing till then?

243
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,666
I was in the PE equipment room organizing the equipment.

244
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,866
After all, I'm a PE teacher.

245
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,666
Excuse me.

246
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,866
Mr. Sugamoto, do you have a car?

247
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,566
Yes. I do.

248
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:48,666
But the engine acted up today so I came by train.

249
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,166
What class are you in?

250
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,566
You don't look familiar.

251
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,366
He's from another school.

252
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:59,166
He's here on a social studies field trip, right?

253
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,366
Yep.

254
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,966
Inspector Megure!

255
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,966
Thank you for coming!

256
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,866
These two people here are the ones

257
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:13,766
who had appointments to meet Ms. Shibuya last night!

258
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,566
I thought she was just seeing one parent.

259
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,366
What is going on?

260
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,666
Barging in on my company like that?

261
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,766
I don't know what's going on,

262
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,466
but please hurry it up

263
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,366
because I've got to prepare dinner, okay?

264
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:29,666
She was struck by someone last night,

265
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,866
carried over to Haido Park,

266
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:35,066
then pushed off the stairs.

267
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:41,366
Ms. Natsuko Shibuya who had promised to see you both here!

268
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:42,366
-What? -What?

269
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,266
And how is she?

270
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,066
Fortunately, the surgery went well,

271
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,266
but she hasn't regained consciousness yet.

272
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,766
Hey, hold it!

273
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:52,666
Don't tell me that we're suspects?

274
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,466
You've got to be kidding!

275
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,866
Anyway!

276
00:15:55,866 --> 00:16:02,666
Will both of you please explain what you came to see Ms. Shibuya for?

277
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,366
First, will you please start, Miss?

278
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:12,466
I just came to warn Ms. Shibuya not to seduce my son.

279
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:13,966
Seduce?

280
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:17,066
"Akiyo Ueno (39)" -I don't care whether she just came back from the States

281
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:19,466
but wearing a skirt so short,

282
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:24,966
it's only natural that my son would fall head over heels for her!

283
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,566
But I think that Natsuko is rather on the plain side.

284
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:32,666
He saying that he's going to marry Ms. Shibuya in the future!

285
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,266
I can't just do nothing and watch, can I?

286
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:41,066
Your skirt is quite short too, don't you think?

287
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,966
I'm not a teacher you see.

288
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,066
You were one before though.

289
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:50,466
At around what time did you see Ms. Shibuya?

290
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,666
At a little after eight pm.

291
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,866
What did she say back then?

292
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:58,366
She said she'd be careful from now on with a grin on her face.

293
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,766
I went home in about 10 minutes.

294
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:06,466
I didn't want to keep my son all by himself for too long.

295
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:10,866
I came to give that irresponsible teacher a piece of my mind!

296
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,766
"Fujiyuki Kandachi (41)" -She marked my daughter's answer wrong

297
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,566
saying that her handwriting was too sloppy.

298
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,566
I came her a little before nine pm,

299
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,966
but the school building was dark

300
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,866
and the gate was closed

301
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:22,866
so I didn't get to meet her!

302
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:26,766
Was it really because her handwriting was sloppy?

303
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:27,766
Yeah!

304
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:30,966
All the answers that were marked wrong were all correct!

305
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,866
She would've gotten a 100 if graded as should be

306
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,966
but she only got a grade of 60!

307
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,566
I don't think Natsuko would do something unfair like that.

308
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:44,366
Would you like me to show it too you my daughter's test paper then?

309
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:48,866
On top of that, she hired a weird detective too.

310
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,266
A weird detective?

311
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,566
Is that right?

312
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:52,766
Yeah.

313
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:57,566
I went after her so that I could talk to her

314
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:00,166
but I was suddenly grabbed by the collar!

315
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,866
It couldn't be helped.

316
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:07,966
She asked me to solve a stalker problem for her.

317
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,666
Bourbon?

318
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,466
I'm sorry I'm late, Inspector.

319
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,166
Did you call him?

320
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,266
Well...

321
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:20,766
His phone number was also shown on her call history.

322
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:25,266
And are those two over there English teachers?

323
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:30,966
No. They are FBI agents

324
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:34,266
and are cooperating with us with the investigation.

325
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,166
Oh.

326
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,366
The FBI?

327
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:43,466
In other words, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States.

328
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:47,166
I see a lot about you on TV or in the movies.

329
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:53,466
Their investigators show up at crime scenes to steal all the credit,

330
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,066
smugly interfere with the investigation,

331
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:58,666
offend the local police and annoy the viewer.

332
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,366
What?

333
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:04,166
I'm not referring to any of you, though!

334
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,866
-I just happened to see what I talked of. -This guy...

335
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:11,566
This guy tried to kill Akai.

336
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,466
Camel.

337
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,566
Cool it.

338
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,166
You don't want him to find out that

339
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,166
the FBI knows that he's a member of the Organization, do you?

340
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,166
Okay.

341
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,266
What?

342
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:25,966
Then, you're saying that

343
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:29,966
you're the one who reported the incident involving Ms. Natsuko Shibuya?

344
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,166
Yes.

345
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,866
She had asked me to investigate on the stalker

346
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,866
as well as act as her bodyguard too.

347
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:40,566
I came to watch her as she usually goes home using the park

348
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:43,066
which is a short cut.

349
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:46,966
But, I didn't think she'd come rolling down the stairs of the park.

350
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,866
If I remember correctly,

351
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,766
when you called in to report, you said that somebody pushed her down.

352
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:54,566
Did you see the perpetrator?

353
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:57,766
Yes. I saw the perpetrator.

354
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:00,866
The silhouette of the perpetrator who was standing on the stairs,

355
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,666
looking down at Ms. Shibuya.

356
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,066
Unfortunately,

357
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,466
I only saw the perpetrator from inside the car

358
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,766
and since the perpetrator fled right away

359
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:11,466
so I couldn't make out the face.

360
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,566
Only the silhouette.

361
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:14,766
Yes.

362
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:19,466
After that I heard a car take off at the top of the stairs

363
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:22,866
so I figured the perpetrator carried her, who was unconscious on the car,

364
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:27,166
took her to the parking lot of the park near the stairs,

365
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:32,766
and after checking to see that no one was around and pushed her off.

366
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:37,066
My car was parked on the road but I guess the perpetrator didn't see it

367
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:40,466
because it was hidden by the trees.

368
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:43,366
Haido Park has unrestricted access

369
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:47,166
but at around nine pm there is virtually no one there.

370
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,866
I believe it was just as Mr. Amuro had explained.

371
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:55,066
But why didn't you wait at the scene

372
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:58,066
until we arrived after you made the report?

373
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:01,266
If you did so, the case would've moved along more smoothly.

374
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:02,766
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:06,166
I had another client in my car.

376
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,666
Since she told me that she didn't want to get involved.

377
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,966
Are you saying that

378
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:14,366
you just left Natsuko who was critically injured out on the street?

379
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:19,966
Of course I left after confirming that the ambulance arrived.

380
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:21,766
Any problem with that?

381
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:24,366
Jodie.

382
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,166
Well...

383
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,866
I guess it's because agent Jodie was best friends with Ms. Shibuya.

384
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,266
I see.

385
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,166
You're friends.

386
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,666
If so, it could be the doing of someone

387
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,766
who has a grudge against the FBI.

388
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,066
You.

389
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,166
Well...

390
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,966
Why don't we go over the incident once more?

391
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,166
For now,

392
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:56,266
we know that those three got to or planned to see Ms, Shibuya last night!

393
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,766
Right!

394
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:01,766
We've got to find the perpetrator first thing.

395
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:05,266
The one who struck Natsuko in this teachers' room, knocked her out,

396
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:08,966
carried her to the park and pushed her down!

397
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:10,266
Right.

398
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:16,866
Then will you tell me about last night without leaving anything out?

399
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:52,766
"Next Episode" -So, this is the answer sheet in question.

400
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,166
It seems that we were the only ones who could decipher it after all!

401
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,566
-"We"? -"We"?

402
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:00,066
Right?

403
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,766
Conan Edogawa?

404
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,566
The hospital just called.

405
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:07,166
Ms. Shibuya took a turn for the worse and she's in critical condition.

406
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,366
Don't die!

407
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:17,466
Next Conan, "The Scarlet Pursuit"

408
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,966
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:37,566
"Flower circles"

410
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:39,966
We get to solve a mystery together again.

411
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:41,966
Are you sure you're not investigating me?
