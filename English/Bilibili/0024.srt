1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:05,895
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:08,815
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,265
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:13,355
Today's case is about amnesia!

5
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:15,015
A trap lurks in a
beautiful woman's shadow!

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,435
You can fool old Kogoro,
but there's always only one truth!

7
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,969
The Case of the Mysterious
Woman with Amnesia.

8
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,599
"Yuda Hitoshi, the murderer
who was arrested

9
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,549
thanks to Mori Kogoro's
brilliant detective work,

10
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,579
escaped from Musashino Prison
last night.

11
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,999
Yuda is an extremely
calculating criminal,

12
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,289
and has many ingenious
techniques at his disposal.

13
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,749
He murdered his wife Keiko-san to collect
on her life insurance policy,

14
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:45,409
and was only arrested because of
Mori's incredible detective skills."

15
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,509
Do you think we'll be alright?

16
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:48,619
What do you mean?

17
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,249
Aren't you scared he'll want revenge?!

18
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,019
Revenge?

19
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,849
He said so when he was arrested...

20
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:00,859
I'll get you for this someday!
Mark my words, Mori Kogoro!

21
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,819
Remember?

22
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:07,409
We'll be fine, Ran!
There's nothing to worry about!

23
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,579
How can you be so relaxed about this?!

24
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,289
You're the one he's after!

25
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:18,539
I'm probably the one he should
be after, not the old man.

26
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,709
Therefore you killed her, Yuda!
Give yourself up!

27
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,409
He worked so hard to escape!

28
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,749
He wouldn't dare cause any trouble
that would lead to his recapture!

29
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,679
He's probably fleeing
the country as we speak.

30
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,679
I sure hope so...

31
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:34,139
Now then, off to work I go!

32
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,789
I'm coming too!

33
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,539
Where to?!

34
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,479
You come too, Conan-kun!

35
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:39,939
What for?

36
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,029
To protect Dad, of course!

37
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,409
Come on out, I'm ready for you!

38
00:03:57,869 --> 00:04:03,539
Give me a break! Why did I have
to come here with them?

39
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,929
What's he looking at?
He's not watching the race...

40
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:15,519
Come on! Come on! Faster!

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,919
The old man?!

42
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:18,629
Don't tell me he's--

43
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,099
Huh?!

44
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:29,699
Damn. I hit you once and
all my luck goes down the drain.

45
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,329
It's not nice to blame others.

46
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,129
My luck's back!

47
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,789
Ow!

48
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,759
My luck's not back.

49
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,729
This lady has really developed muscles!

50
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,199
So she's not seriously injured?

51
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,489
Not really, except for one thing.

52
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,959
All she can remember about herself
is that her name is Maya.

53
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,029
She lost...

54
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,419
...Her memory?!

55
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,199
Technically speaking, it's a light case
of retrograde amnesia.

56
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,089
Partial memory loss, in other words.

57
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:34,299
Maybe it happened when
she fell off those stairs?

58
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,869
No! It happened before that!

59
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,309
She was already out of it by then...

60
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,599
But then where?

61
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,369
Will she get better?

62
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,869
Of course.

63
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:49,579
But it could happen tomorrow, in a month,
or even three years from now--

64
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,539
there's no way for us to know when.

65
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,069
That's terrible...

66
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,789
Alright! This calls
for a great detective!

67
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,539
I, Mori Kogoro,
shall restore Maya-san's memory!

68
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,499
Hey, now. What does a great detective
have to do with that?

69
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,419
Hi there! How are you feeling?

70
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,079
Maya-san, was it?

71
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,079
My name's Mori. Mori Kogoro.

72
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,889
I'm a detective.

73
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,299
A detective?

74
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,749
Just relax and try to think back.

75
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:25,789
Can you at least remember
where you lost your memory?

76
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:26,269
Sorry...

77
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,739
In your state, you couldn't
have walked very far...

78
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:36,749
My deductions tell me that you must
have lost your memory nearby...

79
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,899
Is there anything
you can almost remember?

80
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:43,289
You look like you exercise,

81
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:45,169
so maybe you were
on your way home from the gym!

82
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:46,379
Gym?

83
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:51,699
You certainly are
incredibly proportioned!

84
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,639
Surely you do some kind of sports,
like body-building or weight-lifting!

85
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,599
Her index fingers have scars on them.

86
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,389
What does she do to get
those kinds of scars?

87
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,999
Say, does your job involve
using wires at all?

88
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,719
I...

89
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,749
What was that?!

90
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:21,329
What's the matter?!

91
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,119
Ow, my head! I can't
remember anything else!

92
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,579
Help me!

93
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,539
Conan! Now look what you've done!

94
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,799
But it looks like my luck has returned!

95
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,409
What a situation.

96
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:43,369
Can you really bring her memory back?

97
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:45,879
Nope. I haven't the slightest idea how.

98
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,729
I didn't think so.

99
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,189
Hey, did you borrow this
from the lady at the hospital?

100
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,149
Yeah. That's all she had on her.

101
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,239
A puzzle piece and a page
torn out of a book...

102
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,199
The Gospel According to Matthew,
Chapter 5, Verse 3.

103
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,159
Isn't this from the Bible?

104
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,079
The Bible?

105
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,289
Huh? Yeah, it is!

106
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,459
Maybe she's Christian.

107
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,749
A Christian would tear up a bible?

108
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:17,199
No, I guess not.

109
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,969
Which means that--

110
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,579
Maybe she used it as a notepad.

111
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,909
A notepad?

112
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,889
See? There are light indentations
on it that look like writing.

113
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,789
You're right.

114
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,409
Ah, she must've written
on the previous page

115
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,399
and accidentally tore this page out
along with the other one.

116
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,539
"9.13, Last Supper"...

117
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,539
Maybe this was a dinner date?

118
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,949
Yeah, that's gotta be it!

119
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,129
But who with?

120
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,909
What do you mean "who with"?

121
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,049
Wait, that's a good question.

122
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,999
Where did she write this?

123
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:03,409
It might be fastest to have her look
at something that identifies herself.

124
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:08,019
Where might she unconsciously
use a Bible to jot down some notes?

125
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,919
I can see her writing in it while on
the phone, then ripping the pages out.

126
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,209
A hotel!

127
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,439
Say, hotels have Bibles
in all their rooms, right?

128
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,399
Hotels?

129
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,869
Now that I look at it,
this is really nice paper!

130
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:26,649
It's nice and smooth
and really high quality!

131
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,189
Yes! It would have to be
from at least a 3-star hotel.

132
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:32,829
That narrows down the
number of possible hotels.

133
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,519
Yeah, Dad! Let's check
each hotel one by one!

134
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,799
Let's go!

135
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,759
You two are coming?

136
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,429
What's that supposed to mean?

137
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,759
Nothing at all!

138
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,219
Yokoyama General Hospital

139
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,659
Will you really be alright?

140
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,349
Yeah, I even got the doctor's permission.

141
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,899
I didn't ask you!

142
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,229
I'll be fine.

143
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,649
I just want to know
who I am and where I'm from!

144
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,159
Please let me come with you!

145
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,229
Leave it to me.

146
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,899
Using my detective skills,

147
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,399
I've determined that this is a page
from a Bible in a high-class hotel!

148
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,089
Soon I'll know which hotel
you were staying at!

149
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,549
There'd be no suffering
if everything was that easy...

150
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:23,009
Off to Mount View Hotel we go!

151
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,689
Come on, Dad! We're leaving!

152
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:32,729
Do you know if this young woman
has been staying here?

153
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:33,439
Huh?

154
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,399
Might she be staying at this hotel?

155
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:39,319
Hey, have you seen this lady before?

156
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,249
This is the 12th hotel now!
I'm so exhausted!

157
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,429
Welcome back, Tachibana-sama.

158
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,099
You know who she is?!

159
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,429
Of course. She's a guest here.

160
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,899
Tachibana Maya-sama.
She checked in two days ago.

161
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,899
We did it, Maya-san!

162
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,909
Bingo! This is the place!

163
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:44,309
Here, I'll search her things.
You two get out of the way.

164
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:44,919
Yeah!

165
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,809
There's nothing really here
to identify who you are...

166
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,809
Can you remember anything?

167
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,349
Now what?

168
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:01,479
The address and phone number they
have on record at the front desk

169
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,819
appear to be fake.

170
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:08,689
But there's no mistake that
Maya-san was staying in this room.

171
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:09,569
What could...?

172
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,099
I'm not even sure
if that's my real name...

173
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,399
Who am I?

174
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,589
Is there something about that pendant?

175
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,509
My head! It hurts!

176
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,429
I can't stand this anymore!

177
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,139
Wait!

178
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:30,969
Maya-san!

179
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,429
Wait!

180
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,229
Maya! Look out!

181
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:39,479
It's him!

182
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,998
Why is the man from the racetrack
after Maya-san?!

183
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:11,968
Ow!

184
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:12,978
Are you alright, Dad?!

185
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,038
What's going on?
What was with that car?!

186
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:17,948
Now I get it!

187
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:21,108
Maya-san! There's someone
out to get you!

188
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:26,658
And the shock of being attacked
must've caused you to lose your memory!

189
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,078
Huh? Where'd Conan-kun go?!

190
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,998
This area is full of
one-way streets and dead-ends!

191
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,288
I might be able to catch up!

192
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:34,918
But that predator-like look
that Maya-san had...

193
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,128
She reacted almost like
she knows when she's in danger.

194
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,538
Who is she?!

195
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,828
Darn it! I lost him!

196
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,768
Man, what a mess...

197
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:57,728
That's it! You got it!

198
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:01,698
Hey, officer! What happened?

199
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:02,908
Was there an accident?

200
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,908
Get out of here, little boy.
It's dangerous.

201
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,738
When did the accident happen?

202
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,708
Three hours ago. Now skedaddle.

203
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:19,248
We found her at the crosswalk
near 5th Street three hours ago!

204
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,618
That's not far from Beika Hotel!

205
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,788
Wait a minute!

206
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:28,248
Maybe she took the bus from
the hotel, got in an accident,

207
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:31,698
and then lost her memory from the shock!

208
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:35,078
Then she walked in a daze
to the pedestrian bridge.

209
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:43,328
A bus! A truck!

210
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:44,608
And a collision?

211
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:54,168
I remember! I remember now!

212
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:57,288
Way to go, Conan-kun! You did it!

213
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:58,448
It was just luck, though.

214
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:02,588
But why did she leave after that
without getting any medical treatment?

215
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:06,548
Maybe because that man
was trying to get her?

216
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,618
So despite having lost her memory,

217
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,478
she instinctually ran away from danger.

218
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:16,618
Hey, let's take a ride on the bus!

219
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:20,868
Yeah! You might remember
where you were planning to go

220
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,438
if the accident hadn't happened!

221
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:44,338
It's hopeless.

222
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,288
You don't remember anything?

223
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:50,638
Don't rush yourself. You've already
remembered a lot in one day.

224
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:52,998
But with all the people
getting on and off,

225
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:54,828
nobody will remember her.

226
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,598
She didn't leave any tracks to follow!

227
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:10,488
This is it! I was supposed
to get off here!

228
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:14,448
Gas Tank

229
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:17,918
Let's walk around for now.

230
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,628
Look out!

231
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:36,878
Maya-san?!

232
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:42,648
Don't tell me these two are--

233
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,948
What's piano wire doing there?!

234
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:55,078
What the hell? Are you
trying to kill us all?!

235
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,658
You're mine!

236
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:58,618
Dad!

237
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,908
No!

238
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:01,368
Both the time at the hotel and now...

239
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,548
Judging from the timing, he's not
trying to kill her or even all of us!

240
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:05,588
He's after old man Kogoro!

241
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:09,578
Ran-neechan! Stay with Maya-san!

242
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,788
Wait, where are you--?

243
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,918
My head!

244
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:13,508
Are you alright?

245
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,468
Maybe you should rest somewhere...

246
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:18,558
Stop!

247
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:22,018
If he's out to kill Kogoro,
then he must be--

248
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:31,248
This is bad! Maya-san's gone...

249
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,618
What are you two doing?

250
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,908
Isn't it obvious?!

251
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:35,408
Help!

252
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:38,788
We owe you one...
We owe you one...

253
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,208
Bad news! Maya-san disappeared!

254
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,248
I'm sorry. I only looked away
for a second, but--

255
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:49,378
Where could she have gone though?

256
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:50,838
There's a chance that man got her!

257
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,698
No, that's highly doubtful.

258
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,308
But maybe she made herself disappear!

259
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:59,768
Maybe she got her memory back...

260
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:01,578
Anyway, let's look for her.

261
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:02,878
You two go that way.

262
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:03,538
Okay!

263
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:04,858
Let's go, Conan-kun!

264
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:11,408
Last Supper

265
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:19,368
Damn it! Thanks to that woman,
my plan's been ruined...

266
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,928
So this is the target.

267
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,578
You're too late!

268
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:42,538
I wanted to watch him
suffer and die, but no!

269
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:54,818
I don't want anyone getting in my way.

270
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:00,658
Maya-san!

271
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:04,748
I remember now! That man's
hideout is over there!

272
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:08,038
Wait! This is...

273
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:09,958
...9th Street, building ♪13!

274
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:14,698
Maybe those numbers written
in that Bible were an address!

275
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:16,768
Which means that's the place!

276
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:21,598
So that's what "Last Supper"
referred to!

277
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:29,408
Yuda! So it was him!

278
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,778
So it was Dad he was after?!

279
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:33,738
The Last Supper...

280
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,198
So that puzzle piece
was part of this picture!

281
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:39,248
She's been here too, then!

282
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,788
Who in the world is she?

283
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,628
How is she involved with this guy?

284
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,668
Huh? What's this?!

285
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,578
Yuda's puzzle piece was the key
to information about Kogoro!

286
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:54,828
In other words, she came here
to get it from him...

287
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,678
That's it! Now I see!

288
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,828
Ran-neechan! Call the police!

289
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:02,808
Conan-kun!

290
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:08,728
How did you find out where
his hideout was, Maya-san?

291
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:17,538
Yuda and Maya-san
clearly knew each other!

292
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:19,578
Who exactly is she?!

293
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:23,578
I'll get you for this someday!
Mark my words!

294
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:26,248
Her well-trained body
and sharp reflexes...

295
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:29,448
And then that wire she pulled out!

296
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:32,118
If she used a bus instead
of a taxi or rental car

297
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:35,288
to hide her tracks
like most professionals do,

298
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:36,448
then there's no mistake!

299
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:40,048
She's a professional killer
that Yuda hired to take Kogoro out!

300
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,568
I'm pretty sure he came this way...

301
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,328
Go!

302
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:16,498
Maya-san.

303
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:21,008
Your memory returned when Yuda
dropped the concrete on us, didn't it?

304
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:24,948
That's right! My memory
came back because of him!

305
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,428
I should really thank him!

306
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,198
I should've realized when you tried
to hide the marks on your hands

307
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:30,698
at the hospital.

308
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:34,148
Realized that you were an assassin
who uses piano wire, that is.

309
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:38,658
Just figuring out that I use wire
for a living was impressive enough.

310
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,108
Who exactly are you?!

311
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:43,068
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

312
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:44,658
A detective?!

313
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:51,368
Dad!

314
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:53,428
Are you alright?!

315
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,168
What in the world just happened?!

316
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:59,088
It would seem I've lost.

317
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:45,398
It seems both he and I chose
the wrong target, little detective.

318
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:48,058
What now?

319
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:48,868
What did she say?

320
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:52,448
Oh, she was saying that Mori Kogoro
really is a great detective

321
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:55,988
since he captured
the same guy twice in a row!

322
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:57,998
Looks like luck is on your side again!

323
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:00,238
Really?

324
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,958
Guess that means I'll be raking it in
after this next G1 horse race then!

325
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:15,678
Now then, please explain
the situation during the kidnapping.

326
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:20,018
I don't want to think
about Naoko being dead!

327
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:23,528
You're a famous corporate raider.

328
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,738
Are you sure you haven't garnered
a lot of hatred in your time?

329
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:28,778
I don't want your lousy money.

330
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:29,738
You can keep it!

331
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,118
Ran! Let's go!

332
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,898
I don't think he would be happy,

333
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:36,078
even if he were avenged.

334
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:38,358
On the next Conan--

335
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:41,448
The Fake Ransom Case.

336
00:24:57,774 --> 00:24:59,908
Next Conan's Hint:

337
00:24:59,908 --> 00:24:59,916
Next Conan's Hint:
Scuba set.

338
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,105
Scuba set.
