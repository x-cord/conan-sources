1
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,070
The victim is Mr. Tatsuya Amagi who lives in a condo nearby.

2
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,770
And the person who was the first to discover the body

3
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,070
was Mr. Tameo Fukuda, who just happened to be passing by.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,470
Yes. I was surprised and called the police.

5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,870
From the looks of the corpse,

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,770
he was killed last night at around 9pm.

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,470
It seems he was stabbed in the torso several times

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,570
with an awl or something that has a sharp tip.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,070
The great sum of money in his pocket was left untouched

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,170
and from the ruthless way that he was murdered...

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,570
A murder motivated by hatred.

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,870
-Conan! -Conan!

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,370
Oh, I saw the police and came running after it.

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,870
Who in the world could've done something like this?

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,070
Mr. Mouri.

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,770
Well, I happened to see the police, you see.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,470
I tell you, both of you...

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,570
But...

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,470
Inspector.

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,070
It seems that the victim Mr. Amagi

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,470
was hated by everyone in the neighborhood.

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,470
It seems to be so.

23
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,470
He asked for it.

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,070
Good riddance!

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,070
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,770
The rubberneckers respond in a curious way.

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,970
A chain reaction of cases starts in the neighborhood.

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,570
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:37,827
"The Shifting Mystery of Beika City (Part 1)"

33
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,227
It seems that Mr. Tatsuya Amagi who was living off his parent's inheritance

34
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:49,427
came to this town about three months ago.

35
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:15,727
He used to ride his large motorbike be it day or night

36
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:18,027
and the boisterous sound of his motorbike

37
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,827
seems to have annoyed the residents

38
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,727
of this quiet residential district to no end.

39
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:27,327
If so, all they had to do was tell him to quiet down.

40
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,327
We tried...

41
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,427
But...

42
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,427
Excuse me.

43
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:37,527
What? What do you want with me?

44
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,327
Well...

45
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:49,027
What is it all of you ganging up on me like that?

46
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,427
It hurts.

47
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:52,927
Talk about lame!

48
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:54,727
What the heck did you come here for?

49
00:04:56,827 --> 00:05:00,327
He was dreadfully obnoxious.

50
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,727
In other words, the victim Mr. Tatsuya Amagi

51
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:05,327
was an unthinkably annoying person

52
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,827
who was not like by everybody including you, Mr. Tameo Fukuda,

53
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,927
who was the first to discover him.

54
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:13,927
And everyone in the neighborhood had a motive to want to kill him too.

55
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,927
What do we have to be suspect for a guy like him?

56
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,127
He got what he deserved.

57
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:22,127
-The heavens punished him. -We're the victims.

58
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:26,527
We wouldn't kill him just because of something like that!

59
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:30,427
After all, we had already asked the community head Mr. Bando

60
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,027
to take care of the situation!

61
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:35,227
Are you referring to Mr. Hikoichi Bando?

62
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,527
Yes.

63
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:37,727
Do you know him?

64
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,027
Yeah, I found this beside the corpse.

65
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:44,327
His hospital card.

66
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,427
Could it be that Mr. Bando the community head

67
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,927
called Mr. Tatsuya Amagi out to give him a piece of his mind...

68
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,127
But, Mr. Amagi wouldn't lend a ear

69
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:57,527
so he stabbed him multiple times to death out of rage?

70
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,927
Let's go see Mr. Bando next then.

71
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,327
We'll leave this scene to the local authorities.

72
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,527
Yes, sir, we'll handle it!

73
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:07,127
Pops, to drop something that would give away his identity immediately

74
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:10,427
at a murder site is a bit too careless, don't you think?

75
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:13,527
Let's go take a look at that careless fellow.

76
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,827
He was punished.

77
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,727
Amagi got what he deserved.

78
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,127
"Hikoichi Bando (35), Community Head"

79
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,727
"Hikoichi Bando (35), Community Head" -Mr. Bando!

80
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,527
Mr. Bando!

81
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,527
Are you all right?

82
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:32,827
Mr. Bando!

83
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,427
No good. He's dead.

84
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:39,327
From the looks of it, I think last night he was already...

85
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,927
He drank pesticide mixed in his liquor

86
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,627
and was poisoned to death.

87
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,927
Hey, this is blood, isn't it?

88
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:50,327
I guess it's the weapon that was used to kill Mr. Tatsuya Amagi.

89
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,627
I guess the perp committed suicide and this concludes the case.

90
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:55,627
Does it mean that the murderer is dead?

91
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,027
No.

92
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,527
But...

93
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,427
At any rate, get forensics.

94
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:01,427
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,327
Mr. Hikoichi Bando.

96
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:13,127
It seems he had a nice personality but it was not that dependable.

97
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:16,927
It seems that he was forced to become the community head too...

98
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,627
Only because the Bando family

99
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:21,427
owned more than half of all the land in this district.

100
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:23,727
So he couldn't refuse and took the job on reluctantly.

101
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:26,627
Even so, if the residents pushes him to do something,

102
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:28,927
he couldn't have avoided talking to Mr. Amagi...

103
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,227
Of course.

104
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:34,127
We're all paying community fees after all, you know.

105
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:40,527
Apparently that woman, Ms. Hiro Ezaki, was pestering him the most.

106
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,427
She does look like a strong woman.

107
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,427
It seems that he was not all that dependent,

108
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:47,827
so he carried that awl to protect himself.

109
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:51,527
What do you want, asking me to come to a place like this?

110
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,627
That...

111
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:53,927
What?

112
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,727
Come on, say it!

113
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,327
Just what do you want?

114
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,027
So, Mr. Bando who panicked,

115
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,927
probably in advertently...

116
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:17,727
But since Mr. Bando figured he couldn't get away with it...

117
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:21,127
Gave up and committed suicide.

118
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,527
I guess you could say this is a bitter type of case closed.

119
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,427
Don't rush to conclusions.

120
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:31,427
Well, then I guess everything worked out right.

121
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,527
That unreliable useless guy

122
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:37,227
finally was of some use to the community.

123
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:40,527
To stab a nuisance who was hated by everyone,

124
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,927
how convenient can things get.

125
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:50,527
But I don't think so.

126
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:54,827
Mr. Bando would never be able to cause such an incident.

127
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,127
Really?

128
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:58,327
If it wasn't inadvertently...

129
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,927
To begin, Mr. Bando was not all that concerned

130
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,427
about Mr. Amagi being a problem.

131
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:06,327
Even yesterday, he was laughing about it.

132
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,727
I'd like you to give me more in detail.

133
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:09,927
You are...

134
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:12,427
I'm Toyoko Kanemitsu.

135
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,027
Oh, you can't cross that line.

136
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:20,227
Then why don't we go to my place to talk?

137
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,827
No, we don't need to go out of our way to move places.

138
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:23,927
Right.

139
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:27,427
Oh my god, you're the famed Detective Mouri, aren't you?

140
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:28,927
Please do come over too, Mr. Mouri.

141
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:31,927
I run a small coffee right nearby.

142
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,827
Really?

143
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:34,927
Okay, then.

144
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:36,227
Hey...

145
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:47,727
Here you are.

146
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:49,427
Thank you.

147
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,027
Here you go.

148
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,627
Thank you.

149
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:59,527
When did Mr. Bando came yesterday?

150
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,927
"Koyuki Gamo (23), Waitress" -Oh...

151
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,627
I think it was a little past noon.

152
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:04,827
That's right.

153
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:08,627
He was together with his friend Mr. Yosuke Chino,

154
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:11,827
who teaches Japanese History at Haido University.

155
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,127
I had this assessed

156
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,527
and found out that it wasn't worth much either.

157
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:19,727
Too bad, Mr. Bando.

158
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,927
I wasn't expecting anything so...

159
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:24,727
You spent days assessing the things in the storeroom,

160
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,027
didn't you, Mr. Chino?

161
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,527
Yes. Hoping to find some sort of treasure...

162
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,627
But, all there was were outdated worthless things

163
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:34,827
in the storeroom.

164
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:36,927
But, it's a historical residence and yet,

165
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,527
I wonder if there's such a thing as no treasure whatsoever.

166
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,027
True.

167
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,827
But Chino, who's a professional said so, so...

168
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,327
Right, there were no treasures whatsoever.

169
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,427
I shouldn't be laughing.

170
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,127
Because the residence are pushing me to do something

171
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:56,327
about that nuisance of a guy.

172
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,427
You haven't gone to talk to him yet?

173
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,427
I'm not at home with things like that.

174
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,527
I'll do something about it in time.

175
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:10,027
That was yesterday afternoon, correct?

176
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:15,927
So Mr. Bando would never have gone to talk to Mr. Amagi that night.

177
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,727
Right, it's unthinkable.

178
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:20,727
-But... -But...

179
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,727
Beside, Mr. Hikoichi Bando,

180
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,827
I wonder if he really committed suicide.

181
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,327
What bothers me is the lock of the front door.

182
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:30,227
The door was unlocked when we arrived.

183
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:33,227
If he were going to commit suicide, he would've locked the door, right?

184
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,727
So that nobody would interfere.

185
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:36,727
What...

186
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,427
-It's starting to get tough... -This is Megure.

187
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:40,427
Yeah.

188
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:42,527
I got it.

189
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,027
It's from forensics.

190
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:47,027
It seems that the poison was that pesticide

191
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:50,527
and it seemed to have been mixed inside the bottle.

192
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:52,327
If he were going to commit suicide,

193
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,927
he would put the poison in the glass cup, right?

194
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:56,227
If put in the bottle, the poison would be diluted, right?

195
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,827
This is a murder made to look like suicide.

196
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,727
But if so...

197
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:04,627
If so, this perp is careless, right?

198
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:06,327
Because his method would be exposed right away

199
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,227
and he even forgot to lock the front door.

200
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,427
If Mr. Bando didn't commit suicide,

201
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:13,827
what about Mr. Amagi's murder?

202
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:16,927
So, I don't think Mr. Bando is the perp.

203
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:20,827
Because Mr. Amagi was stabbed by an awl, right?

204
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,127
What? It's wasn't him for sure!

205
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:27,027
-Because... -Mr. Bando had a fear of needles.

206
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:28,127
What?

207
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,027
He couldn't tolerate anything sharp,

208
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,627
and just looking at things like that would make him shiver.

209
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:37,127
Are you saying that he could've never used an awl, then?

210
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:40,527
The real perp X did everything.

211
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,727
Right, that would be it.

212
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:46,427
That X murdered Mr. Tatsuya Amagi.

213
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:49,927
In order to make it look like Mr. Hikoichi Bando did it,

214
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,827
he murdered Mr. Bando and made it look like a suicide.

215
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:54,427
That was most probably what happened.

216
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:55,827
-Yes. -Yes.

217
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:59,527
Things like that actually happened, don't they?

218
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,127
Although there were many like that in there.

219
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:06,227
You like mysteries, don't you?

220
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:07,727
Mrs. Kanemitsu.

221
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,127
You also have a lot of specialized magazines too.

222
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:13,427
But, they're not the latest and you have only one each.

223
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:17,027
She's probably only buying them when her favorite writer is featured.

224
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:21,727
At any rate, the problem is who is the real perp X.

225
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,827
Boss told me to deliver this to you, Inspector.

226
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,227
It was found under the sofa of the scene of the crime.

227
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:36,627
Since the housekeeper happened to come by, I confirmed and...

228
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,927
"Eiko Hayama (55)" -It's not Mr. Bando's.

229
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:41,227
Because he doesn't smoke.

230
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:44,827
Besides, yesterday evening when I left,

231
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:48,027
there was no such thing under the sofa.

232
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,927
If it's as the housekeeper says,

233
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:54,527
somebody who came over after evening dropped it.

234
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:57,527
So, it could belong to the perp.

235
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,127
That lighter...

236
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:02,627
-Remember? -Oh! It's Mr. Chino's!

237
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:21,794
Mr. Chino and Mr. Bando met at this shop, didn't they?

238
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,394
Yes, I saw him use it back then too.

239
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:29,094
It sounds a bit odd, though, Inspector.

240
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:30,394
They met in the afternoon

241
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:33,794
and yet they met again after evening too.

242
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,094
What about that housekeeper?

243
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,294
We're having her stay at the house.

244
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:40,794
Excuse us.

245
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:50,994
Is the police suspecting Mr. Chino?

246
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,894
No, it can't be.

247
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,494
This lighter wasn't there, was it?

248
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:58,594
No.

249
00:14:58,594 --> 00:15:02,494
On my way home yesterday, I dropped some coins.

250
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:05,594
Gosh, this far inside...

251
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:08,094
Great, I found them all.

252
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:11,894
Back then, if it were there I would've noticed.

253
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,594
So it was dropped after evening.

254
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:17,394
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

255
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:18,694
Not at all.

256
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:25,394
Are you seriously saying that Mr. Chino is the perp?

257
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:27,794
Since his thing was found at the site,

258
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,594
he would become one of the suspects.

259
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,994
If he were a friend, it's natural for him to bring a gift along too.

260
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,994
He could slyly promote Mr. Bando to drink too.

261
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,994
What a disgusting off the point pair.

262
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:38,594
-What? -What?

263
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:40,594
Off the point?

264
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,294
The perp killed Mr. Amagi

265
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:46,694
and tried to make it look as if Mr. Bando had done it, correct?

266
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,994
But, Mr. Chino is not a resident of this town.

267
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:53,894
So it wasn't as though Mr. Amagi was bothering him.

268
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:58,794
In other words, Mr. Chino has no motive to kill Mr. Amagi!

269
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:01,694
At this point, not yet...

270
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,194
Mr. Yosuke Chino has no motive.

271
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:06,994
He has no motive to kill Mr. Tatsuya Amagi.

272
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:09,994
Without a motive, he couldn't be the perp, could he?

273
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:13,294
-I got it! -It's the opposite!

274
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:14,694
The opposite?

275
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,294
The one that Mr. Chino wanted to erase

276
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,794
from the face of this earth was Mr. Hikoichi Bando.

277
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:20,794
What?

278
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:22,594
He tried to make it look like suicide

279
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:25,494
so that the police wouldn't suspect him.

280
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,394
But, you need a motive to commit suicide.

281
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:30,594
So, Mr. Chino took advantage of the fact that

282
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:33,694
Mr. Bando was being pressed to do something about Mr. Amagi.

283
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,494
After murdering Mr. Amagi...

284
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:51,994
By making it look as if Mr. Bando had killed him,

285
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,794
he created a motive for suicide.

286
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:57,694
If we consider that Mr. Amagi was killed

287
00:16:57,694 --> 00:17:00,794
only to make Mr. Bando's death look like suicide...

288
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,994
It's only natural that we can find no motive.

289
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:08,694
If so, why would Mr. Chino think of killing Mr. Bando in the first place?

290
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,794
-That's... -That's...

291
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,994
-That's the point. -That's the fundamental part.

292
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:15,894
We're back to where we started.

293
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,694
That's why I'm saying that you're off the point.

294
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:20,094
What did he stand to gain from killing his friend?

295
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:22,694
If there's some treasure involved, it would be a different story.

296
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:23,694
Treasure?

297
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,294
That's it!

298
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,894
That's what it was!

299
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:27,994
When he checked the place out,

300
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:31,194
Mr. Chino probably found an extraordinarily precious treasure.

301
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:34,494
He figured he'd get a hold of it by getting Mr. Bando out of the way.

302
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:36,794
But, I hear no treasure was found.

303
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,194
Mr. Chino was lying.

304
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:40,194
But, even you, Mrs. Kanemitsu said so yourself.

305
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,094
But, it's a historical residence and yet,

306
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:47,294
I wonder if there's such a thing as no treasure whatsoever.

307
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:49,794
If we think on that line, everything falls into place.

308
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:51,194
It's not impossible.

309
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,494
If Mr. Bando had any treasure...

310
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:56,194
So, this time for sure the case is closed.

311
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,994
This was a kind of ABC Murder Case too, wasn't it?

312
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:06,794
Although just a coincidence, the names of the three...

313
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,994
Their initials are A, B and C.

314
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:14,594
Was the ABC Murder Case written by Agatha Christie?

315
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,894
The people are murdered in chronological order.

316
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,894
Don't tell me that Yosuke Chino, whose initial is C

317
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,794
is also already gotten rid of?

318
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:22,494
Don't be kidding!

319
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:25,494
That can't be...

320
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:26,994
Can it?

321
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:29,294
But it's a bit concerning, isn't it?

322
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:34,194
I guess I was the one who was off the point.

323
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:40,194
I'm Chino.

324
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,394
He's okay.

325
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:42,594
Yeah.

326
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,294
Don't tell me, Conan, not again?

327
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:47,294
Pops asked me to go check.

328
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,294
I'd like to talk to you a bit.

329
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,894
About the murder of Mr. Amagi as well as Mr. Bando.

330
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:56,294
What? Mr. Bando's been killed?

331
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,694
Your suspicions are groundless.

332
00:18:57,694 --> 00:19:00,194
I've never met a person named Amagi.

333
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:03,194
The last I met Bando was at a coffee shop in the afternoon

334
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:04,394
and I never went to his residence.

335
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,494
But, we found this.

336
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:10,394
It's mine, but I lost it somewhere.

337
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,594
Take anything from him or not,

338
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,094
there was not a thing that could be called a treasure

339
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,594
in that storeroom to begin with.

340
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:17,194
You'll see if you investigate.

341
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,594
Telling us to investigate,

342
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:21,394
it could mean that you already stole it when you were assessing.

343
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,394
You didn't want it to be exposed so you killed Mr. Bando.

344
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:25,994
No.

345
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,994
It seems you're insisting on making me the perp.

346
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,794
I was home all day yesterday!

347
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,494
Was someone with you?

348
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:35,194
I was alone!

349
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:37,594
I was judging some application papers!

350
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,494
Application papers?

351
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,494
For the new writer's award.

352
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,994
I'm sometimes asked to judge for the preliminary contest

353
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:46,094
hosted by mystery magazines,

354
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,994
because I used to be the head of the mystery club

355
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:49,694
during my university days.

356
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,694
That's why I get asked by mystery clubs here and there.

357
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:53,594
You're an expert on mysteries.

358
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:57,794
In other words, you have no one to verify your alibi!

359
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,894
I'm not in need for money.

360
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,594
I have no reason to steal.

361
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:04,794
We'll hear you out at the station in detail.

362
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,094
Hold it!

363
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,594
Hear me out!

364
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:10,194
Hey, wait!

365
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:12,494
Inspector, it bothered you too, didn't it?

366
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:13,994
That a mystery expert

367
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,294
would put poison inside the bottle instead of the cup

368
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,394
or make such careless mistakes

369
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:21,394
like keeping the door unlocked, right?

370
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,094
He should also know all about

371
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,794
how to provide an alibi for himself and yet,

372
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:26,794
to have nothing prepared is unbelievable.

373
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:30,194
Which means that Mr. Chino is not the real perp X.

374
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,494
But, there's a possibility that he was just framed.

375
00:20:32,494 --> 00:20:34,394
That's impossible.

376
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:35,694
-Pops. -Mr. Mouri.

377
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,794
I came to take a look at the face of Mr. Yosuke Chino too.

378
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:40,794
What do you mean by it's impossible?

379
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:44,294
If there was another real perp who killed Mr. Tatsuya Amagi

380
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,994
and Mr. Hikoichi Bando

381
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,394
and wanted to frame Mr. Chino for both murders,

382
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,994
the perp would've also gotten rid of Mr. Chino.

383
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,394
Then he would've indeed have to make it look like suicide.

384
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:56,594
That way, the case would be closed.

385
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:59,794
True, the perp who killed both men,

386
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:02,294
wouldn't kill Mr. Chino too.

387
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,994
Now that he mentioned it, it's true.

388
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:08,194
The fact that he is still alive is evidence above all

389
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:10,694
that he is the real perp.

390
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,994
It makes sense.

391
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:15,194
That's true, but...

392
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:17,294
I think we were over thinking.

393
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:18,294
We're going home.

394
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:21,194
The police will take care of things from here and make him confess.

395
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:26,594
Maybe...

396
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:33,394
Did I keep you waiting?

397
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:35,494
Oh, no...

398
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,394
Are you sure nobody saw you?

399
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,994
Of course no one did. Let's go.

400
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:40,994
Okay.

401
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:53,394
Good for him.

402
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:57,794
I'm sure the perp deliberately didn't kill Mr. Chino.

403
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,794
The real perp X!

404
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,694
What? Back then...

405
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:09,094
The customers here were...

406
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,494
If I remember correctly...

407
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,694
Oh, Mr. Fukuda and his family

408
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:18,894
and Ms. Hiro Ezaki were here with her friends.

409
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:20,394
What?

410
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:23,194
The one who first discovered Mr. Amagi's corpse

411
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:27,194
and the lady who was pushing Mr. Bando to do his thing were also here.

412
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:31,094
If so, the real perp X is...

413
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,694
The fact that Bando had a fear of needles

414
00:23:56,694 --> 00:24:01,194
and couldn't use an awl is something I knew.

415
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:04,694
Does Mr. Fukuda only work night shifts?

416
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:08,494
It would be difficult for him to commit the crime.

417
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:11,194
What are you snooping around me for?

418
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:12,594
See you then.

419
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:13,694
Oh, hey!

420
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:15,294
Wait up! You brat!

421
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:18,294
Does the name Yamiyo Dorosue sound familiar?

422
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:20,294
Next Conan,

423
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:24,294
"The Shifting Mystery of Beika City (Part 2)"

424
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,937
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:29,337
"Mystery magazines"

426
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:30,337
A word for today.

427
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:32,637
If we watch "Crimson", can we get some candy?

428
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,237
No, I won't give you any.
