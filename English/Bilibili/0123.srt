1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:04,898
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:07,018
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:10,098
Today is a weather lady!
Pager logic will clear the heart!

4
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:11,978
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,558
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,268
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:57,761
"The Weather Lady Abduction Case."

8
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:07,761
Towels, towels!

9
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:12,131
A little more and we'd
be super-sopping wet...

10
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:15,721
The weather lady was right!
Thunderstorms this afternoon!

11
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,571
Huh? Where's Mr. Mori?

12
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,091
He's on a work trip.

13
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,281
Huh? There's a message on here.

14
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,371
Hey, now. Don't go touching it.

15
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:30,381
You have one message.

16
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,721
Geez.

17
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:36,721
Hello, this is
Asano Aki from Nichiuri TV.

18
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:40,761
I'm calling because I need to
speak with you about something urgent.

19
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,381
You appear to be out,
so I'll call again later.

20
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,221
Who's Asano Aki?

21
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:50,771
The weather lady! You know,
she does the weather on Nichiuri TV!

22
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,801
Yeah! She's on "News City" too!

23
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:59,311
She's super cool! I'm a big fan of hers!

24
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:03,751
But what could she urgently
need to talk to him about?

25
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:09,911
Alright! Let's talk with her instead,
as the Junior Detective League!

26
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,461
Yeah!

27
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:12,781
Hey, now...

28
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,621
Nichiuri TV

29
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,701
Oh?
Nichiuri TV

30
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:16,421
Asano Aki (27) Weather lady and newscaster

31
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,831
So you came all the way here in Mori-san's place?
Asano Aki (27) Weather lady and newscaster

32
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:26,581
Yes! If you need help, leave it
to us, the Junior Detective League!

33
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,501
Oh, are you
greeting children today?

34
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,551
Tsukumo-san...

35
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:32,751
Having to deal with kids just to gain popularity...

36
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:37,081
Tsukumo Kazumi (31) Newscaster
Having to deal with kids just to gain popularity...

37
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,561
Big-name newscasters sure have it tough!
Tsukumo Kazumi (31) Newscaster

38
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,981
Yikes, what gaudy makeup.

39
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:43,941
What's with that fingernail?

40
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,251
That's not what I'm doing.

41
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:52,181
Behave yourselves, kiddies.
Don't get in the way of her work.

42
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,711
What an unpleasant person!

43
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,121
Isn't she the person who
did the news before you did?

44
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,251
That's right. We switched
places about half a year ago.

45
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,381
Was she what you wanted
to talk to Mr. Mori about?

46
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:16,331
No... A-Actually, uhh...

47
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:20,721
I was wondering if Detective
Mori-san would be on News City!

48
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:24,711
Aww, what a downer.

49
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:27,311
What a relief it wasn't a case...

50
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:28,531
What's that sound?

51
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,581
What is that?

52
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,581
It's a pager.

53
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:36,921
Ran-neechan told me to take it
because I always suddenly disappear.

54
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,751
Oh! You're so lucky!

55
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,171
You had a cell phone, Mitsuhiko!

56
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,291
It was only a receiver!

57
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,921
But it broke, right?

58
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,171
Yes, for the sake of justice...

59
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,961
Oh? Really?

60
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:53,461
Oh, this is the detective agency's number,
so it must be Ran-neechan!

61
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:58,501
Oh, I know! Could you give
me your pager's number?

62
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,921
I can contact you when I need
the Junior Detective League's help!

63
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,291
Awesome! Hey, Conan!

64
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,291
Sure! It's written right here!

65
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,921
Thanks!

66
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:14,231
Let's see... Now to save
"Junior Detective League" to my phone...

67
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,581
There we go! All done!

68
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:25,581
Oh! This only shows numbers, huh?
I used to have one, too!

69
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:29,421
My friends and I often used
numbers to write messages for fun!

70
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,381
Messages?

71
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,831
Even if it can only display numbers,

72
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:38,211
you can use numbers that look
and sound like letters to write things!

73
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:41,341
For example, "428" could be read "Shibuya"!

74
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:47,171
4, 2, 8... Shi-bu-ya...

75
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,061
Shibuya! (a city in Tokyo) Neat!

76
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:54,021
Say, since you're here, how about
a tour of the News City studio?

77
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,241
Hurray!
Yes!

78
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:59,251
Oh, just a minute.

79
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,741
Hello, this is Asano.

80
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:09,291
Yes. Yes. I will. Yes.
Okay. I'll be right there.

81
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:14,211
I'm sorry. I have work
to do, so I can't go.

82
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,291
I-I'm sorry!

83
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,441
Oh, Kobayashi-san!

84
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,831
Yes? What can I do?

85
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:26,221
I'm sorry to ask, but could
you show them to Studio A?

86
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:28,581
Some work just came up, so...

87
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,081
Sure, it's no problem!

88
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,641
Oh, and could you
get them some passes?

89
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,151
Sure.

90
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:35,001
Well, shall we go?

91
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,401
Hurray!

92
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,821
I'm hungry...

93
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:42,671
How long is she going to make us wait?

94
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:45,621
Sorry to suddenly
ask you to stand in like this!

95
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,081
That's fine, but what's this
about Aki-san being threatened?

96
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,541
Threatened?!

97
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,171
Who are these kids?!
They're distracting! Get rid of them!

98
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,461
U-Understood!

99
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:59,921
Running off because of a threat?!
Aki-san is a failure as a journalist!

100
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,761
We're beginning rehearsal!

101
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,851
Sorry, Kazumi-san hates children.

102
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:13,921
Say, she said Aki-san was threatened.

103
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:14,751
Yeah.

104
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,321
We came to see Aki-san
in Detective Mori's place!

105
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,751
Oh, the famous detective?!

106
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:24,291
I see. Well, just between us,

107
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,171
Aki-san's been getting
harassing letters and phone calls

108
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,791
ever since she started a story
about a certain politician's corruption.

109
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,831
She got a letter this
morning threatening to kill her

110
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:36,251
if she appeared on today's News City.

111
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:41,711
Was this threat what
she really wanted to discuss?

112
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,421
You can see the News City
broadcast on that TV.

113
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:48,091
Well, I have work to do, so I'll see you later.

114
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:55,421
Hey, do you think the
phone call Aki-san got earlier

115
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,581
was a threatening phone call?!

116
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:00,751
Yes, and then that scared her...

117
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:04,041
No! Aki-san isn't a weakling like that!

118
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,991
You agree with me, right, Conan-kun?!

119
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:08,871
Yeah...

120
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:15,541
When she was on the phone then,
she didn't seem afraid at all.

121
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,841
In fact, she sounded happy,
as if she had gotten a special scoop.

122
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,881
That call was probably not a threat.

123
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,801
No, wait! If that call had been
a trap to lure her somewhere--!

124
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,561
Is it Ran-oneechan again?

125
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,521
No.

126
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:43,211
It's probably Aki-san. Only she
and Ran-neechan know this number.

127
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,581
Oh! Okay!

128
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:53,451
Hello, this is Asano. I'm not home
right now, so please leave your--

129
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,041
Huh? Why'd you hang up?

130
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,251
Was it not Aki-san?

131
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:03,381
It was her home. But it
was her answering machine.

132
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:07,881
That's odd! Why would she have
you call her home if she isn't there?

133
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,891
110?

134
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,751
The police phone number.

135
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,501
The police?!

136
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,581
Why would the police call us?!

137
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,401
No! It's Aki-san!

138
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:29,321
A bad guy must've caught her!
So she wants us to call the police!

139
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:33,281
Then couldn't she
just call them herself?

140
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:37,251
What if she's unable to talk?

141
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:44,171
Oh no!

142
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:45,551
It's an abduction...

143
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,961
9109.

144
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:55,831
That's the city code of her phone number!

145
00:09:55,831 --> 00:10:00,331
The police won't listen to us with only this.

146
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:05,361
If the police can't help,
then the Junior Detective League will!

147
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,501
Yeah, but this isn't
enough to know where she is.

148
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,491
Oh...

149
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,071
Yeah...

150
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:15,501
And now for today's sports.

151
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:20,001
The J-League game at the
National Stadium between the Tokyo--

152
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,621
I like Aki-san a lot better...

153
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,881
2003.

154
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,331
I got it! It's read "Niousama"!
[temple guardian]

155
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,391
So she's where there
are temple guardian statues!

156
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:39,311
Come on. Can't you deduce
a little better than that?

157
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,771
Nichiuri TV

158
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:18,311
The messages after
7:20 make no sense at all.

159
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:23,871
Lastly, we've just received this news.

160
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:26,871
The Special Investig. Unit of
the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office

161
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:29,901
is to question the politicians
Mr. Maruya and Mr. Okubo tomorrow

162
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:31,871
about their possible
acceptance of large bribes

163
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,911
in relation to the corruption
case involving Bay Development.

164
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:39,581
I've figured out what
Aki-san's messages mean!

165
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,451
For reals, Mitsuhiko?!

166
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:46,131
These are indicating the names
of the politicians who took bribes!

167
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,961
0 is "maru". Maruya's initial, basically!

168
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:53,291
00 is "oo." Okubo's initial!

169
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,141
And the 96 of 096 is "kuro"!

170
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:03,101
So Aki-san is trying to say
it's Maruya who's guilty of corruption!

171
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,021
Then what do 2003 and 5656 mean?

172
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:12,241
They're bank account numbers
used for the bribes, of course!

173
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:18,211
Alright! Aki-san must be
captured at Maruya's home then!

174
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,831
Let's hurry and save her!

175
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:24,461
I heard he lives in West Teitan,
one subway stop from here!

176
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:28,001
Let's go, Conan-kun!

177
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,671
Okay.

178
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,961
Now there's thunder! Let's run, guys!

179
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,851
Maruya

180
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:51,571
Hey, Conan! Hurry up! Conan!

181
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:55,121
Keep watch for anyone coming!

182
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,751
Mitsuhiko! Hurry up here!

183
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,291
Right!

184
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:03,491
Hey, you! What are you doing?!

185
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,541
Come down here!

186
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,461
I'm sorry!

187
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,711
Can't believe you
guys ran off without me.

188
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:19,791
Next time, we'll have to do something
about the guard and the dogs.

189
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,401
You saw them first!

190
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:22,961
Stop it!
You saw them first!

191
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:24,641
Stop it!

192
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:26,351
Aki-san?!

193
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,561
It's Ran-neechan.

194
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:30,671
Oh...

195
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,021
I'll go call her!

196
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,491
Aww, it's raining again...

197
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,961
Hello? Ran-neechan?

198
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,451
Conan-kun!

199
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,711
Where are you at this time of night?!

200
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,871
I paged you and paged you,
but you ignored me!

201
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,381
S-Sorry! I'll be home soon!

202
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:53,041
You better come home quick!

203
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,211
Huh? There's thunder where you are?

204
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:03,471
Yea, it's really rainy and thundery.

205
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,391
It's nice weather here.
The moon is really pretty!

206
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:12,621
It's pouring here, so I don't
think I'll be home for a while.

207
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,821
Where are you right now, Conan-kun?

208
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,491
Should I bring an
umbrella and come get you?

209
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,491
Moon?

210
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:26,961
What? Hello? Conan-kun?
Hey, are you listening to me?

211
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,081
Now for tomorrow's weather.

212
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,961
A cold front in the northern Kanto
region will bring clouds and rain.

213
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:37,501
Southern Kanto will have clear skies.
Tomorrow's high temperature...

214
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,641
We're going back to the TV station!

215
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,421
Hurry, everyone!

216
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,801
Wait up!

217
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,621
You better explain, Conan!

218
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,350
Here, try reading 2003 on its side.

219
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,610
On its side?

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,070
M-O-O-N.

221
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,900
Oh, I get it! Awesome!

222
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,360
So, what's that mean?

223
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,870
It spells "moon" in English.

224
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,070
Now, the reason Aki-san
sent this "2003" message first

225
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,790
was because she wanted
us to look up at the night sky.

226
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,210
The "2003" was displayed at 7:20 pm.

227
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,180
As I recall, the moon
was in the southeast then.

228
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,320
But it wasn't visible
from Maruya's mansion,

229
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,180
because of buildings to the southeast.

230
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,100
Which means Aki-san
isn't at Maruya's home, right?!

231
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,070
Right... she's being held somewhere
where she can see the moon.

232
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,660
But that isn't enough to
tell us where she is.

233
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,700
Exactly.

234
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,700
So she used numbers like weather symbols

235
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,040
to indicate weather
changes where she is!

236
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,200
0 is the circle meaning fair weather.

237
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,660
00 is the double-circle
meaning cloudy weather.

238
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,360
096 is a filled circle, meaning rain!

239
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,320
What about the 5656 at 8:31?

240
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,470
Say the sound effect for thunder out loud.

241
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,520
"Goro (56) goro (56)"...

242
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,400
I get it! 5656 was referring to thunder!

243
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,400
Yep!

244
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:36,490
So she's being held where there
was rain and thunder around 8:30!

245
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,040
Places with thunderstorms at 8:30 pm?

246
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,610
Oh, the only one was the area around this TV station

247
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,660
Nichiuri TV Meteorology Center
Oh, the only one was the area around this TV station

248
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,340
within a 1-kilometer radius!

249
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,200
It was a passing shower!

250
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,130
Thanks!

251
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,310
It's just as you thought!
Aki-san is somewhere in this area!

252
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,740
Yeah.

253
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,570
0109... What is it?

254
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,570
Wouldn't 01 be the symbol
for "clear weather"?!

255
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,450
No, it's still cloudy here.
It must mean something different.

256
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,580
I bet 0109 means, "I want
to eat a huge eel box lunch!"

257
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,280
After all, she's probably hungry!

258
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,160
I think you mean you.

259
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,500
I'm hungry...

260
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,850
What's your problem?!
It's not that funny!

261
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,270
Sorry, sorry! That's not it!
Nice work, Genta!

262
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,230
Thanks to you, I know where Aki-san is!

263
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,630
The large prop room?

264
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,340
Yeah! That's where
we got separated from her!

265
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,200
As I recall, it's the northernmost
room on the first floor...

266
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,070
Thanks!

267
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,090
H-Hey!

268
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,950
Aki-san's in the large prop room!

269
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:29,160
Like Genta said, you read the 0,
10, and 9 of that 0109 separately!

270
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,230
0, 10, 9? O... to... ku?
Odogu! (large prop)

271
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,570
There are lots of rooms in
TV stations that people rarely enter!

272
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,320
If the kidnapper works here,
they could use one!

273
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,030
Does that mean you know who it is?!

274
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,250
Yeah, because Aki-san told us who!

275
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,920
End of the line!

276
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,110
It's no use running.

277
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,910
We know everything.

278
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,350
Give yourself up.

279
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,270
You called Aki-san here,
knocked her out with drugs or something,

280
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,030
and locked her in that back room

281
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,240
to make others think she had run away,
out of fear of that threat.

282
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,200
Yes, you tried to ruin her credibility
and have her kicked off News City!

283
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,450
Aki-san used her cell phone to
send us messages about her location

284
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,080
by referencing weather changes
she could see outside the window!

285
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:42,200
Except, there was one message
she sent that I didn't understand.

286
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,050
9109.

287
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,240
This number came in after
a message to call the police.

288
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,730
But, if it didn't indicate her location...

289
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,690
...it indicated her kidnapper's name!

290
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,240
Oh, no, you don't!

291
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,570
Take this!

292
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,240
We're the Junior Detective League!
There's no getting away from us!

293
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
That's right!

294
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,910
Aki-san! Hang on! Aki-san!

295
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,730
9109 is separated as 9-10-9.
Changed to kanji and read aloud...

296
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,680
... "tsu ku mo."

297
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,270
That would be you,
Tsukumo Kazumi-san!

298
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,450
Get off me!

299
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,570
I just couldn't stand it...

300
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,330
News City was my idea!
It was my show from the start!

301
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,800
But then they replaced me with
someone younger, someone cuter!

302
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,470
This is serious business! This is...

303
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,760
Then earn the spot back with actual skill.

304
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,350
However you rationalize it,
a crime can't be justified.

305
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,530
That concludes this
afternoon's weather forecast!

306
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,070
And cut!

307
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,580
Good work!

308
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,570
Sorry for the wait!

309
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,310
Thank you all so much for yesterday!

310
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,370
But only the Junior Detective
League could've realized

311
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,910
that my messages were weather codes!

312
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,730
But how did you know it was Kazumi-san?

313
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,710
When she tried to put me to sleep,
I caught a glimpse of her nails.

314
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,870
Oh! The nail art!

315
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,540
Yep! The design reminded me of
a weather map, so I remembered it.

316
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,250
That means you're
snow pellets, Genta-kun!

317
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:39,910
Snow pellets?

318
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,500
See?!

319
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,470
Snow Pellets

320
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,780
Ah! That image fits you perfectly!

321
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,350
Hey, you!

322
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,940
Hey, Genta. You're not just snow pellets.

323
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,500
Hail

324
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,710
Hail!
Hail

325
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,530
Hail
