00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,740
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,340
What a slow day.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,440
I wish an incident or something would occur

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,940
even from now.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,740
Dad, what a thing to say, it's not nice.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,640
Maybe I'll go get myself a drink.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,540
But, it doesn't look like it's going to stop raining.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,440
It's Officer Chiba.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,940
It's come!

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,440
A case.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Mr. Mouri, please take over.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,240
Welcome.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,340
Please find her right away.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,040
We've got to hurry or her life may be in danger!

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,640
If all cases were men,

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,240
There is a request from Officer Chiba to Pops.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,340
A strange occurrence on a certain rainy night.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,940
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:47,321
"Rainy Night Blackmailer"

23
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,021
The fact is,

24
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:53,021
I have a woman that I see a lot at the coffee shop I frequent.

25
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,221
I got a call from her just a while ago asking for advice.

26
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:59,121
She says she feels that her life is in danger.

27
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:02,721
"I'll go see you after I get out of prison".

28
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:05,521
She says she receiving these types of letter several times a year.

29
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,721
Yes.

30
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:09,121
I'm so scared.

31
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:12,521
I changed my job and moved house too.

32
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,121
"Mio Ashida (23)" -But, recently I've been having this feeling

33
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:16,821
of being watched by someone.

34
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,521
I may just be imagining things but...

35
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,321
For the moment,

36
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:24,221
I told her to let me know immediately

37
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,821
if she sees the person or come up with any details.

38
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:29,921
But...

39
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:38,621
She left while I stood up to go the restroom.

40
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:44,521
She suddenly paid for the tab and left.

41
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:47,021
As if she were afraid of something.

42
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,021
Oh, no.

43
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,721
This is her umbrella.

44
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,521
She mistook hers for mine.

45
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:11,421
It felt more like intent to kill more than ill-doing.

46
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,121
Maybe the driver mistook me for her.

47
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,921
How careless of me.

48
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,721
I haven't asked her for her address yet.

49
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:23,221
I was thinking of talking this over with the Inspector too,

50
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,321
but I've got no concrete proof.

51
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,221
So I came here.

52
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,021
I don't really know if you can call this a case.

53
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,221
Besides, if you don't even know who she is,

54
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:34,121
how do you expect me to find her?

55
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,521
But, if you started seeing her a lot recently,

56
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:41,721
doesn't that mean she moved to somewhere near that coffee shop?

57
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:42,921
I see!

58
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:44,821
Then maybe it may be good to start looking for her,

59
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:48,021
expanding the range by first searching from where the coffee shop is.

60
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,521
I guess so.

61
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:53,721
Hey, hey. I don't have any intention of taking on this request...

62
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,121
Okay, I'll go, I'll go.

63
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,521
This criminal kind of pisses me off.

64
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,721
-Student who failed entrance exam... -Darn, the noise...

65
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,521
"Takuya Murakami" -The guys upstairs.

66
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:28,921
Don't! Somebody help me!

67
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:34,521
I was wondering if any incident happened?

68
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,621
What?

69
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,521
What seems to be the matter, Officer Chiba?

70
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:40,721
Yes, yes, I understand.

71
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,321
It seems that a young woman

72
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,621
became involved in a murder case in an apartment near here.

73
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,321
That car's from before.

74
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,321
What?

75
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,921
Too late?

76
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,921
Hey, wait, Chiba!

77
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,021
Move it!

78
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,821
-Chiba. -I thought it was your day off today.

79
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:07,321
She was killed, wasn't she?

80
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,421
Who is this man?

81
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,821
That cap and sunglasses.

82
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,821
From that time.

83
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,221
Mio?

84
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,021
She's not the victim?

85
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,621
She's the assaulter.

86
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,421
Inspector.

87
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,221
Mr. Mouri, what brings you here?

88
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:39,921
About that...

89
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:42,521
I see.

90
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:45,521
That's why you were looking for her?

91
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:46,521
Yes.

92
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,821
The car in the vacant lot was a stolen car after all.

93
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:50,921
I see.

94
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,321
What on earth happened?

95
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:57,321
Officer Takagi, explain the outline of the case for me, will you?

96
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,521
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:03,221
The incident occurred 40 minutes ago, at 9:30 pm.

98
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,021
Mr. Takuya Murakami, a student living right below the room,

99
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:10,921
hears a noise and scream and comes to check out his room,

100
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:15,221
where he finds the dead body and Mio Ashida standing next to it.

101
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:18,221
He then contacts the police using his cell phone.

102
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,221
At the time of discovery,

103
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:23,121
it seems that the entrance door was not locked.

104
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,321
The victim is Mr. Yoshizumi Karashima, age 28.

105
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,921
I confirmed that he got out of the prison for traffic offenders.

106
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:32,721
Prison for traffic offenders?

107
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,221
Was he imprisoned for a traffic accident?

108
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,221
That's right.

109
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,021
A year ago, a car went out of control

110
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,521
because the driver drove under the influence of alcohol.

111
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:42,821
The car crashes right through the guardrail and fell into the lake.

112
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,921
Out of the two who were thrown out of the window,

113
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:49,621
one died and one suffered only slight injury.

114
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,621
The driver who was charged for negligent driving

115
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,121
resulting in injury and death

116
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,921
was not indicted on terms of death of suspect.

117
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,521
The person that was riding in the same vehicle was charged

118
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:00,421
under the road traffic law for aiding and abetting drunk driving,

119
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,921
and served a 1 year sentence in prison.

120
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:06,321
That happened to be the victim of this incident, Mr. Karashima.

121
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,521
That's a lie!

122
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,921
My big brother, after being arrested for drunk driving in the past,

123
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,021
promised never to drive again.

124
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,421
Big brother?

125
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,921
Karashima was the one who was driving.

126
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:21,921
Mio.

127
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:25,021
The person who was driving and died

128
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,221
happened to be her older brother,

129
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:29,921
Mr. Toshiaki Ashida, age 28 back then.

130
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:33,021
I submitted a formal objection to Karashima's testimony

131
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:35,821
that my older brother was at the wheels at that time,

132
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,621
not being able to believe him.

133
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:41,521
But it was dismissed. And, yet...

134
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,721
A year in prison?

135
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,521
You must be joking.

136
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,621
It's because you guys submitted a objection!

137
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,321
You'll pay for this!

138
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,021
I won't let you get away with this!

139
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,221
It's a total spiteful counterattack!

140
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:59,221
Because he was sure he'd be getting a suspended sentence.

141
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,121
Mio, please give me your letters.

142
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,821
Yes, sir.

143
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,821
Are those letters that he wrote while he was in prison?

144
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,521
Each and every one of them mention

145
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:10,821
that he'll come to see her when he gets out.

146
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:12,621
Although it's not written all that clearly,

147
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,121
this is obviously blackmail.

148
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,921
It seems to be so.

149
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,921
It's true that it looks to be so, but...

150
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:22,421
"I'd like you to not forget me and wait for me..."

151
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:23,721
What could this mean?

152
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:29,321
Why is the date on this almost 6 months apart?

153
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,221
Maybe the rage that he once felt subsided for a while,

154
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,721
but with the coming of the end of his sentence,

155
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:35,921
his rage must've built up again?

156
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:39,621
Hey, keep out of this kid!

157
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,721
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:45,321
Mio, afraid that Karashima was soon coming out,

159
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:48,921
you changed jobs and moved to this apartment, right?

160
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,021
Yes.

161
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,221
I see.

162
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,221
You just moved, that's why you furniture

163
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:55,721
and electrical appliances are still new?

164
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,121
There are ones that you haven't used at all yet.

165
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,221
Come to think of it, that's true.

166
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,821
There are price tags on them too.

167
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,621
That's because all I did was come home and sleep.

168
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,421
At any rate, I was scared.

169
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,721
I would think so. I understand.

170
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,221
But, it doesn't look as if she's lived here at all.

171
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,421
The TV was being watched

172
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:21,521
although the remote controller didn't look to have been used.

173
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,621
I don't know how or where he found out,

174
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:28,421
but when you got home the lock was forced open.

175
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,721
When I came home,

176
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,521
the room light was on,

177
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,621
and they door was unlocked.

178
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,121
But, I didn't think I was being ambushed,

179
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,021
and when I opened the door, I was suddenly...

180
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,821
Ashida fought back with the umbrella she had.

181
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,421
They struggled and moved on to the living room.

182
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:01,621
The fatal wound was the blow to his head.

183
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:07,721
He also has a wound on his nose.

184
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:11,021
Maybe he hit it while struggling with her.

185
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,021
See.

186
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,821
The corner of the TV stand.

187
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,821
It seems definite that he bumped into this.

188
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,121
But...

189
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:22,621
It is very likely that this case is manslaughter in self-defense.

190
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,621
Not knowing that she had mistakenly taken my umbrella,

191
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:29,721
he could've also tried to hit-and-run me.

192
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,821
This is...

193
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:39,521
The victim's shoes.

194
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:43,021
Ran, what time did it start raining from?

195
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,021
I wonder...

196
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:47,421
It started at night, so maybe it was around 7:00 pm?

197
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,021
Which means...

198
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,921
Then, I guess we'll be on our way.

199
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:58,621
I'll get the details from you at the station.

200
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:59,921
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,221
Don't worry.

202
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,021
I'll back you up.

203
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,921
No need to worry.

204
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,521
Thank you very much.

205
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,821
Like I've been saying...

206
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,921
And like I told the detective too,

207
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:14,821
the sound of the TV was on all the while.

208
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,921
And, by the way, who are you?

209
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:20,221
I was asked by the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

210
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,621
who's upstairs now.

211
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:25,421
And, since when did you hear the sound of the TV from?

212
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,521
From around 6:00 pm.

213
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:31,121
But, it switched off about 9:30 pm, and that's when I heard the scream.

214
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,221
Although this place looks pretty fancy on first glance,

215
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,021
but it's a cheap apartment,

216
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,021
so sound proofing is the pits.

217
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:39,721
Did you hear any other sound beside that of the TV?

218
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,421
Come to think of it...

219
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:44,121
Darn, the noise...

220
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,521
The guy upstairs.

221
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:49,621
Don't!

222
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,121
I see.

223
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,521
Which means...

224
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,921
Just as I thought.

225
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:07,621
Then, the truth of this case is...

226
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:20,113
Go ahead.

227
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:24,213
Okay, I guess I'll go home and drink some beer...

228
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,613
What's that?

229
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,213
It... it's come again, Mr. Mouri.

230
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:32,513
Dad?

231
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:35,413
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that...

232
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,813
Officer Takagi,

233
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:39,013
I want you to check on something immediately.

234
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:40,413
Yes.

235
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:41,813
Inspector.

236
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,913
We have reached a conclusion yet.

237
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:50,613
Yes. Yes.

238
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,013
About when was this?

239
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:55,213
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

240
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:59,713
Inspector, this is not manslaughter in self defense

241
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,213
but undoubtedly a schemed homicide.

242
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:03,813
Schemed homicide?

243
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:06,413
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

244
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,613
Let me explain.

245
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:11,013
Please look at the umbrella stand at the front entrance.

246
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:13,113
There should be rain water inside it.

247
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:15,913
True.

248
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:17,913
The umbrellas that we brought,

249
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:21,413
are left outside in order to preserve the site.

250
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:25,213
If so, there should only be one umbrella in this room.

251
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,213
Yes, the umbrella that she had brought home

252
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,313
from the coffee shop by mistake.

253
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:31,313
Officer Chiba's umbrella.

254
00:14:31,313 --> 00:14:34,213
It's true but if so then what?

255
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:36,513
That means, the umbrella in the umbrella stand

256
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,113
should also be that umbrella.

257
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:39,613
If so,

258
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,213
her testimony that she was suddenly attacked

259
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,113
by the victim who forced opened the door

260
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,613
and broke into her room is inconsistent.

261
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:48,113
True.

262
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,313
She wouldn't have had the time

263
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:51,613
to put her umbrella into the umbrella stand.

264
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,213
There is still another inconsistency.

265
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,013
Despite the victim parking his car in the vacant lot

266
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:58,213
and coming over here,

267
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,813
his clothes are not wet at all.

268
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,913
It was because he used an umbrella.

269
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,613
But just a while ago, you said there were no other umbrellas.

270
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:07,713
In other words,

271
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:10,013
the victim came into this room

272
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:13,513
before it began to rain, which was about 7:00 pm.

273
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,813
Ridiculous.

274
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,413
I was almost hit-and-run only about 1 hour ago.

275
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:20,713
Right. The shoes.

276
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,413
Weren't the victim's shoes wet?

277
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,713
It's true that his shoes are wet.

278
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:27,213
However,

279
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:31,513
why aren't the socks and pants of the victim wet?

280
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,313
Well...

281
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:36,113
However, inside the possessions of the victim,

282
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:39,613
the cap and the sunglasses that the driver of the car was wearing were.

283
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:43,613
How can you conclusively say that they were the belongings of the victim?

284
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,213
There is another inconsistency.

285
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,513
The position of the seat of that car.

286
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:53,213
I had Conan confirm just a while ago,

287
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,013
that the position of the seat was a bit too close

288
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,613
to the steering wheel

289
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,513
for a big guy like the victim to be driving it.

290
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,713
Although everything till now is circumstantial evidence,

291
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:06,513
there is only one conclusion that we will arrive to...

292
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:08,913
That this case is not a case of self-defense,

293
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:12,313
but schemed homicide committed by Mio.

294
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:17,113
Mio.

295
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:22,313
Everything was schemed by Mio to begin with.

296
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:24,013
Let me explain it to you in order.

297
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:29,713
After placing a trace of the door having been picked,

298
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,213
Mio called Mr. Karashima by phone.

299
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:36,313
She tells him to wait for her inside because the door is unlocked.

300
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:38,013
Next she shows Officer Chiba

301
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:40,513
the letters she had received from Mr. Karashima.

302
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,113
And, shows him that she is afraid

303
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,213
because she is being threatened.

304
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,713
Then she deliberately takes Officer Chiba's umbrella and leaves the shop.

305
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:51,013
When Officer Chiba goes after her, she attacks him using her car,

306
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,613
in an attempt to leave an impression on him

307
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,913
that someone is coming after her life.

308
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:56,913
In the meantime,

309
00:16:56,913 --> 00:17:00,013
Mr. Karashima who gets to her room before it begins to rain,

310
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:03,813
and waits for her return watches TV.

311
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,513
And since he couldn't use the remote controller,

312
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,513
he manually turned the TV on.

313
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:10,913
Mio returns home at 9:30 pm.

314
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,813
Mr. Karashima turns off the TV he had been watching.

315
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,913
He kneels down and manually turns off the TV.

316
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:20,013
He is attacked from behind with a vase,

317
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:23,113
lurches forward and hits his nose on the TV stand

318
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:29,113
Mr. Murakami who lives on the first floor heard this noise.

319
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:31,913
After that Mio,

320
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:34,413
made Mr. Karashima's hand grab the knife,

321
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:38,613
then left the cap and sunglasses she used when she attacked Officer Chiba,

322
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:40,713
back in the room.

323
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:43,213
What about the scream that Mr. Murakami heard?

324
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:46,513
Of course Mio acted it out on her own.

325
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,513
This terrible sound proofing

326
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:51,513
is probably the very reason why she moved into this apartment.

327
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:53,313
However, all the other sounds

328
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,413
while the murder was being committed were heard too.

329
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:59,013
All of what you're saying is based on assumption, Mr. Mouri.

330
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:02,513
But, it is a fact that the victim was threatening Mio.

331
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,113
The vicious remarks in court and letters are proof of this.

332
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:07,013
Is it really so?

333
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:11,113
It's true what happened in court.

334
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:13,313
But, how about the letters?

335
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,813
In the letters that stopped coming for a while

336
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:18,313
and then started to come again, especially, his remark,

337
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:21,813
"I'll go see you after I get out of prison", and...

338
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:25,813
"I want to tell you the truth, so I'd like to see you,"

339
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,213
keeps coming out repeatedly.

340
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:31,113
Maybe he was planning to confess

341
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:33,713
that during the accident that happened a year ago,

342
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,713
"I was the one who was actually driving".

343
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,513
It... it can't be.

344
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:40,813
It's not easy to believe.

345
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:45,813
Then, why didn't he confess that it was so to the police or in court?

346
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,913
Maybe he thought he didn't have time?

347
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:51,313
Officer Takagi, where were you?

348
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:54,413
I had him go to the traffic violations prison to check out

349
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,713
why his letters stopped coming for a while because that bothered me.

350
00:18:57,713 --> 00:19:00,213
A while before his letters stopped,

351
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:03,013
Mr. Karashima was found to have a serious disease

352
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,913
after undergoing a medical examination within prison.

353
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,813
He was given six more months to live.

354
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,013
What?

355
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,013
However, he didn't show up at the hospital

356
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:16,713
he was told to go to after getting out either.

357
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:20,513
I think that he was probably looking for you

358
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:23,313
who quit your job and moved, Mio.

359
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:26,413
Which means he really meant to confess what he did?

360
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,313
That's a lie! I can't believe that!

361
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:31,313
Even if it were to be so, I would never forgive him.

362
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:34,713
No matter who forgives him, I would never!

363
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,113
Mio.

364
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:38,113
My big brother died in that manner

365
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:40,613
and my engagement was cancelled.

366
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,213
My father had no choice but to quit his job,

367
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,813
got depressed, fell ill and died.

368
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:49,413
My mother died soon after as if to go after him.

369
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:52,213
Nobody helped us.

370
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:55,213
Nobody believed my big brother's innocence.

371
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:56,613
That's why...

372
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,813
You took revenge, didn't you?

373
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:01,113
Yes, exactly.

374
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,813
Don't tell me that you're going to admit to your crime.

375
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:07,113
Yes. I hate to go over your head, Mr. famous detective,

376
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:09,413
who could only gather circumstantial evidence till now,

377
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,613
but I have no regrets.

378
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:15,013
No regrets what so ever!

379
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,413
Mio.

380
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:19,213
Then, I shall tell you not the circumstantial evidence

381
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,813
but the truth that I have come to...

382
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,513
If you learn of this truth,

383
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:30,113
you will realize that you have done is totally meaningless.

384
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,613
Rather, although there is no murder

385
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,813
that has any meaning in this world.

386
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:36,513
Just what do you mean?

387
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:39,713
Instead of me explaining it, let me re-enact it. Conan!

388
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:41,013
Yes.

389
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:43,613
You act as Mr. Karashima,

390
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:46,313
and you act out her, Officer Chiba.

391
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,713
Inspector Megure, will you turn on the TV?

392
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:52,613
Well Pitcher Maeda was fantastic today, wasn't he?

393
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:53,813
Then, Officer Chiba,

394
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:56,213
please fling up the murder weapon.

395
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,313
Like this?

396
00:20:57,313 --> 00:21:01,013
Mio, please stay as you are, and turn off the TV.

397
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,013
This is...

398
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:09,813
Mr. Karashima saw you,

399
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,213
but he didn't try to avoid you.

400
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,613
The only possible deduction

401
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,313
is that he knowingly fell into your vicious plans to kill him.

402
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:26,413
Right.

403
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,513
He was actually full of regret

404
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,613
from the bottom of his heart.

405
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,413
Even after hearing this,

406
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:35,213
do you still really not have any regrets?

407
00:22:56,713 --> 00:22:58,713
There's no doubt that through this incident,

408
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:03,413
there will be a reconsideration of the accident that occur a year ago.

409
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:06,713
However, the life that was taken will not come back,

410
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:09,313
nor will the crime that was committed be erased.

411
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:15,813
I couldn't do anything after all.

412
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:17,213
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,213
Don't get conceited.

414
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:22,913
I just took advantage of you

415
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:25,613
because the police doing nothing for me a year ago.

416
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:31,213
But, if I found you earlier and changed the umbrella,

417
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:32,613
it's highly likely

418
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,513
that you wouldn't have committed the crime at least tonight.

419
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:41,213
Either way, I don't deserve protection under your umbrella.

420
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,213
Mio.

421
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,213
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:47,913
Thank you.

423
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:54,113
This time it's her turn to compensate.

424
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:57,613
But, I'm sure that Officer Chiba's feelings got through to her.

425
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,213
Yeah, I'm sure.
