00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.240
Pops Kogoro who came back from the Pachinko Parlor,

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.540
learns that Attorney Kisaki had a surgery because of an acute illness.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.540
He rushes over immediately to the Haido Central Hospital.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.940
However, it turns out that Attorney Kisaki just had mere appendicitis.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.740
Therefore, Pops and I leave the room and...

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.340
Aren't you Mr. Mouri?

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.240
What are you doing in a place like this?

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.840
Bourbon?

9
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.940
Are you ill?

10
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.440
Well... My wife, you see...

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.540
Why?

12
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.640
Why is a member of the Black Organization here at Haido Central Hospital?

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.040
Don't tell me that... It can't be...

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.540
Don't tell me that...

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.440
What brings you here?

16
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.240
I heard that an acquaintance of mine was hospitalized so I came to visit

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.440
but I guess I didn't make it in time.

18
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.540
The nurses mentioned that you've been here before, Conan.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.940
Do you happen to know?

20
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.040
A man called Rikumichi Kusuda?

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.540
Who's that?

22
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.140
No.

23
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.040
You're really something.

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.740
Most people are not really sure whether they remember something correctly.

25
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.040
That's why before they say no,

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.240
they want to know other information

27
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.640
besides the name of the person that is being sought.

28
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.240
That's why you're really something, Conan!

29
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.440
You were confident you didn't know that person just by hearing his name.

30
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.940
Don't take what a kid says seriously.

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.240
There are millions of people you've met

32
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.740
but don't know their names.

33
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.040
There are also those that you only know

34
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.440
-by their nicknames too. -Three! Two! One!

35
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.940
Zero!

36
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.740
What's wrong?

37
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.340
Oh, no.

38
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340
My nickname's also Zero,

39
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.740
so I thought somebody called me.

40
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.440
Why Zero? Your name's Tohru, right?

41
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.540
Tohru in Japanese means transparent, in other words, nil.

42
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.140
Therefore, Zero.

43
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.440
That's how children tend to make nicknames after all.

44
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.840
This picture's so nostalgic.

45
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.740
It was taken during the school festival.

46
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.340
Do you keep all your old photos in your cell phone?

47
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.940
Only the ones that I like.

48
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.140
Wasn't it during this school festival?

49
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.540
That you got it made with Sosaki, Reina?

50
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.140
You're really a lucky person, Reina.

51
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.040
I don't think so!

52
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.440
"Reina Sato (42)" -The other day I was almost about to lose

53
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.840
a large sum of stocks!

54
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.240
My hubby's a mere nouveau riche!

55
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.940
When my son had to take an exam,

56
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.340
I thought he had a cold but he ended up with influenza.

57
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.940
If I didn't realize soon enough, it could've been a tragedy!

58
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.040
My life's like walking on tight rope.

59
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.740
One mistake and I would've been in the pits.

60
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.740
The scream came from this room, right?

61
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.040
Yes.

62
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.540
Is something wrong?

63
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.340
-Reina? -Reina!

64
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.840
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

65
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

66
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.640
Herb tea smeared with revenge!

67
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.840
Solving the case with Amuro from zero.

68
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.340
His name is Detective Conan!

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:39.711
"An Awkward Tea Party (Part 2)"

72
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:42.611
"Haido Central Hospital"

73
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:43.811
Inspector Megure!

74
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.011
We've finished investigating the hospital room

75
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:53.411
but we couldn't find any bag or container with poison inside.

76
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:54.911
I see.

77
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:59.411
So it's likely that the perpetrator took it out and disposed it.

78
00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:02.211
And no poison was detected from the herb tea

79
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.611
that was spilled on the floor.

80
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:05.611
What?

81
00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:07.911
Then, how was the poison inserted?

82
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.311
Well... The poison was actually laced...

83
00:06:11.311 --> 00:06:13.611
Are you talking about the teacup?

84
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:14.911
Hey!

85
00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:17.011
Just what do you think you're doing?

86
00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:19.711
I looked all over the hospital for you!

87
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:21.811
Ran...

88
00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:25.211
I told you not go wandering off by yourself, didn't I?

89
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:27.011
But...

90
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.111
I told you not to, didn't I?

91
00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:35.611
I told you not to fight anymore, didn't I?

92
00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:37.411
But...

93
00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:41.111
I can't treat you next time even if you get hurt, you know.

94
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:45.211
Because I'll have to move far away.

95
00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:51.711
It's bye-bye time, Rei...

96
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:55.411
Hey... Are you all right?

97
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:57.711
Hey!

98
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.411
What's up?

99
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:00.911
Mr. Mouri...

100
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:05.211
Even one as great as you cannot solve this murder by poison case?

101
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.811
You haven't solved it either, have you, Mr. Mouri?

102
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:10.511
If so, I wouldn't be able to solve it either!

103
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:12.311
I guess so.

104
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:16.211
Come on! We're going home!

105
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:19.511
But the case hasn't been...

106
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:21.311
The case...

107
00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:25.011
I heard the siren of a police car a while ago...

108
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.911
Don't tell me that something happened at this hospital?

109
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:32.111
Yes. A woman drank poison and died.

110
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:34.911
So Inspector Megure, Officer Takagi and even Pops Kogoro

111
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.711
are all racking their brains trying to figure it out!

112
00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:39.811
But, Conan.

113
00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:41.711
Look out the window.

114
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.911
The blue sky's turned crimson red, right?

115
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:47.211
So, it's time for children to go home.

116
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.111
The blue sky...

117
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:55.011
turned red?

118
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:57.611
Red...

119
00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:03.111
I see. That's what it was!

120
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:08.311
So, leave the case up to Dad and the police...

121
00:08:08.311 --> 00:08:10.211
Hey...

122
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:11.611
Conan?

123
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:15.111
The mystery's been solved!

124
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:17.911
The perpetrator is her after all.

125
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.011
And the way she did it was...

126
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.411
You've of course got it solved too, right?

127
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.511
Zero!

128
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.011
The rim of the teacup?

129
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:38.511
Poison was laced there?

130
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:43.011
Yes, just where there was lipstick on.

131
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:46.311
It was rigged so that the victim Ms. Reina Suto

132
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:50.011
would bring her mouth to it and drink the poison in.

133
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:55.111
No poison was detected from the herb tea inside the cup.

134
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:57.311
"Kazuki Beppu (41)" -So, are you saying that one of us

135
00:08:57.311 --> 00:09:00.911
laced the cup with poison just before she drank from it?

136
00:09:00.911 --> 00:09:02.211
"Tokie Happo (42)" -I'm sure someone would've noticed

137
00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:04.611
if something like that were done.

138
00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:07.611
"Juri Kosaka (42)" -There was no one like that.

139
00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:11.011
Amuro said just a while ago, didn't he?

140
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.011
The poison wasn't laced directly on the cup

141
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.011
but rather, the poison was laced on the perpetrator's cup

142
00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:16.611
and then switched it.

143
00:09:16.611 --> 00:09:19.411
I'm saying that's not possible, aren't I?

144
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:23.111
I was drinking yellow Chamomile.

145
00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:28.711
Mine was a herb tea called Peppermint of brown color.

146
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:34.211
Mine was a blue herb tea called Butterfly Pea.

147
00:09:34.211 --> 00:09:36.911
If I were to switch my cup with Ms. Suto's

148
00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:39.811
who was drinking a red colored Hibiscus tea,

149
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:42.411
I think everyone would've noticed right away.

150
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:46.711
But, only the victim used lemon in her tea, right?

151
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.411
If vision was limited,

152
00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:50.211
even if the color were to be a bit different.

153
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:52.211
You're absolutely wrong!

154
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:53.911
I guess that a middle aged man

155
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.211
who knows nothing about herb tea like you wouldn't know!

156
00:09:57.411 --> 00:09:59.311
Well...

157
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:02.711
At any rate, it's a clear fact that the perpetrator laced the cup

158
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:06.411
with poison and killed Ms. Suto!

159
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:09.111
However, the fact that no bag

160
00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:11.411
or container with the poison inside was found anywhere

161
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.111
in this hospital room means...

162
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:17.611
either one of you Ms. Beppu or Ms. Happo,

163
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.711
who left this room alternately,

164
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:25.611
is most probably the perpetrator.

165
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:26.911
I see...

166
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:28.911
After lacing the cup with poison,

167
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:31.611
they got rid of the container with the poison inside

168
00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:33.711
by taking it out of the room.

169
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:34.911
Yeah...

170
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:38.411
Wait a minute! I just went to the restroom!

171
00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:41.911
I went to the convenience store to buy sweets to go with the tea.

172
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:44.211
I have the receipt too.

173
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.811
Well, if we check the pipe of the toilet

174
00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:49.111
or the road to the convenience store,

175
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:51.611
I'm sure we'll find something.

176
00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:54.411
But, the perpetrator sure has guts. Don't you think so?

177
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:57.311
Hey, Conan.

178
00:10:57.311 --> 00:11:00.011
Because if I were to lace the cup with poison,

179
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:02.011
I would never leave the room!

180
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:03.411
Because somebody may wipe my cup

181
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:05.811
while I'm gone or the position of the cups,

182
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:09.211
or the type of tea I wanted to drink may be changed.

183
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.611
Making it impossible to figure out which cup the poison is laced on,

184
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:13.811
bringing upon a conclusion that's not called for!

185
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:15.011
True.

186
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:18.411
Then, when and how did the perpetrator lace the poison?

187
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:23.011
And where is the container that the poison was in?

188
00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:28.211
We've got no choice but to thoroughly check this hospital room again.

189
00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:31.111
There's no need to do that!

190
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.311
Because there's one person left!

191
00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:36.011
Who could've laced the poison onto the cup openly

192
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:39.011
without pulling away from the cup at all.

193
00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:40.611
Right?

194
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:42.011
Zero?

195
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:44.111
Zero?

196
00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:50.311
Amuro says that he was called Zero when he was a child.

197
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:52.811
And? How about it?

198
00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:54.811
Do you follow?

199
00:11:54.811 --> 00:11:56.311
Yes...

200
00:11:56.311 --> 00:11:58.111
Thanks to Conan's hint just now.

201
00:11:58.111 --> 00:11:59.611
Somewhat...

202
00:11:59.611 --> 00:12:02.711
That person could lace the poison

203
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.111
as well as dispose of the container of the poison beforehand,

204
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:09.811
without leaving this hospital room at all during the time of the crime,

205
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:12.011
and wait scrupulously for a chance

206
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:18.011
to switch her cup with that of the victim's.

207
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:21.411
The only one who could've done this is you.

208
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.530
That person could lace the poison

209
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.830
as well as dispose of the container of the poison beforehand,

210
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.530
without leaving this hospital room at all during the time of the crime,

211
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.630
and wait scrupulously for a chance

212
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:53.530
to switch her cup with that of the victim's.

213
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.030
The only one who could've done this is you.

214
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.530
Mrs. Juri Kosaka!

215
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.030
Wait up, will you!

216
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.330
You say she laced her own cup with poison to begin with?

217
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.230
Juri was drinking herb tea with that cup right through, you know?

218
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.230
Did you forget?

219
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.730
The poison was laced on the side

220
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.830
when she drank holding the cup in her left hand.

221
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.630
If she were careful not to pick the cup up with her left hand,

222
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.330
she would never drink the poison that was laced.

223
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.130
Then since when was the poison there?

224
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.030
She probably brought the poison with her

225
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.630
even before she was hospitalized.

226
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.830
Today, before the victim came to visit her here,

227
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.430
she probably laced the cup with poison

228
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.130
and disposed of the container somewhere outside the room.

229
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.230
Isn't that right?

230
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.130
Aren't you the one who'd forgotten?

231
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.730
Juri was drinking blue herb tea

232
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.430
and Reina was drinking red herb tea.

233
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.430
No matter if the lemon was afloat in her tea,

234
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.530
she would never have picked up the wrong cup!

235
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.530
Right.

236
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.230
That lemon is the key to this trick.

237
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.430
The key?

238
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.130
Yes. The fact is...

239
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.530
What? It's really blue!

240
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.830
This Butterfly Pea is a strange tea.

241
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.330
Hey!

242
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.430
Don't go touching the personal effects at the crime site on your own again!

243
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.230
This is hot water that I got from the hospital a while ago!

244
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.930
This lemon too!

245
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.630
You brat! That's enough!

246
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.630
It's strange!

247
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.430
This tea was blue and yet after I put the lemon inside,

248
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.630
it's starting to get redder and redder!

249
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.230
-Are you serious? -This is something.

250
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.930
It's like a science experiment!

251
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.230
The color changed because the tea reacted to the acid of the lemon.

252
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.430
There are other herb teas that react likewise.

253
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.930
Are you referring to Blue Mallow?

254
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.730
If I remember correctly, if you put lemon inside,

255
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.330
it changes from light blue to pink.

256
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.830
Yes.

257
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.630
Naturally, if it gets red with acidity.

258
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.330
The thing that Ms. Kosaka used to polish the cups...

259
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.430
If this alkaline baking soda...

260
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.730
were added.

261
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.830
The color would return back to blue again!

262
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.430
In other words, this is how Ms. Kosaka committed the crime.

263
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.130
First, after finding out that Ms. Suto and the others

264
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.230
were coming to visit you,

265
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.430
you asked only Ms. Suto to come a bit earlier than the others.

266
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.930
You asked her to go get hot water for the tea party,

267
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.030
and while she was doing so,

268
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.530
you laced the poison, that you brought when you were hospitalized,

269
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.630
on the opposite side of the rim of the cup that you'd be drinking from

270
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.530
and disposed of the container somewhere outside your room.

271
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.230
After all three woman arrived,

272
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.230
you suggested to compare drinking various kinds of teas,

273
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.130
and waited for Ms. Suto to select Hibiscus tea.

274
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.230
Why?

275
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.530
Because the color of Hibiscus tea is a red with a tinge of purple.

276
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.230
It looks a lot like the color of Butterfly Pea

277
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.830
after lemon is inserted into it.

278
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.830
Just as you wished,

279
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.930
Ms. Suto selected the tea you wanted her to select.

280
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.130
Therefore, you put a Hibiscus teabag,

281
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.230
which contents had been switched beforehand to Butterfly Pea,

282
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.730
then put lemon on top of it and poured hot water into the cup.

283
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.930
As a result you got to serve Ms. Suto red Butterfly Pea

284
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.430
that looked exactly like Hibiscus tea.

285
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.230
I see.

286
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.530
So, how did she switch it?

287
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.530
She did it when Ms. Suto and the others were absorbed

288
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.030
at looking at the pictures in her cell phone.

289
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.230
First of all, into her cup laced with poison,

290
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.030
she put lemon into her blue Butterfly Pea

291
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.030
to change the color to red.

292
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.730
Then she placed Ms. Suto's cup down pushing it forward.

293
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.130
She makes it look as if she was picking up her own cup

294
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.930
when she was actually picking up Ms. Suto's,

295
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.530
then took the lemon out of that cup and put baking soda into it,

296
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.730
returning it to blue.

297
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.930
After that, you pushed the cup that was laced with poison down

298
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.930
and pushed it a bit forward in the same way,

299
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.030
and the handle of the poison laced cup

300
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.230
was on the left side when viewed from Ms. Suto.

301
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.130
You did this to lure her to pick up the poison laced cup

302
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.630
while she was absorbed in looking at the pictures.

303
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.230
Am I wrong somewhere?

304
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.130
You talk like you've been watching or something,

305
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.130
but where on earth do you have such proof?

306
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.930
The ring on your left hand is red, Miss!

307
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.230
Did you get hurt or something?

308
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.330
Oh, no. This is...

309
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.730
There was one other thing the perpetrator

310
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.630
had to erase from the scene of the crime.

311
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.030
That is the lipstick that got on the cup

312
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.630
when Ms. Suto first drank her tea.

313
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.730
Because it would be unnatural if lipstick were to be found on Ms. Kosaka

314
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.130
who is a patient in the hospital.

315
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.530
You probably tried to wipe it off impulsively with your fingers

316
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:05.230
but lipstick is hard to remove unless you use soap or something.

317
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.830
In other words...

318
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.930
If the red color matches that of Ms. Suto's lipstick,

319
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.130
it would serve as evidence.

320
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.030
Well, if Ms. Suto's cup that was switched is checked,

321
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.530
that would serve as proof too.

322
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.230
Because there should be a lot of baking soda inside it.

323
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.230
Then how did she put in the baking soda?

324
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.930
She probably laced the cubes of sugar

325
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.230
that were on the table with baking soda

326
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.030
and hid them at the bottom of the container.

327
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.930
Putting sugar cubes inside herb tea doesn't call for suspicion.

328
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.330
But...

329
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.530
I don't think Juri has any motive to kill Reina, though?

330
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.830
If Juri were to have a grudge against Reina,

331
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.530
it would only be about her son failing to take the entrance test.

332
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.230
That's not something to kill a person over.

333
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.230
It's not only my son

334
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.630
who fell ill from catching her son's influenza back then.

335
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.330
You did too?

336
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.730
Yes.

337
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.930
Back then...

338
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.730
I was pregnant.

339
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.330
I was told by the doctor that catching influenza

340
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.730
may have bad affects on the fetus.

341
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.530
I had a nervous breakdown

342
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.030
and as a result...

343
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.230
I had a miscarriage.

344
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.030
Of course at first I thought I was just a bit careless,

345
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.230
or unlucky but...

346
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.930
After I heard what Mrs. Suto's son said

347
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.430
on the day that he came to visit later.

348
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.630
What's the matter, Tsuneo?

349
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.130
Please give Toji my apologies.

350
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.130
Don't worry about it.

351
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.430
You thought it was just a cold too, didn't you?

352
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.930
No. I knew it was influenza.

353
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.930
I was already getting better, but...

354
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.630
Mom told me to go over and study,

355
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.630
because it's the last day to study,

356
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.930
and by doing so I can get rid of one of my rivals,

357
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.330
it would really be a lucky thing.

358
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.230
Please don't tell Mom that I told you this!

359
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.630
Horrible.

360
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.230
But that's something Reina would do.

361
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.430
I'm just as horrible.

362
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.830
I tried to get you all suspected

363
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.630
and frame you up as being the perpetrator.

364
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.430
But, too bad.

365
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.230
Butterfly Pea also had detoxification properties.

366
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.830
That's why I chose it.

367
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.530
I thought that maybe it would help me digest

368
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.830
the black murderous fury that existed in me

369
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.430
before I committed the crime, but...

370
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.230
But poisoning someone who comes to visit you in the hospital.

371
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.330
To be honest, maybe this hospital is cursed.

372
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.630
Many things seem to have happened in the past too, you see.

373
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.830
Many things?

374
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.830
There was rumor going round that an announcer named Rena Mizunashi

375
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.330
was hospitalized here.

376
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.430
Then wounded people avalanched in causing chaos.

377
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.530
I also heard that there was a bombing commotion here too.

378
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.230
Officer Takagi!

379
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.330
Don't you have to return to MPD already?

380
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.930
Oh, no! I wasn't supposed to be wasting my time here!

381
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:52.730
Then, you don't know of a man called Rikumichi Kusuda, do you?

382
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.730
Rikumichi Kusuda?

383
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.630
Now that you mentioned it,

384
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.330
a few days before the bombing incident that I just mentioned,

385
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.230
a damaged vehicle was found near here,

386
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.030
and the owner of that vehicle was a man called Rikumichi Kusuda!

387
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.830
It seems that he was a patient of this hospital

388
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.930
but he suddenly vanished.

389
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.030
It was a case full of mysteries.

390
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.130
Inside that damaged vehicle

391
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.930
a great amount of splattered blood was found all over the vehicle.

392
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.430
Some of the blood stains were less than a millimeter across.

393
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.330
-According to forensics... -Blood stains less than a millimeter across

394
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.330
from high speed shooting.

395
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.930
A pistol?

396
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.130
See you!

397
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.430
"Next Episode"

398
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.930
You ended up suddenly coming today, didn't you, Ran?

399
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.830
Oh, I got it!

400
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.330
You're on a date with your boyfriend!

401
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.630
It's nothing like that.

402
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.230
Come to think of it, she was waiting here back then too.

403
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.630
You're late.

404
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.830
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

405
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.530
A lot of things came up, you see!

406
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.530
So, it was you after all.

407
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.530
Shinichi Kudo.

408
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:21.930
Next Conan, "Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 1)"

409
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.530
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.930
"Cell phone"

411
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.430
Ran, the next episode is something to look forward to, no?

412
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.130
But, it's just a memory though.

413
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.830
I'm happy about it.
