1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,040
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,440
No one knows what will happen to the couple nor the outcome of the crime.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,740
Words are not necessary for feelings are conveyed.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,199
While exploring a limestone cave,

9
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,699
I am shot by a gang of bank robbers.

10
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:01,799
Ran's blood is used for my transfusion and it saved my life.

11
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,299
This makes me decide to tell Ran about everything.

12
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,799
But then Haibara points a gun at me.

13
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,499
Later at Teitan High School

14
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,199
on the day of their school festival,

15
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,699
during the play in the gymnasium,

16
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,799
a murder is committed right among the audience.

17
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:26,399
Haibara mixes up a potion that restores me to my old body,

18
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,699
and I solve the case immediately.

19
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,299
Thankfully Ran's suspicions are dispelled.

20
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,299
The next day I ask Ran to have dinner with me

21
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,299
at the roof top restaurant in the Beika Center Building.

22
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:45,099
But once again, we were caught up in another murder case.

23
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,999
I leave Ran waiting

24
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,099
as I go off to investigate.

25
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,399
I quickly deduce who the killer is.

26
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,599
I was right.

27
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,899
He killed Mr. Tatsumi after all.

28
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,899
It was Mr. Oba, no doubt about it!

29
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:13,099
"Perilous Return: Place Where Vows Are Made"

30
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,599
I wonder what it is.

31
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,399
What does Shinichi want to tell me?

32
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,899
What could it be?

33
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,299
A proposal, he's going to propose!

34
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,099
What?

35
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,599
I don't believe it, it can't be.

36
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,099
I mean, we're still in high school.

37
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,399
I wish Shinichi would hurry and come back.

38
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,499
I'm absolutely sure Mr. Oba shot Mr. Tatsumi,

39
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,699
but I have two unanswered questions.

40
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,399
I can't explain the strange actions Mr. Tatsumi took in the elevator,

41
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,999
and the lack of powder burns.

42
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,699
Seeing how confident he acted,

43
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,499
I'm sure he did something

44
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,199
so we wouldn't find any powder burns on him.

45
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,799
I know, maybe that's how he did it.

46
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,199
Mr. Oba was wearing an animal costume at the party, wasn't he?

47
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,699
Oh, that's right.

48
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,499
He could have changed his clothes!

49
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:24,499
Are you sure about that?

50
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:25,799
Yes.

51
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,099
Tonight's party was in part,

52
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,899
to celebrate the unveiling of our new company mascot,

53
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,999
and the character was on stage all night.

54
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,199
We were shocked when we found out Mr Oba was inside it!

55
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,799
We really were.

56
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,199
I see.

57
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,999
So if he had another set of the same outfit,

58
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,899
he could have switched it with the one

59
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,699
with the powder burns on them.

60
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,099
But he couldn't have.

61
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:50,299
Before he change into his costume,

62
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:54,099
Mr. Ooba handed us his jacket and slacks.

63
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,299
But...

64
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:57,099
He is suspicious, isn't he?

65
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,799
You shouldn't talk like that.

66
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,299
He worked really hard to make us laugh.

67
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,699
Are you talking about that character winking?

68
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,299
Sure, it was funny at first.

69
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:08,699
But that's the only thing he did.

70
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,599
So after a while, it got pretty stale.

71
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,999
Excuse me.

72
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:15,399
If you don't mind, may I take a look at that costume?

73
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,699
So, this is it.

74
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,199
The design's very surreal, isn't it?

75
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,399
Isn't it adorable?

76
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,899
Who was in charge of the party?

77
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,199
Mr. Ooba.

78
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,599
I've got it.

79
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,599
So that's how he did it.

80
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,199
So did you figure it out?

81
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,999
Yes, most of it.

82
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,099
Isn't it getting hot in here?

83
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,799
You must be kidding.

84
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:45,699
It's freezing, the cooler's on so high.

85
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:48,299
Huh? Then, why am I perspiring so much?

86
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,799
This can't be happening.

87
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,999
I don't believe it.

88
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:06,399
No, not now.

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,999
Not here...

90
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,999
Not on this important day.

91
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,799
Darn it.

92
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,399
Hey, are you all right?

93
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,499
Kudo?

94
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:20,899
Inspector Megure.

95
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,899
We found no traces of powder on Mr. Ooba.

96
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,199
I see.

97
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,899
Then, was it a hold up after all?

98
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:29,899
All right, then.

99
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,999
Let's ask around if anyone suspicious was seen going in

100
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,199
or out this building while the party was in progress.

101
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,599
-Yes, sir. -Wait.

102
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,099
There's no need for that.

103
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,699
The killer is already among us.

104
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,299
So, shall we step up to the stage, where the truth awaits us?

105
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,099
Hey! What's the meaning of this?

106
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,199
You already checked me out.

107
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,599
They didn't find anything!

108
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,099
So, why're you treating me Iike I'm the killer?

109
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,499
Now, just calm down.

110
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:06,499
You tell them that I couldn't have done it.

111
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:09,399
Yes, I'll swear to it.

112
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,499
Mr. Ooba was with me the whole time!

113
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,399
Naturally, I wasn't with him when he changed into his costume,

114
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,399
but the dressing room was locked.

115
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,299
Besides, there were other people with him,

116
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,199
so he couldn't have slipped out

117
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,299
or switched places with someone else.

118
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:26,299
Or are you implying that I'm lying?

119
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:29,899
No, we don't suspect you of anything.

120
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,299
You believe you were with Mr. Ooba through it all.

121
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:39,299
Even while the murder was taking place.

122
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,999
Wait a second.

123
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:45,099
Are you saying I helped a him kill my father?

124
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,599
No, I'm saying that the murder took place near you.

125
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,299
It's just that you didn't notice it.

126
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:54,399
Because at the time it happened, you had your eyes closed

127
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,599
and your back was facing the elevator

128
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,099
because you were kissing Mr. Ooba.

129
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,199
They were kissing?

130
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,699
Kissing? You mean...

131
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,999
That's right.

132
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,499
He cradled your head in his left arm like this,

133
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:11,999
covering your ears

134
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,799
and while he was kissing you,

135
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,799
he pushed the elevator call button.

136
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,499
And as soon as the door opened,

137
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,199
your father was shot

138
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,399
by Mr. Ooba.

139
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,099
But even if he covered her ears

140
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,699
and used a silencer on the gun,

141
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,199
wouldn't she have heard something

142
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,799
when the body fell to the ground?

143
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,099
Yes, believe she would have heard a faint sound.

144
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:46,199
That's why Mr. Ooba had the poppers go off just before the party.

145
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:47,299
When he moved his arm away from her ears,

146
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,699
just as the loud party poppers were going off,

147
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:53,199
the poppers would have made her forget

148
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,599
about the faint sound she had heard previously.

149
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,099
Of course, he would have made sure the elevator door closed

150
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:04,399
before he lowered his arm.

151
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,499
That's a very interesting story.

152
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:12,399
But there's one big hole in your theory.

153
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,799
Mr. Tatsumi left because he wasn't feeling well,

154
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,099
so he got into the elevator going down.

155
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,199
So, why was he still inside?

156
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,599
You aren't saying that

157
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:27,299
he was waiting inside for me to kill him, are you?

158
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,499
That's exactly what happened.

159
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:34,199
He never left, he was waiting inside all the time.

160
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,299
Waiting for you to come while wearing your costume.

161
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:42,099
You probably told him

162
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:45,199
to pretend you've gone home and change in here,

163
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,599
then you can return to the party and surprise everyone.

164
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,299
Isn't that right?

165
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,799
So what you're saying is,

166
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,499
the victim's clothes were scattered because...

167
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:58,399
Yes, he was getting ready to change.

168
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,799
Now, I understand.

169
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,999
The elevator's bell won't ring when the elevator is on hold.

170
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,399
On top of that, this is the company's private elevator.

171
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,499
Mr. Ooba planned this knowing no one would use it

172
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,299
until the party ended.

173
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,199
What about the powder burns?

174
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,499
If I was the killer, you would have found traces of it on me.

175
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:23,999
I understand that you winked.

176
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,399
I beg your pardon?

177
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,699
One of the girls told us

178
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,699
that while you were in the costume, you kept winking.

179
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,999
That made a light go off in my head.

180
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,499
You weren't winking to make them laugh.

181
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:40,499
You hid something inside the eye.

182
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,699
That's why it wasn't working properly, isn't that so?

183
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,499
You already wore gloves on your right hand

184
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:48,699
and you put a plastic bag over the gun,

185
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,299
closing it with rubber bands.

186
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,199
Then you put it in the inside pocket of your jacket,

187
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,899
making it portable

188
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,999
and when the gun is fired,

189
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:01,399
the powder wouldn't get onto your clothes

190
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,699
and the empty casings wouldn't fall on the floor.

191
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,299
But she was close to him,

192
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,499
wouldn't she have noticed him taking the gun out?

193
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,399
Of course, it would have been obvious if things were like it is now.

194
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,099
Please turn off the lights.

195
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:19,299
If the lights were dim like this,

196
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,499
the risk becomes far less.

197
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,999
And if he gives her a necklace while they were here,

198
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,899
she'll lead him to the restroom where she'll put the it on,

199
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,799
then he can toss the gun down the dust chute near the restroom

200
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,099
without leaving her side.

201
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:38,099
When Mr. Ooba covered her ears and touched her earring,

202
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,599
his left hand wasn't gloved.

203
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,899
That means we should find some very nice prints

204
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,399
from your fingers on this plastic bag.

205
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:53,199
My fingerprints on the plastic bag?

206
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,999
Of course, they would be.

207
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:59,699
I touched that plastic bag too, you know.

208
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:03,699
Along with the other people who helped me out of the costume.

209
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,799
What?

210
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,699
What does that mean?

211
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:11,099
-Isn't that right, guys? -He's right.

212
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,199
One of eyes wouldn't close,

213
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,799
so I opened it up and that bag was inside.

214
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,099
Mr. Ooba said it might be some important part of the costume,

215
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,499
so we should leave it inside.

216
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,999
This is my theory.

217
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,399
Someone who held a grudge against me

218
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,799
went down to the next floor and shot Mr. Tatsumi

219
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,299
while Ms. Sakurako and I were at the restroom.

220
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,999
And then to frame me for it,

221
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,699
the killer put that inside the costume.

222
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,299
It would have been easy

223
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:41,299
since the costume was in the dressing room until I put it on.

224
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,199
I think my theory sounds more realistic than your accusation

225
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,499
that I shot him while engaged in a kiss is absolutely silly.

226
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,199
Hey, Kudo...

227
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,499
So, fresh out of school detective, what's next?

228
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,499
You don't seem so cocky now.

229
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,899
What's the matter, run out of ideas?

230
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,999
Well, it doesn't matter. Because for every one of your questions,

231
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:08,099
I have a reasonable answer.

232
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,688
So, fresh out of school detective, what's next?

233
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:30,688
You don't seem so cocky now.

234
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,788
What's the matter, run out of ideas?

235
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,088
Pink pearl.

236
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:50,688
Mr. Ooba, when you gave her the necklace,

237
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,588
you said this to her, didn't you?

238
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:54,588
"It's a pink pearl necklace

239
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:57,188
matching with the earrings you're wearing tonight."

240
00:13:57,188 --> 00:14:00,288
Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?

241
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,588
How did you know that?

242
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,488
How did you know she had pink pearl earrings on?

243
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:09,288
You're really grasping for straws, aren't you?

244
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:12,188
Well, it's obvious that...

245
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,088
She told me

246
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:25,488
that she bought those tonight on the spur of the moment

247
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:28,088
just before meeting you here tonight.

248
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:33,588
Which means, you couldn't have seen them until you saw her here.

249
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:36,888
And in this spot with the lights down so low,

250
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:40,288
those pink pearls look like mere dark balls.

251
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:44,488
There's no way you could tell that it was pink.

252
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:48,588
That's right. Not unless...

253
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,188
you opened this door of light

254
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:56,188
while you were kissing her.

255
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,188
Mr. Ooba, you couldn't have...

256
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,888
Mr. Ooba, why don't you answer me?

257
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:12,288
Tell us why you opened the door.

258
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,988
You're asking me why?

259
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:19,188
The answer is simple.

260
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,988
Because I made a promise to my father.

261
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,388
That I would avenge his death.

262
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:33,388
Avenge your father's death?

263
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:39,088
Yes. My father also had a rather big game company.

264
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,588
That was until 20 years ago

265
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:44,088
when her father suggested their companies merge.

266
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:49,088
He suggested they open an office in the Beika Center Building.

267
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:54,288
But he wasn't planning a merger, he was planning a take over.

268
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:58,188
All the game creating know-how my father constructed was stolen

269
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:03,188
and all the employees in my father's company were laid off.

270
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,888
And my father...

271
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:07,088
who was vice president in name only,

272
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:09,588
was so full of despair, so he killed himself.

273
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:12,488
But papa took such good care of you.

274
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:16,788
Yes. I think it was because he felt guilty.

275
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:19,788
That's why he kept promoting me.

276
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:23,488
Me, the man who planned to kill him,

277
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:27,888
marry his daughter and take over the company.

278
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,988
No way...

279
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,088
It was all a game.

280
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,488
The story line was the hero uses the powers of evil

281
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:39,088
to overthrow the demon.

282
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:43,088
But who would have thought it would end the same way.

283
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,288
What do you mean by that?

284
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:49,188
My father was murdered, but it was made to look like a suicide.

285
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,488
He was killed 20 years ago,

286
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:54,788
right here in this very building by Mr. Tatsumi.

287
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,788
But someone saw through the crime.

288
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,388
It was a young man like you,

289
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:03,088
he figured it out just like you did tonight.

290
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,388
I guess when you borrow the powers of evil,

291
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:06,788
you have to pay the price.

292
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:09,288
Yes, that's it! I remember it now!

293
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:11,288
It was Yusaku!

294
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,788
Yusaku Kudo butted in when we were investigating the case

295
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:17,388
and he solved it for us!

296
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:21,188
Oh, you're talking about that mystery writer.

297
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:25,188
Which means the son solved the crime which arose

298
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:29,088
from the crime committed 20 years ago which the father solved.

299
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:32,088
Isn't that ironic? Don't you think, Kudo?

300
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,688
Kudo?

301
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:44,888
Please. I need a little more time.

302
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:47,788
She... she's waiting for me.

303
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:53,188
I can't turn into Conan again now.

304
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:58,688
Haibara?

305
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,488
You...

306
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:01,988
why...

307
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:06,788
24 minutes over time.

308
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:09,588
I guess that's the maximum tolerance level.

309
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,388
I'll consider this a loan.

310
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,588
Edogawa.

311
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:20,488
Hey, did you hear? The murder's been solved.

312
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,988
Is that true?

313
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:24,288
You're finally going to get to see him, aren't you?

314
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:25,788
I mean, your boyfriend.

315
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:28,488
For goodness sakes. He is not my boyfriend.

316
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:34,588
Conan?

317
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,988
Here, take this card.

318
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:39,988
Shinichi told me to give it to you.

319
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,988
Uncle Kogoro told me to come check up on you,

320
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,888
and I ran into Shinichi.

321
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,488
Is dad here, too?

322
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:49,488
Yes. He's waiting in the parking lot downstairs.

323
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:52,388
Gosh, what's taking that kid so long?

324
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:54,688
It's already been one hour!

325
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,988
I can't wait anymore, I'm going to go have a look myself.

326
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,688
No, I better just wait.

327
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,188
That wouldn't be adult of me.

328
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,788
Darn it.

329
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,288
So, where is Shinichi?

330
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:05,488
Well...

331
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:09,088
It's like this, he got a call on his cellular,

332
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,288
it was about a case he worked on recently

333
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:13,188
saying something terrible happened

334
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:16,088
and so he ran off.

335
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,388
I see.

336
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:21,688
Shinichi is stupid, isn't he?

337
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,588
Leaving you all alone like this.

338
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:27,688
So, he left me behind again.

339
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,288
You know,

340
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,888
Shinichi told me that...

341
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,888
No! Stop it!

342
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:39,388
I don't want to hear it!

343
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,188
I don't want to hear it.

344
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:44,688
No more excuses from him.

345
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,688
Shinichi told me...

346
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,688
that one day...

347
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,088
One day, for sure...

348
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,088
He'll come back even if it kills him.

349
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,188
That's why...

350
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:19,788
That's why...

351
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:28,788
He wants you to wait for him. That's what he said.

352
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,088
That's why...

353
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:45,888
You're so silly.

354
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:48,788
Conan, you don't have to put on such a serious face.

355
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,688
It's all that eager beaver detective's fault,

356
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:54,288
he drops everything and runs off at the mere mention of a case.

357
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:57,488
Eager beaver detective?

358
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:00,188
Oh, I almost forgot! Conan, would you like some dessert?

359
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:02,388
Yes, sure.

360
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:04,188
Excuse me, dessert menu please.

361
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:05,788
Here you go.

362
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,388
Good grief.

363
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:56,488
He has some nerve, asking me to wait for him!

364
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:59,288
Who does he think I am, his mother?

365
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:03,088
That makes five desserts.

366
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:07,588
But I'd still like to know what he wanted to talk to me about.

367
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:10,088
Conan, aren't you curious too?

368
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,088
Huh? No, not really.

369
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:15,588
Well, since he ran off without telling me,

370
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:19,088
I guess it wasn't very important.

371
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:20,388
I just don't understand

372
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:23,588
why he picked such an expensive restaurant

373
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:25,288
What a fool.

374
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,688
Making such a big deal when he had nothing important to say.

375
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,688
I don't know how to tell her.

376
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:38,288
I picked this place for good luck...

377
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,588
since dad proposed to mom here.

378
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:56,988
What's taking so long?

379
00:23:58,588 --> 00:23:59,788
"Next Episode" -Here, look.

380
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,688
The pins on the drum of this music box are broken.

381
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:06,888
It looks like it they were deliberately twisted and broken off.

382
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:08,088
It's true.

383
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,188
Maybe it was a message of some sort!

384
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,588
Who's there?

385
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:21,488
"I've been waiting, Haruna."

386
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:22,688
What?

387
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:28,509
Next Conan, "The Entrusted Music Box (Part 1)"

388
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,206
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:33,406
"Haru-yo-koi"
