1
00:00:00.948 --> 00:00:04.238
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:06.228
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:08.278
Today's case has the scent of honey!

4
00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:09.978
There's a stinger behind the sweetness!

5
00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:11.858
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:13.448
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:16.198
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:57.701
"The Honey Cocktail Murder Case."

9
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:08.841
That hurts...

10
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.291
Dad, isn't President Yamazaki
the head of Yamazaki Development,

11
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:16.271
the company you did a bodyguard
job for during that blackmail case?

12
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.231
What were you invited to today?

13
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:27.701
She says she has a favor to ask
of the nationally famous Mori Kogoro!

14
00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:48.371
Aihara Shingo (53) Caretaker
Welcome! Mori-sama, yes?

15
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:49.331
The president is expecting you!
Aihara Shingo (53) Caretaker

16
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:50.251
The president is expecting you!

17
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:51.261
Please come in!

18
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:59.171
Mori-sama is here.

19
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:00.251
Right this way!

20
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.191
Hello!

21
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:03.201
Welcome, Mori-san.

22
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:04.331
Yamazaki Hiromi (50)
Welcome, Mori-san.

23
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.751
I'm sorry to call you all the way
Yamazaki Hiromi (50)

24
00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.551
into the mountains like this.
Yamazaki Hiromi (50)

25
00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:07.901
into the mountains like this.

26
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.541
Oh, I see you're as beautiful as ever!

27
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.201
Oh, you're a flatterer.

28
00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:19.161
Let me introduce you. This is the
Mayor of Iwami, Hachimaki-sama.

29
00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.711
Hachimaki Hachibe (62) Mayor of Iwami City
I'm Hachimaki Hachibe.

30
00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:27.131
It's an honor to meet the distinguished
Mori Kogoro-san like this!
Hachimaki Hachibe (62) Mayor of Iwami City

31
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.291
It's a pleasure to meet you.

32
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:34.431
I'm Nakamura, her secretary. It's nice to meet you.
Nakamura Eri (32) Pres. Yamazaki's Secretary

33
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.291
The pleasure's all mine.

34
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:43.581
I'm Aihara, the caretaker here.
If you need anything, just let me know.

35
00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:45.221
Nice to meet you.

36
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.501
Now if you'll excuse me.

37
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.041
What's this model of?

38
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:58.501
You know not to touch,
Conan-kun!

39
00:03:58.501 --> 00:03:59.871
It's all right.

40
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:05.341
Mori-san, this is the
Iwami Spa Resort we're planning.

41
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:08.371
Aside from the hot springs,
it'll have a golf range, a tennis club,

42
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.261
an arcade, and many other facilities!

43
00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:19.291
Our city's population is dwindling,
so I've teamed up with

44
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:24.581
President Yamazaki to build a
spa resort to give it a shot in the arm!

45
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.071
Tomorrow is the ground-breaking ceremony!

46
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:31.791
And we'd like you to
play a part in the advertising,

47
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:36.531
by appearing in magazines and
television commercials as a model.

48
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:40.331
Model in your commercials?!

49
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.421
Like this, perhaps?

50
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:44.791
You're getting too excited...

51
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.421
Let's set aside the business talk for now.

52
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:52.051
Aihara... prepare the early celebration.

53
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.011
Yes, I'll bring it right now!

54
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:11.241
An afternoon with a rare feast
and sake... There's nothing better!

55
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:14.421
Wild boar stew and fresh Iwami vegetables!

56
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:17.241
They all share the
simple flavors of this region!

57
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:21.751
Yes, local cuisine will be
one of the resort's attractions!

58
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.121
It's coming from your upstairs office.

59
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:28.421
Pardon me a moment.

60
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:37.471
Oh, yes! Mayor! Why don't
you let Mori-san try the specialties?

61
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:41.431
Oh, that? Leave it to me!

62
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:49.651
Hey! Aihara-kun!
Bring you-know-what out!

63
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:52.991
What's he doing?

64
00:05:58.501 --> 00:06:00.531
What are "the specialties"?

65
00:06:02.581 --> 00:06:05.001
You'll just have to wait and see!

66
00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:10.541
Aihara-kun!

67
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.461
Oh, you're on the phone?

68
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:18.181
Uhh, please send over
one case of beer and juice!

69
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:22.121
I'm taking you-know-what.

70
00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:23.141
Oh, okay!

71
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:34.151
Now these are the pride of our town!

72
00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:37.861
W-What are they?

73
00:06:37.861 --> 00:06:42.831
Newt and wasp sake!
They're incredibly revitalizing!

74
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:47.001
Well, drink up!

75
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.171
O-Okay...

76
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:56.471
I think I've had too much to drink.
I need some fresh air.

77
00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:01.791
Are you all right?

78
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.601
Y-Yes, I think so.

79
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:09.351
It was such nice weather earlier, too...

80
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:12.821
Mountain weather does change quickly.

81
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:17.171
Like they say, a woman's
heart is as fickle as autumn weather.

82
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.411
Th-That was President Yamazaki!

83
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.291
Call the police and a doctor!

84
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:31.131
Right!

85
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:44.391
A balloon...

86
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:58.861
An insecticide spray?

87
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.491
It's too late.

88
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.621
Madam!

89
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.471
This is horrible!

90
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.421
Umm, are you the famous
detective, Mori Kogoro-san?

91
00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:28.021
Yes.

92
00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:31.291
I'm Suzuki, a resident police officer.

93
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:35.711
This is Dr. Sakurai,
who runs a clinic in town.

94
00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.371
Thanks for coming.

95
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:43.581
Well, I leave the rest to you.
I'm going to have a look at her room.

96
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:48.741
This door locks automatically, you know.

97
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:50.621
I know that!

98
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:53.041
Mori-san! I have a spare key!

99
00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:05.341
It smells like insecticide!

100
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:12.141
It appears it was
locked from the inside.

101
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:23.081
It appears she broke the
window to get onto the veranda,

102
00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:27.501
and then she fell over when
the rail she was leaning on broke.

103
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:29.921
But why?

104
00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:31.451
Mori-san.

105
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:38.961
Dr. Sakurai says she died
of head injuries when she fell.

106
00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.211
This office has an automatic lock,

107
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:46.641
and all upstairs windows
were locked from the inside.

108
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:52.851
It'd be impossible to sneak
past us on the first floor to go upstairs.

109
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:56.811
And sneaking in via the
chimney would also be impossible.

110
00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:59.771
So it was a completely locked room...

111
00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:07.201
This is--!

112
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:11.331
Say, officer! This is a bee, right?

113
00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:15.961
That's a yellowjacket wasp.

114
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:21.551
Come to think of it, Dr. Sakurai
did find sting marks on her head.

115
00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:23.881
Sting marks?

116
00:10:24.581 --> 00:10:26.881
Are wasps common in this area?

117
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:28.371
Yes.

118
00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:32.811
Come to think of it, wasn't she
afraid of wasps, Nakamura-san?

119
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:34.671
Yes.

120
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:39.771
She's from here, and she'd had
a traumatic childhood experience.

121
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.671
Some wasps stung her in the sixth grade,

122
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.901
and Aihara-san saved
her on the verge of death.

123
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.291
She said she hired him
to take care of the mansion

124
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:56.371
because she owed him her life...

125
00:10:56.961 --> 00:10:59.291
Yes, that's right.

126
00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:05.341
I always had bug spray on hand
to keep wasps from coming inside.

127
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:10.391
There've been many wasp-related
incidents so far this year.

128
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.041
I've figured out the killer!

129
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.851
It was the wasps that killed her,
no question about it!

130
00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:23.921
Listen... President Yamazaki
must've been attacked

131
00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:27.861
by wasps that entered
through that fireplace.

132
00:11:29.711 --> 00:11:31.911
She tried using the nearby bug spray,

133
00:11:32.711 --> 00:11:37.081
but in her panic, she went
through the window and onto the veranda.

134
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:42.211
Then, as luck would have it,
the handrail broke and she fell over.

135
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:45.211
In other words, this was an accident.

136
00:11:46.791 --> 00:11:52.831
But why did she escape
through the window and not the door?

137
00:11:52.831 --> 00:11:57.581
When people panic, they lose
the ability to make good judgments.

138
00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:07.171
What's this sticky stuff?!

139
00:12:09.711 --> 00:12:10.531
This is--!

140
00:12:27.501 --> 00:12:31.171
This might not have been an accident!

141
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:35.501
It's possible it was a murder
plotted by one of these people!

142
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.230
Protective clothing for handling wasps!

143
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.160
These two bottles were used recently.

144
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.040
Ether and sulfuric acid?!

145
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.320
Helium? Why is this here?

146
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.760
Wait a minute!

147
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.990
As I recall, it went downstream!

148
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.840
Fishing line and a ripped plastic bag!

149
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.300
And this black dirt!

150
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.520
The rain cap that should
be on this chimney is gone.

151
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:26.150
Some of the soot inside it
has been rubbed off.

152
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.330
Scotch tape?!

153
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.340
A hole in the floor?

154
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.950
Ah! Now I see how the trick worked!
That person is the killer!

155
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.780
Conan-kun! Where are you?

156
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.820
Where'd that runt disappear to?!

157
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.390
What is it?

158
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.610
You always worry us
when you suddenly disappear!

159
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.160
Quit scampering around! Come with us!

160
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.910
Hold on. Have a nap
and leave the rest to me, old guy.

161
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.450
What the--?

162
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.920
Dad! What was that sound?!

163
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.630
What was that?!

164
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.780
What happened?!

165
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.840
I've figured it out, everyone.

166
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.260
This was a murder.

167
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.530
It wasn't an accident?!

168
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.220
Why do you say that now?

169
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.190
To catch the killer off guard.
I wanted time to gather proof, you see.

170
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.820
The person responsible
murdered President Yamazaki

171
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.610
and made it look like an accident.

172
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.490
What proof do you have to--?

173
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.120
Have a look at the inside doorknob.

174
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.200
What about it?
Nothing seems out of the ordinary...

175
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.380
Underneath the connecting part.

176
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.540
This is--!

177
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.590
Yes... honey.

178
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:18.780
If wasps attacked you inside,
you would normally run out the door.

179
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.520
But there were a bunch of
wasps on the honey-covered doorknob,

180
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.440
so President Yamazaki ran in
the opposite direction, to the window.

181
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.240
The rail on the veranda was quite corroded.

182
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.360
It had been corroded in
advance using sulfuric acid.

183
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.660
But what about the wasps?

184
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.200
Yes... the wasps were planned too.

185
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.670
Have a look at the ceiling behind you.

186
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.130
Is that the balloon that--?

187
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.320
Yes.

188
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.060
It's the balloon you and Conan
saw on your way down to the river.

189
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.980
It got stuck to a
tree branch downstream.

190
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.940
Ran, check the plastic bag.

191
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.160
Okay.

192
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.360
A wasp!

193
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.360
The killer put wasps into
the bag attached to the balloon

194
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.910
and placed it in the chimney.

195
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:25.450
They were probably gathered
after spraying them with ether.

196
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.290
Aihara-san.

197
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:32.260
I found a beekeeper outfit
that smelled of ether in the shed.

198
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.280
Most everyone in this area has one.

199
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.950
Then what are the
helium tanks in the shed for?

200
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.070
We made balloons for
kids at the summer festival.

201
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.190
They're what's left over.

202
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.660
I wonder. There were three tanks.

203
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.110
Are you sure you didn't do
a lot of test flights of a balloon

204
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:57.200
with a bag attached instead?

205
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.870
What's that supposed to mean?
What are you trying to say?!

206
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.160
Only the caretaker here
could have set all this up!

207
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.080
Yes! You're the killer,
Aihara-san!

208
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.490
Wh-What are you talking about?!

209
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.760
I was in the living room when she fell!

210
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.720
I was with all of you!
How could I have killed her?!

211
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.390
First, to temporarily keep
the balloon inside the chimney,

212
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.860
you tied fishing line to it,
led it to the downstairs kitchen

213
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.820
through a small hole in the floor
by the fireplace, and tied it to a nail.

214
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.280
You also stuck fishing line
to a piece of tape on the bag

215
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.240
and led it to the kitchen as well.

216
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.570
Everything was then ready to go.

217
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:49.110
The phone rang, and President
Yamazaki went to the upstairs office.

218
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.950
At the same time, you were on the phone.

219
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:59.160
Yes... you had called her upstairs
office to get her into the room.

220
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.320
After confirming that
she had picked up the receiver,

221
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.450
you pulled a thread leading into the kitchen.

222
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.450
The tape covering a pre-made
rip in the bag came off

223
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.060
and sent the wasps flying out.

224
00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:20.240
The balloon blocked the chimney's top,
so they flew into the room.

225
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.200
The agitated wasps then
attacked President Yamazaki.

226
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.670
While spraying the insecticide,
she headed for the door.

227
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:36.590
But she was unable to open it.
Because it was crawling with wasps.

228
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.740
With no other choice, she ran
around the room, broke the window,

229
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.560
and leapt onto the veranda.

230
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.070
She leaned against the rail
and aimed the spray at the wasps,

231
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.430
but the rail broke and she fell over.

232
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.030
After we rushed outside,
you quickly returned to the kitchen

233
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.400
and undid the other thread.

234
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.950
And so the balloon
went flying out of the chimney.

235
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.780
That's what Ran
and Conan happened to see.

236
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.250
But something didn't go as planned.

237
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.820
The balloon was supposed to
fly far off into the distance,

238
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.300
but the light rain and wind
unfortunately got it stuck in a tree.

239
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.090
I found the tape!

240
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.310
And there is a hole in the floor!

241
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.770
That doesn't prove anything!

242
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.030
Aihara-san. Could you
show us the towel on your hip?

243
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.240
Towel?! Wh-What about it?!

244
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.910
The doorknob must've been
entirely covered in honey.

245
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.700
Are you sure you didn't
wipe it away with your towel?

246
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.290
There is honey on it!

247
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.570
And one more thing.

248
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.250
Please take out what's
in your right pants pocket.

249
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.550
What's the matter? Show it to us.

250
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:13.230
That's the very same thread
that undid the tape on the plastic bag.

251
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.560
The mayor and Conan
had barged in just then,

252
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.690
so you hastily stuffed it into your pocket.

253
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.030
It appears you didn't have
time to dispose of the evidence.

254
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.540
That, or you lowered your guard
when it was deemed an accident.

255
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.740
Making me the caretaker because
I saved her life was nice and all,

256
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.670
but I wound up like a worker
bee slaving away for the queen bee.

257
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.910
But she said she'd make
me manager of the spa resort,

258
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.880
so I tried so hard to endure it!

259
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.910
But it was a lie. A big, fat lie.
I couldn't stand it anymore.

260
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.850
I wanted to ruin tomorrow's
ground-breaking ceremony.

261
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.320
So I had to do it today.

262
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:39.220
Way to go, Dad! You solved the case!
You're a genius, as always!

263
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.440
Don't be silly! That was a piece of cake!

264
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.280
Speaking of which, I'm hungry!
Plus we didn't go to the hot springs!

265
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.390
Okay! Let's hit the
hot springs and get manlier!

266
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.470
Sleeping Kogoro gets to
show off his mind and body!

267
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.390
The only thing you
can show off is how to sleep...

268
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.930
Whoa! What is this?!

269
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.850
The room is filled with idol posters!

270
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.930
There are two of everything,
even photo books and CDs!

271
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.940
And they have their names on them.

272
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.180
This wasn't a suicide! It was a murder!

273
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.850
But this was a sealed room!
How did the killer escape?!

274
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.390
On the next Conan--

275
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.580
"The Sealed Bathroom Murder Case (Part 1)."
