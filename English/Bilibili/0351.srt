1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.840
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.940
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.640
Tracking down a cell phone case leads us to

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.440
revealing an unexpected case.

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:54.968
"Forgotten Cell Phone (Part 2)"

9
00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:58.468
Thank you very much!

10
00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:00.368
Yes.

11
00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:02.368
I see. Yes.

12
00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:03.568
I understand.

13
00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:06.068
Yes, thank you.

14
00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:07.268
And?

15
00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:09.068
I found three prospective people!

16
00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:10.768
They called from day before yesterday to today.

17
00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:13.368
Three people?

18
00:02:13.368 --> 00:02:15.168
And? What did they have to say?

19
00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:19.168
The first one said he wanted to go the interview site of a company

20
00:02:19.168 --> 00:02:22.268
but forgot the paper that he had written the address on at home

21
00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:26.568
and said he may be excluded from the interview if they found out.

22
00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:29.668
And asked to somehow have them give him the address.

23
00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:32.168
The second call was from a man

24
00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.568
who said his daughter who had run away from home

25
00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:36.568
and that he wanted to specify

26
00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:39.568
from where the phone call was placed.

27
00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.968
The third call was from a person who said that the cell phone

28
00:02:41.968 --> 00:02:44.168
of a person who he had befriended during his trip

29
00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:47.568
was mistakenly mixed up in his bag.

30
00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:49.368
He wanted to thank that person

31
00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.068
as well as return the cell phone

32
00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:54.868
so he wanted the name and address of that person.

33
00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:56.068
He's the one!

34
00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:58.768
He's the only one who mentioned cell phone so far!

35
00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:00.068
Yes!

36
00:03:00.068 --> 00:03:01.968
On top of that, only this last person

37
00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:04.468
asked to have the phone number too.

38
00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.568
And, what's the number?

39
00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:09.168
Well, since they were going to refuse answering him,

40
00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:12.168
they didn't take his number down.

41
00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:14.868
Besides, all three seem to have called from outside

42
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:16.768
and not their residence,

43
00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:18.468
so they don't know who called at all.

44
00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:20.668
-From outside? -Yup.

45
00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:22.368
One called the day before yesterday

46
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.368
from the platform of Beika Station,

47
00:03:24.368 --> 00:03:27.468
the next one called yesterday at noon from sports shop Apollo

48
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:29.068
and yesterday at sundown

49
00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:30.768
another called from Restaurant Colombo.

50
00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:33.468
The problem is...

51
00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:36.668
they don't remember which person it was

52
00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:41.668
that asked for the cell phone number.

53
00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:43.668
Oh, right.

54
00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:46.068
It seems that only the person who asked for the phone number

55
00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:48.868
suddenly hung the phone up from his side.

56
00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:49.968
Suddenly?

57
00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:52.368
Yes. They say they heard a sound

58
00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:54.168
on the other side of the line at that time.

59
00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.368
A sound that interrupted conversation.

60
00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:57.968
A loud sound.

61
00:03:58.568 --> 00:04:01.368
Well, it seems to have been so sudden that

62
00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:06.168
they didn't seem to have time to make out what the sound of the was.

63
00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:08.968
I guess we have no choice but to get in touch

64
00:04:08.968 --> 00:04:12.368
with the place that these three people called.

65
00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:15.368
I've passed one of the universities that I applied.

66
00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:17.268
Oh, I'm happy for you!

67
00:04:17.268 --> 00:04:18.468
Thanks.

68
00:04:18.468 --> 00:04:20.468
I guess you're relieved.

69
00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.968
Here's your change.

70
00:04:23.468 --> 00:04:25.068
Now, for the first one.

71
00:04:25.068 --> 00:04:26.168
Yes.

72
00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:31.168
The Tohto Kanjo Line will be coming in shortly!

73
00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:33.968
What? The public phone on the platform?

74
00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:36.568
The night before last.

75
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.668
There were many passengers using the phone so...

76
00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:41.768
I thought so.

77
00:04:41.768 --> 00:04:43.568
I mean I understand.

78
00:04:43.568 --> 00:04:46.768
Hey! Could it be that guy?

79
00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:48.868
You know that person who was standing in front of the phone

80
00:04:48.868 --> 00:04:51.368
that looked to be contemplating whether to call or not.

81
00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:54.568
Come to think of it, yeah.

82
00:04:54.568 --> 00:04:56.968
He was wearing this expensive looking coat,

83
00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:58.968
with a frightening and taut look.

84
00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:01.868
He comes around to the station recently.

85
00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.268
Didn't you hear a loud sound in the background

86
00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:05.868
when this person was on the phone?

87
00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:06.968
A loud sound?

88
00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.068
Yes.

89
00:05:08.068 --> 00:05:11.368
Of course, all the time!

90
00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:14.568
Because this is a train station after all. See!

91
00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:18.068
The train for Kenbashi will be coming shortly.

92
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.468
Please stand behind the white line.

93
00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:20.568
Oh!

94
00:05:20.568 --> 00:05:23.168
The announcement at the train station!

95
00:05:23.168 --> 00:05:26.468
-Hello? -It's true that you can hardly hear.

96
00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:29.368
Hello!

97
00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:32.468
Did you hear that? That's the loud sound.

98
00:05:32.468 --> 00:05:34.868
Thank you. I understand very well now.

99
00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:37.668
But, do you happen to have any other information

100
00:05:37.668 --> 00:05:39.568
on that frightening man?

101
00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:43.068
Yeah, maybe I'll see him again tonight.

102
00:05:43.068 --> 00:05:45.968
I see him a lot recently on the platform.

103
00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:48.968
Well, if you see him, please contact us!

104
00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:51.268
Yes, all right.

105
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:54.568
Thank you for your help!

106
00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:56.968
Yes!

107
00:05:56.968 --> 00:06:00.568
About noon yesterday, there was a man with a short hair cut

108
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.768
that came here asking to use the phone. He's the one, right?

109
00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:05.568
He said that the battery of his cell phone went dead

110
00:06:05.568 --> 00:06:06.868
and that he had no loose change either,

111
00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.868
so he wanted to borrow the phone.

112
00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:11.568
A loud noise?

113
00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:12.668
Yes.

114
00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:15.168
Was there noise loud enough back then

115
00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:16.768
that you had to stop talking?

116
00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:20.768
Yeah. I'm sure you're referring to the sound of the construction

117
00:06:20.768 --> 00:06:24.868
that's been going on for about a week in front of the bank.

118
00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:27.268
See! It's started again!

119
00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:32.168
It's like this intermittently from a little after noon time!

120
00:06:32.168 --> 00:06:34.868
The sound of construction.

121
00:06:34.868 --> 00:06:37.668
Huh? About sundown yesterday?

122
00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:42.268
Oh! He must be one of our customers!

123
00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:46.268
He's reticent and always wearing light colored sunglasses.

124
00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:48.868
He unusually seems to have forgotten his cell phone

125
00:06:48.868 --> 00:06:52.068
and asked for loose change in order to use the phone.

126
00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:54.068
So, I remember him well.

127
00:06:54.068 --> 00:06:56.668
Huh? A loud noise?

128
00:06:56.668 --> 00:07:01.868
Yes, did you hear a noise loud enough that you had to stop talking?

129
00:07:01.868 --> 00:07:05.968
I wonder. This road is known for being quiet.

130
00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:08.768
Hello, everyone!

131
00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:13.568
I, Shuhei Baisho with your ballot, with you voting for me

132
00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:18.568
will work along with you to create a quiet town!

133
00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:19.968
Did you hear that loud sound?

134
00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:22.868
It's like this every noon and at sundown.

135
00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:25.768
It seems that the campaign car usually takes this route.

136
00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:27.768
A political campaign car.

137
00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:30.668
When will that customer come to your shop again?

138
00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:32.768
He comes everyday,

139
00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:34.868
so when he comes again, I'll give you a call.

140
00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:37.568
Thank you. I'll be waiting for you to call me then.

141
00:07:37.568 --> 00:07:41.168
All of them sure sound suspicious.

142
00:07:41.168 --> 00:07:45.068
All of the three cases seem to fit the description.

143
00:07:45.068 --> 00:07:47.068
This is?

144
00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.568
Huh?

145
00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:53.068
What's this? This cell phone is strange!

146
00:07:53.068 --> 00:07:55.168
Look at it, Pops. See.

147
00:07:55.168 --> 00:07:58.968
Kid! Don't tell me you broke it?

148
00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:03.468
No. The phone numbers that are saved in this cell phone.

149
00:08:03.468 --> 00:08:06.768
Most of them start with the same four numbers.

150
00:08:09.968 --> 00:08:12.768
1028.

151
00:08:12.768 --> 00:08:15.968
1025. True.

152
00:08:15.968 --> 00:08:17.968
Almost all the figures are similar.

153
00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:21.268
Maybe they all live in the same neighborhood!

154
00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:23.168
Stupid! I just told you

155
00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:27.568
that there are no 10 digit numbers that start with 1.

156
00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:31.868
I'm pretty sure that the owner of this cell phone, that chubby man

157
00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:34.268
who got to know people on the job or something,

158
00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:36.868
put numbers in order besides their names.

159
00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:40.868
Hey. Among those numbers, which are the smallest ones?

160
00:08:43.568 --> 00:08:44.968
This is it.

161
00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:49.668
It's more than 1,000. He sure knows a lot of people.

162
00:08:49.668 --> 00:08:53.468
Yeah. Maybe he was a door to door sales man

163
00:08:53.468 --> 00:08:56.768
and just numbering his customers.

164
00:08:56.768 --> 00:08:59.468
Then what is the number behind it supposed to be?

165
00:08:59.468 --> 00:09:02.468
And this! What about this black dot?

166
00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:05.768
Some are marked and some are not.

167
00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:08.268
Maybe he marked the people

168
00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:13.168
who are prospective buyers with the black dot.

169
00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:17.968
The number towards the end like "150" and "600"

170
00:09:17.968 --> 00:09:20.568
could be number of products he sold, or...

171
00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:23.268
If so, that's strange?

172
00:09:23.268 --> 00:09:25.368
Because there are no people before the numbers 1022,

173
00:09:25.368 --> 00:09:28.168
that are at the start of the all the numbers,

174
00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:29.668
and see look carefully!

175
00:09:29.668 --> 00:09:33.268
There are two people with the number "1031"!

176
00:09:34.068 --> 00:09:35.268
One.

177
00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:36.968
Two.

178
00:09:36.968 --> 00:09:38.368
True.

179
00:09:38.368 --> 00:09:39.568
And, this too.

180
00:09:39.568 --> 00:09:41.868
There's a person numbered 1101

181
00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:46.768
but why isn't there anyone with the numbers 1032 to 1100?

182
00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:49.168
If he was numbering everyone in order,

183
00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:53.168
why does the number jump suddenly from 1031 to 1101?

184
00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:56.368
Could it be that...

185
00:09:56.368 --> 00:09:58.968
it's a calendar?

186
00:09:58.968 --> 00:10:00.168
Calendar?

187
00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:03.468
1031, October 31st.

188
00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:07.068
1101, November 1st and so forth.

189
00:10:07.068 --> 00:10:08.668
I see!

190
00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:10.668
Everything falls in place that way.

191
00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:12.068
Hold it.

192
00:10:12.068 --> 00:10:15.468
If this number stands for the end of October last year

193
00:10:15.468 --> 00:10:18.268
and this other one the 1st of November,

194
00:10:18.268 --> 00:10:20.368
it's just about the time the Tohto Congress election was held.

195
00:10:20.368 --> 00:10:21.268
Oh!

196
00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:25.268
Besides, back then it was a pretty busy time

197
00:10:25.268 --> 00:10:26.868
with the community baseball tournament

198
00:10:26.868 --> 00:10:28.768
and preparations for the autumn festival and all.

199
00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:32.968
So, it's for sure that this guy's not from this community.

200
00:10:32.968 --> 00:10:35.368
Hey! That's not the point.

201
00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.168
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:37.168 --> 00:10:38.168
No problem.

203
00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:41.468
If the four digits at the top are dates,

204
00:10:41.468 --> 00:10:45.768
the numbers behind them could be the time that he made the visit.

205
00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:47.768
"150", 1:50.

206
00:10:47.768 --> 00:10:49.968
"600", 6:00 sharp.

207
00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:52.268
Then why are the surnames written in Kanji

208
00:10:52.268 --> 00:10:53.868
and the names in Katakana?

209
00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:54.968
Because when he visits the house,

210
00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:57.368
the surname is written on the name plate,

211
00:10:57.368 --> 00:11:02.568
but he can only get the name of the person after he talks to them.

212
00:11:02.568 --> 00:11:06.468
It could be that the person was angry at the guy

213
00:11:06.468 --> 00:11:08.868
for selling him something he didn't want.

214
00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.668
What? Who?

215
00:11:10.668 --> 00:11:12.768
The guy who called using an a number that was not displayed.

216
00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:14.768
The one who shouted for the owner of the cell phone to take the call.

217
00:11:14.768 --> 00:11:17.268
And the same one who called the telephone company

218
00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:19.568
asking for the name and address of the owner of the cell phone.

219
00:11:19.568 --> 00:11:22.168
The man with the frightening face.

220
00:11:22.168 --> 00:11:25.168
If we can find out who and where he is,

221
00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:28.468
we can get the phone number of this cell phone from him

222
00:11:28.468 --> 00:11:32.568
and figure out the identity of the chubby guy.

223
00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:38.768
Darn! We wouldn't have to think so hard if that guy didn't die.

224
00:11:38.768 --> 00:11:42.168
I wonder if that's how it really is.

225
00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.368
It's strange after all.

226
00:11:44.368 --> 00:11:47.068
The place where that cell phone was forgotten.

227
00:11:47.068 --> 00:11:49.268
It's strange that it was folded in two,

228
00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:51.868
with the antenna sticking out and under the sofa.

229
00:11:51.868 --> 00:11:53.768
That's true, that it's strange.

230
00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:57.268
It's as if the cell phone was asking for someone to find it.

231
00:11:57.268 --> 00:11:58.568
Talking of the phone ringing,

232
00:11:58.568 --> 00:12:01.868
the gruff person who was the second one to call said,

233
00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:04.068
"Did it ring?"

234
00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:09.668
Maybe the chubby man made the gruff man call

235
00:12:09.668 --> 00:12:13.968
and was planning to secretly give him the cell phone.

236
00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:15.368
Don't be silly.

237
00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:19.568
Then, why didn't he call the gruff man over to this shop?

238
00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:23.868
If the phone rings, the employee of the shop would find it first

239
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.068
and he could never give it away secretly, could he?

240
00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:28.868
Exactly! It's just as Pops says!

241
00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:31.368
-Right? -He would never come back for something

242
00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:34.168
he was planning to hand over secretly!

243
00:12:34.168 --> 00:12:37.968
He couldn't have made mistake as to the place either.

244
00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:40.068
Mistake?

245
00:12:40.068 --> 00:12:42.168
You know, like I always make a mistake too.

246
00:12:42.168 --> 00:12:44.168
Come to think of it, before getting run over,

247
00:12:44.168 --> 00:12:46.568
the chubby man asked for directions at the convenience store.

248
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.868
I see! That's right.

249
00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:51.868
If he wasn't familiar with this place,

250
00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:54.368
there's a possibility of him making a mistake.

251
00:12:54.368 --> 00:12:57.568
Then, the most suspicious would be...

252
00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:58.768
Apollo!

253
00:12:58.768 --> 00:13:01.468
He could've made a mistake because this shop Poirot

254
00:13:01.468 --> 00:13:03.968
sounds similar to Apollo, the sports shop?

255
00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:05.368
I see!

256
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:09.068
But, Azusa, I think it's hard to believe that

257
00:13:09.068 --> 00:13:11.668
he'd mistake a sports shop for this coffee shop, don't you?

258
00:13:11.668 --> 00:13:13.768
I guess so.

259
00:13:13.768 --> 00:13:16.268
Azusa!

260
00:13:16.268 --> 00:13:19.568
Why is the name of this shop called Poirot?

261
00:13:19.568 --> 00:13:24.268
Yup. I wonder if you know, Hercule Poirot.

262
00:13:24.268 --> 00:13:27.968
The master likes him, that's where we got the name!

263
00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:30.168
Conan, do you know Poirot?

264
00:13:30.168 --> 00:13:31.868
The man's that a bit plump.

265
00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:34.468
Yup! I've seen him on TV!

266
00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:36.968
He's the one that always says, "You know, my wife she..."

267
00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:39.668
The detective that's wearing the wrinkled up coat, right?

268
00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:41.268
No!

269
00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:44.068
He's not Poirot, but Colom...

270
00:13:44.068 --> 00:13:45.268
Bo...

271
00:13:45.268 --> 00:13:47.168
Don't tell me!

272
00:13:47.168 --> 00:13:50.568
Maybe he made a mistake because they're both detectives?

273
00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:53.868
Besides, Colombo is located on 5-chome like we are.

274
00:13:53.868 --> 00:13:55.768
So, if that chubby man

275
00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:59.768
remembered the shop as one on 5-chome that has the name of detective,

276
00:13:59.768 --> 00:14:02.368
it's understandable that he would make a mistake.

277
00:14:02.368 --> 00:14:04.268
Let's go!

278
00:14:04.268 --> 00:14:05.268
Where to?

279
00:14:05.268 --> 00:14:06.768
Where else?

280
00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:09.468
The other detective's shop!

281
00:14:09.468 --> 00:14:12.468
-Wait! -Hey! I'm going too!

282
00:14:12.468 --> 00:14:13.768
Me too!

283
00:14:13.768 --> 00:14:17.168
The identity of the chubby man is becoming clear!

284
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.690
The man with the sunglasses that I told you about over the phone

285
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.090
hasn't come yet.

286
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.290
Oh, yeah?

287
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.890
Could we wait for him here, then?

288
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.990
Yeah.

289
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.990
Are you going to be all right, Azusa,

290
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.490
taking off from work like this?

291
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.690
Yes. Master's there

292
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.790
and as long as go back by sundown when it'll start getting busy.

293
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.790
I'm so concerned that I can't work this way anyway.

294
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.890
Hey, mister!

295
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.890
Did that customer ask you something?

296
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.190
Yeah.

297
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.690
From just a while ago, each time he comes here, he keeps asking me

298
00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.490
whether anybody found a forgotten cell phone here.

299
00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.690
Just as I thought.

300
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.790
-There seems to be no doubt about it. -Right.

301
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.390
Oh! There he is.

302
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.290
Welcome!

303
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:12.290
It's him. But what did you want with him?

304
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.290
Oh, just a little something.

305
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.390
I'll go talk to him.

306
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.890
If I talk to him, I'm pretty sure I can tell

307
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.690
whether he's the person who called or not.

308
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.890
No! I'll go first!

309
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.790
-Huh? -In times like this, men should go first.

310
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.690
What's the matter, Mr. Detective?

311
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.990
Aren't you going to go talk to him?

312
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.290
Talk to that man after you hear my deduction out.

313
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:47.190
First for the strange names in Katakana that were in this cell phone.

314
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.390
Although it's made to look like names of people at first glance,

315
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.190
these are actually the short form of a certain name.

316
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.690
A certain name?

317
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.690
Please show me the cell phone.

318
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.190
Just what do you mean?

319
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.190
There are names that are saved on the cell phone

320
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.590
that are very unnatural as names of people, aren't there?

321
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.590
Could you be referring to Sho Kenbashi and Chiyo Daitoma?

322
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.490
True. I've heard of places named like that,

323
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.390
but not so with the names of people.

324
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:20.090
Right! Those probably are the names of place.

325
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.690
For example, Sho Kenbashi stands for Kenbashi Shopping Arcade

326
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.990
and Chiyo Daitoma stands for Daitoma Community.

327
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.690
True that it falls into place if so.

328
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.990
Ken Aida stands for Aida Construction Company.

329
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.190
Seisaku Ishizawa stands for Ishizawa Manufacturing Company.

330
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.790
Furthermore, the 10 digit numbers that are

331
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.590
registered together with the names.

332
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.490
The 4 numbers at the top are dates.

333
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.490
The numbers after that denotes cash,

334
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.990
and the black dot shows that the company in question

335
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.490
is in the black.

336
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.790
In other words, it's about income.

337
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.790
The ones without the black dot means just the opposite.

338
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.290
That is, expense.

339
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.690
If you consider that the dates are focused

340
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.090
during the election time of last year,

341
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.890
-there is just one answer. -It can't be.

342
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.290
Under-the-counter accounting book of election campaign funds?

343
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.690
Exactly.

344
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.590
I have no idea how the chubby man

345
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.790
got a hold of the under-counter accounting book,

346
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.490
but there's probably no mistake that he was extorting money for this.

347
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.990
He probably put the copy of the accounting book into the cell phone

348
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.590
to show the one he was extorting that he really had the info.

349
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.590
Which means that the man is...

350
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.290
Most probably some man hired by Congressman Baisho,

351
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.190
who runs his election campaign car through this area.

352
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.290
-What? -He probably

353
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.490
wanted to get back the under-the-counter accounting book.

354
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.790
That man hung up part way calling the telephone company.

355
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.990
Because he heard the Shuhei Baisho's election car coming.

356
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.190
He didn't want people to think that anybody connected to Baisho

357
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.490
was searching for somebody who had information on the account book,

358
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.290
so he hung up without thinking.

359
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.890
The one who chose this shop as the place to get the info,

360
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.290
is that man wearing sunglasses, who frequents this shop.

361
00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.990
He was supposed to ring the cell phone here

362
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.990
and secretly get hold of the information

363
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.490
but the chubby man made a mistake!

364
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.690
But, I wonder why the chubby man didn't call our shop

365
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.190
after he realized he made a mistake?

366
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.890
Probably because he realized

367
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.490
only after the time he promised to ring the cell phone.

368
00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.690
Because if it worked out the way it should have,

369
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.190
the chef of this shop was supposed to have found the cell phone

370
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.090
and the man wearing the sunglasses was supposed to come pick it up

371
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.790
as something he forgot.

372
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.790
Even if he went to the wrong shop, if he calls the cell phone,

373
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.090
the guys could come pick it up at Poirot.

374
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:41.290
But he didn't want the guys to hear his voice.

375
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:47.090
So, he probably carried everything out using faxes and e-mails,

376
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.890
because he didn't want the guys to get anything on him,

377
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.190
including his face and voice that would identify him.

378
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.190
That's why he even ended the contract with the cell phone company

379
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.790
and peeled off the product number.

380
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.290
Then why did the chubby man rush back to Poirot?

381
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.690
He wanted to confirm whether the man wearing the sunglasses

382
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.790
really got hold of the cell phone.

383
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.390
Because if someone picked it up and delivered it to the police,

384
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.590
his plans for getting cash would go down the drain.

385
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.390
But, under these circumstances,

386
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.390
that man wearing the sunglasses

387
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.090
would probably refuse to talk no matter what we ask him.

388
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.890
-Don't worry, there's still a way. -Huh?

389
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.490
Okay, Conan?

390
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.990
Yup!

391
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.290
Let's go, Azusa!

392
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.290
Huh?

393
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.090
-Hurry! -Conan?

394
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.890
Hey, Azusa! I wonder who forgot that cell phone.

395
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.490
If the owner can't be found, give it to me, okay?

396
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.390
This is the first time I've seen a cell phone

397
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.190
with such a strange pattern!

398
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.890
Huh? There are many strange names and letters in it!

399
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.990
Conan.

400
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.690
Hey you! Kid!

401
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.990
I mean, sonny.

402
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.390
You see, that's my phone.

403
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.790
What? Really?

404
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.390
Then, show me proof!

405
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:01.990
Proof?

406
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.290
Yup, if this is yours,

407
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.590
you should know the number of this cell phone, right?

408
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.090
I'll call it with my cell phone and see if it really works.

409
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.890
Will you give me the cell phone number?

410
00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.090
Cut out the blabbering, hurry up and...

411
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.090
There's a policewoman!

412
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.990
I think I'll give this to that policewoman.

413
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.690
Hold it. Okay.

414
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.490
I'll give you the number now.

415
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.590
I got hold of the chubby man's phone number,

416
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.290
and from that number the police tracked down the apartment

417
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.290
where the chubby man lived.

418
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.090
The man seems to have been a journalist

419
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.990
and a copy of the under-the-counter account book

420
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.490
was found buried below a heap of receipts.

421
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.290
The names, dates and amount of cash were clearly written in it

422
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.690
and it was more than enough to serve as evidence.

423
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.290
All the people who received money from

424
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.790
or who were given money from Congressman Baisho

425
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.290
during the election campaign

426
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.490
were arrested, one after the other.

427
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.190
"Cafe Poirot"

428
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.790
Welcome!

429
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.890
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

430
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.990
A cup of hot coffee, please!

431
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.190
I'm an unknown detective that is fighting

432
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.590
with the dark aspects of society.

433
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.190
No, let me revise what I just said.

434
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.890
I am Kogoro Mouri, a renown detective!

435
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.690
Hello!

436
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.790
Thank you so very much for yesterday.

437
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.790
If anything should ever come up again, make sure you tell me, okay?

438
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.190
Yes, sir.

439
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.990
Yes, there is no case that I cannot solve.

440
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.890
Take for instance, that student.

441
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.790
He has successfully passed the university exam,

442
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.090
and doesn't have to come here to study anymore,

443
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.090
and yet he comes here frequently.

444
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.290
I'm sure that something else is blossoming inside him now.

445
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.490
A case!

446
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.190
Yes! This is Detective Mouri.

447
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.690
Hello, dad?

448
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.790
It's me.

449
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.490
Yup, what is it?

450
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.490
I think I'm going to be a bit late because of club practice today,

451
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.490
so could you go shopping for me?

452
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.090
Yes. Of course.

453
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.690
Potatoes.

454
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.190
Carrots, onions, pork, and apples!

455
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.890
Yep.

456
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.690
I figure we're going to be having curry tonight?

457
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.690
Bull's eye! Just as expected of a great detective!

458
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.990
Okay, got you! It sure is an important case!

459
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.990
I'll head off to the site immediately!

460
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.990
-Oh, no! -What's the matter, dad?

461
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.290
Hot, my coffee! My coffee!

462
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.390
Business sure is slow, eh, Pops?

463
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.190
During this season, I'm sure the bass

464
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.990
are waiting for bait in hiding at the shore side.

465
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.790
A person died there 6 months ago.

466
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.790
This is no coincidence!

467
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.890
Next Conan,

468
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.790
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 1)"

469
00:24:23.717 --> 00:24:26.217
Next Conan's Hint:

470
00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:27.917
"Trolley track"

471
00:24:27.917 --> 00:24:30.517
Fishing? You caught nothing, right?

472
00:24:30.517 --> 00:24:31.417
Well, it's way better than

473
00:24:31.417 --> 00:24:32.763
not fishing at all and just holding buckets.
