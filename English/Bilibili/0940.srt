1
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.870
"Kaho Mizunuma (24), Office Worker" -I'm free Sunday.

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.170
And send.

3
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.870
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She's missing?

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.570
Kaho Mizunuma.

5
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.970
She's my girlfriend.

6
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.470
"Jun Naruse (27), Kaho's Boyfriend" -She suddenly disappeared

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.370
a few days ago.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.970
She's pretty.

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.470
Yeah.

10
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.870
We planned to go ring shopping on Sunday.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.970
Please find her! Please!

12
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.570
In my eyes are maximum creation.

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.370
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.970
The client makes a desperate request.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.170
An unexpected development leads to the answer.

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.570
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:56.011
"The Missing Girlfriend"

20
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.511
Did Ms. Kaho lived here alone?

21
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.211
Yes, since about three months ago.

22
00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:08.711
Why did you two comes with us?

23
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.211
I mean...

24
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.411
Right?

25
00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.211
I don't see anything particularly suspicious.

26
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:34.911
Why only here?

27
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.611
Could she have gone to visit family or friends?

28
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.511
Her parents are already dead.

29
00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:45.111
She hasn't visited any friends or coworkers.

30
00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.411
I see.

31
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.511
Huh? Was Kaho...

32
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.411
It's an emergency!

33
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:03.811
The police just called!

34
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:06.211
Kaho is...

35
00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:16.011
Excuse me.

36
00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:17.211
Conan!

37
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.511
Hey, wait! Conan?

38
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.011
"Kaho Mizunuma"

39
00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:30.711
Suicide?

40
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:32.611
No, this is...

41
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:39.611
I doubt we'll find a body in this current.

42
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.611
Yeah.

43
00:04:40.611 --> 00:04:43.811
It rained all day yesterday.

44
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.511
But these shoes and ID card aren't wet.

45
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:48.711
Hey.

46
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:50.911
Gosh. You're always snooping around.

47
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:57.211
That's because Kaho Mizunuma jumped from the bridge at 5:15 am,

48
00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:59.811
long after it stopped raining.

49
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:03.811
What? How do you know the exact time?

50
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:07.811
Because someone happened to witness Ms. Kaho jumping.

51
00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:10.011
A witness?

52
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.611
"Tetsuya Ushio (21)" -This morning I came to deliver the paper...

53
00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:15.611
"Newspaper Delivery Boy College Student" -at the usual time.

54
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.611
That's when I saw...

55
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:18.811
Hey, you!

56
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:20.611
What?

57
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.411
Wait, wait! Hey!

58
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.211
Was that...

59
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.111
As far as I can tell from that video,

60
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:33.111
it was definitely a suicide.

61
00:05:33.111 --> 00:05:35.111
No way.

62
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:36.511
Mr. Naruse.

63
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:39.211
You're pretty amazing, though.

64
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:42.711
You took such a good video.

65
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:45.511
It happened suddenly, right?

66
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.111
You're right.

67
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.211
Wait. Please.

68
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:55.511
It's just a coincidence that it came out well.

69
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.911
Come to think of it, this place is pretty far

70
00:05:57.911 --> 00:06:00.211
from Ms. Kaho's house, right?

71
00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:02.411
How did Ms. Kaho get here?

72
00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:03.811
Well, obviously...

73
00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:07.511
The trains and buses would've just started running by then.

74
00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:09.911
Her shoes are too clean for someone walking outside

75
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.811
after it stopped raining.

76
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.711
Oh, in that case...

77
00:06:21.211 --> 00:06:25.011
"Maki Ohara (46), Taxi Driver" -Well, well. So she did die.

78
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:30.311
Could you tell us what happened when you gave her a ride?

79
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:32.411
It was around 2:30 am.

80
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:35.511
I picked her up on the road and drove for about thirty minutes.

81
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.111
We arrived here around three.

82
00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:39.711
Her story's accurate.

83
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.911
It's what we confirmed on the security camera footage.

84
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:46.211
She got off here looking like she was going to die.

85
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:47.611
I knew she'd do it.

86
00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:50.011
Then why didn't you stop her?

87
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.411
Not letting people die when they want to?

88
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:56.611
Is that the right thing to do?

89
00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:00.411
But something's not right.

90
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:06.011
Don't women carry handbags?

91
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:12.311
Come to think of it, Ms. Kaho was carrying a handbag

92
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.411
in the security camera footage.

93
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:18.011
I wonder where it went.

94
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.211
I don't know.

95
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:25.811
She took her bag when she got off.

96
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:29.411
And didn't Ms. Kaho get here around three?

97
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.411
What was she doing for over two hours

98
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.311
until she jumped after five?

99
00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:38.211
Probably mentally preparing herself.

100
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:41.111
She must've gotten rid of her bag then, too.

101
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:45.211
We have the witness and video to prove it.

102
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.711
It was definitely a suicide.

103
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.311
Hey, officer.

104
00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:52.211
Can I leave now?

105
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.411
I work nights and haven't gotten any sleep.

106
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:56.211
Can I go, too?

107
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:59.711
Yes. Thank you for your cooperation.

108
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:03.211
We might ask you for more details later.

109
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.711
We appreciate your continued cooperation.

110
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:11.711
Hey, as long as she's here, let's take a taxi home.

111
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:13.511
Right, Ran?

112
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:15.511
What? But...

113
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:19.311
I don't mind, as long as you pay.

114
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.111
Why don't you guys ride with us?

115
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:24.311
The police will pay our fare, right?

116
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:30.411
I supposed we can cover your transportation costs.

117
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.911
Lucky.

118
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.111
If you insist.

119
00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:36.411
What about you, Dad?

120
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.911
I'll stay a little longer.

121
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:41.911
Then we'll head home. Let's go, Conan.

122
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:54.311
There should be a clue in this video.

123
00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:58.611
How long are you going to keep watching that? It's my phone.

124
00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:01.411
Conan, Mr. Naruse is here, too.

125
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:04.111
Sorry.

126
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.811
Gosh. Kids these days.

127
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:13.711
I managed to stop them,

128
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:14.911
but what now?

129
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:19.311
That good luck charm...

130
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:22.411
Oh, it's my daughter.

131
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:24.511
She's dead now, though.

132
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.911
It was an illness.

133
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:27.811
I see.

134
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.611
She was my only family.

135
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.011
Now I live alone and carefree.

136
00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:35.811
Really? She kind of looks like

137
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:37.911
the girl who killed herself.

138
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.511
No way. They look nothing alike!

139
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:46.411
Don't compared her to a girl who killed herself!

140
00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:49.511
There's no need to be so angry.

141
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:54.911
I gotta go to the bathroom.

142
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.511
Hey, Ran?

143
00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:03.811
What?

144
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:04.911
Is this...

145
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:07.411
"Eyewitness Information Wanted! Face Unknown, Skinny Man"

146
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:09.811
"Long Brown Hair" -I think it was three months ago.

147
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.511
"Tattoos on Both Arms" -A female college student fell down

148
00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:14.011
from stairs at a park and died.

149
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:15.811
Isn't the park where this happened

150
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:17.811
near Ms. Kaho's house?

151
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:22.211
You're right. It's right next door.

152
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:24.311
Oh, that?

153
00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:27.911
We keep it posted at the family's request,

154
00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:30.311
but even the police say it was an accident.

155
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:34.111
I understand how they feel, though.

156
00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:37.211
Is this really a man?

157
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:42.711
Oh, nothing. I just thought they could also look like a woman.

158
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:49.211
Excuse me.

159
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.911
Be right there.

160
00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:01.811
Huh? You're going to dye your hair black?

161
00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:04.711
I've got an interview for a new job.

162
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:07.811
The money's good, but they seem strict.

163
00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:11.911
I can't imagine you with black hair.

164
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:13.011
Shut up.

165
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:17.511
Wait a minute.

166
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:18.711
In that case...

167
00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:22.011
What is it, Conan?

168
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:24.011
I need to go back to the bridge!

169
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:25.111
What?

170
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:26.511
Wait, Conan!

171
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.811
What is it, Conan?

172
00:11:37.811 --> 00:11:40.211
He forgot something.

173
00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:42.411
Gosh. Why did we have to come, too?

174
00:11:47.411 --> 00:11:49.411
There might still be some trace of it.

175
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.411
Hey!

176
00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:55.011
You're still wandering around here?

177
00:11:55.011 --> 00:11:57.711
Mr. Mouri, that's dangerous.

178
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:03.611
-Oh, no! -Conan!

179
00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:05.611
Hey!

180
00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:06.911
Conan!

181
00:12:28.778 --> 00:12:30.978
That's it! That light!

182
00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:34.378
-Conan! -Conan!

183
00:12:37.778 --> 00:12:38.978
Darn!

184
00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:02.178
Conan!

185
00:13:07.178 --> 00:13:08.578
Ms. Maki!

186
00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:09.778
Grab on!

187
00:13:12.478 --> 00:13:13.778
Ran!

188
00:13:13.778 --> 00:13:15.778
Pull! Heave!

189
00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:27.478
It's hot.

190
00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:32.578
Thank you very much.

191
00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:33.878
Thank you.

192
00:13:34.778 --> 00:13:37.878
Good thing you didn't die.

193
00:13:40.478 --> 00:13:42.378
"Maki Ohara"

194
00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:45.178
You're a very good swimmer.

195
00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:47.678
I used to swim at the National Athletic Meet.

196
00:13:48.678 --> 00:13:49.978
Could it be...

197
00:13:53.878 --> 00:13:55.478
I see.

198
00:13:55.478 --> 00:13:58.078
So that's how it is.

199
00:13:58.078 --> 00:13:59.978
Sorry, Conan.

200
00:13:59.978 --> 00:14:03.878
Gosh. This only happened because you were wandering around.

201
00:14:03.878 --> 00:14:05.878
You're all amazing, though.

202
00:14:06.878 --> 00:14:10.078
Even though you couldn't see her face clearly,

203
00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:14.278
you all knew the person in the video was Ms. Kaho.

204
00:14:15.278 --> 00:14:19.378
Well, she had the same hair and clothes.

205
00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:24.078
I see. I've figured it out.

206
00:14:24.078 --> 00:14:26.778
Figured out what, Mouri?

207
00:14:27.878 --> 00:14:30.278
The truth behind this case.

208
00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.878
Case? Wasn't Kaho's death a suicide?

209
00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:38.678
No, Ms. Kaho didn't kill herself.

210
00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:41.678
Didn't you see my video?

211
00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:45.978
That was clearly a suicide.

212
00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:49.878
Only if the person in the video really was Ms. Kaho.

213
00:14:52.878 --> 00:14:54.578
Yes, that was

214
00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:57.978
a different person disguised as Ms. Kaho.

215
00:14:59.478 --> 00:15:02.678
Right? You have a similar build as her,

216
00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:04.578
and you're good at swimming.

217
00:15:04.578 --> 00:15:06.078
Ms. Maki Ohara.

218
00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:16.178
You faked Ms. Kaho's suicide.

219
00:15:16.178 --> 00:15:18.278
You knew that Mr. Ushio

220
00:15:18.278 --> 00:15:20.878
would pass by the bridge at that time.

221
00:15:21.678 --> 00:15:24.878
So she waited for me to arrive to jump.

222
00:15:24.878 --> 00:15:27.778
That's why you were able to film the video.

223
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:32.178
What proof do you have?

224
00:15:32.178 --> 00:15:34.578
What? Well...

225
00:15:34.578 --> 00:15:36.378
It's her shoelaces, right?

226
00:15:38.878 --> 00:15:41.178
The shoes in Ms. Kaho's room

227
00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:43.178
and the ones found at the crime scene

228
00:15:43.178 --> 00:15:44.878
"Over wrap, At Kaho's House" -were tied differently.

229
00:15:44.878 --> 00:15:46.278
"Under wrap, At Crime Scene"

230
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.578
You said someone must've retied them,

231
00:15:49.578 --> 00:15:51.778
remember?

232
00:15:51.778 --> 00:15:53.678
Uh, yeah.

233
00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:55.878
But why would I...

234
00:15:55.878 --> 00:15:58.478
In Mr. Ushio's video,

235
00:15:58.478 --> 00:16:01.078
there's something flashing.

236
00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.778
Hey, you!

237
00:16:03.778 --> 00:16:05.578
What?

238
00:16:05.578 --> 00:16:06.978
Wait, wait! Hey!

239
00:16:07.678 --> 00:16:10.578
When I fell from the bridge,

240
00:16:10.578 --> 00:16:14.078
I saw Ran's necklace sparkle in the same way.

241
00:16:15.078 --> 00:16:17.878
That was probably Ms. Maki's necklace.

242
00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:21.478
It... it wasn't me!

243
00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:24.378
I'm sure that Kaho girl wore a necklace, too!

244
00:16:26.078 --> 00:16:27.278
No,

245
00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:31.478
Ms. Kaho never wore any jewelry.

246
00:16:32.478 --> 00:16:36.378
Even when she wore a dress, she didn't even wear a watch.

247
00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:38.578
Ms. Kaho must have been

248
00:16:38.578 --> 00:16:40.378
allergic to metals.

249
00:16:42.278 --> 00:16:45.878
We'll know as soon as we analyze the video.

250
00:16:50.678 --> 00:16:53.778
That's right. I killed her.

251
00:16:56.878 --> 00:16:59.478
I'm drowning in debt

252
00:16:59.478 --> 00:17:02.678
from my dead daughter's medical bills.

253
00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:06.478
When I saw her credit card, I couldn't help myself.

254
00:17:06.478 --> 00:17:09.778
Then that long black hair...

255
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.078
That's right, a wig.

256
00:17:11.078 --> 00:17:14.178
A keepsake of the daughter who lost her hair to illness.

257
00:17:14.178 --> 00:17:16.778
I never thought I'd be able to use it like this.

258
00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:25.278
No.

259
00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:27.278
That's not what happened, Ms. Maki.

260
00:17:28.378 --> 00:17:32.678
Well, that settles this...

261
00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.878
I thought this was over.

262
00:17:37.978 --> 00:17:39.178
Wait a minute.

263
00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:44.378
Why did Ms. Kaho

264
00:17:44.378 --> 00:17:47.378
come to this place late at night?

265
00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:49.378
Isn't that because...

266
00:17:49.378 --> 00:17:50.878
Mr. Naruse.

267
00:17:53.278 --> 00:17:56.578
Remember what you said when we met?

268
00:17:56.578 --> 00:18:00.778
We planned to go ring shopping on Sunday.

269
00:18:01.278 --> 00:18:04.878
Ms. Kaho, a woman allergic to metals, wanted to buy a ring?

270
00:18:04.878 --> 00:18:06.578
No way.

271
00:18:06.578 --> 00:18:07.578
It's a big fat lie.

272
00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:11.578
Then why did Mr. Naruse say that?

273
00:18:11.578 --> 00:18:14.378
Mr. Naruse, you're sweating.

274
00:18:15.378 --> 00:18:17.178
Why don't you roll up your sleeves?

275
00:18:18.178 --> 00:18:20.078
You can't, can you?

276
00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:23.178
You're afraid your tattoo sleeves will be seen.

277
00:18:23.178 --> 00:18:24.778
Tattoos?

278
00:18:24.778 --> 00:18:26.678
Could it be...

279
00:18:26.678 --> 00:18:28.978
I'm glad I had Conan drag you around

280
00:18:28.978 --> 00:18:29.978
until you gave yourself away.

281
00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:33.378
That's right.

282
00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:36.278
You're the man who pushed the student

283
00:18:36.278 --> 00:18:38.678
down the stairs at the park three months ago.

284
00:18:39.878 --> 00:18:41.478
And Ms. Kaho...

285
00:18:42.278 --> 00:18:45.878
I'm free Sunday. And send.

286
00:18:54.978 --> 00:18:57.578
If you tell anyone about this,

287
00:18:57.578 --> 00:18:59.878
I'll kill you and your entire family.

288
00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:01.678
I'll be watching.

289
00:19:02.978 --> 00:19:07.178
The curtains in Ms. Kaho's apartment were closed,

290
00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:10.678
and there was dust beneath them.

291
00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:14.778
It's because she'd been unable to approach the window for a long time.

292
00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:18.078
That proves you persistently followed her around and watched her.

293
00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:22.878
At the end of her rope, Ms. Kaho came to this bridge.

294
00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:24.378
And then...

295
00:19:24.378 --> 00:19:27.378
That's right, she died.

296
00:19:27.378 --> 00:19:30.678
There's no proof to back up your reasoning.

297
00:19:30.678 --> 00:19:33.078
There is proof.

298
00:19:34.078 --> 00:19:35.578
Ms. Maki.

299
00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:41.678
Your driver's license had no mention of corrective lenses

300
00:19:41.678 --> 00:19:44.878
that's required for persons with impaired vision.

301
00:19:44.878 --> 00:19:48.478
If you have such good vision, why did you purchase

302
00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:50.878
a contact solution.

303
00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:54.578
Rather, for whom did you purchase contact solution

304
00:19:54.578 --> 00:19:56.678
and two lunch boxes?

305
00:19:59.378 --> 00:20:00.778
Ms. Maki,

306
00:20:00.778 --> 00:20:03.878
you didn't kill anyone.

307
00:20:03.878 --> 00:20:06.578
You simply faked Ms. Kaho's death

308
00:20:06.578 --> 00:20:08.978
to protect her from Mr. Naruse.

309
00:20:08.978 --> 00:20:10.578
Then Ms. Kaho is...

310
00:20:10.578 --> 00:20:12.978
That's right. She's alive

311
00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.878
and hidden in Ms. Maki's home.

312
00:20:15.878 --> 00:20:17.078
You're lying!

313
00:20:17.078 --> 00:20:18.578
It's true!

314
00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:22.178
Kaho!

315
00:20:26.178 --> 00:20:27.278
Ms. Maki.

316
00:20:27.278 --> 00:20:29.278
Kaho.

317
00:20:29.278 --> 00:20:31.978
I was so scared.

318
00:20:31.978 --> 00:20:34.078
I was so worried,

319
00:20:34.078 --> 00:20:35.578
but the police

320
00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:38.278
wouldn't take me seriously.

321
00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:39.978
When I lost hope, I went to that bridge.

322
00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:44.478
I'm terribly sorry.

323
00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:46.578
So much time had passed,

324
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.478
and it had been treated as an accident.

325
00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:52.078
But I won't run anymore.

326
00:20:52.078 --> 00:20:55.978
For Ms. Maki, who risked herself to protect me.

327
00:20:57.978 --> 00:21:00.478
I saw him.

328
00:21:00.478 --> 00:21:02.578
He did it!

329
00:21:10.678 --> 00:21:13.478
Thank you, Ms. Maki.

330
00:21:13.478 --> 00:21:17.078
But why were you so desperate to protect Ms. Kaho?

331
00:21:17.078 --> 00:21:18.478
He's right.

332
00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:22.178
You tried to take the blame for killing Ms. Kaho.

333
00:21:22.878 --> 00:21:26.678
Do you remember when you told me about what happened?

334
00:21:27.378 --> 00:21:28.978
I was so angry.

335
00:21:28.978 --> 00:21:32.078
At Naruse, of course, but also you.

336
00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:36.378
You thoughtlessly said you wanted to die over something so small.

337
00:21:37.378 --> 00:21:39.978
Why did my daughter who wanted to live die,

338
00:21:39.978 --> 00:21:42.378
but this girl is alive?

339
00:21:42.378 --> 00:21:45.278
I thought about killing you,

340
00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:47.178
just like you wanted.

341
00:21:50.078 --> 00:21:51.678
But then...

342
00:21:59.078 --> 00:22:02.178
I had to help you.

343
00:22:03.178 --> 00:22:04.678
Ms. Maki.

344
00:23:35.578 --> 00:23:38.278
"Dead Student. Suspect Jun Naruse." -Goodness.

345
00:23:39.578 --> 00:23:41.978
What a ridiculous client.

346
00:23:44.478 --> 00:23:47.678
"We baked these together." -Conan, do you think you can become family...

347
00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:50.478
"Thank you. From Maki and Kaho." -even if you're not related by blood?

348
00:23:50.478 --> 00:23:52.878
I'm sure you can.

349
00:23:54.578 --> 00:23:57.478
"Next Episode" -About Maria Higashio...

350
00:24:00.578 --> 00:24:02.778
It's Maria shoes and backpack.

351
00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:04.778
It's open?

352
00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.478
The bookcase fell.

353
00:24:08.478 --> 00:24:12.178
It's likely she is been trapped for over six hours.

354
00:24:12.878 --> 00:24:14.878
Huh? Hattori is calling.

355
00:24:15.878 --> 00:24:18.278
-Hello... -You punk!

356
00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:20.578
Next Conan,

357
00:24:20.578 --> 00:24:24.478
"Find Maria (Part 1)"

358
00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:27.863
Next Conan's Hint:

359
00:24:27.863 --> 00:24:29.463
"Cover"

360
00:24:29.463 --> 00:24:31.463
Anyways, what happened regarding the mansion?

361
00:24:31.463 --> 00:24:32.863
The Goal is in the past tense. Just kidding.

362
00:24:32.863 --> 00:24:33.963
A pun?
