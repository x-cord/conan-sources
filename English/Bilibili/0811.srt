1
00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:01.824
We came on a sightseeing tour

2
00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:05.624
to the old Battle of Kawanakajima at Nagano Prefecture.

3
00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:07.124
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Kansuke Yamato

4
00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:08.224
and other Nagano Prefectural Police officers

5
00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:09.424
and they had taken us around.

6
00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:12.124
Just as we were about to arrive at the Chikuma River,

7
00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:15.024
we found the head of a person come drifting along the river.

8
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:20.024
The head that had the mark of a woodpecker footprint on its forehead

9
00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:23.724
belonged to Squad Chief Takeda of the Nagano Prefectural Police.

10
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:26.424
Furthermore, another officer of the Takeda Squad,

11
00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:30.824
Police Lieutenant Kano was also found hung to death at his residence.

12
00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:38.824
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

13
00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.824
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

14
00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.724
What happened within the organization?

15
00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:44.624
Police officers are targeted one after the other.

16
00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:46.224
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:48.124
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:50.324
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:41.479
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 2)"

20
00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.579
"I shall destroy the woodpeckers"?

21
00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.579
"I'm the God of War"?

22
00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.479
What're you talking about, Kansuke?

23
00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.279
I'm not the one saying it.

24
00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.979
On this mail from Mr. Kano, that's what's written.

25
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.279
"Hyoe Kuroda (50)"

26
00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.779
Cause of death is suffocation from strangulation.

27
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.579
Based on postmortem lividity and rigor mortis,

28
00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.479
estimated time of death is from an hour to an hour and a half ago.

29
00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.879
Judging from the Yoshikawa line on the neck that appear when he struggles,

30
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.579
Mr. Kano was most probably strangled from behind by someone,

31
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.979
then a rope was wound around his neck,

32
00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.179
which after, he was hung from the ceiling.

33
00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.579
"Mamoru Saegusa (37)" -There must be more than one perpetrator, then.

34
00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.179
Because it took all three of us

35
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.379
"Shinsuke Akiyama (26)" -to bring Mr. Kano down too

36
00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.379
I guess so.

37
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.979
No, if a chair were to be placed on the desk

38
00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.279
and he was made to sit down,

39
00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.779
one person could've hung him.

40
00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.479
Even if he were to be someone with bad legs.

41
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.179
True.

42
00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.079
Ringtone of a cell phone?

43
00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.079
This is Mr. Kano's!

44
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.579
It's a mail from Mr. Takeda has come to Mr. Kano's cell phone.

45
00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.379
What? You mean it's from the suspect who killed Squad Chief Takeda.

46
00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.579
Most likely.

47
00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.979
And, what does it say?

48
00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.279
"There are three woodpeckers left".

49
00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.379
I see.

50
00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.379
Based on the woodpecker's footprint that was found on Kano's forehead,

51
00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:34.679
the remaining three targets are most likely to be one of the officers.

52
00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:35.779
This is just great.

53
00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.979
Let's give the perpetrator a taste of what happens

54
00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.579
when you make an enemy of the police!

55
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.779
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

56
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.979
Inspector Yamato.

57
00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.379
What do you think of this rope that was wrapped around his neck?

58
00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.679
Come to think of it.

59
00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:51.379
It's that it's a bit strange.

60
00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.979
Hey, Kansuke, put on your gloves!

61
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.279
I mean I already touched it when I got him down,

62
00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.779
so it doesn't matter does it?

63
00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.679
By the way, Kansuke,

64
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.579
it seems that an eye-witness saw you this morning near the bridge

65
00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:05.479
where Mr. Takeda's body was found.

66
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.479
Like I already said, I didn't go to that bridge!

67
00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.279
I'm sure that the witness took me for someone else!

68
00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.579
I don't see how anyone can mistake you for anybody else but you though.

69
00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:19.279
That goes for you too,

70
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.379
First Section Chief Kuroda.

71
00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.979
What? He was killed?

72
00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.879
You mean that Lieutenant called Kano who we met this afternoon?

73
00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.979
Yes. He was found hanging from the ceiling of his residence.

74
00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.479
So, we were looking for someone who could've had a grudge

75
00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.179
against Squad Chief Takeda and Police Lieutenant Kano,

76
00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:40.279
but it led us to the random shooting incident nine years ago,

77
00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.779
and the case of the man who confined himself inside a bank six months ago.

78
00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.579
Mr. Kano belonged to the Takeda Squad

79
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.679
both nine years ago and six months ago.

80
00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:51.879
But, the bereaved family of the perpetrator that was shot

81
00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.279
has all passed away,

82
00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.979
and the only person left is the grandmother of the perpetrator, right?

83
00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.979
Yeah. But that old lady would never be able to cut somebody's head off

84
00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.279
nor do a feat such as strangle somebody then hang him from the ceiling.

85
00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.679
Which means there's still no prime suspect after all.

86
00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:10.879
No, there's just one.

87
00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:11.879
What?

88
00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.779
The best friend of the perpetrator who watched his friend being killed

89
00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:14.979
right before his eyes.

90
00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.179
You mean...

91
00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:19.479
The one who also objected to the shooting six months ago.

92
00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.279
Komei. Don't tell me that you...

93
00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.179
Right, Kansuke.

94
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:27.679
It's you.

95
00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.279
You're suspecting me?

96
00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.779
Like they say, even parasites inside a lion will eat their host.

97
00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.279
Why you...

98
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:41.079
Inspector Yamato could never be the perpetrator!

99
00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:44.479
You already know that, right, Inspector Morofushi?

100
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.779
Because you've been best friends since your childhood days.

101
00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.379
Best friends?

102
00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.379
Well, that's a first.

103
00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.779
Yeah. The feeling's mutual.

104
00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.779
I'm going to continue the investigation on my own from here!

105
00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.979
Go tell Chief Kuroda that!

106
00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.279
Suit yourself.

107
00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.479
Kansuke?

108
00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.179
What? Did I say something I wasn't supposed to?

109
00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:12.379
Come to think of it,

110
00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.379
your trainer was Yamato when you first became a cop, right?

111
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.479
But you'd better not side with him just because of that.

112
00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:20.979
Because although your chief was murdered,

113
00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.279
you still belong to the Takeda Squad, you know?

114
00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:24.679
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:25.979
Hey.

116
00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.079
That Lieutenant called Kano went back home

117
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:31.479
because he realized something, right?

118
00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:33.079
Oh, yeah.

119
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:35.679
Do you remember what made him realize it?

120
00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:36.679
I wonder.

121
00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:39.779
Well, he had his finger on his forehead for a while,

122
00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:42.079
and it looked like he suddenly hit upon an idea.

123
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.479
His forehead?

124
00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.579
I think he hit upon something

125
00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:46.679
after remembering the footprint of the woodpecker

126
00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:48.979
that was on Squad Chief Takeda's forehead.

127
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.279
What about after that?

128
00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.679
We split up and continued to go around asking questions.

129
00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.779
We'll let Section Chief Kuroda know about it too.

130
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:58.779
Oh, and I also e-mailed Inspector Yamato

131
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:01.179
although I guess he didn't read it because he was more concerned

132
00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.179
about the calls from Mr. Kano that he missed.

133
00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:06.779
I mean, why do we have to tell this kid about it?

134
00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:11.779
Which means that Kansuke also knew that Mr. Kano returned to his residence.

135
00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:15.079
Hey! Are you seriously suspecting Kansuke?

136
00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:16.679
Any problem?

137
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:18.479
It's a great problem!

138
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:23.079
Right! Inspector Yamato would never commit murder.

139
00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:25.079
Oh, Mr. Aburgawa, telephone?

140
00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:28.679
It's Akiyama. It's about time you remember my name.

141
00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:31.279
Besides, what came is not a phone call but mail.

142
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.479
What's the matter, Mr. Akiyama?

143
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.979
Nothing. I'm going to go change clothes!

144
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:40.879
After all, I got quite wet asking around in the rain.

145
00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:42.279
My house is close by too, you see.

146
00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.779
Hey, come back quickly, okay?

147
00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.079
Copy that!

148
00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:48.579
Come to think of it, his mother's house is right near here.

149
00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:51.879
Yes, I think it was the beauty salon at the corner.

150
00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:55.879
I'm Bishamonten...

151
00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:56.979
I'm...

152
00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.079
I'm Bishamonten.

153
00:09:03.579 --> 00:09:05.279
I shall destroy the woodpecker.

154
00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.879
I'm the God of War!

155
00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.279
It matched?

156
00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.879
You mean the body that was found under the bridge

157
00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.779
and Chief Takeda's head?

158
00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:27.479
Yeah, the DNA of the right toe, which barely made it unburned, matched.

159
00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:29.879
What about the other guys?

160
00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.979
A lot of things happened

161
00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.279
so Inspector Yamato went off to investigate on his own.

162
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:36.879
Morofushi, I told you to keep your eyes on him, didn't I?

163
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:38.279
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:41.079
We don't seem to have good chemistry.

165
00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:43.179
Where're Akiyama and Saegusa?

166
00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:46.079
Mr. Akiyama went to his mother's house to get changed

167
00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:48.479
because he got wet

168
00:09:48.479 --> 00:09:50.679
but he didn't come back even after we waited for a while.

169
00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:53.779
So, Mr. Saegusa went to check on him now.

170
00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.879
Morofushi? This is Saegusa.

171
00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.679
Is something wrong?

172
00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.479
I tell you that guy!

173
00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:03.579
After he went to his mother's place and got changed,

174
00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:07.079
I hear he took his car and drove off to Mount Saijo!

175
00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:08.079
Mount Saijo?

176
00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:13.179
Yeah. To the mountain shack where the wanted robber is hiding out!

177
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.379
I'm headed over there now,

178
00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.679
so will you guys please come too!

179
00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:18.879
Gosh.

180
00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:20.779
How come you're in here?

181
00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.079
No problem is there?

182
00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:25.179
By the way...

183
00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:28.579
Why do you have a spare tire in the backseat?

184
00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:31.379
For some reason, I'm experiencing a lot of flats recently.

185
00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:33.179
I have them here so I can change tires easily.

186
00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.479
Are they in your way?

187
00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:35.979
Nope, I'm fine.

188
00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:38.279
What? That tire, a while ago...

189
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:43.079
I'm Bishamonten.

190
00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:45.979
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

191
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.679
I'm the God of War!

192
00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:54.579
He doesn't seem to be at the mountain shack.

193
00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:57.679
We've got no choice but look around here.

194
00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:06.479
There he is!

195
00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:08.879
Help me.

196
00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.279
He's being dragged along by the car!

197
00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:12.979
My cell phone...

198
00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:19.679
Akiyama!

199
00:11:24.979 --> 00:11:26.779
Akiyama!

200
00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:43.146
Akiyama!

201
00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:47.946
Who would've done a thing like this?

202
00:11:47.946 --> 00:11:52.046
Before Akiyama was dragged by the car and fell off the cliff he said...

203
00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:53.646
My cell phone...

204
00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.046
If I recall correctly.

205
00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:58.046
Hey, ring Akiyama's cell phone.

206
00:11:58.046 --> 00:11:59.146
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:05.346
I found it!

208
00:12:05.346 --> 00:12:08.346
It's unmistakably Akiyama's cell phone.

209
00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:17.846
He received a mail at sundown, 5:32 pm.

210
00:12:17.846 --> 00:12:20.446
Oh, I remember that.

211
00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:24.246
After looking at the mail, Mr. Akiyama said he was going to change clothes

212
00:12:24.246 --> 00:12:26.046
and went to his parents' beauty salon.

213
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:30.846
Then, without returning to NPD headquarters he came here to Mount Saijo.

214
00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:33.246
And, what does the mail say?

215
00:12:33.246 --> 00:12:35.446
"I found the cell phone of Pops Takeda, who was murdered,

216
00:12:35.446 --> 00:12:38.746
from inside the belongings of a certain person,

217
00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:41.546
and I'm text mailing you from it."

218
00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.846
"That person is from the police force

219
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.046
so I'd like you to make up a good reason

220
00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:47.646
and come to the mountain shack on Mt. Saijo."

221
00:12:47.646 --> 00:12:50.946
"I'll tell you the details there."

222
00:12:50.946 --> 00:12:53.346
"Kansuke Yamato" -"Kansuke Yamato".

223
00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:56.246
Kansuke's the one who sent the mail?

224
00:12:56.246 --> 00:12:59.146
Then, is he the one who lured Akiyama out here

225
00:12:59.146 --> 00:13:01.046
and killed him?

226
00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.446
Can't you get in touch with Yamato?

227
00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:07.246
No. I called him repeatedly on our way here,

228
00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:09.146
but it seems that he has his phone switched off.

229
00:13:09.146 --> 00:13:10.946
Let's put out a criminal search.

230
00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:13.946
Yamato's undoubtedly a suspect!

231
00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:16.646
Not necessarily.

232
00:13:16.646 --> 00:13:21.946
Because that mail wasn't sent from Inspector Yamato's cell phone.

233
00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:24.146
It could be mail that the perpetrator sent

234
00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:26.946
pretending to be Inspector Yamato, right?

235
00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:29.746
Besides, if Inspector Yamato were the perpetrator,

236
00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:32.546
I don't think he'd leave a cell phone that has a mail like that in it

237
00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:35.946
that could serve as evidence lying around without even looking for it.

238
00:13:35.946 --> 00:13:38.946
Just what're you talking about?

239
00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:43.146
I'm sorry, we weren't aware that he was in our car,

240
00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:44.446
but the fact is he...

241
00:13:44.446 --> 00:13:46.246
You find the clue to solving the case

242
00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:50.546
from an unexpected perspective and support the deduction.

243
00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:53.346
The wisdom bag of the Sleeping Kogoro.

244
00:13:56.446 --> 00:14:01.346
It's rumored to be so at MPD, Conan Edogawa.

245
00:14:01.346 --> 00:14:04.346
Is that so?

246
00:14:04.346 --> 00:14:05.646
However,

247
00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:07.546
it could be that we arrived

248
00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:08.946
just as he was about to search for the cell phone

249
00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:11.746
so he had no choice but to leave.

250
00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:15.246
Or, it could be that Akiyama did some quick thinking.

251
00:14:15.246 --> 00:14:17.946
See? I knew it.

252
00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:23.046
Yamato's cell phone number is blocked.

253
00:14:23.046 --> 00:14:25.946
Akiyama who figured that Yamato might kill him,

254
00:14:25.946 --> 00:14:28.246
probably did so in the spur of the moment

255
00:14:28.246 --> 00:14:30.346
to prevent the evidence from being erased.

256
00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:31.946
No way.

257
00:14:31.946 --> 00:14:34.246
Or the perpetrator, in order to make everyone believe so,

258
00:14:34.246 --> 00:14:36.946
set it up beforehand to make it look that way.

259
00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:40.246
Yeah? I would've thought so too.

260
00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:43.346
Until I was informed by forensics a while ago.

261
00:14:43.346 --> 00:14:44.646
Informed?

262
00:14:44.646 --> 00:14:48.546
Yamato's fingerprints were detected on the rope that Kano was hung with.

263
00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:51.546
I'm calling a search out for him as a murder suspect!

264
00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:55.346
Please wait, sir!

265
00:14:55.346 --> 00:14:57.646
Inspector Yamato touched that rope

266
00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:59.546
when he brought Lieutenant Kano down.

267
00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:02.046
He's prints were not only found on the top part of the roof

268
00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:04.146
that was hooked onto the lighting of the room.

269
00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:07.146
They were also found on the rope that was wrapped around the neck.

270
00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:10.646
That's proof that he strangled Kano with that rope!

271
00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:11.646
No.

272
00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:15.846
Morofushi. Did Yamato touch the rope by the neck back then?

273
00:15:15.846 --> 00:15:17.046
No.

274
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:20.646
I was near the corpse until forensics got there

275
00:15:20.646 --> 00:15:23.646
but nobody touched the rope by his neck.

276
00:15:23.646 --> 00:15:26.246
Considering the testimony of a witness,

277
00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:29.946
who claim to have seen Yamato under the bridge

278
00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:32.646
where Takeda's corpse was found,

279
00:15:32.646 --> 00:15:35.646
including the random shooting incident that occurred nine years ago

280
00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:39.546
and the barricade incident at the bank six months ago.

281
00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:42.246
I think that a BOLO search is appropriate.

282
00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:46.146
But Inspector Yamato would never commit murder!

283
00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:49.346
We should prioritize justice over emotions right now.

284
00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:52.546
If we let him get away, we may regret it.

285
00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:54.646
Okay. We'll set up checkpoints immediately

286
00:15:54.646 --> 00:15:57.246
and get custody of Yamato at all costs.

287
00:15:57.246 --> 00:16:00.146
Don't go easy on him just because you know him.

288
00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:06.046
Remember that he's a serial killer that killed three officers in a row!

289
00:16:06.046 --> 00:16:09.246
I'm going back to headquarters to carry out an investigation meeting.

290
00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:12.646
Oh, but what about Akiyama's body?

291
00:16:12.646 --> 00:16:16.546
The ground's muddy from the rain and it's already this dark.

292
00:16:16.546 --> 00:16:19.746
We can retrieve his body after daybreak, right?

293
00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:22.446
Saegusa, you get in my car!

294
00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:24.746
I think it'll be too cluttered in Morufushi's car

295
00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:28.546
with the spare tire in the backseat and all.

296
00:16:28.546 --> 00:16:31.446
"Mount Saijo Observation Platform"

297
00:16:33.146 --> 00:16:34.146
Hey.

298
00:16:34.146 --> 00:16:36.846
Is it true that Inspector Yamato brought down

299
00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:39.446
the body of Lieutenant Kano?

300
00:16:39.446 --> 00:16:40.646
Yes.

301
00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.246
Kansuke got on a chair.

302
00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:45.246
Then Mr. Akiyama and the others held the corpse up a bit.

303
00:16:45.246 --> 00:16:48.246
But, Inspector Yamato has a bad leg, doesn't he?

304
00:16:48.246 --> 00:16:52.346
Kansuke's tall and besides, if the thinks the person can still be saved,

305
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.446
he'll do what he can without thinking.

306
00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.946
Come to think of it, it was the same the other day too.

307
00:16:56.946 --> 00:16:58.446
The other day?

308
00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:00.946
You mean something similar happened before too?

309
00:17:00.946 --> 00:17:02.246
Yeah.

310
00:17:02.246 --> 00:17:05.046
The parents of the suspect of the bank confined case

311
00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:06.646
that came up a while ago,

312
00:17:06.646 --> 00:17:09.146
couldn't put up with the treatment they were getting from the neighbors

313
00:17:09.146 --> 00:17:11.246
so they hung themselves.

314
00:17:11.246 --> 00:17:13.346
Even back then as soon as he got to the scene,

315
00:17:13.346 --> 00:17:16.046
Kansuke got onto a chair and took them down.

316
00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:18.346
But, unlike Mr. Kano's time,

317
00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:22.446
he just untied the knot of the rope that was tied to the beams back then.

318
00:17:22.446 --> 00:17:25.846
Then, how was the rope that Lieutenant Kano was hung by?

319
00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:32.346
Well, he was hanging from a rope made from two connected loops.

320
00:17:32.346 --> 00:17:35.846
The upper loop was tied around the light bar.

321
00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:39.446
Kansuke grabbed the upper loop with both hands

322
00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:42.346
and removed it from the lamp.

323
00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:47.546
Did that rope by any chance look like this?

324
00:17:47.546 --> 00:17:49.046
Yeah.

325
00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:51.746
Then when he lay the corpse on the floor,

326
00:17:51.746 --> 00:17:53.446
do you remember who was where?

327
00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:56.346
If I remember correctly,

328
00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:58.646
Inspector Morofushi and Mr. Akiyama were bent down near the corpse,

329
00:17:58.646 --> 00:18:01.546
but the others were standing some distance away.

330
00:18:01.546 --> 00:18:04.246
Then, didn't something happen back then?

331
00:18:04.246 --> 00:18:06.646
Like something that would distract everyone's attention?

332
00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:07.646
Now that you mentioned it,

333
00:18:07.646 --> 00:18:11.546
a message from Takeda's phone thought to be sent by the suspect

334
00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:13.646
was sent to Kano's phone,

335
00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:16.646
which was in the body's coat pocket.

336
00:18:16.646 --> 00:18:19.346
It said, "There are three woodpeckers left"

337
00:18:19.346 --> 00:18:23.046
When you overlay the mail that was sent to Kasuke's cell phone that said,

338
00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:27.546
"I shall destroy the woodpeckers. I'm the God of War!"...

339
00:18:27.546 --> 00:18:30.646
If we exclude Mr. Akiyama, who was killed after that,

340
00:18:30.646 --> 00:18:34.046
it means that the killer is going to kill two more people, right?

341
00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:37.046
But, who? And for what?

342
00:18:37.046 --> 00:18:38.846
What is this woodpecker bit about?

343
00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:41.446
I can't say for sure just yet

344
00:18:41.446 --> 00:18:43.446
but I more or less know whose life

345
00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:45.146
the perpetrator is most likely after next.

346
00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:46.546
What?

347
00:18:46.546 --> 00:18:48.046
It's the names.

348
00:18:48.046 --> 00:18:49.546
I don't know why

349
00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:52.446
but the three who've been killed up to now all have names similar

350
00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:58.046
to the generals that have been killed at the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima.

351
00:18:58.046 --> 00:19:00.546
Chief Takeda, who was the first one murdered,

352
00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:01.746
corresponds to Nobushige Takeda.

353
00:19:01.746 --> 00:19:04.446
Police Lieutenant Shoji Kano, who was killed next,

354
00:19:04.446 --> 00:19:06.246
corresponds to Tadatsugu Hajikano,

355
00:19:06.246 --> 00:19:09.046
and Police Sergeant Shinosuke Akiyama, who was killed just a while ago,

356
00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:10.146
used to go by the name Aburakawa,

357
00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:11.746
so it corresponds to Nobuyoshi Aburakawa.

358
00:19:11.746 --> 00:19:14.046
And, who are the other two?

359
00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:18.046
Inspector Mamoru Saegusa who is only one letter off from Morinao Saegusa

360
00:19:18.046 --> 00:19:20.646
and the one who felt responsible for the strategy that failed

361
00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:22.246
and threw himself into the hands of the enemy,

362
00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:24.546
the General of Takeda Army,

363
00:19:24.546 --> 00:19:26.546
Kansuke Yamamoto!

364
00:19:26.546 --> 00:19:27.746
What?

365
00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:31.246
Just what kind of grudge does anybody have against Kansuke anyway?

366
00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:32.246
It may have something to do

367
00:19:32.246 --> 00:19:35.946
with the confined bank case that occurred six months ago.

368
00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:38.846
Will you tell me the details of it?

369
00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:42.446
You mean the case where Chief Takeda shot the suspect.

370
00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:45.546
The fact was that suspect was on the verge of turning himself in

371
00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:47.946
after being persuaded by the police

372
00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:50.846
but the Takeda Squad that had the place surrounded made a forced move,

373
00:19:50.846 --> 00:19:53.346
and the suspect who saw this went berserk,

374
00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:56.446
firing the gun that he had randomly inside the bank.

375
00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.146
Mr. Takeda who had no choice but to charge into the bank,

376
00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:01.446
and shot the suspect. Fortunately, there were no other casualties.

377
00:20:01.446 --> 00:20:05.246
But, Kansuke was outraged at Mr. Takeda.

378
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.746
Don't tell me that you think it's okay

379
00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:09.946
to kill suspects just because you're a cop!

380
00:20:09.946 --> 00:20:10.946
So he said.

381
00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.246
Come to think of it,

382
00:20:12.246 --> 00:20:16.346
the cell phone of the suspect seems to have gone missing in this case.

383
00:20:16.346 --> 00:20:18.046
Although he seems to have been talking to someone on it

384
00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:20.346
up to the time he was shot.

385
00:20:20.346 --> 00:20:23.246
He said things like, "If they arrest me, you're finished too."

386
00:20:23.246 --> 00:20:27.446
"They'll find out where the gun came from as well as about the X".

387
00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:28.446
The X too?

388
00:20:28.446 --> 00:20:29.646
Find out?

389
00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:31.646
Is that true?

390
00:20:31.646 --> 00:20:35.846
Yes, Akiyama was wondering and mentioned something like that the other day,

391
00:20:35.846 --> 00:20:37.046
but haven't you heard?

392
00:20:37.046 --> 00:20:38.946
Right. Inspector Saegusa may know about it

393
00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:41.046
because he also belongs to the Takeda Squad.

394
00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:42.746
What?

395
00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:44.946
"Shoji Kano" -Why's Lieutenant Kano's text mail address

396
00:20:44.946 --> 00:20:47.746
listed under the alphabet "T"?

397
00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:50.446
It's because Mr. Kano formerly went by the name Tsuchiya,

398
00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:52.946
but he took after his wife's family name after getting married.

399
00:20:52.946 --> 00:20:54.446
Tsuchiya?

400
00:20:54.446 --> 00:20:55.746
"X"?

401
00:20:57.046 --> 00:21:00.046
What's the suspect after anyway?

402
00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:02.046
What grudge does he have against the people

403
00:21:02.046 --> 00:21:04.146
who died in the Battle of Kawanakajima?

404
00:21:04.146 --> 00:21:05.646
No.

405
00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:08.746
It's not the people who died in battle, it's the "X".

406
00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:10.446
Either way, it seems that Kansuke is included

407
00:21:10.446 --> 00:21:14.446
in the list of people to be murdered.

408
00:21:14.446 --> 00:21:16.746
Really! Where on earth were you?

409
00:21:16.746 --> 00:21:18.446
I was worried about you!

410
00:21:18.446 --> 00:21:20.346
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:21.846
I tell you, really...

412
00:21:21.846 --> 00:21:24.746
And, were you able to get in touch with Yamato?

413
00:21:24.746 --> 00:21:26.046
No, not yet?

414
00:21:26.046 --> 00:21:28.746
His time he's phone's been busy right through.

415
00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.346
Investigation First Section Chief Kuroda,

416
00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:33.446
we got a tip just now that a man resembling Yamato was witnessed.

417
00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:37.546
I want to go and confirm it, but there's no car available.

418
00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:38.646
Oh, good timing.

419
00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:41.346
Morofushi, will you lend me your car?

420
00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:43.746
No. I don't think so.

421
00:21:43.746 --> 00:21:45.746
Is there a problem?

422
00:21:45.746 --> 00:21:49.446
No. Mr. Saegusa's driving is a bit rough, you see.

423
00:21:49.446 --> 00:21:50.446
Morofushi.

424
00:21:50.446 --> 00:21:51.446
Yes, sir.

425
00:21:51.446 --> 00:21:54.246
This is an emergency. Let him use it.

426
00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.546
It's an order.

427
00:21:55.546 --> 00:21:56.546
Yes, sir.

428
00:21:56.546 --> 00:21:57.846
Go ahead.

429
00:21:57.846 --> 00:21:59.146
Sorry. Thanks.

430
00:21:59.146 --> 00:22:02.046
If the tip's credible, report back immediately!

431
00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:03.546
Roger!

432
00:22:05.746 --> 00:22:08.246
I'm Bishamonten.

433
00:22:08.246 --> 00:22:11.046
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

434
00:22:11.046 --> 00:22:12.646
I'm the God of War!

435
00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:25.946
"Flow forward like the river, Yamato"

436
00:22:25.946 --> 00:22:29.546
"Flow forward like the river."

437
00:22:29.546 --> 00:22:30.846
Kansuke.

438
00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:54.846
"Next Episode" -It's mail from Kansuke.

439
00:23:54.846 --> 00:23:57.246
I'm going to expose X!

440
00:23:57.246 --> 00:24:00.146
How do you know about X?

441
00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:01.746
X?

442
00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:04.046
That's what I thought at the time.

443
00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:08.446
I didn't know The Woodpeckers Club was called X.

444
00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:09.946
Kansuke.

445
00:24:09.946 --> 00:24:12.546
I came to pick you up as you told me to.

446
00:24:12.546 --> 00:24:13.746
Yamato?

447
00:24:16.546 --> 00:24:21.946
Next Conan, "The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 3)"

448
00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:24.489
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:24.489 --> 00:24:26.789
"Woodpecker"

450
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:28.589
They sure make nice sounds with their beaks.

451
00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:29.689
I guess you could say they like pecks on the lips.

452
00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:31.489
Seriously.
