1
00:00:01.392 --> 00:00:03.732
The famous high school
detective Shinichi Kudo

2
00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:05.562
was forced to take a strange poison
by a certain organization,

3
00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:08.072
causing him to shrink
and become Conan Edogawa!

4
00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:09.272
Doesn't matter if I'm small!

5
00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:11.272
My mind's that of a brilliant
17-year-old detective!

6
00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:14.312
I'll solve another case today that would
have adults shaking in their boots!

7
00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:50.617
The Case of the Coded City Map.

8
00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:58.517
Secret Treasures of the World Exhibit

9
00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:00.957
It's so pretty!

10
00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:03.427
Totally awesome!

11
00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:05.857
Amazing!

12
00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:08.827
A map to buried treasure?

13
00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.267
That sure was fun!

14
00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:13.037
I really liked that gold mask!

15
00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:15.367
There's still tons of secret
treasure all over the world

16
00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:18.007
that hasn't been discovered yet!

17
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.447
For reals?! I wanna try and find some!

18
00:02:25.777 --> 00:02:27.417
What's this?

19
00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:28.747
What is it?

20
00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:30.757
What's with this piece of paper?

21
00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:33.217
It has a bunch of
strange symbols on it...

22
00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.927
Hey! Maybe it's a treasure map!

23
00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:38.927
A treasure map?

24
00:02:38.927 --> 00:02:40.267
Yeah, right!

25
00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:44.937
What?! Are you sayin' you can't
believe what Ayumi says?!

26
00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:46.037
But...

27
00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.307
But what?

28
00:02:48.307 --> 00:02:50.007
What are you getting so mad about?

29
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:51.607
But what?!

30
00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:52.977
Let's go check it out!

31
00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:53.607
I agree!

32
00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.047
Yeah!

33
00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:58.217
Ayumi's definitely right about this!

34
00:02:58.217 --> 00:02:59.777
Yeah!

35
00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:02.787
What if it really is a 100%
genuine treasure map?!

36
00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.457
Exactly! What if it is a real map?!

37
00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:06.157
So, let's go check it out!

38
00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.127
Definitely!

39
00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:11.127
Alright then! Let's go treasure hunting!

40
00:03:11.127 --> 00:03:13.967
From this day forth we'll be known
as the Junior Detective Club!

41
00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.427
Huh? Junior Detective Club?

42
00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:17.937
That sounds so cool!

43
00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:21.007
I, Genta Kojima, will be club leader!

44
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:22.167
Any objections?!

45
00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.537
Nope!

46
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.137
My head's starting to hurt...

47
00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:27.377
Let's go!

48
00:03:27.377 --> 00:03:28.907
Yeah!

49
00:03:32.247 --> 00:03:33.247
Go where?

50
00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:34.917
Don't ask me...

51
00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:38.417
Let me have a look at
that piece of paper...

52
00:03:42.957 --> 00:03:45.497
Look at this very top symbol.

53
00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:47.167
Haven't you seen this
somewhere before?

54
00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:53.967
Hurry!

55
00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:54.837
Alright!

56
00:03:56.067 --> 00:03:57.837
Come on!

57
00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:05.547
Dino Cavane, the Italian crime lord
who was arrested last night

58
00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:11.087
at an apartment complex near Tokyo Tower,
has so far refused to say anything.

59
00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:15.957
The police are currently
pursuing Cavane's accomplices,

60
00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:18.157
but they have been unable to find any
clues leading to their whereabouts.

61
00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:21.427
The location of the 15,000
Maple Leaf gold coins they stole

62
00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.297
is also unknown.

63
00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.267
To Tokyo Tower

64
00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:31.677
I thought the Tokyo Tower was
suspicious from the very beginning!

65
00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:34.247
Now the treasure is as good as ours!

66
00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:38.417
But what do you think
these letters mean?

67
00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:40.847
It says "ORO" here, but...

68
00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:43.787
Oro? Orochi? (Giant serpent)

69
00:04:43.787 --> 00:04:45.717
I bet it's an abbreviation!

70
00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:48.087
The first O stands for ookii,
which means big!

71
00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.857
The R means rich!

72
00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.497
And the last O stands for otakara,
which means treasure!

73
00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:58.637
So, that means it's a big treasure
that will make you rich!

74
00:04:59.037 --> 00:05:02.337
Wow! I didn't know you could
read English, Mitsuhiko!

75
00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:04.877
Well, just a little.

76
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.017
I bet it's a huge treasure!

77
00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:12.247
Hey now!

78
00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:16.217
Alright! I'm gonna use that treasure
to eat the world's best eel dishes!

79
00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:18.787
I'm gonna go around
the world 100 times!

80
00:05:18.787 --> 00:05:22.187
I'm going to buy a space shuttle
from NASA and go into space!

81
00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:23.927
What about you, Conan-kun?

82
00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:25.857
I'll save it, I guess...

83
00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:28.097
You don't know how to have fun, do ya?

84
00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:29.967
Well, excuse me.

85
00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:44.277
Alright! Here we are!

86
00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.617
All that's left is to decipher the code!

87
00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:49.217
But none of the other symbols
look like anything,

88
00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:52.357
except for the one that
looks like an umbrella...

89
00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:59.097
That's it! It's the moon!

90
00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:04.767
The treasure must be where the moon
and Tokyo Tower line up like this!

91
00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:07.537
That can't be it.

92
00:06:07.537 --> 00:06:09.837
The moon's position changes everyday,

93
00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:13.707
and I doubt you could specify exact
locations with such simple drawings.

94
00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.907
Then where is it?!

95
00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:19.177
Conan-kun, did you figure anything out?

96
00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:25.087
I was wondering if the other symbols
are abbreviations for things.

97
00:06:25.087 --> 00:06:28.227
Like this symbol beneath
the tower could be a hat.

98
00:06:28.227 --> 00:06:30.087
Beneath that might be underwear.

99
00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:33.097
The umbrella beneath that could be
an emblem on a sweater or something.

100
00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:36.767
And the thing that links
them all together...

101
00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:38.297
A clothes store!

102
00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.567
But this isn't enough to really...

103
00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:42.567
Hurry!

104
00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:44.237
H-Hey!

105
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:56.217
Find it!

106
00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:59.287
There has to be a clue
in here somewhere!

107
00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:02.857
Come on! Faster!

108
00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.427
Hey, stop it, you three!

109
00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.997
Get out!

110
00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.467
Stupid little kids!

111
00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:15.407
I never want to see you here again!

112
00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:18.837
Looks like it didn't have to do
with clothing stores after all...

113
00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:19.607
Nope...

114
00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:20.877
I sure am hungry...

115
00:07:21.277 --> 00:07:22.807
Wanna go eat something?

116
00:07:22.807 --> 00:07:23.577
Sure.

117
00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.447
Hey, why don't we stop by a bookstore?

118
00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:28.717
Stupid! You can't eat
anything at a bookstore!

119
00:07:29.117 --> 00:07:30.857
Just for a short while. Okay?

120
00:07:32.457 --> 00:07:33.857
Whoa!

121
00:07:33.857 --> 00:07:35.387
Hey, check this out! It's hilarious!

122
00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:36.557
Yeah, it is!
Hey, check this out! It's hilarious!

123
00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:37.227
Yeah, it is!

124
00:07:37.227 --> 00:07:39.957
O-R-O. ORO?

125
00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:42.497
Was there such a word in English?

126
00:07:44.037 --> 00:07:45.997
No luck, it's not in there...

127
00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:48.167
Which means...

128
00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.107
Italian...

129
00:07:57.417 --> 00:07:58.817
I really doubt it...

130
00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.747
Here it is!

131
00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:06.287
Oro in Italian means gold!

132
00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:11.657
Which means this code really
does show where treasure is!

133
00:08:12.627 --> 00:08:15.027
The accomplices of the Italian
crime lord Dino Cavane,

134
00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:19.667
who was caught yesterday,
are currently in Japan.

135
00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:23.107
The whereabouts of the 15,000
Maple Leaf coins they stole

136
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:25.137
are, as of yet, unknown.

137
00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:29.077
These coins, which total over
600 million in Japanese yen, were...

138
00:08:29.077 --> 00:08:32.577
600 million, huh? These guys
must know what they're doing.

139
00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:35.587
You've trashed the place up again?!

140
00:08:35.587 --> 00:08:38.457
Can you get any worse?!

141
00:08:41.857 --> 00:08:44.897
That reminds me, where's the runt?

142
00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:46.897
If you mean Conan-kun,
he left early this morning

143
00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:49.067
to go to the art museum
with his friends.

144
00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:53.637
Kids sure got it easy.

145
00:08:54.107 --> 00:08:57.837
Come on, Dad! At least help
clean up a little!

146
00:08:59.577 --> 00:09:00.777
Fine, fine.

147
00:09:00.777 --> 00:09:02.777
According to Italian authorities,

148
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:09.917
three of Cavane's accomplices are on
the run, and one of them is Japanese.

149
00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:19.657
What's up with Conan-kun?

150
00:09:19.657 --> 00:09:23.267
How should I know? That's all
he's been doing since we got here!

151
00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:25.197
Do you think maybe he
figured something out?

152
00:09:25.537 --> 00:09:28.137
It's hopeless!
I can't figure it out!

153
00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:31.177
What is this code?!

154
00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:34.847
Is it a map? Or is it
some kind of message?!

155
00:09:36.047 --> 00:09:37.577
Darn it!

156
00:09:39.777 --> 00:09:41.047
Look!

157
00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.247
Could that be it?!

158
00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:47.127
See! That sign! It looks
just like the 2nd symbol!

159
00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:49.287
Hey, it does!

160
00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:49.987
Which means...

161
00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:52.797
Could these symbols
actually represent...?

162
00:09:54.697 --> 00:09:58.837
It has to be! This shop's directly
in front of Tokyo Tower,

163
00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:03.407
and the next symbol has
the shape of this sign!

164
00:10:03.407 --> 00:10:07.977
So, if we follow this order of
store signs, we'll find the treasure!

165
00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:11.047
But which way should
we go from here?

166
00:10:17.787 --> 00:10:20.157
Moon View Street!

167
00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:24.597
Could the moon symbol next to the tower
actually represent Moon View Street?!

168
00:10:24.597 --> 00:10:26.727
I bet it does! Let's go!

169
00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:27.567
Yeah!

170
00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:31.667
Look! There it is!

171
00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:33.667
An upside-down triangle sign!

172
00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:37.007
You're right! It looks
just like the third symbol!

173
00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:40.807
So, these symbols really do represent...

174
00:10:41.277 --> 00:10:43.247
An aquarium!

175
00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:45.617
That's it! I figured it out!

176
00:10:45.617 --> 00:10:49.247
This code is a map from Tokyo
Tower to the Nanbu Aquarium!

177
00:10:49.247 --> 00:10:53.727
They drew the signs and displays
of stores along Moon View Street!

178
00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.657
And the final destination...

179
00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.497
...is a mountain of treasure!

180
00:10:59.957 --> 00:11:01.467
Okay! Let's go!

181
00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:02.767
Yeah!

182
00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:19.477
I didn't see the 5th star-shaped
symbol anywhere...

183
00:11:19.477 --> 00:11:23.617
Darn! And we were so close
to the treasure!

184
00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:24.587
Huh?

185
00:11:25.087 --> 00:11:27.057
We've made it all the way to the aquarium!

186
00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:29.427
What?!

187
00:11:29.427 --> 00:11:31.397
How can this be?!

188
00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:35.067
We never even found the 5th
symbol on Moon View Street

189
00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:38.037
between Tokyo Tower
and the Nanbu Aquarium!

190
00:11:38.037 --> 00:11:40.307
Or am I assuming something incorrectly?

191
00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:45.007
Wait. Why is "gold" written in Italian?

192
00:11:45.007 --> 00:11:48.147
If the person who wrote this was Italian,
then the moon symbol...

193
00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:51.017
Could it be...?

194
00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:55.817
That's it! I figured it out!

195
00:11:57.657 --> 00:11:59.857
We need to go back
to where we started!

196
00:12:00.227 --> 00:12:02.327
Hey! Conan!

197
00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:15.702
It's hard to think that the person
who wrote "gold" in Italian

198
00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:18.172
would use the moon symbol
to represent Moon View Street,

199
00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.132
which is in Japanese!

200
00:12:19.132 --> 00:12:22.702
The moon represents night and the
things you can only see at night!

201
00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.442
Neon signs!

202
00:12:25.842 --> 00:12:28.642
Conan! What did you figure out?

203
00:12:29.412 --> 00:12:33.352
This is a treasure map comprised
of the shapes of various neon signs.

204
00:12:34.222 --> 00:12:37.182
The neon sign in the
2nd symbol is over there!

205
00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:45.062
There!

206
00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:47.032
You're right!

207
00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:49.532
Next we go down by the stadium!

208
00:12:49.532 --> 00:12:52.232
We just need to find
an umbrella-shaped sign!

209
00:12:52.932 --> 00:12:56.142
I don't see any umbrella-shaped
signs anywhere...

210
00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.542
Are you sure you've got it right?

211
00:12:58.542 --> 00:13:00.642
I already found it.

212
00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:01.712
Tomorrow's Weather

213
00:13:01.712 --> 00:13:02.342
There.
Tomorrow's Weather

214
00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:02.682
There.

215
00:13:04.582 --> 00:13:07.152
What're you talking about?
That's the sun.

216
00:13:08.182 --> 00:13:10.422
That's it! The symbol for rain!

217
00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:14.192
Rain must've been in the forecast
for the day after they wrote the code!

218
00:13:15.422 --> 00:13:17.392
Next is a neon sign
shaped like a star!

219
00:13:20.862 --> 00:13:22.562
I found it!

220
00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:24.502
This has to be it!

221
00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:26.372
A Ferris wheel!

222
00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:29.402
There's no doubt about it!
It's the 5th symbol!

223
00:13:29.402 --> 00:13:32.142
So, we should see
the 6th sign from here!

224
00:13:32.142 --> 00:13:34.612
Where is it?!

225
00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:49.422
There it is! The 6th neon sign!

226
00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:59.372
Say, Conan, there's really
gonna be treasure here, right?

227
00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:04.612
Yeah. This symbol has "ORO"
written next to it, after all.

228
00:14:04.612 --> 00:14:07.842
I've been looking for the
last fish-shaped sign for a while,

229
00:14:08.512 --> 00:14:11.812
but I just can't seem to find it.

230
00:14:12.212 --> 00:14:14.222
Of course not.

231
00:14:14.222 --> 00:14:16.352
This is a residential street.
There's nothing on it.

232
00:14:16.352 --> 00:14:19.092
The closest fish would probably
be in a nearby river or something.

233
00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.992
That's it! The river!

234
00:14:20.992 --> 00:14:23.462
It must mean a river with fish in it!

235
00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:24.132
Huh?

236
00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:26.732
Okay! Let's go check out the river!

237
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:29.562
Hey now!

238
00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:34.772
Come on, Genta-kun! Stop!

239
00:14:36.002 --> 00:14:38.072
That's dangerous, you know!

240
00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:41.942
Quit yer yappin'! The treasure has
to be at the bottom of this river!

241
00:14:42.942 --> 00:14:43.982
Cold!

242
00:14:44.412 --> 00:14:49.922
No! This code represents things
you can only see at night!

243
00:14:50.282 --> 00:14:54.062
So, the fish symbol at the end
can't represent the river.

244
00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:59.232
If my guess is correct,
then it has to be somewhere nearby!

245
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.162
A fish-shaped neon light...

246
00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:17.182
Conan-kun?

247
00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.882
I finally found it.

248
00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:24.422
The glowing fish, that is.

249
00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.592
A glowing fish?

250
00:15:28.592 --> 00:15:31.062
Never heard of any.

251
00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:33.562
Just follow me.

252
00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:35.032
Come on already...

253
00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:39.732
Is there really gonna
be a glowing fish here?!

254
00:15:41.042 --> 00:15:44.672
Hey! It's so dark I can't see anything,
much less any fish!

255
00:15:45.242 --> 00:15:47.412
Take a look outside.

256
00:15:47.812 --> 00:15:48.982
Towards that river.

257
00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:50.082
The river?

258
00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:51.912
See! Over there!

259
00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:54.382
That's the glowing fish!

260
00:15:57.292 --> 00:16:00.422
The lights are reflected on the water
and make it look like a fish!

261
00:16:00.422 --> 00:16:03.422
And the fish's eye is the light
on the building in front of us!

262
00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:06.032
Does that mean the treasure's in here?!

263
00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:06.992
Yeah.

264
00:16:06.992 --> 00:16:09.532
It's probably located right around...

265
00:16:17.442 --> 00:16:18.242
...here!

266
00:16:22.712 --> 00:16:23.782
A gold coin...

267
00:16:27.482 --> 00:16:30.282
What's that black shadow?!

268
00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:31.922
It looks like it's connected to a rope.

269
00:16:32.752 --> 00:16:34.062
Now I see.

270
00:16:34.062 --> 00:16:36.222
They raised the sacks of gold coins up

271
00:16:36.222 --> 00:16:38.462
by looping the rope around part
of the ceiling that sticks out!

272
00:16:46.002 --> 00:16:48.242
It's the treasure!

273
00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.982
Thanks for the help, kiddos!

274
00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:58.612
W-Who are you guys?

275
00:16:59.012 --> 00:17:01.652
Weren't they the ones I saw
in front of Tokyo Tower?

276
00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:04.592
Wait! Maybe they're the...

277
00:17:04.592 --> 00:17:07.792
Give it back! We found those first!

278
00:17:07.792 --> 00:17:09.162
Stop!

279
00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:10.592
Bam! Smash! Crash!

280
00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:12.562
Darn it!

281
00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:15.102
Are you alright, Genta-kun?

282
00:17:16.832 --> 00:17:21.102
I see. They still don't know
where the coins are.

283
00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:23.972
Who are those people?

284
00:17:23.972 --> 00:17:26.342
Members of that Italian
crime ring, most likely!

285
00:17:26.342 --> 00:17:28.542
Crime ring?!

286
00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:31.682
Come to think of it, I heard
about them on the news!

287
00:17:31.682 --> 00:17:34.522
That means those coins
just now must've been--

288
00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:36.252
That's right.

289
00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:42.092
We swiped these coins from
an Italian bank a year ago.

290
00:17:42.092 --> 00:17:44.462
Just like our Boss Cavane told us to.

291
00:17:44.462 --> 00:17:49.002
But then he backstabbed
us and ran off to Japan.

292
00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:53.942
With the 15,000 Maple Leaf
coins in tow, of course.

293
00:17:53.942 --> 00:17:57.842
We tailed him to Japan
and paid him a visit!

294
00:17:57.842 --> 00:18:01.042
But he had hidden the coins somewhere!

295
00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:05.782
He wouldn't tell us where he hid 'em,
no matter how much we interrogated him.

296
00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:10.022
All we found at his place was this code!

297
00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:13.592
He wouldn't help us out, so we
informed the police of his location,

298
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:18.092
and set out in search of the coins
ourselves, relying only on his code.

299
00:18:18.962 --> 00:18:22.802
The wind blew the paper away
when we stopped by the art museum.

300
00:18:23.332 --> 00:18:26.602
But we saw you cracking
the code little by little,

301
00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:28.892
so we decided to let you keep going.

302
00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:32.912
Never imagined you'd actually
find it for us though!

303
00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:37.182
A gun!

304
00:18:41.152 --> 00:18:43.122
Conan-kun!

305
00:18:43.482 --> 00:18:46.722
So, tell me! Where are the coins?!

306
00:18:46.722 --> 00:18:48.562
You better speak up!

307
00:18:51.132 --> 00:18:52.792
The fish.

308
00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:53.492
What?

309
00:18:53.492 --> 00:18:56.602
The coins are hidden at the
location where the fish symbol

310
00:18:56.602 --> 00:19:00.842
and the night view of the bridge
outside match up!

311
00:19:01.502 --> 00:19:03.172
I see.

312
00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:10.682
Conan! What'd you tell him for?!

313
00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:14.322
We're as good as dead
once they find the treasure!

314
00:19:14.322 --> 00:19:17.252
They're gonna kill us no matter what!

315
00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:22.092
They're gonna shoot us to death, I bet...

316
00:19:22.092 --> 00:19:26.562
I bet they're gonna stick us in cement
and drop us into the ocean...

317
00:19:26.562 --> 00:19:31.002
No, they're going to burn us to death
so there's no proof left behind!

318
00:19:31.002 --> 00:19:33.102
Mom...

319
00:19:33.102 --> 00:19:34.872
Dad...

320
00:19:34.872 --> 00:19:36.502
Mommy...

321
00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:41.682
It's too early to give up just yet!

322
00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:45.352
We still have a chance!

323
00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.452
If we all work together, that is!

324
00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:50.052
How will that do anything?

325
00:19:50.052 --> 00:19:52.152
We're just children!

326
00:19:52.522 --> 00:19:54.722
Aren't we the Junior Detective Club?!

327
00:19:56.792 --> 00:19:59.162
Alright! So, what do we do?

328
00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.932
Get up. But make sure they don't notice.

329
00:20:07.872 --> 00:20:09.542
We only have one shot at this!

330
00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:20.112
The moment that they find the
coins and let their guard down!

331
00:20:23.252 --> 00:20:24.122
Now!

332
00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:25.592
Run!

333
00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:56.122
We did it!

334
00:20:57.892 --> 00:21:00.892
Afterward, we went straight
to a nearby police station

335
00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.922
and explained everything
that had happened.

336
00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:07.502
To everyone's delight, the gang was
arrested and the case was closed.

337
00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:11.332
It wound up being the Junior Detective
Club's very first accomplishment!

338
00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:00.682
You're amazing! All of you!

339
00:23:00.682 --> 00:23:02.642
I can't believe you cracked that code!

340
00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:05.052
And you even captured some thieves!

341
00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:07.982
It was me! I caught them!

342
00:23:07.982 --> 00:23:11.292
And I used my reasoning
to decipher the code!

343
00:23:12.952 --> 00:23:14.622
Don't listen to them!

344
00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:20.962
It was Conan-kun who cracked
the code and beat up the gang!

345
00:23:22.732 --> 00:23:25.472
He was so cool!

346
00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.442
Conan-kun.

347
00:23:32.772 --> 00:23:33.272
Kiss

348
00:23:33.672 --> 00:23:35.042
Thank you!

349
00:23:38.612 --> 00:23:43.822
Good for you, Conan-kun!
You've made a cute little girlfriend!

350
00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:46.292
N-No, I didn't...

351
00:23:46.292 --> 00:23:48.492
Now he's embarrassed! How cute!

352
00:23:48.492 --> 00:23:51.662
No, really!

353
00:23:53.492 --> 00:23:55.062
Lousy Conan!

354
00:23:55.902 --> 00:23:57.332
Lousy Conan!

355
00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:04.812
Darn it! There's still
something I want to ask you!

356
00:24:05.512 --> 00:24:07.482
Who has the bomb?!

357
00:24:07.482 --> 00:24:09.982
Huh? Where is it? I can't find--

358
00:24:16.942 --> 00:24:19.672
There's only one way
to make her believe me!

359
00:24:19.672 --> 00:24:22.822
If I tell her that
I'm actually Shinichi Kudo!

360
00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:25.892
Who are you really?

361
00:24:25.892 --> 00:24:27.522
On the next Conan--

362
00:24:27.522 --> 00:24:29.892
The Great Bullet Train Explosion.

363
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.454
Next Conan's Hint:

364
00:24:50.454 --> 00:24:50.459
Next Conan's Hint:
Cell Phone.

365
00:24:50.459 --> 00:24:52.971
Cell Phone.
