1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,640
Wow, great!

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,740
Poirot's really on it.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,240
See!

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,340
The other day, an interviewer came

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,740
and told me that it was going to be published

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,540
but I didn't think the article was going to be so big!

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,940
Your picture's on it too, Azusa.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,040
See, over here!

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,640
It says Tai the calico cat owned by a patron of this shop

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,040
together with the beautiful waitress Azusa.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,940
Oh, true! You're carrying Tai!

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,540
Geez, calling me a beauty is going too far, no?

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,340
They usually exaggerate when writing articles like this.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,340
I guess so.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,440
Your picture's not here Amuro?

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,540
No. I wasn't feeling good that day

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,740
so I took a day off.

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,240
Oh, that's too bad.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
After all, you're handsome.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,440
Well, a member of the Black Organization

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,040
couldn't afford to show his face that easily

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,140
on a cheap gourmet magazine like this.

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,740
By the way, I thought there was one other person in your group?

24
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,840
Ai went home already!

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,940
We invited her to come to Poirot to see Tai.

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,640
She said she suddenly remember she had something to do.

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,140
Come to think of it...

28
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,740
Where's Tai?

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,940
Did he already come to eat?

30
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,340
No. Well, you see...

31
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,940
From last week, Tai's become my pet!

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,040
What?

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,440
Is it okay to do something like that?

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,940
Tai's a stray cat but was wearing a collar,

35
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,440
so I think he belonged to someone before.

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,640
But...

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,340
The other day, he seems to have fought with a cat in the neighborhood

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,340
and came along all beat up.

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,440
So, I got worried.

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Besides, our picture was put in a magazine too.

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,140
If Tai's owner is really looking for him,

42
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,140
I figured the owner would come to claim him.

43
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,540
But, but...

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,240
It's not fair keeping Tai all for yourself.

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,840
Besides, the owner would never come to claim him

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,340
because the picture's so small!

47
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,840
If the picture was posted on the net,

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,640
it'd be a different story, though.

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,140
So you'd think, right?

50
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,640
But, you'd be surprised.

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,740
Excuse me.

52
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,340
Is this the shop Poirot that was in the magazine?

53
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,440
Yes.

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,740
It was written in the article, right?

55
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,540
That at sundown a stray cat comes to eat cat food.

56
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,940
-With its picture and all... -Yes.

57
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,940
"Shogo Amezawa (36), Free-lancer" -In fact, that's my cat!

58
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,040
I've been looking for it from about half a year ago.

59
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,040
Hey! Just what do you think you're saying?

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,140
"Teiji Masuko (54)" -That's unmistakably my pet cat!

61
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,340
"Company President" -Don't lie!

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,740
What?

63
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,540
Wow. The owner actually showed up.

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,940
Moreover, two of them.

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,540
It... it's not just two of them!

66
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,940
The fact is, there's one more person in the shop.

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,840
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,640
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

69
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,340
Three owners come to claim their pet?

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,140
Kogoro and Bourbon have a deduction tag match.

71
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,040
His name is Detective Conan!

74
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:54,394
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 1)"

75
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,394
Hey! Do I have to keep repeating myself?

76
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:01,594
"Mutsumi Shagawa (61)" -This cat is my granddaughter's pet cat!

77
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,194
"Housewife" -Mugi.

78
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:04,794
Where's Mugi?

79
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,794
Weren't you going to bring her here?

80
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:08,894
Yes.

81
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,594
I went outside to try to bring the cat

82
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:14,994
but I met these children and while talking to them,

83
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:18,994
these people came claiming that they are the owners.

84
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:22,394
No, I'm the real owner.

85
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,794
No, you're not! I'm telling you it's me, aren't I?

86
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:28,794
Do you people mean to snatch my granddaughter's cat away?

87
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,394
Wow! Tai is really popular.

88
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:33,294
But, why are there three owners?

89
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:36,794
He's only an ordinary calico cat, and yet...

90
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,194
The thing is, he's not ordinary.

91
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,294
-What? -What?

92
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:43,994
I do think he's smart

93
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:47,394
because when we were trapped in the car of the bad courier guys,

94
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:51,494
Tai seems to have delivered Conan's message here.

95
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:54,394
Back then, Tai really did a good job!

96
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:57,094
But... Although he delivered it,

97
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:59,994
that message was blown away by the wind, right?

98
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:00,994
Yes.

99
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,194
At any rate.

100
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,794
Please go back home and bring Tai here!

101
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:06,994
Okay.

102
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:08,894
While we're waiting,

103
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:12,694
let's hear what the three people have to say, separately.

104
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:16,194
Let's ask the master of solving mysteries to join us too.

105
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:19,494
Master of solving mysteries?

106
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,094
Don't tell me...

107
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,394
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What? Searching for the owner of a cat?

108
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,694
-The horses are all starting off at once. -Go have somebody else do it!

109
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,294
I'm busy now!

110
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:29,594
Geez.

111
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:32,394
Goro.

112
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,794
Why's he here?

113
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,394
This cat is that scary lady's cat, right?

114
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,794
Scary lady...

115
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:42,694
Mom's on a business trip in Fukuoka,

116
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,694
so I was asked to take care of him for the night!

117
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:48,494
Go home! Go home!

118
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:52,094
Nobody's paying me for the job, right?

119
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:55,094
Then, I'll ask you to do the job.

120
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:57,594
The payment for the job will be a premium seat ticket

121
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,594
for the Yoko Okino Summer Live.

122
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:05,294
First of all, claiming to be the owner...

123
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,794
Mrs. Shagawa, you're a housewife?

124
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,794
Yes.

125
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,594
He's really a super simpleton.

126
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:15,294
And? When did your cat disappear?

127
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:17,394
About 2 months ago.

128
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:21,194
We asked a friend to watch it for us since we went on a family trip.

129
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:25,294
But, it seems to have gotten away when my friend wasn't watching.

130
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:27,494
This is the picture of my granddaughter,

131
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,994
the owner of the cat.

132
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:32,094
This was taken 5 years ago.

133
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:35,594
I see. It still seems to be a kitten, though.

134
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:39,494
It's true that the pattern on its body looks similar.

135
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,594
Right? You think so too, don't you, Mr. Detective?

136
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,694
Yes.

137
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:46,594
Then do you like cats too, ma'am?

138
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:48,794
Yes, of course.

139
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:52,094
Okay. Come here, come here.

140
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:58,494
Oh, my. This cat is quite shy, no?

141
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:00,694
It likes you a lot, doesn't it?

142
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,594
It's not my cat though.

143
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:05,194
The cat in question had traces of it

144
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,894
having been neutered.

145
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:11,094
We had a tough time back then.

146
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,894
It was hospitalized for a night and came back

147
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,394
but we couldn't take the bandage off for a while.

148
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:20,294
It took about a week to get the stitches removed.

149
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:24,494
Mr. Masuko, President of an IT company.

150
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:28,494
You're the 2nd candidate for owner.

151
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,694
When did the whereabouts of your cat become unknown?

152
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,794
Just about 4 months ago when I moved.

153
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,394
My wife of 30 years passed on.

154
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:42,694
I sold my house and moved to a condo.

155
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:46,794
I thought I had it in a cage and carried it onto the truck

156
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:50,994
but when it came time to get off it was gone from its cage.

157
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,994
Do you have a picture or something?

158
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:55,894
If it's one that I took with my cell phone.

159
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:58,594
The one in the picture with the cat is my wife.

160
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:00,394
I'm the one who took the picture.

161
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:04,994
This cat is the exact duplicate of the cat at Poirot.

162
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:08,794
Of course, because it's the same cat.

163
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:11,094
Then, do you like cats too, sir?

164
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:12,094
Yeah.

165
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,594
Would you like to carry him?

166
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:18,194
Do you have a cold?

167
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,194
Maybe so...

168
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:24,094
By the way, was your cat neutered?

169
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:26,194
Yes. But I'm not sure

170
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:29,694
because I used to leave things like that up to my wife.

171
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,394
Only, even after the surgery,

172
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,294
there was no bandage around it but for some reason,

173
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:38,694
I remember it had what looked like a parabola antenna on its neck.

174
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,894
I'm telling you if you let me see the cat,

175
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:44,494
you'll be able to see for yourself right away

176
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,694
that I'm the owner.

177
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:49,494
Well, let me hear you out either way.

178
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:51,594
Free-lancer, Mr. Amezawa.

179
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,594
When did your cat disappear?

180
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,694
About a half year ago.

181
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:59,394
I like being free, so likewise with my cat.

182
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:02,994
One day, it suddenly didn't come home!

183
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:04,694
Then, do you have a picture of it?

184
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,794
What makes you think I'd have something like that?

185
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:08,894
I let it go free.

186
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:11,194
Then, you like cats, don't you?

187
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,994
Yeah. Of course.

188
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,394
Come here!

189
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:20,594
No joke.

190
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:23,194
Goro isn't that much of a friendly cat, and yet...

191
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:26,494
It seems that animals take well to me.

192
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:30,294
Then, do you remember neutering your cat?

193
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:31,394
I wonder...

194
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:35,694
Somebody gave it to me after it was quite an adult already.

195
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,094
By the way,

196
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,094
the article addressed Tai as if it were a male

197
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,494
but it's actually a female cat.

198
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:45,694
Well... Then, maybe it's not mine.

199
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:46,894
Just what do you think you're saying?

200
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:48,594
Tai's a male!

201
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:50,394
He had balls.

202
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:51,894
Is that right?

203
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:56,094
Don't scare me! I'm sure it's a male!

204
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,594
"Mouri Detective Agency"

205
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:04,594
So, who among those three was the owner?

206
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:06,994
Maybe it was that young man after all?

207
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,394
Goro really liked him too.

208
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:12,094
But, the picture that the man had in his cell phone

209
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,294
looked just like Tai.

210
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:18,094
But, he himself, wasn't in the picture.

211
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,194
What about the picture the lady showed us?

212
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:25,194
But that was a picture of the cat when it was a kitten.

213
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,594
What do you think, Conan?

214
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:30,894
-I'm not really sure yet. -The final straight course.

215
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,194
-That's it! Go! -Dad, turn the volume down.

216
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,994
Everybody's thinking you know!

217
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:35,994
Noise?

218
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,494
That's right.

219
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,294
I'll let Ai know too.

220
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,394
Three people showed up claiming to be Tai's owner?

221
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,394
And? How was it?

222
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:50,694
They're all thinking really hard who the owner really is.

223
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,894
I mean, what does Conan think?

224
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,294
How does he look?

225
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:02,694
He's grinning wearing a mischievous look.

226
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:04,494
If so, it'll be fine.

227
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,994
I guess he's found the owner.

228
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:19,928
Hey, hey, just what is the meaning of this?

229
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:24,128
Didn't you gather us here because you found the owner?

230
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:26,828
So, Azusa from Poirot

231
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,528
will be bringing the calico cat here soon.

232
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,528
If so, why didn't you say so to start with?

233
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,228
We'll all find out who the owner is

234
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:36,928
as soon as we see the cat.

235
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:41,328
But, in my case, my granddaughter is the owner.

236
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,428
Thank you for waiting!

237
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,528
Tai!

238
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:54,128
See! It's my cat after all!

239
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:57,628
Okay, I'm taking this cat home with me, then!

240
00:12:57,628 --> 00:13:01,028
But, if there are three people,

241
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:03,828
cats have a tendency to go to the person in the middle.

242
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:06,228
It could be that Tai jumped on you

243
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:08,428
because you happened to be in the middle.

244
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:11,228
-What? -Is that true, Conan?

245
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:13,828
Yes! I saw it on TV the other day.

246
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,928
I'm sure he's right!

247
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,928
Otherwise my cat would never go to a shady guy like him.

248
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,228
Then, try it again!

249
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:24,428
I don't care if I'm on the left or the right!

250
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,628
There's a better way do it!

251
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:31,328
An experiment that will nail the owner at once!

252
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,828
Azusa, are you ready?

253
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:39,628
Yes! Tai's eating his food in front of the door of the office.

254
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:43,028
Will each of you approach the door and open it?

255
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,228
If it's one to one,

256
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:47,328
I'm sure the cat will be able to distinguish its owner.

257
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,328
First you, Mrs. Shagawa.

258
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,328
Yes.

259
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:02,028
Come, Mugi. It's me!

260
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:03,628
Can't you tell?

261
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:07,028
Mugi!

262
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:11,728
It... it's no good after all unless it's my granddaughter, the owner.

263
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:15,128
No. It's the same even if she were here!

264
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:17,428
Because that cat that you're looking for,

265
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,028
unlike that cat is a female cat.

266
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,228
What?

267
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,728
That right, isn't it, Amuro?

268
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:28,028
Yeah, Mrs. Shagawa, you mentioned, didn't you?

269
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:30,628
That when the cat was spayed, the cat was hospitalized...

270
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:33,328
And it took a week before the stitches were removed.

271
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:34,428
Yes.

272
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,328
That was because the cat was spayed

273
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:39,928
and not neutered.

274
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:43,428
Spaying is surgery that includes making an abdominal incision

275
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,428
and removing the ovaries.

276
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:49,428
But neutering involves only a slight incision

277
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:50,928
to remove the testes.

278
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,928
So hospitalization isn't necessary.

279
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,728
Well, just as Mr. Masuko mentioned,

280
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,428
all it takes is putting a collar around the cat's neck

281
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:00,828
so it doesn't lick the spot.

282
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:02,328
Besides, ma'am,

283
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:06,428
you mentioned that you kept the cat together with your granddaughter

284
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,928
but wasn't it that she just used to bring the cat over

285
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:10,628
to your place only sometimes?

286
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:13,228
Because you're not used to handling the cat!

287
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,028
Other than the owner,

288
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:18,328
cats don't like being stared at.

289
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:21,928
That's why back then,

290
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:26,528
the cat went over to Uncle Kogoro who isn't interested in it!

291
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:30,828
You were probably asked by your granddaughter to take care of the cat

292
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:33,028
because she had to leave the house,

293
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,728
but it got away, right?

294
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,728
It's exactly as you say, sonny.

295
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,228
My granddaughter's on a school trip

296
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:43,428
and her parents took this opportunity to travel abroad.

297
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:46,728
I was asked to take care of the cat

298
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,928
but it wouldn't take too well to me.

299
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,928
And the minute I took my eyes off it,

300
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,428
it disappeared.

301
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:57,028
I was at a loss as to what to do

302
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:01,128
then I saw the picture of that cat in the magazine.

303
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,928
So, you decided that you wanted Poirot's cat

304
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,428
in place of the cat that disappeared?

305
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,828
But, I think a male and female

306
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,828
have different physical characteristics.

307
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:15,128
But, my granddaughter's coming back from her school trip tonight!

308
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:19,628
I've got to do something by then or I can't face up to her.

309
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,428
When did your cat disappear?

310
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,528
Last night after it finished eating cat food.

311
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:28,628
I looked all over under furniture

312
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:30,728
and places where the door were open

313
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,728
but to no avail.

314
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:36,428
Then, try looking in places where the doors are closed,

315
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,728
like in the bathroom, in the washing machine

316
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:39,828
or in the closet for example.

317
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:45,228
Cats tend to slide in the moment doors are opened.

318
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:48,128
I'll try looking once more!

319
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:53,128
Gosh. What a granny.

320
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:56,128
Next! Try it Mr. Amezawa!

321
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,928
Just like Mrs. Shagawa did right now!

322
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,128
Okay! Sure!

323
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:02,828
Well, even before doing it,

324
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,828
the result is obvious though.

325
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:06,628
Right, Conan.

326
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,128
Just like a while ago.

327
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,528
The cat's going to jump on him and purr.

328
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:18,428
Hey, what's the matter?

329
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,628
Come like you did before.

330
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,528
I'm telling you come here!

331
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,128
Don't you know?

332
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:29,828
Catnip's only good for 5 to 10 minutes.

333
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,428
After that, to the cat...

334
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:36,628
you're only a scary man shouting.

335
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:37,828
As proof of that,

336
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:40,828
even Goro who was frolicking with you at first

337
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:45,028
is afraid of you and doesn't even attempt to go near you!

338
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:50,128
Well, the real owner wouldn't sprinkle catnip over his body

339
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:53,228
when coming to pick the cat up.

340
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,228
Well, this is...

341
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:59,428
Besides, you were about to leave on the spot

342
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:02,528
when Conan mentioned that the cat was female, no?

343
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:03,928
If you saw the picture in the magazine

344
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:06,328
and was sure it was your cat,

345
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:10,628
you would've insisted a lot more.

346
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,128
You knew, didn't you?

347
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:15,728
That the cat was worthless if it were female.

348
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,428
Worth? It's only a mix, isn't it?

349
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:22,228
True for female calicos but...

350
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,128
As for males because of chromosomal aberration,

351
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:27,128
only one out of a thousand are born.

352
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:28,528
Because of this rarity value,

353
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:31,528
they have served as models for the so-called luck cats.

354
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,328
They're worth at least 1 million yen.

355
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:36,728
I've heard that some were even priced as high as 20 million yen.

356
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:38,628
Twenty million yen?

357
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:39,728
No joke.

358
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:43,128
-Wow, Tai! -Just as valuable as the white lion!

359
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:47,128
If that much money, I could eat unlimited eels over rice.

360
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:50,128
You apparently knew what it was worth,

361
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:53,428
so would never have let it go free in a city like this, no?

362
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,328
Excuse me!

363
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:04,128
Lastly, Mr. Masuko, please try doing it.

364
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:06,328
Okay.

365
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:09,528
But, I haven't seen him for 4 months,

366
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:12,928
and my wife used to feed him most of the time...

367
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:18,228
I may end up with the same result as the other two.

368
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,928
Souseki.

369
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:28,828
You remembered me, Souseki.

370
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:31,628
But, why?

371
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,328
It seems he was waiting for you in front of the door

372
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,228
even before you opened it.

373
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:36,328
The sound.

374
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:42,028
They said on TV that cats have super good ears

375
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,228
and can tell the footsteps of their owners!

376
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:48,428
You said that your cat disappeared when you moved

377
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:52,528
but were you using the Cheetah Movers back then?

378
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:55,628
Yeah... But, how'd you know?

379
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,328
Because some time ago that cat

380
00:19:57,328 --> 00:20:02,628
jumped into the container of the same courier.

381
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,928
I see.

382
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:08,128
He wanted to go back to his owner!

383
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:10,328
He thought that he could get home

384
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:12,228
if he got on a truck with the same mark on it.

385
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:14,528
I'm happy for you, Tai.

386
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:22,728
Thank you so much for everything.

387
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:25,628
Bye, Tai!

388
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:27,028
Take care!

389
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,328
Don't run away anymore!

390
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:37,828
This is my address and e-mail address.

391
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:40,428
You can come over if you want and I'm home!

392
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:42,628
Really? Thank you.

393
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,528
But, I didn't know

394
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:51,628
that cats were attracted to people in the middle.

395
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:53,928
That's not true.

396
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:58,328
I had to say that in order to carry out the footsteps experiment.

397
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:04,128
I lied by faking an innocent smile as sweet as a cat.

398
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:08,028
You see... After all we're dealing with a cat.

399
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:09,628
Is that supposed to be a pun or something?

400
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:38,528
"A week later" -But, I didn't think he'd actually call us.

401
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:41,228
An e-mail was received at the detective agency saying,

402
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:44,028
to come today if we want to see the cat, right?

403
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:47,128
-Yeah. -It's only been just a few days yet since then.

404
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:48,728
I wonder why?

405
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:51,728
Maybe he decided to give it away, after all?

406
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:54,428
It seemed he was allergic to cats too.

407
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:56,328
Allergic to cats?

408
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:58,828
And yet he kept a cat?

409
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,028
Well, there are times when you keep a cat

410
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,328
not knowing that you're allergic to it.

411
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:06,328
Or even become allergic while keeping it.

412
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:09,828
But I wonder if he's going to sell it after all?

413
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:13,728
-What? -After all, it's 20 million yen.

414
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:16,428
It's that room, right, Mr. Masuko's place?

415
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,128
At any rate, please open the door!

416
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:19,928
Because I heard a strange sound!

417
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,328
Mr. Masuko! This is the Manager!

418
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:28,128
Are you all right?

419
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:32,428
What's with this cat?

420
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:34,128
Sir! Is anything wrong?

421
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:38,528
Well, although this cat doesn't seem to be hurt,

422
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,328
it's got blood on its paws.

423
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:41,528
Which means...

424
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,028
Don't tell me that Mr. Masuko...

425
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:45,528
Don't tell me...

426
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,328
There's blood on the paws.

427
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,428
I'm sure something happened inside!

428
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:57,828
Do you guys have a string or something?

429
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,228
The room beyond?

430
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:06,028
There's no time for you two to be lovey-dovey!

431
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,428
The tape and scissors are here...

432
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:12,328
but the wastebasket nearby is empty.

433
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:15,328
Why that think isn't it here?

434
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,728
Next Conan,

435
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:21,028
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 2)".

436
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:38,628
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:41,028
"Wrapping".

438
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:43,228
Right on, Part 2, tune in, yeah!

439
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:45,728
-That's a rapper. -It's supposed to be wrapping!
