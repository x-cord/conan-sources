1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:03,266
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:04,966
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,766
An eerie case and a night train

4
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,866
are rushed on by the sound of the departure bell.

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,566
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,566
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,979
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 1)"

9
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:10,679
Dear Mr. Kogoro Mouri, Ran and Conan,

10
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,679
how are you all doing?

11
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,279
I have somehow been able to get a hold of the tickets

12
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,579
for riding the North Star that I promised to get you.

13
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,379
I will be looking forward to seeing you all

14
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,179
-and so will Takeshi. -"And so will Takeshi.

15
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:26,179
Well, let's talk ourselves out after you arrive here.

16
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,179
Please enjoy your luxurious train ride to your hearts' content.

17
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:31,979
Natsue Hatamoto."

18
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,279
That is what she wrote.

19
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,079
She's the one who was involved

20
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,079
in the luxurious passenger liner incident, right?

21
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,479
After that, they left the Hatamoto residence

22
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,479
and began life on a ranch in Hokkaido.

23
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,379
How nostalgic...

24
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,479
We haven't seen them since that incident.

25
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,979
Well, I don't mean to brag,

26
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,479
but we get to ride on the royal suite of this North Star

27
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,379
thanks to the good work of the Sleeping Kogoro,

28
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,679
who solved the case!

29
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,879
Yes, we are very grateful and owe it all to you.

30
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
So long as you know!

31
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,279
This is the seventh time we're hearing this

32
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,679
since we boarded the train.

33
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,879
Anyway, I'm hungry.

34
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,679
Right.

35
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:18,579
It seems that Natsue has already dinner reservations for us, too.

36
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,279
So, why don't we head to the dining compartment?

37
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,979
It seems that the dining compartment is gorgeous, too!

38
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,979
Watch out, you idiot!

39
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,379
You are...

40
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,979
What? What's up?

41
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,679
Beats me...

42
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,479
Now, let's go eat!

43
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,379
I heard that it's a full course French cuisine!

44
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:52,779
Oh, really?

45
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:57,179
Just splendid having French cuisine in a train.

46
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,879
You can say that again.

47
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,279
Darn it. It's Kogoro Mouri.

48
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,679
"Yasuji Asama (39)" -They didn't tell me he was going to be around.

49
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,479
Gosh, I am so full!

50
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,879
It sure was delicious.

51
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,679
The food is good, the room is gorgeous...

52
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,379
We couldn't possibly ask for anything more.

53
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:19,779
What's with that rabbit hut?

54
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,279
I told you to reserve the royal suite, didn't I?

55
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,079
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,079
"Toshinori Kaetsu (38)" -But, owner, you mentioned that you wanted

57
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,379
to ride North Star only a week ago.

58
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,379
Being a very popular train,

59
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,579
we were lucky that we got the number

60
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,279
of individual compartments we needed.

61
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,979
"Keitaro Izumo (56)" -Just to think that I got stay in a room

62
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,379
that ranks the same as yours...

63
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,679
My wifes locked up in her room saying

64
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:44,179
she doesn't want anyone to see her taking a trip in a room like this!

65
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,379
That's why you should've taken a plane...

66
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,479
Shut up!

67
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,679
I wanted to go to tomorrow's auction on this train!

68
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,479
Excuse me.

69
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,079
Haven't I met you before?

70
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,579
I'm sure you've seen him on TV or in the papers.

71
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,479
Our jewelry shop was robbed the other day

72
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,279
and he was interviewed by various press people.

73
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,279
Oh, I see!

74
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,779
The one who got rid of the robber all by himself...

75
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,179
Was there such an incident?

76
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,779
Remember, the evening of the day that you went camping

77
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,879
with your friends.

78
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,379
It was no big deal.

79
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,879
The robber fled as soon as I shouted aloud

80
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,379
and rang the burglar alarm. That's all it was.

81
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,079
But everybody was surprised at how brave you were!

82
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,679
All the fuss for something like that...

83
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,779
But it was good advertisement for you, wasn't it?

84
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,579
"Akishige Ishizuchi (67)" -For you running as mayor...

85
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,179
in the next election.

86
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,979
You've got it made.

87
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,379
Mayor Ishizuchi? What brings you here?

88
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,679
I'm going on a short vacation to Hokkaido.

89
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,379
And what do you mean by he's got it made?

90
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,479
It's just a rumor.

91
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,879
There's a rumor going around

92
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,679
that the owner conjured up the robbery

93
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,679
in order to gather votes for the next election.

94
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,279
It's just groundless rumor.

95
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,479
But like they say, where there's no smoke there's no fire.

96
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,779
Hey.

97
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,079
But the one who was caught by the surveillance camera back then

98
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,079
was a professional robber with a record, wasn't he?

99
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,379
It couldn't possibly have been set up...

100
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,679
All more the reason to suspect him.

101
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,879
It's hard to believe that such a professional

102
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,079
would raid a place without checking it out first,

103
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,179
let the alarm go off and flee without taking anything.

104
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:26,279
That's not enough evidence to suspect the owner, is it?

105
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,979
That's not the only thing.

106
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:28,979
Huh?

107
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,179
The employees seem to have heard

108
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:35,679
the robber say something strange before he flee.

109
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,679
Something strange?

110
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:42,979
The robber seems to have said bitterly just before he fled,

111
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,379
"Nobody told me."

112
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,779
Is that true?

113
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,779
Yes, I heard the robber say something like that, too.

114
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,079
-If so, something smells fishy. -Wasn't there a similar incident...

115
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,179
-Just what do you think you're saying? -some time ago?

116
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,479
Who on earth are you anyway?

117
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,079
What? You don't know me?

118
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,879
Actually, I am none other than...

119
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,079
Kogoro Mouri.

120
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,679
You are, aren't you?

121
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,679
Yes.

122
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,679
"Toru Aoba (32)"

123
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,979
How lucky

124
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,479
to run into the renown detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri

125
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,079
in a place like this!

126
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,479
May I take a picture together with you later?

127
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,879
Yes.

128
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,079
Mouri...

129
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,879
Kogoro?

130
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:32,979
Seriously, coincidences can be so frightening.

131
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,479
Oh, you're Ms. Akechi who made reservations for dinner?

132
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,879
Your seat is that way.

133
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,379
I'm sorry, but I'm canceling my dinner.

134
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
Ms. Akechi?

135
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,979
"Fumiyo Akechi (37)"

136
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,479
Seems like it's going to be an interesting trip.

137
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,579
Hey, I'm pretty sure that there was an incident

138
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,279
where the robber fled without taking anything.

139
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,679
I don't know of any.

140
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:05,279
You must've watched a suspense drama something like that recently.

141
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,679
No, not recently.

142
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,279
But a long time ago.

143
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,079
I'm sure it was when I was still a kid.

144
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,079
Look, we've entered the Seikan Tunnel!

145
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,579
What's with you guys? Are you still awake?

146
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,679
Hey, it's already 4:00 am.

147
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,579
That's enough. Go to bed right now.

148
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,379
Darn it. I can't remember.

149
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,379
I'm sure I ran into that incident somewhere.

150
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,779
An incident really similar to the recent one.

151
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:38,879
Somewhere...

152
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,279
The sound of gun shot and screams

153
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,279
washed out the roar within the tunnel.

154
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,679
What was that?

155
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:22,679
What was that scream about?

156
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,079
Did you hear anything strange before this happened?

157
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,979
I'm sure it was gun fire.

158
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:30,679
Somebody was shot with a gun.

159
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,179
Idiot! We won't know it unless we go look!

160
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,879
That's true.

161
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,379
The man ran through the aisle as if he were a starved beast...

162
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,079
Not again.

163
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:47,779
Darn it! What's is this that I keep on hearing?

164
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,279
Hey, you...

165
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,779
It's a murder!

166
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,979
He shot a man...

167
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,579
What?

168
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,779
What the...

169
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,079
But the man was no longer anywhere in sight...

170
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,679
I won't let you get away!

171
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,779
Darn it. We're too late.

172
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:23,979
The wind and the sound of the train played their clamorous tune...

173
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:26,079
-Hey, stop the train right away... -I see.

174
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,679
-and get the police! -It's the novel.

175
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,079
Yes, sir!

176
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,079
This is just like the plot of that novel.

177
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,779
The one that Dad wrote a long time ago.

178
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,479
The novel that never came to light.

179
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:49,368
According to the driver's license

180
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,168
and name card the victim had on him,

181
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:57,468
he is Keitaro Izumo, age 56, a resident Furuichi City in Tokyo.

182
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:00,068
He seems to be the owner of a large jewelry store.

183
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,568
He was shot to death, right?

184
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,168
Yes. According to witnesses,

185
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,868
the killer came suddenly from behind the victim

186
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:08,368
and shot him.

187
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,668
It's obvious.

188
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:13,168
And what did the killer do after that?

189
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,768
He fled that way.

190
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:18,768
The conductor ran right after him, but...

191
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:22,568
He lost track of the killer

192
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,568
who ran past in front of my room,

193
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,568
fired at the window of his room and cracked it,

194
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:31,768
and fled outside from there!

195
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,768
Who are you?

196
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:37,368
Huh? You don't know me?

197
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,568
I thought you looked familiar...

198
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:44,368
You're the sleeping Kogoro, the renown Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

199
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,568
What?

200
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:48,468
You mean that cursed one who causes disastrous incidents

201
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:49,968
wherever he goes?

202
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:52,968
I wonder what kind of rumor is going around?

203
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:56,968
And? Are you the only one who saw the killer get away?

204
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,868
No, three of us.

205
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:03,068
Me, my daughter, Ran here and the other one is...

206
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:06,668
Huh? That brat's not around?

207
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,368
He was here just a while ago.

208
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:11,668
-Gosh, where did he go? -Conan?

209
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,568
Everything is exactly the same.

210
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,068
The strange remark made by the robber

211
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:23,768
and the shooting that occurs Mithin the train after that.

212
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:29,668
Everything synchronizes with that story.

213
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:31,968
The one that I read when I was a kid.

214
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,868
My Dad's novel that hasn't been published yet.

215
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:38,268
Darn it!

216
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:41,068
I only remember it vaguely because I was only a kid.

217
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,868
I thought I'd be able to get some hints from Dad.

218
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:46,668
I wonder where he is at a time like this...

219
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:56,268
Oh, Conan! There you are!

220
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,868
You shouldn't go skittering here and there.

221
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,268
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:02,668
Come, the police officer wants you.

223
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,968
Okay.

224
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:11,168
So, like I've been telling you...

225
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,568
The killer came running like this.

226
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:15,568
Then, he opened the door to his room,

227
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:18,868
fired his gun, cracked the window,

228
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:24,368
and fled outside after he fired twice at me.

229
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:30,068
But you didn't actually see the killer flee out of the window, right?

230
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,668
Well, not really...

231
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:34,968
And besides, would a killer normally throw his gun out in the room

232
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,268
and flee?

233
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:39,768
He fired six shots within the train.

234
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,568
There are still some bullets left.

235
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:46,368
It could be that while you were down after firing at you,

236
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,868
he fled into another room.

237
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:51,068
It couldn't be!

238
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:56,168
The killer closed the door just before I got here!

239
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,868
Maybe it just looked that way to you?

240
00:13:58,868 --> 00:13:59,868
What?

241
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,868
The lights of the corridor were dimmed,

242
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:06,468
and you seemed to be excited because you were fired at, too.

243
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,868
Come on, inspector.

244
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:10,268
That's true.

245
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,068
It's true that he closed the door back then.

246
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:16,868
But the inspector has a point, too.

247
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,368
It's also true

248
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:21,968
that we didn't actually see the killer flee out of the window.

249
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:25,468
Besides, it's unnatural for a killer on the run

250
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:27,968
to leave his gun behind.

251
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,368
Moreover,

252
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:34,168
why didn't the killer lock the door when he closed the door?

253
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:37,668
He could buy more time that way for sure.

254
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,968
And the greatest mystery is,

255
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:45,868
why this incident has the same plot as that novel?

256
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:51,068
Anyway, he could have fled into someone's room.

257
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,968
Shall we check all the rooms around here?

258
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,968
I guess I'll start checking from this room next door.

259
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,568
Yes.

260
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,468
I wonder if it's vacant?

261
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,068
It's so noisy!

262
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,468
Do you know what time is it?

263
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:11,268
I beg your pardon, I'm Inspector Nishimura

264
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:12,668
from the Hokkaido Police Department.

265
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:16,268
There's been a bit of an incident within this train.

266
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:17,268
An incident?

267
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,668
You mean you didn't notice a thing

268
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,668
with all that racket going on next door?

269
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,768
"Azusa Izumo (49)" -How should I know? I was fast a sleep.

270
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:28,268
Nevermind that. What is this incident that you're talking about?

271
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,968
Oh, well...

272
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,168
What's up?

273
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:35,068
A person was shot to death.

274
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,468
Mr. Keitaro Izumo, the owner of a jewelry store was killed

275
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,668
in the lobby on board this train!

276
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:43,068
-What? -What? It can't be!

277
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,468
Why? Why was my husband killed?

278
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:46,468
Your husband?

279
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:49,268
Anyway, please move so that I can search your room.

280
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:59,668
Mrs. Izumo, may I open this?

281
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,468
Yes. But who on earth killed my husband?

282
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:05,868
That's what we're investigating on now.

283
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,268
But...

284
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,468
Isn't this a shot gun?

285
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:14,168
Yes, I use it for clay shooting, my hobby.

286
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:17,068
I was planning to use it in Hokkaido.

287
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,868
Nobody's seems to be in here.

288
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,268
Yes, sir.

289
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:22,268
Let me check your room next.

290
00:16:22,268 --> 00:16:24,068
-Yes. -Inspector!

291
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,468
Please... please let me see my husband!

292
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,968
Please calm down, Mrs. Izumo.

293
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:29,568
It's over here.

294
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:35,668
What is that long bag over there?

295
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,568
Oh, it's a fishing kit.

296
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,368
Unlike his wife, the owner liked lure fishing.

297
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,068
I used to carry his bag around for him.

298
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,268
I see.

299
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:48,668
Next is the room right across.

300
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,868
That's the owner's room.

301
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,568
No one suspicious in here.

302
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,768
And next is this room with the stairs between it.

303
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:06,368
Darn it! What's with all these guys?

304
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:09,668
Hey, this is the police! Open up!

305
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,168
What is it?

306
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:13,768
Police. I would like to see your room.

307
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,968
Come in.

308
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,168
What is that on top of the bed?

309
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,968
It's a bamboo sword.

310
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:23,468
I was fixing it because it was coming apart.

311
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:26,568
I'm going to participate in a kendo match in Sapporo tomorrow.

312
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,668
Is anything wrong?

313
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,568
Well, sort of...

314
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,868
Darn it! We're getting nowhere!

315
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:36,968
Dispatch all the officers and check out all the rooms!

316
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,768
-Yes, sir! -What's all this commotion?

317
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,768
I'm completely sober now.

318
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:45,368
Where is your room?

319
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,068
Upstairs.

320
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:48,468
Excuse me!

321
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,768
Hey...

322
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:54,268
What's with you? Barging into my room like that...

323
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:56,168
It's just a golf bag.

324
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:59,568
Hey! You'd better cut it out or I'll call the police!

325
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:02,468
I am a police officer! Got any problem with that?

326
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:06,568
Did you find the killer?

327
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,768
If he could be found so easily, we wouldn't be having problems.

328
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:13,068
Come to think of it, there was a suspicious looking woman

329
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:15,868
in the lobby until just before the incident.

330
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:16,868
A woman?

331
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:18,868
Yes, she was wearing sunglasses

332
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:22,068
and seemed to be shooting glances at the person who was shot.

333
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,368
Could that have been me?

334
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:27,368
-It's her. -What?

335
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:30,968
I left the lobby to go to the restroom.

336
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:32,868
I was shooting glances at him

337
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:35,668
because the smell of his tobacco bothered me.

338
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:39,368
Excuse me, but where is your room?

339
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,168
Over here.

340
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:46,268
Oh, is that shoulder bag your only luggage?

341
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:50,368
Yes. Because I'm just going to Hokkaido to go horseback riding.

342
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:51,968
Horseback riding?

343
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:54,368
Oh, I've seen that before!

344
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,868
When you ride the horse,

345
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:00,268
you have to wear a helmet and a strange pair of slacks, right?

346
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:02,968
A culotte? Of course!

347
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:06,468
You're doing the works!

348
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:08,868
Of course, sonny.

349
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:12,168
Then, do you get rid of the dirty stuff (boro) by yourself, too?

350
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:15,468
Yes, I go and buy myself a new one on my own.

351
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,568
Including the gloves and boots, too.

352
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:21,168
Excuse me. The passengers are beginning to make a fuss.

353
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:23,568
We've got to start heading the train for the station.

354
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:24,768
No, no!

355
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:27,268
Don't move the train until we finish checking all the rooms.

356
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:30,168
We don't want the killer throwing evidence out of the window.

357
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:34,668
If so, maybe you should hurry and start searching inside the tunnel.

358
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:37,168
We've already started to!

359
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:39,968
Inspector Nishimura! In the tunnel...

360
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:42,768
We've found the body of a dead man in the tunnel.

361
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:44,868
What?

362
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:53,068
He seems to have hit his head hard.

363
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,368
He must have fell the wrong way when he fled out the window.

364
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,468
What an idiot.

365
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:00,868
Is this the man you saw?

366
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,968
-Yes. -I think so.

367
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:06,968
What's this?

368
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:11,568
Fake beard?

369
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,668
He's...

370
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,268
Yasuji Asama?

371
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,568
Hey, hey.

372
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:22,368
Isn't Yasuji Asama the one who...

373
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,968
Yes. The professional robber who raided the jewelry shop in Tokyo

374
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:28,668
and fled without taking a thing.

375
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:31,668
They seem to have been working together as a group of three,

376
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:34,768
but ever since one of the members died of dope,

377
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,568
they've been really quiet.

378
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,968
I was thinking that he goofed it

379
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,168
because it had been a long time since he did his last job.

380
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,668
But I didn't think I would meet him here.

381
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,068
Just a minute.

382
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,768
The one who was killed in the train

383
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:48,168
was the owner of the jewelry shop

384
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:50,168
that was robbed by Asama the other day!

385
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:51,268
What?

386
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:54,468
Something does smell fishy here.

387
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,168
Well, all is well.

388
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:01,368
Although he is dead, we've nabbed the killer.

389
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:04,768
Tell the conductor to start the train as usual.

390
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,068
Yes, sir!

391
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:22,968
The phone you have reached is not accessible

392
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:24,868
or switched off and cannot be connected.

393
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,468
Please call back later.

394
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:29,268
The phone you have reached is not accessible...

395
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,368
Hey.

396
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,368
Hi, sonny.

397
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,968
Did you want to talk to me?

398
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:48,368
Yes. I was amazed

399
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:51,868
at how well you disguised yourself.

400
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:54,868
You were lying about going horseback riding, weren't you?

401
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:59,168
You got on board this train for another reason, didn't you?

402
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:03,468
Just what're you talking about, sonny?

403
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:06,268
I'm really going horseback riding.

404
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:07,468
Idiot.

405
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:09,468
The dirty stuff (boro) that I was referring to a while ago

406
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,868
means horse dung.

407
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,568
You can't possibly be horseback riding

408
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:16,968
while not knowing something like that.

409
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,568
So, go ahead and reveal your true identity.

410
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:24,368
You've been busted already.

411
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:26,368
Lady.

412
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,568
"Next Episode" -You saw something strange?

413
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:10,768
It was a little before the incident occurred.

414
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,468
I wonder whose this is?

415
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,168
Wait a second.

416
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:18,068
If an object that shape were to be there...

417
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:22,668
If it were to be there...

418
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:27,368
I found it. There it is!

419
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,668
Next Conan,

420
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:33,389
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 2)"

421
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,670
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,470
"Costume for disguise"

423
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,370
Next, the trip and the case both come to close.

424
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,970
Those two are coming, Conan.
