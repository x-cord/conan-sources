1
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.640
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.540
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.240
Yuka's bluebird that's supposed to bring happiness

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.140
turns into a case.

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.840
Hurry to the scene Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:17.125
"The Youth Detective Squad Pursues the Bluebird"

10
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.025
It sure is cold again today, too.

11
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:26.425
They say the temperature

12
00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:29.525
is gonna be like it was in late November for three whole days.

13
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:30.725
Yuka.

14
00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.225
Konno from Class C.

15
00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:38.125
She's always standing in front of the cage watching the birds.

16
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.425
Yuka!

17
00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:42.925
Ayumi.

18
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:44.925
Do you like birds?

19
00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.725
Yes, I love them!

20
00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:49.225
I have a budgie at home, too.

21
00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:51.825
A blue one.

22
00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:53.225
What's its name?

23
00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:54.225
Chicchi.

24
00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:56.425
He's two years old and perches on people's hands.

25
00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:58.625
He also talks just a little bit.

26
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.025
You mean he speaks words?

27
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:01.725
I want to see him!

28
00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:04.425
Okay. Do you want to stop over at my house today?

29
00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:05.925
May I go, too?

30
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.925
Me, too! May I?

31
00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:11.225
You're Conan and Ai, right?

32
00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:13.025
-Oh, yes. -Oh, yes.

33
00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:14.725
You two are also welcome to come.

34
00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:17.225
But if all of us go at once...

35
00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:18.425
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:22.125
My mother is at work and won't be home until early evening.

37
00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:25.225
Your parents are both working. Same with me.

38
00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.725
In my case, it's a bit different though.

39
00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:33.025
Yuka's father died of an illness two years ago.

40
00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:34.525
Is that right?

41
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:42.025
Hey. Let's go together, Conan and Ai.

42
00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:45.925
Okay, let's all go see the hand perching budgie!

43
00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.125
Let's go!

44
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.625
We did it!

45
00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.025
What did we do?

46
00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:55.725
Do you know how to tell the difference between an adult male and female?

47
00:03:56.925 --> 00:03:59.025
Is it the size of their bodies?

48
00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:00.625
Is it the pattern on the feathers?

49
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.425
No.

50
00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:05.025
It's by the colour of the cere of the parakeet which is above the beak.

51
00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:07.625
Males have blue ceres while females have brown ones.

52
00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.125
Exactly!

53
00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.825
But despite Chicchi being a male,

54
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:14.225
his cere has recently been turning brownish.

55
00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:15.525
I wonder why?

56
00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.525
Are we not there yet?

57
00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:33.125
Huh? The door. It's unlocked.

58
00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.425
What?

59
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:37.025
Maybe it's a thief?

60
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:41.725
Stand back, everybody!

61
00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:44.625
Okay!

62
00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:46.725
All right!

63
00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:50.525
You two...

64
00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:51.525
Go ahead!

65
00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:53.225
I'm ready!

66
00:04:58.525 --> 00:04:59.825
Who are you?

67
00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.525
A thief?

68
00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:04.925
Hi! Welcome home, Yuka!

69
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:06.525
Do you know him?

70
00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:08.825
No, I don't.

71
00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.425
She's saying she doesn't know you!

72
00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:12.125
You're a thief after all!

73
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.425
No, I'm Shinya Sakaguchi.

74
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:18.725
I work at the Beika University research lab of the Engineering Department.

75
00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:21.725
I'm a friend of Yuka's mother.

76
00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:25.925
Yuka's mother manages a gardening shop in Haido City,

77
00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:28.425
and since she's going to be coming home late from work today,

78
00:05:28.425 --> 00:05:32.425
I was asked to eat out together with Yuka tonight.

79
00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:36.025
Your mother said that she told you so this morning, too.

80
00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:38.125
She didn't say anything to me.

81
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.325
-Yuka. -Please wait!

82
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:42.525
How did you come into the house?

83
00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:46.525
Well, Yuka's mother told me where the house key is hidden.

84
00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:47.525
Everybody!

85
00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:50.225
Never mind him, and come on in.

86
00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:53.725
Hello!

87
00:05:55.325 --> 00:05:56.625
In other words,

88
00:05:56.625 --> 00:06:00.125
you're very intimate friends with her mother.

89
00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:03.425
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.125
Will you stop pushing me?

91
00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:10.425
It's so spacious!

92
00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:12.225
The garden is nice, too.

93
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:15.325
But why are the windows all open?

94
00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:16.625
Oh, well...

95
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.225
I just thought that it would be nice to air the room out

96
00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:20.225
before Yuka came home.

97
00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:22.925
Chicchi, I'm home!

98
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:25.425
How cute!

99
00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:27.225
Its colour is beautiful, too.

100
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:30.025
What's the matter?

101
00:06:30.025 --> 00:06:34.025
Nothing, but it seems that Chicchi's become slightly smaller.

102
00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:36.525
I don't think so.

103
00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:37.625
It's just your imagination.

104
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.925
Chicchi! Chicchi!

105
00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:42.825
Chicchi, "Welcome back". Say, "Welcome back".

106
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:46.725
Strange.

107
00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:50.425
He always says welcome back when I come home, but...

108
00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:54.225
I'm sure he's nervous because your friends that he doesn't know is here.

109
00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:56.725
Did he talk this morning?

110
00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:58.825
He said, "Good morning" very energetically.

111
00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:20.925
So ticklish!

112
00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.725
Its cere really is brown, isn't it?

113
00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:28.825
Right.

114
00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:31.525
Do you have a cold?

115
00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:33.625
Yes, just slightly.

116
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.925
Is that why you're standing away from everyone else,

117
00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:37.325
because you don't want us to catch cold?

118
00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:38.725
Yes.

119
00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:44.325
I wonder why he had all the glass windows open despite having a cold?

120
00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:46.225
It sure is strange.

121
00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:47.625
Let's have some juice, okay?

122
00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:56.725
Hey. Could it be that you let the bird go?

123
00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:00.125
You went to the pet shop

124
00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.525
and bought a bird that looks just like the one she had, right?

125
00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:08.925
You left the windows open because the bird that fled may come back.

126
00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:10.225
I get it!

127
00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:13.225
And you bought a bird that was a bit smaller.

128
00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:14.825
That's why it doesn't talk!

129
00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:17.025
Come on and spit out the truth.

130
00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:19.225
No! Just what are you talking about?

131
00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:20.925
You spilled soy sauce, didn't you?

132
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:25.425
When I opened the refrigerator, I smelled soy sauce.

133
00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:26.825
Oh, right.

134
00:08:26.825 --> 00:08:29.725
The soy sauce container fell a while ago when I was putting the cake

135
00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:31.625
that I got for you into the refrigerator.

136
00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:34.525
Don't you dare open the fridge of other people's houses without permission!

137
00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:43.225
What's all the shouting for, Yuka?

138
00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:44.625
Mother?

139
00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.425
Hello...

140
00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.825
Hello.

141
00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:50.525
My client suddenly cancelled the appointment.

142
00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.625
Mr. Sakaguchi, let's go eat out together.

143
00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:57.125
No, I'll leave for today.

144
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.525
But...

145
00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:07.925
Conan, Ai, see you both tomorrow!

146
00:09:07.925 --> 00:09:11.725
It's already late. So go home straight, okay?

147
00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:13.125
Yes!

148
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.825
You guys go straight home and don't go rendezvousing some place together!

149
00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:18.825
Well, maybe that's not a bad idea.

150
00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.625
You've got to be kidding!

151
00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:24.225
Oh, my. What are you all worked up about, Conan?

152
00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:27.025
Conan is as dense as ever.

153
00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.225
But we've got to check this out, no matter what.

154
00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:30.625
Come on, let's go!

155
00:09:35.025 --> 00:09:37.425
Yes.

156
00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:39.425
A person who looks like this

157
00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:43.625
did come to buy a blue parakeet about two hours ago.

158
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.825
Really?

159
00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:45.825
Just as we thought!

160
00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:47.425
It's just like what Ai said.

161
00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:50.825
That man let the parakeet go!

162
00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.525
But he...

163
00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:54.725
was holding a dead parakeet in his hand.

164
00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:59.725
And he said to give him a parakeet just like the one he was holding.

165
00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:01.725
He seemed to be in a rush, too.

166
00:10:03.725 --> 00:10:07.525
It's so shocking that Chicchi was already dead.

167
00:10:07.525 --> 00:10:09.925
But Yuka said that the bird greeted her in good health this morning

168
00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:12.525
and said "Good morning", didn't she?

169
00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:16.125
Yes. Which means the bird didn't die of an illness.

170
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:20.425
Besides, it was in a cage so it couldn't have died accidentally either.

171
00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:23.925
Could it be that the man killed it?

172
00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:27.725
But if he rushed to go buy another parakeet after what happened,

173
00:10:27.725 --> 00:10:30.525
at least we know that he didn't do it on purpose.

174
00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:33.325
Then, did he mistakenly killed it?

175
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.225
What kind of work?

176
00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:41.325
Yes.

177
00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:43.325
Mr. Sakaguchi mentioned that he is working

178
00:10:43.325 --> 00:10:46.125
at the research lab at Beika University, didn't he?

179
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.925
I was just wondering what kind of research he was doing.

180
00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:51.625
Well, I don't really know,

181
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.125
but I think he's researching some kind of drug.

182
00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:54.225
-What? -What?

183
00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:55.925
Drug?

184
00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:58.325
But... It can't be!

185
00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:01.725
But I'm sure it was some kind of drug.

186
00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:03.325
-Conan! -Do you have a relative...

187
00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:05.625
-Don't, Ayumi! -by the name of Kitada?

188
00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:09.525
Well, because he always gets the credit.

189
00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:12.725
So this time, let's solve the truth ourselves.

190
00:11:12.725 --> 00:11:14.625
But...

191
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.225
Okay, Ayumi?

192
00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:17.425
Okay.

193
00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:41.488
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

194
00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:44.388
We're sorry to have called you out like this despite your busy schedule.

195
00:11:44.388 --> 00:11:45.588
We're sorry.

196
00:11:46.588 --> 00:11:50.088
Is your research lab in here?

197
00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:51.988
Yes, it is.

198
00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:54.088
May we see it?

199
00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:56.088
No, you can't.

200
00:11:56.088 --> 00:11:57.588
Why not?

201
00:11:57.588 --> 00:12:00.488
Because there are many dangerous chemicals inside.

202
00:12:00.488 --> 00:12:01.888
Dangerous chemicals?

203
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.088
Just as we thought!

204
00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:07.788
Actually, we went to the pet shop yesterday.

205
00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:11.988
The employee told us everything.

206
00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:14.288
Will you please explain the situation?

207
00:12:20.088 --> 00:12:23.988
I'm sorry. I lied yesterday.

208
00:12:23.988 --> 00:12:29.088
The fact is, when I got to Yuka's house, Chicchi was dead in the cage.

209
00:12:31.288 --> 00:12:34.288
Yuka really took good care of Chicchi,

210
00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.588
so I thought she'd be sad if she came back and found out.

211
00:12:36.588 --> 00:12:39.388
That's why I rushed over to the pet shop

212
00:12:39.388 --> 00:12:42.488
and bought a parakeet that looked like Chicchi at the pet shop.

213
00:12:42.488 --> 00:12:45.688
Then, what did you do with Chicchi that died?

214
00:12:45.688 --> 00:12:51.088
After I left Yuka's house at sundown, I buried it in a park nearby.

215
00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:56.388
Would you please take us there?

216
00:12:57.688 --> 00:13:00.088
We'd like to offer our prayers.

217
00:13:01.388 --> 00:13:03.788
Now? Well...

218
00:13:03.788 --> 00:13:05.788
You can't take us?

219
00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:07.788
I'm in the midst of an experiment right now.

220
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.788
I hate to say this, but maybe some other time.

221
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.988
-I'm sorry! -Mr. Sakaguchi!

222
00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:13.088
Hey!

223
00:13:15.088 --> 00:13:16.788
There's something suspicious about him.

224
00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:20.388
There's no doubt that he's the one who killed Chicchi!

225
00:13:20.388 --> 00:13:24.388
But I wonder what he did to kill it?

226
00:13:24.388 --> 00:13:26.788
Thank you very much.

227
00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:33.188
Isn't it this way?

228
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.088
He probably mistakenly spilled the chemical

229
00:13:36.088 --> 00:13:37.688
that he brought back from the research lab.

230
00:13:37.688 --> 00:13:40.688
The chemical probably splattered into the water container of the cage

231
00:13:40.688 --> 00:13:43.088
and the parakeet drank it.

232
00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:47.988
But that's too much of a coincidence, don't you think?

233
00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:51.088
Maybe it was an aerosolized toxin!

234
00:13:52.088 --> 00:13:55.588
What's that air something about?

235
00:13:55.588 --> 00:13:57.788
Aerosolized toxin, Genta!

236
00:13:57.788 --> 00:13:59.988
A process where liquid becomes gas.

237
00:13:59.988 --> 00:14:00.988
In other words,

238
00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:06.088
the parakeet inhaled the vapour of a poison that he mistakenly spilled!

239
00:14:06.088 --> 00:14:09.188
If this is what happened, everything falls into place!

240
00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:15.388
Mr. Sakaguchi opened the windows and door of Yuka's house

241
00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:20.688
because he thought that the vaporized poison may still be left in the air.

242
00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:25.288
His eyes were bloodshot and he was coughing

243
00:14:25.288 --> 00:14:29.288
because he inhaled the vaporized poison by mistake.

244
00:14:29.288 --> 00:14:32.188
That's why he stayed away from us.

245
00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:35.888
He wanted to stay away from the place he spilled the poison.

246
00:14:35.888 --> 00:14:39.588
I see! So the thing about him having a cold was also a lie.

247
00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:40.688
Hello!

248
00:14:41.688 --> 00:14:43.188
Hello?

249
00:14:43.188 --> 00:14:44.888
-Yuka. -Yuka.

250
00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:49.888
Hello!

251
00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:51.888
Thank you for all the food yesterday!

252
00:14:51.888 --> 00:14:54.488
Not at all. I didn't do anything at all.

253
00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:55.788
Are you shopping?

254
00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:58.588
Yes, we're having hand-wrapped sushi tonight.

255
00:14:58.588 --> 00:15:00.088
What a coincidence!

256
00:15:00.088 --> 00:15:03.888
We're going to Doc's house tonight to eat hand-wrapped sushi, too!

257
00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:06.788
Doc?

258
00:15:06.788 --> 00:15:08.388
Dr. Agasa.

259
00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:10.788
The inventor that lives in 2-chome.

260
00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:14.688
He talks like an old fart though.

261
00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:18.588
Is Mr. Sakaguchi coming for dinner, too?

262
00:15:18.588 --> 00:15:20.288
Well, I asked him over,

263
00:15:20.288 --> 00:15:23.288
but he turned me down saying that he is busy tonight.

264
00:15:25.788 --> 00:15:27.988
Please come over again.

265
00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:30.488
Yes, goodbye...

266
00:15:31.588 --> 00:15:36.188
Was it okay not telling them about the man?

267
00:15:36.188 --> 00:15:38.588
I was wondering what we should do too, but...

268
00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:41.988
Maybe we should tell them after things become clearer.

269
00:15:43.088 --> 00:15:45.188
Hello!

270
00:15:45.188 --> 00:15:47.188
Oh, you've come!

271
00:15:47.188 --> 00:15:49.188
-Doc, where's Conan? -Vinegar rice.

272
00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:51.488
-Conan again. -I smell vinegar rice.

273
00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:53.088
It's nothing.

274
00:15:53.088 --> 00:15:55.088
He'll probably get here soon.

275
00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:57.988
Haibara, would you like me to help you with something?

276
00:15:57.988 --> 00:16:00.988
Well, would you line out the plates?

277
00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:03.588
Okay! Sure.

278
00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:08.988
The point is why Mr. Sakaguchi brought the poison to Yuka's house.

279
00:16:08.988 --> 00:16:11.988
Don't tell me that he was trying to poison Yuka or her mother.

280
00:16:11.988 --> 00:16:13.988
I don't want to think that way,

281
00:16:13.988 --> 00:16:16.388
but the possibility cannot be denied either.

282
00:16:16.388 --> 00:16:19.288
Then maybe he already may have...

283
00:16:19.288 --> 00:16:21.888
Cake, cake!

284
00:16:21.888 --> 00:16:24.588
He put something in the cake that he bought!

285
00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:25.888
Genta.

286
00:16:25.888 --> 00:16:29.688
We already ate the cake at her house yesterday.

287
00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:32.988
Well, it's really not enough.

288
00:16:35.788 --> 00:16:38.588
That's right!

289
00:16:38.588 --> 00:16:43.788
Come to think of it, Yuka didn't eat the cake at all.

290
00:16:43.788 --> 00:16:46.888
She probably really doesn't like Mr. Sakaguchi.

291
00:16:46.888 --> 00:16:49.388
But then, what on earth is...

292
00:16:49.388 --> 00:16:52.688
My hunch is that he just took the poison to the house

293
00:16:52.688 --> 00:16:55.288
and hasn't done anything with it yet.

294
00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:56.788
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here taking it easy like this.

295
00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:59.988
Ai, here's the soy sauce. I wonder if this will be enough?

296
00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:05.088
The soy sauce container fell.

297
00:17:05.088 --> 00:17:07.488
Shoots!

298
00:17:07.488 --> 00:17:08.788
Don't tell me he put it in there?

299
00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:09.988
That's why Mr. Sakaguchi

300
00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:13.888
refused to have hand wrapped sushi together with them tonight!

301
00:17:13.888 --> 00:17:15.188
This is bad.

302
00:17:15.188 --> 00:17:16.288
We've got to stop them quick!

303
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:17.488
What? What is it?

304
00:17:17.488 --> 00:17:18.488
I'm going with you!

305
00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:20.988
Hey, wait!

306
00:17:20.988 --> 00:17:23.388
What's up? What on earth...

307
00:17:23.388 --> 00:17:25.088
I wonder...

308
00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:28.188
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya has made the mistake of a life time!

309
00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:31.388
We should've told Conan about this to begin with!

310
00:17:31.388 --> 00:17:33.388
There you go again.

311
00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:36.088
What if we don't make it in time?

312
00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:41.588
-Genta! -Genta!

313
00:17:53.588 --> 00:17:56.188
The traffic light's red!

314
00:17:56.188 --> 00:17:57.288
Quick! Quick!

315
00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:01.188
Turn green! Turn green!

316
00:18:02.388 --> 00:18:04.488
Please let us make it in time!

317
00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:12.388
Let's go around to the yard!

318
00:18:14.988 --> 00:18:16.988
We made it!

319
00:18:16.988 --> 00:18:18.088
They're alive.

320
00:18:19.588 --> 00:18:21.288
I'm so glad.

321
00:18:22.388 --> 00:18:24.788
What's the matter, everybody?

322
00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:28.788
Don't use that soy sauce! It is poisoned!

323
00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:30.488
Poison?

324
00:18:32.188 --> 00:18:33.888
What're you talking about?

325
00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:35.788
It's not poisoned.

326
00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:37.888
We're already using it and eating.

327
00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.188
Yes!

328
00:18:46.088 --> 00:18:47.088
Conan!

329
00:18:50.688 --> 00:18:51.888
Mr. Sakaguchi...

330
00:18:55.088 --> 00:18:56.888
Just as I thought.

331
00:18:56.888 --> 00:18:58.788
I thought this is what you guys were up to!

332
00:18:58.788 --> 00:19:01.488
Conan, what brings you here?

333
00:19:01.488 --> 00:19:03.088
Based on the look on your faces,

334
00:19:03.088 --> 00:19:06.088
it looks like your deduction is messed up.

335
00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:13.488
Then is it true that when Mr. Sakaguchi came here, Chicchi was dead?

336
00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:18.088
Yes. Very often little birds peck on food until just before they die

337
00:19:18.088 --> 00:19:21.688
and act healthy trying to hide the fact that they are ill.

338
00:19:21.688 --> 00:19:22.888
Why?

339
00:19:22.888 --> 00:19:24.988
When living in flocks,

340
00:19:24.988 --> 00:19:27.188
if they display any signs of being weak from an illness,

341
00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:30.588
they may become prey to an enemy and lose their life, right?

342
00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:32.688
Even if the parakeet is tame enough to perch on fingers,

343
00:19:32.688 --> 00:19:35.288
it has remaining instincts of when it used to be in the wild.

344
00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:36.588
I see.

345
00:19:36.588 --> 00:19:41.088
That's why it could say "Good morning" healthily like always.

346
00:19:41.088 --> 00:19:43.188
But there were signs of an upcoming illness.

347
00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:44.688
The cere of male parakeets

348
00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:48.188
seem to change from blue to brown when they get sick.

349
00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:55.188
Right. Chicchi's cere became brown because he wasn't in good health.

350
00:19:55.188 --> 00:19:57.188
I didn't know that.

351
00:19:57.188 --> 00:20:01.188
So Mr. Sakaguchi didn't cough or have bloodshot eyes...

352
00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:03.488
Because he inhaled poison?

353
00:20:03.488 --> 00:20:07.888
No, Mr. Sakaguchi really had a cold.

354
00:20:07.888 --> 00:20:09.788
He hadn't taken a bath for three days,

355
00:20:09.788 --> 00:20:12.688
so he thought that he had body odour.

356
00:20:12.688 --> 00:20:15.188
That's why he opened the windows and doors

357
00:20:15.188 --> 00:20:17.088
to keep the smell from enveloping the room.

358
00:20:17.088 --> 00:20:18.688
Moreover, that's the very reason why

359
00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:21.188
he was standing some distance away from Yuka after she came home.

360
00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:25.488
She's a girl. So I thought she'd dislike me even more if I smelled.

361
00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:29.788
I'm sorry, Yuka.

362
00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:34.088
He came a while ago to tell me that I should tell you the truth.

363
00:20:34.088 --> 00:20:37.788
That it would save you from being hurt.

364
00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:40.988
That's when I first realized how stupid I was.

365
00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:44.888
Life is invaluable.

366
00:20:44.888 --> 00:20:47.388
I think that you're regretting

367
00:20:47.388 --> 00:20:50.288
the fact that you didn't realize sooner that he was ill.

368
00:20:50.288 --> 00:20:53.988
But Chicchi was taken good care of by you,

369
00:20:53.988 --> 00:20:56.088
and I'm sure he was really happy.

370
00:21:00.488 --> 00:21:05.988
Since Chicchi's cere was brown, I mistakenly bought a female yesterday.

371
00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:14.388
It's a budgie!

372
00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:16.388
The cere is blue. It's a male!

373
00:21:16.388 --> 00:21:18.188
Fantastic!

374
00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:21.488
I was thinking about whether it's good or not

375
00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:23.488
to buy a new budgie right after Chicchi died but...

376
00:21:44.788 --> 00:21:46.488
Thank you.

377
00:21:57.588 --> 00:22:00.188
How lucky. You've got a family now.

378
00:23:37.388 --> 00:23:40.088
They sure are late. I wonder what they're doing?

379
00:23:40.088 --> 00:23:42.188
Why don't you go ahead and eat already?

380
00:23:42.188 --> 00:23:43.988
Right!

381
00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:46.388
Even if they don't roll back, I can't speak ill of them.

382
00:23:46.388 --> 00:23:48.888
Though I want to scream like a bream, but that's too fishy.

383
00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:51.188
Roll it and dip it. Here goes the soy sauce.

384
00:23:54.288 --> 00:23:57.788
Whether it's sushi or a play on words, the point is how fresh they are.

385
00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:01.688
"Next Episode"

386
00:24:01.688 --> 00:24:03.988
The dates of the five incidents that happened here.

387
00:24:03.988 --> 00:24:06.488
The first one was two years ago on February 4th.

388
00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:08.288
The next one was on July 4th.

389
00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:10.488
Last year, it also happened on February 4th and July 4th.

390
00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:12.588
And this year, it's April the 4th, right?

391
00:24:12.588 --> 00:24:16.288
Which means the day before those days are all Butsumetsu?

392
00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:29.588
Next Conan, "The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (The Case)"

393
00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:32.515
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:34.615
"Habit"

395
00:24:34.615 --> 00:24:36.415
Do you know what my seven habits are?

396
00:24:36.415 --> 00:24:38.415
Biting nails, digging your nose...

397
00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:39.415
Hey!
