1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.270
The Youth Detective Squad met a woman named Saki Midorikawa.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.070
"Saki Midorikawa (28)" -She helped Ayumi when she tripped

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.570
and hurt herself.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.370
We thought Ms. Saki was a kind, good-natured person,

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.370
but shortly afterwards, we noticed something strange.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.570
There were three people glaring at her.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.970
Women's university professor, Mr. Junnosuke Tachibana,

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.570
officer worker, Ms. Michiyo Konno

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.470
and social critic, Ms. Tatsuko Dojima.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.470
And then...

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.170
Ms. Dojima, did you find what you were looking for?

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.770
No. I thought I dropped it around here.

13
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.470
In my eyes are maximum creation.

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.070
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

15
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.670
A beautiful woman falls from a building.

16
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.570
What are the three mysteries connected to her window?

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.070
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.270
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:05.911
"The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 2)"

21
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:13.511
Looks like she fell to her death.

22
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.411
Yeah.

23
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:18.511
Did she fall from the roof?

24
00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:20.211
I knew it.

25
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.111
Ma'am!

26
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:27.711
You were at the intersection yesterday, right?

27
00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:29.211
What did you know?

28
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:31.811
"Naka Nakabayashi (73)" -The same thing happened to her yesterday.

29
00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:48.211
Miss!

30
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:50.111
What happened?

31
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.811
Did someone push her?

32
00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:01.611
So she was nearly killed yesterday too.

33
00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:04.511
Who pushed her?

34
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.111
I don't know!

35
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.211
Don't bring me into this!

36
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.611
Sounds like Ms. Saki may have been murdered.

37
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.911
The culprit came back to finish her off.

38
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:21.611
But who and why?

39
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.011
Those three...

40
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:29.311
They're suspicious.

41
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.911
Indeed.

42
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.511
Ms. Saki hid the attempt on her life.

43
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.611
It would've been natural for her

44
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:37.611
to report it to the police.

45
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.911
Which means there was some reason she couldn't.

46
00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:43.411
But what would that be?

47
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:45.811
We don't know that yet.

48
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.111
-Please clear a path. -Stand back, please.

49
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:51.311
Excuse me.

50
00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:54.311
Hello, sir.

51
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.311
I told you

52
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:00.011
I was just looking for a ring I happened to drop.

53
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:01.011
That's when...

54
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:07.011
She came crashing down right before my eyes!

55
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:12.311
She was here at the time of the incident.

56
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.011
Apparently.

57
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:22.111
The deceased is Saki Midorikawa, 28 years old.

58
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:25.911
She lived in an apartment across the street.

59
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:30.511
She worked as a dancer as at a pub on Sanchome.

60
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:34.711
So she was a dancer.

61
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.111
Someone fell to their death?

62
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:41.111
"Towa Akabane (26)" -So scary. How ominous.

63
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.911
She seems to live here too.

64
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:47.411
Yeah. It looked like she was returning from a trip.

65
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:48.711
Excuse me.

66
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:50.211
Can I leave now?

67
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:52.311
I'm feeling dizzy.

68
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.111
Very well.

69
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:55.811
Goodbye, then.

70
00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:01.311
Why did she kill herself?

71
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.911
I know, right?

72
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.311
Officer Takagi, about Ms. Saki Midorikawa...

73
00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:10.411
You kids are here?

74
00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:11.711
Inspector Megure,

75
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:15.211
the victim seems to have fallen from the roof.

76
00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:18.311
There were scratch marks on the railing on the roof.

77
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.911
We also found a woman's earring on the ground.

78
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:25.811
They match.

79
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:28.511
The building's security cameras also captured

80
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:31.611
the victim heading to the roof.

81
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:35.511
Was Ms. Saki wearing gloves then?

82
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.211
-What? -No, she wasn't.

83
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.211
I see.

84
00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:45.111
The victim took the elevator to the 11th floor and got off there.

85
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:49.811
The stairs have to be taken to reach the roof

86
00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:53.911
but she didn't fall until an hour later.

87
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:56.711
Then there's her phone.

88
00:06:56.711 --> 00:07:00.311
Her last incoming call was from a nearby payphone.

89
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:04.211
She came to this building shortly after receiving it.

90
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:09.011
Which means the person who called invited her up to a roof

91
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:12.011
where they got into a fight.

92
00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:18.711
So it's possible she was pushed.

93
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:20.411
Yes.

94
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:21.811
Excuse me.

95
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:25.511
Yes.

96
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.011
Yes, I see.

97
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.411
Got it.

98
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:30.711
According to the victim's colleagues,

99
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:34.511
she used to be a good-natured woman well-liked by everyone.

100
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:35.611
I knew it!

101
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:38.311
But for whatever reason,

102
00:07:38.311 --> 00:07:42.211
her personality suddenly changed about three years ago.

103
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:45.811
She started extorting coworkers and customers.

104
00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:48.011
People didn't think highly of her.

105
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:53.511
I see. I'm going to watch the autopsy.

106
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:57.611
You two question the people she was extorting.

107
00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:58.611
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

108
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.611
We'll start with her coworkers.

109
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.011
Hey, Officer Takagi.

110
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:07.711
A car almost struck Ms. Saki at an intersection yesterday.

111
00:08:07.711 --> 00:08:09.911
What? What do you mean?

112
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:15.811
And there are three people who have been glaring at Ms. Saki.

113
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.211
We should talk to those three.

114
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.611
Yeah, although Ms. Dojima has an alibi.

115
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:30.811
I don't know anything about her.

116
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.811
She saw you doing something unsavory

117
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:35.211
from that window, didn't she?

118
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:42.511
And she was blackmailing you with it, right, Mr. Tachibana?

119
00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:46.011
I did receive a threatening letter yesterday.

120
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:48.311
Could we take a look at it?

121
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:51.111
"I saw it all. I'll tell."

122
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:54.311
"Don't bother contacting the police."

123
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:56.811
"The woman who knows your secret."

124
00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:01.711
So you hastily attempted to silence her yesterday

125
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:03.711
but when you failed, you tried again today.

126
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:08.111
No! I was here in my apartment when she fell!

127
00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:10.711
And I have an alibi for yesterday.

128
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.011
If my students find out,

129
00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:15.611
my popularity with them will be over.

130
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.811
He's innocent as far as the attempted murder goes.

131
00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:22.811
Over? What did she see?

132
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:26.011
You're still under suspicion for the murder.

133
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:33.811
I took this off without thinking.

134
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.211
It's so hot...

135
00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:43.411
This moment never gets old.

136
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:53.611
She saw me...

137
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:58.211
But I didn't kill her!

138
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:00.311
Let's withhold judgment

139
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:04.611
until we talk to Michiyo Konno the office worker.

140
00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:08.411
This arrived today.

141
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.511
It's the same as Mr. Tachibana's.

142
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.611
Yeah.

143
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:15.611
But I'd never do that.

144
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:19.211
I was here when that woman died.

145
00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:22.011
After all, Ms. Saki called me and told me to stay here.

146
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:23.911
Ms. Saki called you?

147
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:26.011
What did she say?

148
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:27.311
I suppose it can't be helped.

149
00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:30.511
It's better than being framed for murder.

150
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:31.911
Wait in your apartment.

151
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:33.811
We need to talk...

152
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:38.211
about how you tried to silence me yesterday.

153
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:39.211
She knows!

154
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:40.311
Then...

155
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:42.511
That's right. If she told anyone...

156
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.511
What did she see you doing?

157
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:50.111
I heard a wealthy man was looking for a love child he conceived

158
00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:51.411
a long time ago.

159
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.211
I disguised myself as Michiyo Konno

160
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:56.411
in order to blackmail him, but...

161
00:10:58.311 --> 00:10:59.611
A bulge...

162
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:01.511
-She's flat. -She's flat.

163
00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:05.611
Yeah. My real name is Daihachi Numagaki.

164
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:06.911
"Daihachi Numagaki (32)" -I'm a man.

165
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:14.311
"Driver's License. Daihachi Numagaki" -And she saw me.

166
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.911
Nothing beats this.

167
00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:22.611
Being a woman is so restricting.

168
00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:33.111
She even sent me that letter.

169
00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:37.111
-I didn't do it! -We're arresting him

170
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:39.411
-Hold up! -for attempted murder and fraud.

171
00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:40.711
-Hey, wait! -What?

172
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:43.511
They found sedatives in the body?

173
00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:46.811
So you drugged her with sedatives before you pushed her.

174
00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:49.711
I told you I was in my apartment!

175
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.111
So it was him.

176
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.111
But that letter and phone call were clearly...

177
00:11:55.111 --> 00:11:56.211
I see.

178
00:11:56.211 --> 00:12:00.311
She might've seen their secrets while I was over.

179
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.311
After all, she said...

180
00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:06.511
So they have a friend over.

181
00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:08.711
A friend?

182
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.411
Maybe she thought he was someone else

183
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.411
since he looked different from usual.

184
00:12:12.411 --> 00:12:14.411
No, wait. That's...

185
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:18.311
I'm the one who called the police!

186
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:21.111
I live in unit 202! My name is Akabane!

187
00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:22.711
I'd been traveling since the day before yesterday

188
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:27.211
and when I returned, all my jewels had vanished!

189
00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:29.111
Sounds like she was robbed.

190
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.711
We saw her this morning. Come think of it...

191
00:12:31.711 --> 00:12:35.511
So scary. How ominous.

192
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.611
And unit 202...

193
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:40.811
Then the friend Ms. Saki saw was...

194
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:43.611
Conan!

195
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:55.211
We can see it.

196
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.911
It's certainly possible.

197
00:12:56.911 --> 00:12:59.311
So she saw the thief.

198
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:02.411
But isn't that unrelated to the murder?

199
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:06.011
Numagaki's the one who killed her.

200
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:09.211
But we still don't know...

201
00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.611
Anyway, she lived rather frugally

202
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:14.411
for someone blackmailing people.

203
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:23.411
Maybe that's her boyfriend.

204
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:24.811
Excuse me, ma'am.

205
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:28.311
His name was Ryo Suenaga.

206
00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:31.211
They lived here together.

207
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:33.811
But he suddenly moved out.

208
00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:39.311
He forced his shady debts onto Saki.

209
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:41.611
That was three autumns ago.

210
00:13:41.611 --> 00:13:44.811
-Wait a minute! -She started extorting people

211
00:13:44.811 --> 00:13:47.111
to pay off his debts?

212
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:50.211
And she was living frugally because of it.

213
00:13:50.211 --> 00:13:55.311
"Hiroe Omori (60), Landlady" -Saki must have really loved Suenaga.

214
00:13:55.311 --> 00:13:57.411
She waited for him,

215
00:13:57.411 --> 00:14:00.211
believing he'd someday return.

216
00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:03.311
It sounds like she often looked out her window,

217
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:04.511
but was that...

218
00:14:08.511 --> 00:14:11.611
Saki, you're soaked.

219
00:14:11.611 --> 00:14:15.111
I thought I saw him from the window.

220
00:14:15.111 --> 00:14:19.711
She started sitting in her window after that.

221
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:24.511
She was waiting for him for three whole years.

222
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:27.611
Did you tell anyone that Ms. Saki was waiting

223
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.611
for Mr. Suenaga to return?

224
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:33.611
Yes, I told that detective woman last night.

225
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:36.911
She asked me to tell her all about it

226
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:38.811
since her investigation was very important to Saki.

227
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.811
I've got it.

228
00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:44.111
It even explains how that person got Ms. Saki

229
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:45.411
to come to the crime scene.

230
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.511
That person?

231
00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:49.611
The woman who killed Ms. Saki.

232
00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:51.711
Tatsuko Dojima.

233
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.611
What? But she has an alibi.

234
00:15:06.978 --> 00:15:11.078
She was on the ground when Ms. Saki fell.

235
00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:13.278
And of course, not by coincidence.

236
00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:18.078
I know that her apartment, unit 1107, is directly above here

237
00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:19.478
and the trick she used.

238
00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:23.878
Could it be?

239
00:15:24.978 --> 00:15:31.078
The woman in unit 202 lost her key about a week ago.

240
00:15:31.078 --> 00:15:34.978
Apparently the key was turned in to the building manager.

241
00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:37.678
She must've made a spare key then.

242
00:15:37.678 --> 00:15:41.878
Ms. Dojima received the offer to be a regular guest on a TV show

243
00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:43.578
yesterday afternoon.

244
00:15:43.578 --> 00:15:46.278
Looks like that's after the theft occurred.

245
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.778
That's why she needed to silence her.

246
00:15:52.078 --> 00:15:54.778
Is she meeting with the TV station staff?

247
00:15:54.778 --> 00:15:56.478
Hey, Officer Takagi.

248
00:16:07.178 --> 00:16:08.378
Conan!

249
00:16:15.078 --> 00:16:18.278
There's only signs of water on this side.

250
00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:19.478
So that's how she did it.

251
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.378
That's why she used gloves and sedatives.

252
00:16:30.578 --> 00:16:32.978
Is it possible that she...

253
00:16:38.678 --> 00:16:40.878
She must've bought them in a hurry.

254
00:16:40.878 --> 00:16:43.778
It sounds like you've figured it all out.

255
00:16:43.778 --> 00:16:47.078
But I need your help now.

256
00:16:48.778 --> 00:16:51.778
What do you mean you want my advice?

257
00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.778
Apparently Ms. Saki Midorikawa was murdered

258
00:16:55.778 --> 00:16:57.778
but there are some things us, The Youth Detective Squad,

259
00:16:57.778 --> 00:16:59.778
can't figure out.

260
00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:02.478
Since you're such a great social critic,

261
00:17:02.478 --> 00:17:05.778
we thought we could use your advice.

262
00:17:05.778 --> 00:17:08.278
Fine, then. Well?

263
00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:11.778
When she died, Ms. Saki was wearing gloves.

264
00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:13.478
I wonder why.

265
00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:16.078
To protect her hands from UV rays, right?

266
00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:18.978
It's possible the culprit put them on her.

267
00:17:18.978 --> 00:17:23.278
Why would they do that to push her off a roof?

268
00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:26.778
Because she didn't come to the roof.

269
00:17:27.878 --> 00:17:30.578
That's why the culprit put the gloves on her.

270
00:17:30.578 --> 00:17:32.278
They needed it to make sense that

271
00:17:32.278 --> 00:17:36.678
Ms. Saki's fingerprints weren't on the door to the roof.

272
00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:43.278
After exiting the elevator on the 11th floor,

273
00:17:43.278 --> 00:17:47.378
she visited you in unit 1107.

274
00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:48.578
Hey, listen...

275
00:17:48.578 --> 00:17:52.378
Why don't you wait until we're finished to respond?

276
00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:54.078
On a whim,

277
00:17:54.078 --> 00:17:56.778
you made a spare of the key you found

278
00:17:56.778 --> 00:18:00.078
and robbed unit 202.

279
00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:01.278
And then...

280
00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:04.678
Ms. Saki saw you.

281
00:18:04.678 --> 00:18:06.078
She saw me!

282
00:18:06.078 --> 00:18:07.478
That can't be good.

283
00:18:07.478 --> 00:18:10.078
Your theft would surely be discovered

284
00:18:10.078 --> 00:18:12.878
and even if Ms. Saki's memory was hazy,

285
00:18:12.878 --> 00:18:16.578
if you started appearing on TV, she was sure to notice.

286
00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:19.378
In a hurry to silence her,

287
00:18:19.378 --> 00:18:24.278
you noticed there were others who didn't like Ms. Saki.

288
00:18:24.278 --> 00:18:28.978
You realized she'd seen their secrets too.

289
00:18:30.278 --> 00:18:35.178
And you used that against them!

290
00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:37.178
Impersonating Ms. Saki,

291
00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:40.778
you delivered the letters so they would silence her.

292
00:18:40.778 --> 00:18:45.378
And Mr. Numagaki fell for it.

293
00:18:45.378 --> 00:18:47.678
But he failed

294
00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:50.478
and Ms. Saki hid the attempt on her life.

295
00:18:50.478 --> 00:18:52.178
I was thinking

296
00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:55.378
and accidentally tried to cross when it was red.

297
00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:57.878
Since she knew she'd incurred the ire of others,

298
00:18:57.878 --> 00:19:01.478
she thought that's what it was.

299
00:19:01.478 --> 00:19:06.278
Next you plotted to frame Mr. Numagaki.

300
00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:08.378
You impersonated Ms. Saki and called Mr. Numagaki on the phone

301
00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:12.278
so he wouldn't have an alibi.

302
00:19:12.278 --> 00:19:14.178
Wait in your apartment.

303
00:19:14.178 --> 00:19:16.078
We need to talk...

304
00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:19.678
Then you invited Ms. Saki to your own apartment.

305
00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:23.878
You used the information you got from the landlady the night before

306
00:19:23.878 --> 00:19:29.378
and lied about having information about Mr. Suenaga.

307
00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:31.578
Ms. Saki gleefully ran over

308
00:19:31.578 --> 00:19:33.478
and you put her to sleep using sedatives.

309
00:19:36.378 --> 00:19:40.078
You made it look like she was pushed from the roof.

310
00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:46.578
You placed Ms. Saki on the platform

311
00:19:46.578 --> 00:19:50.478
made from the materials and ice you bought last night.

312
00:20:01.078 --> 00:20:06.878
Then you pretended to look for a lost item on the ground

313
00:20:06.878 --> 00:20:10.678
and waited for the ice to melt and Ms. Saki to fall.

314
00:20:15.178 --> 00:20:17.478
That gave you an alibi

315
00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:21.978
and nobody noticed the contraption on your balcony

316
00:20:21.978 --> 00:20:24.278
because of the balloons you used to hide her.

317
00:20:25.378 --> 00:20:26.978
This is ridiculous.

318
00:20:26.978 --> 00:20:28.278
It's all just conjecture.

319
00:20:28.278 --> 00:20:31.078
You don't have a single piece of evidence.

320
00:20:31.078 --> 00:20:35.678
One of the balloons was missing from its string.

321
00:20:35.678 --> 00:20:38.878
There was a thin scratch on Ms. Saki's neck.

322
00:20:38.878 --> 00:20:42.878
I thought maybe got caught on it when she fell.

323
00:20:42.878 --> 00:20:46.478
So we searched for the balloon together.

324
00:20:47.578 --> 00:20:51.478
You kids were right about this.

325
00:20:51.478 --> 00:20:54.978
The abrasion on Ms. Saki Midorikawa's neck

326
00:20:54.978 --> 00:20:58.178
and the shape of the string were a perfect match.

327
00:20:58.178 --> 00:21:01.678
And we found fingerprints matching the ones on your lease

328
00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:03.478
on the balloon.

329
00:21:06.578 --> 00:21:10.378
A single balloon isn't evidence!

330
00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:15.378
But that connects you to the deceased Ms. Saki.

331
00:21:15.378 --> 00:21:19.378
The police can search your apartment now.

332
00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.678
I'm sure they'll find all kinds of things.

333
00:21:25.178 --> 00:21:28.678
The woman in unit 202 was an eyesore!

334
00:21:28.678 --> 00:21:32.078
Despite being so stupid, she wore all those jewels!

335
00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:36.378
I swiped them because she needed to be brought down a peg!

336
00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.978
But she...

337
00:21:39.778 --> 00:21:43.478
Have we met recently?

338
00:21:44.878 --> 00:21:47.478
It's her fault for witnessing it.

339
00:21:48.978 --> 00:21:51.278
Once the robbery was discovered,

340
00:21:51.278 --> 00:21:54.478
Ms. Saki might have blackmailed you.

341
00:21:54.478 --> 00:21:58.078
That woman was evil!

342
00:21:58.078 --> 00:22:02.378
Being evil doesn't give you the right to kill her!

343
00:22:02.378 --> 00:22:05.378
She was also a kind person,

344
00:22:05.378 --> 00:22:09.978
waiting for her beloved to return.

345
00:23:36.678 --> 00:23:39.378
Be careful, Genta.

346
00:23:39.378 --> 00:23:42.378
Someone might be watching you.

347
00:23:42.378 --> 00:23:44.078
You'd better be careful.

348
00:23:44.078 --> 00:23:48.778
I bet Conan's got way more to hide than me.

349
00:23:48.778 --> 00:23:50.278
Don't redirect the question at me!

350
00:23:50.278 --> 00:23:52.378
Wow, he's right.

351
00:23:54.378 --> 00:23:57.478
"Episode Preview" -We accompanied Pops to Kokura, Fukuoka,

352
00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:59.578
for the Japanese Detective League's award ceremony

353
00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:02.878
so he could accept his Best Detective Award.

354
00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:06.178
He was hospitalized for an injury?

355
00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:08.378
He hit his head when he fell.

356
00:24:08.378 --> 00:24:10.578
He's still unconscious.

357
00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:14.678
Could we keep what I'm about to tell you between us?

358
00:24:14.678 --> 00:24:17.378
Sorry but could you be my girlfriend for a while?

359
00:24:17.378 --> 00:24:18.378
What?

360
00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:20.378
Next Conan,
