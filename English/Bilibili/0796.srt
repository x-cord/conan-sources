1
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,740
Inspector. He probably fell from there.

2
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,940
The window of the fifth floor corridor was left opened.

3
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,040
And there were traces of the victim's footprints on the window frame too.

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,140
Then, I guess there's no mistake about it.

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,240
The problem is...

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,640
Why he fell?

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,040
Mouri?

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
Hi, there. I saw you, Inspector,

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,440
and thought that maybe I could be of some help.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,940
He says.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,340
"Chosaku Kanbayashi (38)" -This man...

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,540
Could he by chance be the novelist...

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,740
Mr. Chosaku Kanbayashi.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,340
He seems to have been renting a workshop on the fifth floor here.

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,740
Chosaku Kanbayashi is a mystery novelist, isn't he?

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,140
His books are selling pretty well, aren't they?

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,440
Not pretty well!

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,240
"Seiko Kanbayashi (35)" -My husband...

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,440
"Kiyoshi Sugiyama (58)" -was super first class.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,640
She's Seiko Kanbayashi, his wife.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,040
The corpse has already verified.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,140
Not so.

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,140
She seems to be the first discoverer.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,940
You mean she found her husband's corpse?

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,040
Why'd you die...

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,440
Why'd this have to happen?

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,940
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,040
Love and cases come from the same origin.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Lovey-dovey couples get along.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,940
But the two have an underside?

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,740
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:39,503
"The Secret of the Lovey-dovey Couple"

35
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:42,903
Then...

36
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,703
Please tell us again,

37
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,803
how you found the corpse.

38
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:47,903
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:50,503
This morning, before he left...

40
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,803
My husband asked me to...

41
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:55,903
My work documents will be arriving in the morning.

42
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,203
So I'd like you to bring it over to my workshop.

43
00:03:58,203 --> 00:03:59,503
Oh... But...

44
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:00,903
I know.

45
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:03,603
You can watch the program first,

46
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,103
and deliver it to me after that, so please.

47
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,503
So, I took the documents that arrived.

48
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:10,903
And left the house at 12:00 sharp.

49
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:12,903
But, when I called him to say I was coming over,

50
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,803
he didn't answer the phone.

51
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,203
I thought that maybe he got sick or something.

52
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:20,403
So I asked the security guard to open the door with a spare key.

53
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:25,103
Mr. Kanbayashi's not in.

54
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:28,203
He couldn't have gone out, though.

55
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:43,603
Mrs. Kanbayashi came around 12:20

56
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:46,503
and he was found right after that.

57
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:50,903
His wristwatch is broken and stopped at 11:50.

58
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:55,103
It's likely that he fell at this time.

59
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:58,003
So, 30 minutes before he was found.

60
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:01,303
But, I wonder why he's wearing work gloves?

61
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:09,203
These work gloves look new.

62
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:13,003
And about those sneakers...

63
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,803
When I saw him this morning,

64
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:17,203
I think he was wearing leather shoes.

65
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:18,803
What?

66
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:22,203
And his scrape wounds on his face,

67
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:23,403
I wonder what they are?

68
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,303
He probably scraped his face on the ground

69
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,103
when he fell...

70
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:30,803
If so, grains of sand should be stuck too, right?

71
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:36,503
Either way, something may come up in the autopsy.

72
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,703
Besides, if we check Mr. Kanbayashi's workshop,

73
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,603
we may come up with something too.

74
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:47,303
It's a picture of when you were both really young, isn't it?

75
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:48,403
Yes.

76
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:51,703
We were poor when we just got married.

77
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:54,403
So, it was tough buying the fox and badger stuffed animal

78
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:56,703
in the picture too.

79
00:05:56,703 --> 00:06:00,103
I didn't know he kept that picture.

80
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,003
Did you notice anything different

81
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,903
about Kanbayashi this morning?

82
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:06,103
Nothing in particular.

83
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:10,203
He just went out for about five minutes to buy cigarettes.

84
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,803
It's your wedding anniversary?

85
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,303
Yes. I'm grateful to my wife

86
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:19,603
because I'm what I am now thanks to her.

87
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:20,703
It's too embarrassing to say

88
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:22,703
so I haven't said it, though.

89
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,603
I'll be right back.

90
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:28,003
He said something like that?

91
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,503
It's the opposite.

92
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,603
Thanks to Kanbayashi,

93
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:34,803
God knows what a great life I've lead.

94
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:38,903
It doesn't sound as if any problems existed.

95
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:40,803
It seems that your husband,

96
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:43,903
judging from his wearing work gloves and sneakers

97
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,003
seems to have been working on something

98
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:49,403
then accidentally fell to his death.

99
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:54,003
It was... An accident?

100
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:56,803
But, Inspector Megure...

101
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:00,903
There's nothing outside that window.

102
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,203
I see.

103
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:06,403
I guess it's hard to believe he was working on something.

104
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:09,503
If so, it's homicide?

105
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:15,403
Somebody cornered Mr. Kanbayashi to the window and pushed him.

106
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,503
But, Pops...

107
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,503
No way!

108
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,503
Today is a holiday,

109
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:25,003
so the only one in this building was Mr. Kanbayashi.

110
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,003
Even if someone were to have snuck in the only way,

111
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:29,503
they could come in and out was from the staff doorway.

112
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:32,303
But I was there.

113
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:33,503
Right?

114
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,603
You brat!

115
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:40,303
If so, the only other option is suicide.

116
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:42,503
That's possible.

117
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,003
He was saying that today was the deadline for a manuscript.

118
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:48,603
So, he could've been cornered and acted on impulse.

119
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:53,703
I didn't realize that he was suffering that much.

120
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,603
It's my fault.

121
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:56,903
A writer committing suicide.

122
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:59,903
Because he can't write is often.

123
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:02,203
But...

124
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,203
If he jumped to his death impulsively,

125
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:06,003
he wouldn't have jumped from the window

126
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:08,103
of the corridor but from here, no?

127
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,403
Really...

128
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,103
"Fumito Ikejiri (35)" -Really, Mrs. Kanbayashi?

129
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,703
Is it true that Mr. Kanbayashi died?

130
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,603
Mr. Ikejiri?

131
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:19,603
I came to take a look on Mr. Kanbayashi

132
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:20,903
wondering how he was progressing on his manuscript

133
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:22,903
and heard that he passed away!

134
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,303
Yes.

135
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,203
He's the publisher who was in charge of Kanbayashi.

136
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:30,703
I'm sorry to have to do this,

137
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,903
but I've got to think of a way to cope with this situation.

138
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:35,203
Please let me confirm the manuscript!

139
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,103
You...

140
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,703
He's just doing his job.

141
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,703
And besides, if it's suicide...

142
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:46,703
It... It's finished!

143
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,503
It is.

144
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:52,403
But, when I called him this morning...

145
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,203
I'm stuck you see.

146
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:57,803
And won't be finished until 16:00 at the earliest.

147
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:05,003
And yet, he was finished with it by noon when he died...

148
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:09,103
He was probably just teasing, Mr. Ikejiri.

149
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:13,503
Sensei's last joke.

150
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:16,503
So, the possibility of suicide has also become slim.

151
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:19,503
Accident, murder, suicide.

152
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:23,603
None of it fits the logic!

153
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:24,803
Something's...

154
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:27,303
Just not apparent yet.

155
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:30,703
There should be some clue in this room...

156
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:35,403
Courier bags.

157
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,803
These are...

158
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,103
Documents.

159
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:41,103
I wonder if he had them sent here all the time.

160
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:43,203
If so, then, why just today was it...

161
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:46,003
"Circle P"

162
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,903
What're you doing?

163
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,103
It's a receipt from the convenience store nearby.

164
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:55,803
It's strange, isn't it?

165
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,203
"Gloves 1 Pair" -He bought a carton of cigarettes with working gloves.

166
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,803
"Mini Seven 1 Carton" -Moreover, is this morning...

167
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,103
Which means somewhere...

168
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,303
"Mini Seven Extra Lights"

169
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:09,103
See, I found it, the cigarettes!

170
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:13,003
And yet, he went out to buy some, Mr. Kanbayashi?

171
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:15,603
10 minutes before he fell to his death.

172
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,803
True, it's strange.

173
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,203
He used to do things like that sometimes too.

174
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:24,103
When he gets absorbed in work he forgets

175
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:26,303
that he's stocked things up.

176
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:29,803
So, she says...

177
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:32,903
I'll be heading back to the company, then.

178
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:35,603
I'll come back again to think up what we should do later.

179
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:45,403
Excuse me, ma'am.

180
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,903
I just thought it was a bit strange...

181
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:58,303
Wasn't that picture always there from before?

182
00:10:58,303 --> 00:10:59,603
No way.

183
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:02,703
It's been over for them for quite some time already.

184
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,403
Mrs. Kanbayashi wanted a divorce

185
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:08,103
but Mr. Kanbayashi was a money monger

186
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,703
so he didn't want to pay alimony

187
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,903
so he kept avoiding talks of divorce.

188
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,903
I see.

189
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,303
She went head over heels over Korean stars

190
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:19,503
after she got sick of Mr. Kanbayashi.

191
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,803
Don't tell anybody about this.

192
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:23,403
Oh, okay.

193
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:24,803
Mrs. Kanbayashi!

194
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:26,103
Yes?

195
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,203
According to my information network,

196
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:31,603
I hear that your relationship with your husband had long been over.

197
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,603
That seems to be the key

198
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:38,203
to solve the case of your husband falling to his death lies.

199
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:41,203
It's true that we had crucial times.

200
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:45,003
But, we've worked everything out already.

201
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,103
I wouldn't like you to bring something like up at this point.

202
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:49,703
Oh... Well...

203
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,503
-Mouri. -Mr. Mouri.

204
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,103
Oh... Well?

205
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,903
Something's not right...

206
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,703
Murder, suicide, accident.

207
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:06,103
No matter what you consider, nothing fits into place.

208
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:09,003
"Circle P, Mini Seven Extra Lights" -And it's fishy.

209
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:15,203
What was Mr. Kanbayashi doing here anyway?

210
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:17,103
Standing at this window?

211
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:22,203
There's a window on the other side too.

212
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,603
I see!

213
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:26,603
If so, everything falls into place...

214
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,003
"Ristorante Buono"

215
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:33,103
The location's about here...

216
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,603
The men's washroom?

217
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,603
A window and a window...

218
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:46,303
The width is about two meters.

219
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:47,503
If you put your mind to it,

220
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:49,503
you could jump from here to there.

221
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,503
"Cleaning Checklist" -Cleaning is done every day

222
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:55,503
at 7:00, 11:00 and 17:00.

223
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:58,403
As long as everything's put back in place till then...

224
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:02,303
Besides, no matter what time the documents arrive,

225
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,003
it's possible to predict that Mrs. Kanabayashi

226
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:06,803
would leave the house after 12:00.

227
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:10,603
It takes 20 minutes from their residence to here on foot.

228
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,903
Between the house and here is...

229
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,603
"Beika Ryokuchi"

230
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:15,203
Is Beika Ryokuchi?

231
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:20,403
Trees make the place dark even in the daytime...

232
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:24,803
But, since he took the distance of two meters lightly,

233
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,203
he failed...

234
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:29,503
What?

235
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:30,803
Mrs. Kanbayashi is lying?

236
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,003
Lying?

237
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,203
Mrs. Kanbayashi says that she left home

238
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,903
at 12:00 sharp, correct?

239
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:42,003
But, her neighbor witnessed her leaving much earlier.

240
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,203
At around 11:20!

241
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:49,403
Which means she already arrived here at around 11:40?

242
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,903
Mr. Kanbayashi fell to his death at around 11:50.

243
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:55,703
If she arrived at around 11:40,

244
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:58,303
she could've pushed him down!

245
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,403
But, even if she could've come here,

246
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:01,703
she wouldn't have been able to enter

247
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,103
without being seen by the security guard.

248
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:06,003
I wonder if doubting her to begin with is...

249
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,303
But she was lying about the time that is the key, you know!

250
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:12,303
That's true but...

251
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:15,403
Just what does it mean?

252
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:28,054
Mrs. Kanbayashi was able to arrive here by 11:40...

253
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:31,554
11:40?

254
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:34,354
That's just when Mr. Kanbayashi...

255
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:37,854
Maybe back then...

256
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:39,354
If so...

257
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,154
The scrape wounds he had...

258
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:45,654
"Cleaning Checklist"

259
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:47,354
This is it!

260
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,054
Mr. Mouri!

261
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:53,854
I'm sure she'll spit it out if we corner her!

262
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,554
But, Mr. Mouri...

263
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:56,654
This is bad!

264
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:59,754
There's still one thing that hasn't been cleared!

265
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:04,554
It's true that I left home at 11:20 the first time.

266
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,654
What do you mean by the first time?

267
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:11,254
I was in a rush wanting to deliver the documents to him right away,

268
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:13,354
so I forgot to lock the house, you see.

269
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:17,554
I walked part way and hurried back.

270
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:21,554
Then I left the house again at around 12:00 sharp.

271
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,654
I see.

272
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,654
So she says, Mr. Mouri.

273
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:26,954
That's...

274
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,754
Too convenient to be true...

275
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:35,054
Let's get a "convenience" beer!

276
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,454
Mr. Chosaku Kanbayashi falling to his death

277
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:40,554
is indeed quite incomprehensible.

278
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:42,954
But, I finally solved it.

279
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,754
Mrs. Seiko Kanbayashi.

280
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:49,254
You were about to be killed by your husband.

281
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,954
Me?

282
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,554
What?

283
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:55,454
His motive was that he found someone new

284
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,054
or something like that.

285
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,154
No.

286
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,854
But, if he were to simply kill you,

287
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:02,554
he'd risk being suspected.

288
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:06,554
Therefore, he tried to fake an alibi.

289
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:08,954
First, in order to lure you here,

290
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:12,354
he asked you to bring his documents over.

291
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,154
He deliberately worked it out

292
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:16,654
so that the documents that were always delivered here were delivered

293
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,754
to the residence.

294
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:21,954
Then at 11:40,

295
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:22,954
Mr. Kanbayashi lied saying

296
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:25,654
that he was going out to get cigarettes,

297
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:27,754
and went to the building next door,

298
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,754
to the fifth floor with the window in question,

299
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:33,254
and opened the window of the men's washroom.

300
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,754
Then he comes back looking his usual self...

301
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:39,554
He changes into his sneakers.

302
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:42,254
He jumps to the window of the building on the other side.

303
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:44,154
He walks through inside the building...

304
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,754
And ambushes you around Beika Ryokuchi

305
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:47,854
and then kills you!

306
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:51,754
If he takes a reverse route and returns...

307
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:56,454
I've finally somehow managed to finish it.

308
00:16:56,454 --> 00:17:00,154
He then gives the manuscript to Mr. Ikejiri.

309
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:02,654
All he had left to do after that was

310
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,354
to close the window of the men's washroom of the building next door

311
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,854
that had been left opened,

312
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,654
then all done...

313
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:09,154
Since today's a holiday,

314
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,754
there's nobody who would use that restroom.

315
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:17,054
The cleaners come at 17:00 after coming at 11:00,

316
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:18,654
so if he closed the window by then,

317
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:20,954
no one would notice.

318
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:23,954
Your corpse would've eventually been found

319
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:25,354
and the estimated time of your death would've been determined

320
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:28,654
to be at around noon today.

321
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:31,754
But Mr. Kanbayashi's alibi would have been established

322
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:35,254
by the security guard who had been at this building

323
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,654
from morning till night.

324
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,754
He left the room around five minutes at one time but,

325
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:43,654
since it's impossible to make a round trip from the scene of the crime,

326
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,454
no one would make a point of it.

327
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:48,354
He finished the manuscript beforehand

328
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:50,954
because he wouldn't have been able to write

329
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:53,454
after committing murder!

330
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:57,254
That was just a prop to lead people to think that

331
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:58,854
there was no intent of murder involved.

332
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,154
Everything was schemed

333
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:03,654
so that he could flee after killing his wife.

334
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,754
Correct.

335
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:10,554
Although Mr. Kanbayashi wore work gloves as well as sneakers,

336
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:14,854
he couldn't jump over to the window on the other side like he planned.

337
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:18,554
He failed and fell to his death...

338
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:20,654
Which means it was an accident!

339
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,754
What an idiot.

340
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,854
I'm an idiot too.

341
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,654
I didn't even realize that I was in his way,

342
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,954
so much so that he wanted to get rid of me.

343
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,454
Mrs. Kanbayashi...

344
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:36,354
You can cut out the acting already.

345
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:37,754
-What? -Yes?

346
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,254
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

347
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:44,254
Mr. Kanbayashi didn't fail to jump over

348
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:46,154
to the next building,

349
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:48,654
he couldn't because you got in his way!

350
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:55,354
After you left your home at 11:20,

351
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:58,954
you arrived at this building at 11:40.

352
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:02,054
At that time, you witnessed it, didn't you?

353
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:06,754
Mr. Kanbayashi's suspicious actions...

354
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:10,654
You, who also doubted the fact that he had the documents

355
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,654
sent to your residence just today,

356
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:14,654
followed Mr. Kanbayashi

357
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,754
and realized what he was up to!

358
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:21,154
Then you decided to use his own plan against him.

359
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:45,354
In other words,

360
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:48,454
his fall was a result of homicide.

361
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:52,454
I could never...

362
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:55,254
And you along with the security guard

363
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:58,254
became the first discoverer of the corpse.

364
00:19:58,254 --> 00:20:00,154
Because unless you brought a third person along,

365
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:02,954
you would've risked being suspected.

366
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:07,554
You're the one who will get the most out of your husband's death.

367
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:10,554
You'll get a load of insurance money coming in too.

368
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:14,554
It's all evil imagination.

369
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,854
I think the evidence is left

370
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,554
in the restroom in question of the building next door.

371
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,454
I got it!

372
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,054
Mr. Kanbayashi's eyelash

373
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:26,154
from the tip of the brush of the deck brush.

374
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,954
And, we got this from the floor too!

375
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:31,454
A woman's hair.

376
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:33,854
Everything will be cleared

377
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:36,154
after a DNA examination, I'm sure.

378
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:39,554
That idiot husband of mine's been trying

379
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,854
to kill me all this time.

380
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:45,754
That's why I did the same thing.

381
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:53,654
I got rid of him.

382
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:56,954
I didn't think I'd get caught, though.

383
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:02,454
I always wanted to get rid of him from before.

384
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:04,254
All I did was stick a brush out

385
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,554
at the face of that stupid husband of mine.

386
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:11,454
What's with that attitude of yours after having killed somebody!

387
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,454
They're no different from each other.

388
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:16,954
Although they both wanted to kill each other,

389
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:19,454
they faked being a couple that was on good terms.

390
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,954
That's a fox and badger for you, no doubt.

391
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:48,654
Mrs. Kanbayashi...

392
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:52,854
Will you tell me something?

393
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,954
Mr. Kanbayashi's murder plan failed

394
00:22:55,954 --> 00:23:00,254
because you left the residence 40 minutes earlier than planned.

395
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,354
Your favorite Korean star TV program was being aired

396
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:06,154
but why didn't you watch it till the end?

397
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,454
That's because, Mr. Mouri...

398
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:15,054
I thought up a great trick of killing that stupid husband,

399
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:18,354
making his death look like an accident.

400
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:20,854
A great trick.

401
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:25,554
Then, I couldn't help it,

402
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:28,754
I just wanted to carry it out as soon as I possibly could.

403
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:30,954
Like they say,

404
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:33,054
strike while the iron's hot!

405
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:38,654
-Hey, wait! -Hey, wait!

406
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:42,054
My god, what's with that woman...

407
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:45,354
Geez...

408
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,154
"Next Episode" -Quiet or I'll kill you!

409
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:54,854
Give me the jewelry!

410
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:56,254
"Crime Plan"

411
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:57,954
Crime Plan?

412
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:59,454
Oh, my...

413
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:03,054
My dear Mr. Mirage is doomed!

414
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:05,354
Funachi will not be defeated!

415
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,654
Here it is!

416
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,754
But the most important thing isn't here.

417
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:15,554
For this could be the birth of Detective Funachi!

418
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:21,054
Next Conan, "The Starry-Eyed Girl's Confused Deduction"

419
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:38,654
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:41,154
"Printing paper"

421
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:43,454
A lovey-dovey couple and a starry-eyed girl!

422
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:46,154
-What's up? -Ms. Sato!
