1
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,240
Today's story has to do with Peach Boy.

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,840
Clear up the mystery of the legend!

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,940
A dog, pheasant, monkey, and even an ogre appear!

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,340
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:01,025
-"Peach Boy!" -"Peach Boy!"

8
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:05,025
"Those sweets you have hanging on your hip..."

9
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:09,025
"I'd like to have one, too..."

10
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:10,725
Huh? Peach Boy?

11
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,625
According to the legend of "Peach Boy",

12
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,525
around the middle of the 7th Century, in order to defeat Ura,

13
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:22,425
the demon that had come from a foreign land

14
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:25,125
to carry out a countless number of atrocities,

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,825
the Yamato Court sends out a gallant and renown warrior called

16
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:28,725
Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto.

17
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,925
It is said that this story is based on the battle between these two.

18
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,225
But that is not the fact.

19
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:37,225
The fact is in the year 663,

20
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,125
as stated also in the Chronicles of Japan,

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:43,425
the Japanese Yamato military that lost in the Battle of Hakusukinoe,

22
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,125
built fortifications one after the other

23
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,025
to prepare against the attacks of enemy forces.

24
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,125
This story seems to be related to one of the fortifications,

25
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,625
Kinnojyo and Kibitsu in Okayama Prefecture where the castle is located.

26
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,225
It seems that here, in Kibitsu, was where the legend began.

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,225
There are many ancient tombs in Kibitsuji.

28
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:01,225
Of course they reflect the culture of those times.

29
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,625
As well as the memories of various people.

30
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:16,325
"Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 1)"

31
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,325
When one thinks of Okayama,

32
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:23,625
what comes to mind is "Peach Boy", right?

33
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,925
And "Peach Boy" also brings to mind...

34
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,125
Millet dumpling!

35
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,325
Everything is food to you, isn't it, Genta?

36
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,025
A dog, right?

37
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,725
-A pheasant! -Monkey!

38
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,125
-And the demons of Demon's Island! -And the demons of Demon's Island!

39
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,125
Well true, but...

40
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,825
After all, this is a weekend trip as well as a history study tour.

41
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,925
Yes, we studied beforehand for this.

42
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,425
So please be more professional.

43
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,425
Or that's what I'd like to say,

44
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:50,225
but first of all, I want to eat some Mamakari!

45
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:54,025
Gosh! Not you, too!

46
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,425
Sorry. I'm sorry!

47
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,025
We've arrived in Okayama!

48
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:05,525
We're transferring to the Sanyo main line next!

49
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,125
Hurry, hurry!

50
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,425
Hey, you don't have to rush so much.

51
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,025
The train's already here!

52
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:37,725
Kurashiki is famous for its fine sight landscape of white walls.

53
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:40,525
Yes, it's what travel-loving girls admire.

54
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,725
But before that, this is where I want to go.

55
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,725
-Hello! -Hello!

56
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,625
Chibori Park...

57
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,625
That's enough, Seiko!

58
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,625
What makes you think you can talk to me like that, Saruwatari?

59
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,225
You got to go independent because I wrote an article for you.

60
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,525
Just how much do you think I had to pay you for...

61
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:27,725
I went out of my way to give you "classmate discount".

62
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,125
You got to be kidding!

63
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,625
Are you all right, Ayumi?

64
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,525
Look what you did to Ayumi!

65
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,825
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:37,125
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,325
I hope you're not hurt, are you?

68
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,425
Thank you so much.

69
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,425
No. We're sorry and embarrassed for acting so childish.

70
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:49,025
I feel bad.

71
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,125
You're right.

72
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,125
I'll bet you're feeling really lucky.

73
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,525
Hey, did you both apologize?

74
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:56,525
Yes.

75
00:05:56,525 --> 00:06:00,425
Little lady, does the ice cream we bought for you taste good?

76
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,425
Yes, it's delicious!

77
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:03,825
I'm glad!

78
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:06,325
That's no way to apologize, is it?

79
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,625
You're all friends, aren't you?

80
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,425
I don't think it's good to fight.

81
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:12,425
Friends, huh?

82
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:15,825
It's true that we're classmates since our elementary school days.

83
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,525
But some live in Osaka and others in Tokyo now.

84
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,425
So, it's been about 15 years since we've seen each other.

85
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:25,325
The last time we saw each other was when we were just about your age.

86
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:28,325
Which means, it's your class reunion?

87
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:29,425
Sort of.

88
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,325
I'm sorry, my name is Agasa.

89
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,525
I'm their chaperone, or rather, I'm escorting the children on their trip.

90
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,525
I'm Ayumi. Ayumi Yoshida!

91
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,725
I'm Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!

92
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:42,225
I'm Genta Kojima!

93
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,525
I'm Conan Edogawa.

94
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,325
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad...

95
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,225
"Naoto Momoi (27)" -What a polite introduction.

96
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,025
I'm Naoto Momoi.

97
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,425
"Yayoi Kijima (27)" -I'm Yayoi Kijima. Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:59,025
"Kengo Saruwatari (27)" -From this side, he's Kengo Saruwatari,

99
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,425
-Seiko Inui. -Hi!

100
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,025
"Mamoru Onitsura (27)" -And Mamoru Onitsura.

101
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,025
Youth Detective Squad?

102
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,625
We named our group something like that, too.

103
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,625
And we're gathered because...

104
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,925
I'll tell you!

105
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,325
After all, it's what I proposed to begin with.

106
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:16,625
We got together this time to support Momoi's candidacy

107
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,925
and also to congratulate his marriage to Yayoi!

108
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,225
Amazing! You're going to be running in the election.

109
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,725
And getting married, too?

110
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,525
Congratulations!

111
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,225
Thank you.

112
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:31,025
Peach Boy and the pheasant are going to get married.

113
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,025
-So you noticed too, Mitsuhiko? -Yes.

114
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,625
You guys are like "Peach Boy".

115
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,425
What's this about?

116
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,625
Their names, right?

117
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,125
The first two letters of their names

118
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,825
are characters that appear in "Peach Boy".

119
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:49,225
Peach, pheasant, monkey, dog, and demon...

120
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:52,725
Just as expected of the Youth Detective Squad.

121
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:59,825
That's why we acted out "Peach Boy" in our school play because of it.

122
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,525
Talk about old story.

123
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:04,825
How nostalgic.

124
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,825
But back then, the stage and interpretation were good.

125
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:09,825
Especially Shunya.

126
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,725
Shunya?

127
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,825
Never mind about the past.

128
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:19,225
By the way, what now?

129
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,325
I'm thinking of all kinds of things.

130
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,525
Tomorrow we go treasure hunting, right?

131
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,925
Huh? Right.

132
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,525
Treasure hunting?

133
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,125
That's new to me.

134
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,525
I'll explain it at dinner time.

135
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:33,725
Until then, it's free time.

136
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,625
I guess that's it for now then.

137
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,025
Bye, little lady!

138
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,425
I guess we should get going, too.

139
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,625
This is Kurashiki.

140
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,225
How nice!

141
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:54,025
The view has been kept as it was in the Edo period.

142
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,325
Right, Doc?

143
00:08:55,325 --> 00:09:00,125
Yes. Most of those warehouses were built by the merchants back then.

144
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,525
They used to transport all kinds of merchandise

145
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,025
sailing their ships into Kurashiki River.

146
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,525
The pasted roof tiles on the east side of this Kurashiki Archaeology Museum

147
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:13,525
are said to be one of the most beautiful in this fine sights district.

148
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:15,725
All the things exhibited here are things excavated from the tombs and ruins

149
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:22,825
of the districts of Kurashiki, Kibitsu and the entire Seto Inland area.

150
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:24,325
There sure is a lot to learn.

151
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,825
Coming in touch with culture of the past...

152
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,625
Can be useful.

153
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,925
But this is the best after all!

154
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,225
It's delicious.

155
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,825
It's Mamakari after all.

156
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:43,625
"Mama carry the food over to me."

157
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,925
There he goes again.

158
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,125
A peach?

159
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,425
-A peach? -It's a peach, like in "Peach Boy"!

160
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,425
Amazing!

161
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,925
You got to be kidding.

162
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,325
We've almost got it!

163
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,425
-Genta! -Hang in there!

164
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:01,225
Hey! Hold on tight!

165
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,125
Be careful.

166
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,825
I didn't think it would be real, but...

167
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,225
And inside we find...

168
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:09,725
Envelopes?

169
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,425
Inside the envelope is...

170
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,825
What's this?

171
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:14,825
Maybe it's a code!

172
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,525
A code?

173
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:20,725
If it is, it isn't something all that difficult.

174
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,425
It's elementary school level.

175
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,625
But it's something worth studying because we're here!

176
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,925
We'll solve the code and excavate a tomb.

177
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,525
Maybe we'll be able to find the treasure on Demon's Island!

178
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:34,725
-Really? -We'll resolve the "Peach Boy" legend!

179
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,725
Let's do it! Let's do it!

180
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:37,825
Hey, hey.

181
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:40,125
Then I'll go rest somewhere nearby.

182
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,825
All of you give it your best.

183
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:44,025
I'll leave the rest up to you, Shinichi.

184
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,025
Is this your doing, Doc?

185
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,025
No. I know nothing of it. It's not me.

186
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,825
But studying should be fun.

187
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:55,325
What great educational material to study with. How lucky.

188
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,125
See you.

189
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,925
Give me a break.

190
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,725
Okay, the Youth Detective Squad launches Operation Treasure Hunt!

191
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:06,925
Hey!

192
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,288
What's with this picture?

193
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,788
On its eyes. This eyelash?

194
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:19,288
Fire, maybe?

195
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,788
Conan.

196
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:24,588
Huh? Oh, that's a very natural way to look at it.

197
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:27,088
Fire and eye stands for...

198
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,988
Fire and eye...

199
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:32,488
Fire and eye!

200
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,988
It's the Hinomi Yagura (watch tower)!

201
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:40,688
Did you find anything?

202
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,688
Did you find something?

203
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,588
This is...

204
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,888
Did you find it, Conan?

205
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,388
Yes.

206
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:54,988
The treasure.

207
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:56,088
Open it! Open it!

208
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,388
What's this? It's just filled with junk!

209
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:06,688
It's out of battery, too.

210
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:10,188
At the least, it's no treasure.

211
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,188
What are you looking at, Conan?

212
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,488
6 years was a lot of fun.

213
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:17,288
All except for that one incident.

214
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:19,288
What does "that" refer to?

215
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:20,488
Beats me.

216
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:24,788
Maybe this is a time capsule.

217
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:27,688
-Time capsule? Really? -Time capsule? Are you sure?

218
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:30,088
If this is somebody's time capsule,

219
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:33,088
I wonder if it's okay that we dug it up?

220
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:36,188
Of course it's not okay.

221
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,688
But it's obvious that somebody has already dug this up before us.

222
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,088
Maybe this is...

223
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,488
Our rival treasure hunters?

224
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,288
If so, we can't let them beat us!

225
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,988
Let's hurry and solve the next code, Conan!

226
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:58,388
A picture of a house and the alphabets "P, I, B, T, I, J,".

227
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:01,988
Just what does it mean? I can't make it out at all.

228
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,688
Well, this is super basic of codes.

229
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,288
So what is it?

230
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:09,688
You move each alphabet to the front one by one.

231
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,388
Which means, it's before "P".

232
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:14,088
-So, "O"? -Right!

233
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:17,188
The next alphabet before "I" is "H", right?

234
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,788
Next...

235
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:21,388
Ohashi?

236
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:23,188
The chopsticks you use when eating?

237
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:24,988
No, it's probably the name of a place.

238
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,988
Somewhere near Kurashiki here...

239
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:30,388
You children. What are you doing?

240
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:32,188
I guess we meet again.

241
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,288
Well, we were trying to solve a code.

242
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,688
What brings you here?

243
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,988
Aren't you going around with the rest of your group?

244
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,488
Yes, well...

245
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,888
I'm not very well liked by everybody.

246
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:48,588
You saw for yourselves just a while ago, didn't you?

247
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:51,788
But why not? You're all classmates, aren't you?

248
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,688
Since long way back in the past, I could never lie.

249
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,388
The article I was planning for Mr. Onitsura's company

250
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:59,788
was all about his underhanded moneylending.

251
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:05,088
Even when Mr. Saruwatari went independent and opened his own beauty salon,

252
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:08,088
I honestly wrote how good I thought he was.

253
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:11,688
I mean, I can't help it because he's not good.

254
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:13,588
Then, Yayoi...

255
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,788
I ended up fighting for Mr. Momoi with her.

256
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,988
We were going with each other until recently.

257
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,688
Him and I.

258
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:25,088
I see, that's why something about them was awkward.

259
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,788
Isn't Shunya coming?

260
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,588
You're sure sharp, renown detective!

261
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:32,188
I remember you saying that he was in charge of making the script

262
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:35,988
and interpretation of the "Peach Boy" play that you put on.

263
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,888
Of course, we would've called him,

264
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:41,988
if he were alive.

265
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,888
You mean he passed away?

266
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:48,488
15 years ago in a traffic accident, so we couldn't graduate together.

267
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,388
Poor thing.

268
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,888
He was full of justice and a really good boy.

269
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,788
Sorry, sorry, it's this dark already.

270
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:58,888
I'll see you all again.

271
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,588
Hang in there, Youth Detective Squad!

272
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:06,888
Here it is! We've found it!

273
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:10,088
Ohashi.

274
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:11,288
An old house!

275
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:14,488
It sort of sounds like something in a samurai movie.

276
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,488
If I remember correctly, after the development of Shioda,

277
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:20,488
this Ohashi residence became a great landowner.

278
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:25,288
This house is said to be about 200 years old.

279
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,488
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

280
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:30,288
Well, it's really no big deal.

281
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,588
I'm glad I did some studying beforehand.

282
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:34,188
Okay, let's search!

283
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,088
I found it! I found it!

284
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,288
Not again.

285
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,688
-It's already been dug up. -Treasure...

286
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,388
Not this again.

287
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:44,888
Old comics.

288
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:47,088
And old stationery.

289
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,088
Not "that" again.

290
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:52,188
I'm sure that somebody is beating us to it!

291
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,688
Okay, next!

292
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,488
The square face of a clown?

293
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,888
What was it called? That symbol used with cell phones?

294
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,088
You mean, pictographics!

295
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:02,288
Right!

296
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:03,888
This is lower case "t",

297
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:07,688
this is lower case "u", this is "t" too, and...

298
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:11,488
This is "a", but I wonder why it's reversed?

299
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,988
T-u-t-a (Ivy).

300
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:16,088
You mean, ivy, the plant?

301
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,588
Tsuta is ivy in English.

302
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,588
The next word is "square".

303
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:21,988
I got it!

304
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:24,188
Over there, over there!

305
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:28,188
Kurashiki Ivy Square! Over here.

306
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,088
-Ivy! -Right?

307
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,788
How spacious!

308
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:34,788
This used to be a spinning factory.

309
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,988
It seems that the buildings back then are being used as is,

310
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,388
and turned into hotels and memorial halls.

311
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:41,688
Okay, let's start!

312
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:42,688
Okay...

313
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:02,388
There's nothing that looks like treasure anywhere.

314
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,788
What the heck is going on?

315
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:06,988
I get it.

316
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:09,788
Not only the "a" is reversed,

317
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:11,388
everything is in the back.

318
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,988
Which means, it is in back of this Ivy Square.

319
00:17:13,988 --> 00:17:16,588
I see! Behind!

320
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,788
I found it! I found it!

321
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,488
Did you find the treasure?

322
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:26,388
This again.

323
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:28,188
This stuffs again?

324
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:31,388
Talk about depressing.

325
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:32,588
This is no fun.

326
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,288
It's that lady.

327
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,088
No good. She's not breathing anymore.

328
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:46,088
A dying message.

329
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,888
O, N, I. Oni (ogre)?

330
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,288
Oni?

331
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:54,288
-The killer is an ogre. Like in "Peach Boy"! -Oh, no!

332
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:00,588
So you're the ones who found her.

333
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:03,688
The Youth Detective Squad...

334
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:04,788
There they go again.

335
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,088
If the killer is an ogre...

336
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:08,088
We'll be Peach Boy...

337
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,588
And punish, rather arrest him!

338
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:11,988
Good grief.

339
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:17,588
Excuse me, sir. Is that the belongings of the victim?

340
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,288
What? Oh, right.

341
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,288
Huh? Over there, something's not right, is it?

342
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,788
That stamp.

343
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,988
Why is it reversed?

344
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,588
Beats me.

345
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,288
So what?

346
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:32,188
Well, it's nothing.

347
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:34,188
Sorry to have bothered you.

348
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:39,188
So being friends of the victim, the four were interrogated by the police.

349
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:45,588
Which means that none of you has an alibi.

350
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,288
To put it more accurately, I was alone.

351
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:51,088
Like I said, there were a lot of people at Chibori Park,

352
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,288
so there must be somebody who remembers seeing me.

353
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:54,788
Same here.

354
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,088
I was in the lobby of the hotel that I'm staying at.

355
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,388
There were a lot of people there, too.

356
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,888
Unfortunately, it would be difficult to verify your situation.

357
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,388
I guess we don't have a problem, then?

358
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,288
We were together all the while.

359
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,888
You were walking along the fine sights district, you say?

360
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:12,088
Yes, sir. We were together all the say.

361
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,588
The only time we were alone was when we went to the bathroom.

362
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,788
Even so, we weren't separated for more than five minutes.

363
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,988
I don't mean to be rude,

364
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:21,688
but we can't take the testimony of a fiance just like that.

365
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,688
Moreover, our investigation shows that you were going with the victim, too.

366
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,988
That's...

367
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:32,688
The other two seem to have had some trouble with the victim, too.

368
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:37,188
Officer Tsuyama, they're here.

369
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:38,888
Is that the container that the peach was inside?

370
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:42,088
Yes. It may have nothing to do with the incident,

371
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:46,088
but we contacted you because we thought we should let you know about it.

372
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,288
It's not that we wanted to report this,

373
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,088
but we figured we had to cooperate with your investigation.

374
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,988
Is that...

375
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:56,288
Our time capsule with the code we entered?

376
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,488
What a surprise.

377
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,888
The code was what specified the place

378
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:04,588
in which they hid their time capsules 15 years ago.

379
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:09,088
15 years ago, they put things their precious items inside a time capsule

380
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,188
and after exchanging them,

381
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:13,688
each person buried a capsule other than his own.

382
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:18,088
They make it so that the owners didn't know where it was buried.

383
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:23,188
That's the reason why they were able to leave their true feelings behind.

384
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,588
The fact is that last night the elementary school

385
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,288
that you all attended was raided by someone.

386
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:34,388
This container was also included among the things that were damaged.

387
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:39,888
Then, we received word from them that they picked this up.

388
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:43,388
It must be some work of fate that we ran into you guys.

389
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:46,088
But what are you going to do stealing something like that?

390
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,588
That's why you threw it away, right?

391
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:50,288
Because you figured it won't bring you any money.

392
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,988
Then, is this how it went, officer?

393
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:55,988
Seiko, as a journalist happened to figure out

394
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,788
who the culprit that raided the school was and was killed instead.

395
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:00,988
-No. -That's unthinkable.

396
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:03,788
We're looking at it from a different angle.

397
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:06,388
Mr. Onitsura.

398
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:09,088
No! I didn't do it. I'm innocent!

399
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:13,688
Don't get me wrong. At this point you're still only a major witness.

400
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:16,688
Then, why am I the only who is being detained?

401
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,688
How would you explain this dying message?

402
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:22,488
It seems that you were holding a grudge against the victim

403
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:24,088
since she wrote an article about you that you didn't like.

404
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,788
Hey, do you really think Mamoru did it?

405
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,488
Cut it out, Saruwatari!

406
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,888
Could be.

407
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:35,388
How dare you talk like that, Momoi?

408
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,988
These days,

409
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:39,988
it's not surprising who kills who.

410
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,188
This is no time to be treasure hunting.

411
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:52,488
So the killer is an ogre after all.

412
00:21:52,488 --> 00:21:54,888
I sure wish we could catch it!

413
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:59,588
Genta, you're holding the silverware with wrong hands!

414
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:02,088
Hold the knife with your right hand and your fork with your left.

415
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:05,388
What's the different? After all, I'm right handed.

416
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:08,588
So I want to hold my fork with my right hand.

417
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,088
Do you want to ask for chopsticks?

418
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:12,788
Why didn't you do so in the first place, Doc?

419
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:17,688
I see. So that's it.

420
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:20,988
If so, the contents of the dying message would change.

421
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:22,688
Now I'm sure,

422
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,688
the killer is among the four of them!

423
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,488
But in order to specify who it is,

424
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:29,488
the remaining two codes will have to be solved

425
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:32,388
and the buried time capsule needs to be found.

426
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:00,688
"Next Episode"

427
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:03,888
You're the only one who knew that I was going to dig out the time capsule.

428
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:05,788
Why did you do this?

429
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:09,588
I wanted to check on something,

430
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:12,388
so I went alone to bookstores and the library.

431
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:14,888
Thinking something like this could happen...

432
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,388
I, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, took notes!

433
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:21,688
All right, Mitsuhiko!

434
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:23,588
Good work, Mitsuhiko.

435
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:29,588
Next Conan, "Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 2)"

436
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,515
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,615
"Left-handed"

438
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:35,615
In the next episode, we finally defeat the ogre!

439
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:38,215
Conan, give me some more millet dumplings.
