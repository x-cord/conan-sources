1
00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:03.482
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.682
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:06.682
Today's the conclusion!

4
00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.582
The criminal and trick appear like magic!

5
00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:10.982
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.182
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:15.882
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.895
Ran and Sonoko come to a lodge up in a snowy mountain

9
00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:01.295
to attend a off the net gathering of the Magic Lovers' Group.

10
00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:05.395
However, the board leader of the group, Tsutomu Nishiyama

11
00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:07.195
is murdered at his residence,

12
00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:10.295
and a message hinting that serial killings may be committed

13
00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.595
is left behind at the scene.

14
00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:14.495
The suspended bridge which is the only way to get down

15
00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:15.895
from the mountains have been burned,

16
00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:18.295
and the lodge is left secluded.

17
00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:20.095
The corpse of a second victim

18
00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:22.795
is found in the snow by the lodge.

19
00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:27.795
There are no footprints around the corpse.

20
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:29.695
This is an impossible crime.

21
00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:33.795
Could it be the doings of "Shadow"?

22
00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.895
The only member not present at the off the net gathering.

23
00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.695
I see. So, that's what it was.

24
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.195
I have figured it out completely.

25
00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:47.195
The trick behind the impossible crime,

26
00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:51.895
as well as the person who carried it out!

27
00:02:55.195 --> 00:03:01.095
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part III)"

28
00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:06.595
Let's see, where shall I start?

29
00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:08.395
Hey!

30
00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:10.495
Behave yourself, will you?

31
00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.295
It's okay. One bottle seems to be enough.

32
00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:18.595
Um, are there any staples, scissors and a long rope

33
00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:19.695
in this lodge?

34
00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:20.495
Huh?

35
00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:22.595
What are you going to do with those things?

36
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:26.695
We're going to wait here till morning for police, aren't we?

37
00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:29.395
Since I don't have anything to do, I thought

38
00:03:29.395 --> 00:03:31.195
I'd finish my art homework.

39
00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:33.795
I think I have them in my room.

40
00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:35.195
Let's go get for them together.

41
00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.395
Okay.

42
00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:39.995
Oh, here they are.

43
00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:43.095
There, now you have everything you need.

44
00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:44.495
Thank you!

45
00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:48.195
I'd like drawing paper and crayons too.

46
00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.995
I know I have some drawing paper,

47
00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:53.695
but wonder if I have crayons.

48
00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:58.195
Hey, sonny, I found some color pencils.

49
00:03:58.195 --> 00:03:59.195
See.

50
00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.595
Sonny?

51
00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:06.795
What? Conan disappeared?

52
00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:10.095
Yeah. I just took my eyes off him for a minute, but...

53
00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:14.195
Maybe he went to the restroom?

54
00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:16.795
No, he wasn't in the restroom.

55
00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:18.795
Besides, the arrow of the bow gun

56
00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.895
that I had put away also gone.

57
00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:22.095
-Huh? -No...

58
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.495
It can't be...

59
00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.195
Don't tell me he was caught by the killer...

60
00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:33.095
That was Conan's voice.

61
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.395
Okay. Let's all go look for him.

62
00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:40.095
Conan? Where are you?

63
00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:41.695
Conan!

64
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:46.995
Conan.

65
00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:49.195
Ran.

66
00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:53.695
Not again.

67
00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.895
There somebody there!

68
00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:00.095
In the woods on the right side this time!

69
00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:03.095
Hey, wait.

70
00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:06.495
Conan!

71
00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:09.495
Wait up!

72
00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:14.495
Hey!

73
00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:20.495
Why don't you behave yourself?

74
00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:24.095
What are you going to do if you run into the killer?

75
00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:28.495
But if the killer got hold of the bow gun again...

76
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.795
We'll be his target if we hang around out here like this.

77
00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:35.895
It worked, didn't it, Sonoko?

78
00:05:35.895 --> 00:05:37.695
Huh? What worked?

79
00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:39.695
You know...

80
00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:41.295
That...

81
00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:43.395
-That? -Well...

82
00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:52.095
Sonoko?

83
00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:53.795
Hey.

84
00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:56.395
What's the matter? Snap out of it, will you?

85
00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:59.395
You're the one who's got to snap out of it, Ran.

86
00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:00.595
Huh?

87
00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:04.895
Come and take the bow gun that is behind me.

88
00:06:05.795 --> 00:06:07.395
Why?

89
00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:09.195
Why is the bow gun out here?

90
00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:13.295
Take that to Mr. Hamano's room, the middle room on the 3rd floor.

91
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:16.695
-Hey. -Just what are you going to do?

92
00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:20.195
Ran and I are going to replay

93
00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:22.095
the scene of the blood smeared magic show

94
00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:25.495
that the killer performed here in the back yard tonight.

95
00:06:25.495 --> 00:06:26.595
What?

96
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:31.195
Re-act the blood smeared magic show?

97
00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:32.695
Did you figure it out or what?

98
00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:34.895
The mystery of the impossible crime.

99
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:38.595
Yes. The trick of how the corpse was brought here

100
00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:40.095
to the middle of the backyard

101
00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:43.495
without leaving any footprints in the snow

102
00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.795
as well as the person who carried that out.

103
00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:47.695
-What? -What the...

104
00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:49.995
Are you saying that you've figured out who the killer is?

105
00:06:49.995 --> 00:06:50.995
Go, Ran.

106
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:54.595
Take the bow gun up to Mr. Hamano's room on the 3rd floor.

107
00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:57.195
I've got everything ready up there already.

108
00:06:57.195 --> 00:06:58.795
Okay.

109
00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:04.795
What do you intend to do with the bow gun?

110
00:07:04.795 --> 00:07:09.195
The bow gun is not enough, but with a rope and scissors,

111
00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:12.195
this impossible crime becomes possible.

112
00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:13.495
First, open holes

113
00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:16.695
in the back of each of the arrows of the bow gun.

114
00:07:16.695 --> 00:07:18.495
Then pull a rope through each hole.

115
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:21.095
Make two small loops and tie it.

116
00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:25.995
Pull a pre-measured rope through the two loops.

117
00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:31.195
A long rope with two other ropes attached to it in the center.

118
00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:34.395
Then tie the two sides of the long ropes

119
00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:38.195
to the railing of the veranda, and it's all set.

120
00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:40.095
All that needs to be done is to fire the arrows

121
00:07:40.095 --> 00:07:41.495
from the bow gun one by one.

122
00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:43.495
Sonoko!

123
00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:47.195
I set the arrows up just like it was drawn on the paper!

124
00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:49.695
But, where do I aim when I shoot?

125
00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:52.595
Ran, aim the arrow at the base of this tree!

126
00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:54.395
-Huh? -Don' worry!

127
00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:56.995
If you fail, just do it over again!

128
00:07:56.995 --> 00:08:00.495
Shoot so that the ropes don't get tangled!

129
00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:01.895
Okay, I'm going to shoot!

130
00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:03.795
Get out of the way, everybody!

131
00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:05.995
Here goes...

132
00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:07.795
Wait.

133
00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:09.895
Let me shoot it for you.

134
00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:12.195
I'm really good at things like this.

135
00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:14.295
When the heck did he go up there?

136
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:16.595
Is it okay, Detective Sonoko?

137
00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:18.495
Yes.

138
00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:21.695
Okay, here goes...

139
00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:24.795
Bingo!

140
00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:28.495
Cry for joy only after shooting the second arrow!

141
00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:31.195
Shoot the arrow into the base of the tree in the woods

142
00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:34.195
on the other side, right opposite the one you just shot at!

143
00:08:34.195 --> 00:08:35.495
Yes.

144
00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:38.595
The shape of the rope that is made by the arrow

145
00:08:38.595 --> 00:08:42.895
forms into what looks to be that of the two sails a yacht.

146
00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:45.095
What on earth is this?

147
00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:47.895
Oh, can't you tell yet?

148
00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:51.595
Mr. Doito, take out a mattress and use it in place of the corpse.

149
00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.395
Attach that to the small loop of the rope that is tied,

150
00:08:54.395 --> 00:08:56.095
and pass it through one of the two ropes

151
00:08:56.095 --> 00:08:59.295
that serves as the mast of the yacht!

152
00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:02.495
Then lower the mattress down the veranda

153
00:09:02.495 --> 00:09:04.395
like a rope way!

154
00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:10.495
The corpse is perfectly placed right in the middle of the back yard.

155
00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:11.895
I see.

156
00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:13.495
Wow.

157
00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:16.195
It's no wonder that there were no footprints

158
00:09:16.195 --> 00:09:17.995
when the corpse was put here.

159
00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:21.095
If the rope is pulled through the belt loops of his slacks,

160
00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:23.295
it would work like a rope way.

161
00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:24.395
That's right.

162
00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:26.095
The killer used the bow gun

163
00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:31.495
to instantly create a fulcrum of a rope way in mid-air

164
00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:33.795
and made the impossible, possible.

165
00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:38.695
But, how did the killer put all this away?

166
00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:40.395
If the rope were pulled,

167
00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:44.495
it would make strange trails in the snow.

168
00:09:45.795 --> 00:09:50.095
Nothing like that was left behind at the scene.

169
00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:52.195
No need for worry.

170
00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:54.995
Now, Mr. Doito, tie the other rope

171
00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.795
that is the mast of the yacht onto the arrow,

172
00:09:57.795 --> 00:09:59.595
and shoot it out to the air of the woods

173
00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:01.695
on either the right or the left.

174
00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:05.295
At the same time, cut the rope that is tied onto the veranda.

175
00:10:05.295 --> 00:10:09.595
Then, all the doubts that you may have had are cleared.

176
00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:19.695
Well?

177
00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:23.595
This way, you can get rid of the rope from the back yard

178
00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:26.395
without letting it touch the snow around the corpse, right?

179
00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:28.195
True.

180
00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:31.995
But the arrow is still stuck to the tree.

181
00:10:31.995 --> 00:10:34.395
That's why the killer burned the suspended bridge

182
00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:37.295
and cut us off from the world below.

183
00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:40.995
In order to collect the arrows before the police get here.

184
00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:42.395
Right?

185
00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:44.595
Ms. Kikue Tanaka?

186
00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:57.184
Ms. Tanaka's the killer?

187
00:10:57.184 --> 00:10:58.984
Oh, no.

188
00:11:00.884 --> 00:11:02.884
Hey, Sonoko,

189
00:11:02.884 --> 00:11:06.684
I was almost shot with the bow gun by the killer.

190
00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:09.584
Why do I turn out to be the killer?

191
00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:12.484
Why don't you go ask Ran who was with me back then?

192
00:11:12.484 --> 00:11:13.684
Yes,

193
00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:17.284
you tried to fake being a victim

194
00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:20.084
in order to clear yourself from the suspects' list.

195
00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:21.784
So, how?

196
00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:24.184
The tricks easy.

197
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:27.384
You hammered staples into the wall above the window.

198
00:11:27.384 --> 00:11:29.584
Then you tied a rope to it.

199
00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:33.284
Put weight anywhere on the rope, and pull the remaining rope

200
00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:36.184
through the pole of the railing of the room above,

201
00:11:36.184 --> 00:11:39.584
and go into the room from under the window.

202
00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:42.384
All you have to do now is fix the rope onto the bed,

203
00:11:42.384 --> 00:11:44.084
and hide it under some clothes.

204
00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:46.784
The rope is cut under the pretense of picking up the clothes.

205
00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:49.584
The window pane will crack automatically.

206
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.284
At the same time that the window was cracked,

207
00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:54.284
you fired the bow gun that you had hidden under your clothes,

208
00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:56.284
over your shoulder.

209
00:11:56.284 --> 00:11:58.884
And, while Ran and the others were absorbed in the arrows,

210
00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.784
you pulled the rope again,

211
00:12:00.784 --> 00:12:02.484
lifted the weight,

212
00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:03.784
opened the curtains

213
00:12:03.784 --> 00:12:07.584
and made Ran and the others confirm that the glass was cracked.

214
00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:09.884
That way, it would look like somebody

215
00:12:09.884 --> 00:12:13.884
had shot the arrow from outside.

216
00:12:13.884 --> 00:12:17.084
I wonder if it would work out that well.

217
00:12:17.084 --> 00:12:17.984
It will.

218
00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:22.284
Because I shot the arrow a while ago in the same way.

219
00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:27.084
See, the trick that I used is still over there in the room.

220
00:12:27.084 --> 00:12:28.884
Oh, yes.

221
00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:31.084
But, when the arrow came flying through the room a while ago,

222
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:34.084
another arrow was also shot through the bathroom right below.

223
00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:36.384
That trick is easy too.

224
00:12:36.384 --> 00:12:38.084
You stuck a rope with a weight attached to it

225
00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:41.684
above the window of the bathroom below with staples

226
00:12:41.684 --> 00:12:44.084
and pulled the remaining rope from the railing to above

227
00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:45.384
and used a stopper,

228
00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:47.784
snapping it under the window.

229
00:12:47.784 --> 00:12:50.784
All you had to do next was open the window and remove the stopper,

230
00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:54.084
so that the glass window of the bathroom would crack.

231
00:12:54.084 --> 00:12:57.484
Ms. Tanaka had already stuck an arrow

232
00:12:57.484 --> 00:13:00.084
onto the mirror of this bathroom beforehand.

233
00:13:00.084 --> 00:13:03.884
Then Ms. Tanaka put away all her gadgets

234
00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:06.384
while Ran was heading for the bathroom.

235
00:13:07.384 --> 00:13:08.884
As proof of that,

236
00:13:08.884 --> 00:13:11.584
I found the staples and holes made by them

237
00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:14.084
outside the bathroom.

238
00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:17.684
But, wasn't the bow gun found in the woods?

239
00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:21.184
After everything happened, and we went outside,

240
00:13:21.184 --> 00:13:22.284
you threw the bow gun out there

241
00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:24.284
while we were all distracted by the footprints

242
00:13:24.284 --> 00:13:25.884
that you had made beforehand.

243
00:13:26.784 --> 00:13:30.884
You pulled the arrow out of the tree at that time, right?

244
00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:34.284
The characteristic arrow that was used to move Mr. Hamano's corpse,

245
00:13:34.284 --> 00:13:37.684
the one with a hole in the tip of the back.

246
00:13:39.284 --> 00:13:42.084
You fell on your rear end at that time

247
00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:44.884
from the impact of pulling out the arrow.

248
00:13:44.884 --> 00:13:46.284
Isn't that right?

249
00:13:47.784 --> 00:13:50.684
I'd like to compliment you for your fantastic deduction

250
00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:54.384
but, I couldn't have killed Mr. Hamano.

251
00:13:54.384 --> 00:13:57.984
I was burning firewood for the bath at that time.

252
00:13:57.984 --> 00:14:00.584
It took me approximately 8 minutes.

253
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:04.384
Wouldn't it be quite difficult for me to burn firewood

254
00:14:04.384 --> 00:14:06.384
go to Mr. Hamano's room

255
00:14:06.384 --> 00:14:08.684
and carry out that impossible crime

256
00:14:08.684 --> 00:14:10.584
in a matter of 8 minutes?

257
00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.684
You have no problem if you had set fire to the firewood

258
00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:14.684
for the bath beforehand.

259
00:14:14.684 --> 00:14:18.684
But, I was coincidentally chosen to make the bath, wasn't I?

260
00:14:18.684 --> 00:14:20.084
Coincidentally?

261
00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:21.984
That was no coincidence.

262
00:14:21.984 --> 00:14:23.584
It was magic.

263
00:14:23.584 --> 00:14:26.284
And since you were a preselected spectator

264
00:14:26.284 --> 00:14:28.684
for Mr. Hamano's magic,

265
00:14:28.684 --> 00:14:31.384
you probably knew beforehand who was going to do what.

266
00:14:31.384 --> 00:14:32.984
Preselected?

267
00:14:32.984 --> 00:14:34.984
That magic was done by preparing

268
00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:37.184
paper with marks on the back beforehand.

269
00:14:37.184 --> 00:14:39.484
Then, the preselected, supposedly ignorable spectator

270
00:14:39.484 --> 00:14:41.584
writes the names of the members on each sheet of paper.

271
00:14:41.584 --> 00:14:44.984
The magician, then finally guesses which mark matches who.

272
00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:49.084
But, aren't you the one who marked the sheets at that time?

273
00:14:49.084 --> 00:14:52.684
Yes. I was blind-folded and was given a pen that couldn't write,

274
00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.484
that you exchanged for the one you used,

275
00:14:54.484 --> 00:14:56.384
just before giving it to me.

276
00:14:58.584 --> 00:15:01.384
In other words, I had no way of telling that

277
00:15:01.384 --> 00:15:02.484
the pen couldn't write

278
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:04.484
or that the memo sheets were marked beforehand.

279
00:15:04.484 --> 00:15:05.584
And those around me

280
00:15:05.584 --> 00:15:09.684
were lead to believe that I had randomly marked the sheets.

281
00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:14.384
You probably talked Mr. Hamano into doing this magic,

282
00:15:14.384 --> 00:15:16.384
and contrived it so you would be the one to make the bath,

283
00:15:16.384 --> 00:15:18.184
and snuck into the second floor from the eaves of the place

284
00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:19.684
to burn firewood for the bath

285
00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:21.684
where you had already fed the fire beforehand.

286
00:15:21.684 --> 00:15:24.784
Then you waited for Mr. Hamano to confine himself to his room,

287
00:15:24.784 --> 00:15:26.284
and strangled him.

288
00:15:26.284 --> 00:15:28.684
That's how you committed the impossible crime

289
00:15:28.684 --> 00:15:31.684
that was displayed to you just now.

290
00:15:31.684 --> 00:15:34.084
The thief that is said to have broken in here recently,

291
00:15:34.084 --> 00:15:36.484
was probably Ms. Tanaka,

292
00:15:36.484 --> 00:15:38.584
because she had to check on the length of the rope

293
00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:40.984
that was to be used in the trick, as well as to find out

294
00:15:40.984 --> 00:15:43.184
what type of pen was being used here.

295
00:15:43.184 --> 00:15:46.084
If you so insist, I hope you have proof.

296
00:15:46.084 --> 00:15:48.884
Of course, I do.

297
00:15:48.884 --> 00:15:51.384
It's in your boots.

298
00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:55.384
The remaining arrow with a loop on the rear edge of it.

299
00:15:56.584 --> 00:16:00.884
I had a reason for making Conan run this way.

300
00:16:00.884 --> 00:16:03.584
I asked him to do so to lure you out here.

301
00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:07.984
You had no time to pull out the arrow

302
00:16:07.984 --> 00:16:12.184
that was stuck to the tree on this side, until a while ago.

303
00:16:12.184 --> 00:16:13.684
The only arrow left now

304
00:16:13.684 --> 00:16:16.584
is the one I used to verify what happened.

305
00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:19.584
You had no choice but to pull it out

306
00:16:19.584 --> 00:16:21.984
when you came out here after Conan.

307
00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:25.284
The hole.

308
00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:27.584
The hole that was made by the arrow is here.

309
00:16:27.584 --> 00:16:30.584
Right. You couldn't throw the arrow

310
00:16:30.584 --> 00:16:33.384
that you had rigged out here just like that, right?

311
00:16:33.384 --> 00:16:37.084
And what better place is there to hide it but in your boots.

312
00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:41.184
Then, "Shadow" is...

313
00:16:41.184 --> 00:16:45.484
Probably an imaginary figure that Ms. Tanaka had created.

314
00:16:45.484 --> 00:16:48.984
She's probably using somebody else's I.D. illegally.

315
00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:51.984
But she participated in the chat

316
00:16:51.984 --> 00:16:54.284
at the same time as did "Shadow".

317
00:16:54.284 --> 00:16:56.484
That's possible so long as you have

318
00:16:56.484 --> 00:16:59.784
a phone line, and two modems and computers.

319
00:17:00.184 --> 00:17:02.884
The handle name, "Shadow",

320
00:17:02.884 --> 00:17:05.884
her name Kikue Tanaka and her I.D.

321
00:17:05.884 --> 00:17:09.484
is probably all that of another person, right?

322
00:17:13.384 --> 00:17:17.184
No, they are both genuinely mine.

323
00:17:17.984 --> 00:17:21.584
The granddaughter of Fuden Harui who was lured into

324
00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:24.284
rushing to his death because of all of you.

325
00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:28.184
Fuden Harui's...

326
00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:29.884
Granddaughter?

327
00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:31.284
Then, don't tell me that...

328
00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:34.984
Yes, grandfather was communicating with all of you,

329
00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:36.784
using my I.D.

330
00:17:36.784 --> 00:17:40.684
with the handle name of "Swindler".

331
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:44.684
I found out only after I was cleaning out his things

332
00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:48.084
and saw the record of the chat.

333
00:17:48.084 --> 00:17:50.184
I was wondering what had come over him

334
00:17:50.184 --> 00:17:53.384
when he started saying he was going to do "Escape Magic" once again

335
00:17:53.384 --> 00:17:55.484
despite his physical condition weakening.

336
00:17:55.484 --> 00:17:57.584
But, that was...

337
00:17:57.584 --> 00:18:00.784
Yes, grandfather decided to do it of his own accord

338
00:18:00.784 --> 00:18:03.184
and died as a result of having done it.

339
00:18:03.184 --> 00:18:06.684
I have no grudge against any of you here.

340
00:18:06.684 --> 00:18:10.284
But, I just couldn't forgive them.

341
00:18:10.284 --> 00:18:13.484
The remarks made by Mr. Nishiyama and Mr. Hamano

342
00:18:13.484 --> 00:18:16.084
after my grandfather died accidentally.

343
00:18:18.284 --> 00:18:21.584
I read the papers too and was surprised.

344
00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:26.384
Well, I'm sure he was delighted to have died on stage like that.

345
00:18:26.384 --> 00:18:29.584
A case of an old man not knowing how to be prudent, I guess?

346
00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:42.684
Grandfather was planning to reveal his identity to all of you

347
00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:45.084
if he succeeded doing "Escape Magic."

348
00:18:45.084 --> 00:18:46.584
What?

349
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.884
"I somehow succeeded."

350
00:18:48.884 --> 00:18:51.584
"Did you all enjoy yourselves?"

351
00:18:51.584 --> 00:18:56.384
"From alias "Swindler", Fuden Harui."

352
00:18:56.384 --> 00:18:58.984
When I found this remark left in the computer,

353
00:18:58.984 --> 00:19:02.084
I became sad and vexed.

354
00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:06.484
I just couldn't stop myself.

355
00:19:07.384 --> 00:19:08.584
But...

356
00:19:08.584 --> 00:19:12.084
If those two knew that "Swindler" was Mr. Harui,

357
00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.984
they wouldn't have written such a remark.

358
00:19:13.984 --> 00:19:15.684
Yes.

359
00:19:15.684 --> 00:19:18.884
But, he seems to have known.

360
00:19:18.884 --> 00:19:20.284
He?

361
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:21.984
Mr. Doito.

362
00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:23.784
Because the day before the show,

363
00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:27.184
he sent grandfather an e-mail of encouragement.

364
00:19:27.184 --> 00:19:29.484
But how did he know?

365
00:19:29.484 --> 00:19:33.584
That's probably because he was also a magician.

366
00:19:33.584 --> 00:19:34.784
Huh?

367
00:19:34.784 --> 00:19:37.584
Oh, haven't you figured it out yet?

368
00:19:37.584 --> 00:19:40.184
Katsuki Doito is an anagram.

369
00:19:41.084 --> 00:19:44.384
When you change the order of the letters in his name...

370
00:19:49.984 --> 00:19:53.184
Th... Thief Kid?

371
00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:56.484
Why on earth is he here?

372
00:19:57.484 --> 00:20:00.284
Fantastic deduction, Mr. Detective?

373
00:20:00.284 --> 00:20:02.084
Where's Ran?

374
00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:03.684
She's in the room next door, sleeping comfortably,

375
00:20:03.684 --> 00:20:05.484
wearing a sweet look.

376
00:20:05.484 --> 00:20:08.684
I happen to like her looks.

377
00:20:08.684 --> 00:20:12.184
Skittering here and there, what's on your mind...

378
00:20:12.184 --> 00:20:18.284
Handle name, "Red Herring"? I was almost fooled.

379
00:20:18.284 --> 00:20:21.184
I had no such intention.

380
00:20:21.184 --> 00:20:23.984
I came here because I wanted to know

381
00:20:23.984 --> 00:20:25.784
why "Swindler" who had passed away

382
00:20:25.784 --> 00:20:28.584
was still communicating on the net.

383
00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:31.184
"Swindler" was the stage name Fuden Harui used

384
00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:33.684
when he made his debut.

385
00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:36.184
The minute I saw her, I could tell she was his granddaughter,

386
00:20:36.184 --> 00:20:37.984
and I knew she was faking the innocent spectator.

387
00:20:37.984 --> 00:20:40.484
But, I didn't think she would go as far as to commit murder.

388
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:44.084
By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late.

389
00:20:44.084 --> 00:20:46.384
What a wretch.

390
00:20:46.384 --> 00:20:48.884
Emotional qualities still at times

391
00:20:48.884 --> 00:20:52.584
get in the way of deductions.

392
00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.384
I really wanted to keep her

393
00:20:54.384 --> 00:20:58.484
from committing the sad murder.

394
00:20:58.484 --> 00:21:02.584
I'm no detective, and you were half-dead with that cold.

395
00:21:02.584 --> 00:21:04.084
It couldn't be helped.

396
00:21:09.084 --> 00:21:11.584
Let's meet again, renowned detective,

397
00:21:11.584 --> 00:21:13.784
before the bells telling of the coming of the end of the century

398
00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:15.784
stops tolling.

399
00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:37.384
He never fails to put on airs, that guy.

400
00:23:07.884 --> 00:23:10.184
Some time later, the police helicopter,

401
00:23:10.184 --> 00:23:12.784
Pops and Inspector Megure arrived.

402
00:23:12.784 --> 00:23:14.884
Tanaka turned herself in without a fuss

403
00:23:14.884 --> 00:23:17.484
and the case was quietly closed.

404
00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:21.184
However, Sonoko was not quiet.

405
00:23:21.184 --> 00:23:24.184
Ran and I, of all things, right after the case was closed,

406
00:23:24.184 --> 00:23:26.384
was dragged along to a Karaoke Box,

407
00:23:26.384 --> 00:23:30.784
and had to listen to "Sonoko on stage" for 4 long hours.

408
00:23:32.584 --> 00:23:35.184
She seems to have been vexed that

409
00:23:35.184 --> 00:23:38.684
she didn't get to see that thief again.

410
00:23:39.884 --> 00:23:42.684
Three days later.

411
00:23:44.084 --> 00:23:46.184
Hey, Ran. Listen to this.

412
00:23:46.184 --> 00:23:50.084
I found another nice guy on the internet.

413
00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:52.784
Oh, what kind of people are they this time?

414
00:23:52.784 --> 00:23:54.684
Raising dwarf trees.

415
00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:56.584
Seriously?

416
00:23:56.584 --> 00:23:58.884
I'm sure he's a sensitive man!

417
00:23:58.884 --> 00:24:00.984
You never learn.

418
00:24:07.084 --> 00:24:10.584
There is blue plastic on the nail of his middle finger.

419
00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:13.084
Could be a part of his belongings

420
00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:15.684
or is it the murder weapon?

421
00:24:15.684 --> 00:24:20.284
Lady, what's with that bandage on your hand?

422
00:24:24.084 --> 00:24:27.284
What's he doing? What was he looking at?

423
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:29.284
Next Conan,

424
00:24:29.284 --> 00:24:33.284
"Investigation Case Of The Missing Murder Weapon"

425
00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.186
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:38.186
"Trash day, with a crow"

427
00:24:38.786 --> 00:24:40.686
The next proof is really a surprise.

428
00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:42.286
Leave it to the crow.

429
00:24:42.286 --> 00:24:43.386
Who is it?
