1
00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.999
While we were waiting at the office of Ran's mom,

2
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.599
we met the former All-Japan women's judo champion

3
00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.099
"Yuko Arisawa (37)" -in the 70kg class,

4
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.099
Yuko Arisawa.

5
00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
When her husband, Shiro requested Lawyer Kisaki, Ran's mom

6
00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.299
for a consultation over a recent stalker problem.

7
00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.799
A meeting was set to meet with them.

8
00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:24.099
Since Shiro suddenly received a call to attend a wake,

9
00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
the appointment was re-set for 9:30.

10
00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:32.499
However, when we got there...

11
00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.499
We found Shiro strangled to death.

12
00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.799
I and Lawyer Kisaki began to find Yuko's behavior suspicious.

13
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.699
But she has a solid alibi,

14
00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.399
since she had been having dinner with us at that time.

15
00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.499
The only time she could've committed the murder

16
00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.999
was the 10 minutes that she left to go to the restroom.

17
00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.699
Could it have been possible for her to kill Shiro in such a short time,

18
00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.999
when she didn't even know where the wake was being held?

19
00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.399
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

20
00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.699
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

21
00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.399
Kogoro and Eri combined deduction.

22
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.899
Makes a tag-team move on the case.

23
00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.499
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.599
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.599
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.529
"Might over Mystery (Part 2)"

27
00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.029
Maybe they have call forwarding.

28
00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.529
That way, if Yuko called here from your office,

29
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.929
the call would be forwarded to his cell!

30
00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.329
You know, when you try calling several times

31
00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.129
and there is no answer.

32
00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.429
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

33
00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.529
What?

34
00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.229
The truth is, before you two made it to the office,

35
00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.529
I called here.

36
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.829
It was in order to confirm the appointment for tonight.

37
00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.929
But the call wasn't forwarded,

38
00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.729
it went to the answering machine after ten rings.

39
00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.929
Then, maybe her husband hadn't come home yet,

40
00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.329
so she called his cell.

41
00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.829
It wasn't just that phone that's bothering me.

42
00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.429
Near the closet where the body was discovered

43
00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.429
is the door to the garage,

44
00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.029
but the trash bag there was strange.

45
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.929
What? How so?

46
00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.529
Maybe it was just placed there to make taking it out easier?

47
00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.329
No. The problem's not where it was, but rather the contents.

48
00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.729
A large amount of matchbooks

49
00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.229
from the western-style restaurant we ate earlier

50
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.529
was found at the bottom of the trash bag.

51
00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.729
Since she doesn't smoke,

52
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:12.129
it's probably what her heavy-smoker husband brought home with him.

53
00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.429
In other words, he's also a regular customer at that same restaurant.

54
00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:21.029
But if so, why did she say her husband wasn't interested in food,

55
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.129
and so she frequented that restaurant alone?

56
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.929
If that's the case, why don't you talk it over with Dad?

57
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:32.129
-What? -Maybe he can find a hint!

58
00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.629
I'd rather sell my soul to the devil!

59
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.029
Gosh.

60
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.129
The devil, huh?

61
00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.829
What? You found wiretaps?

62
00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:49.229
-Five of them? -Yes, sir!

63
00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.729
It seems certain that the victim was the target of a stalker.

64
00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.429
We also found two queer items in the victim's clothing.

65
00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:59.629
-Two? -Yes.

66
00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.229
One of them was found in the inside the pocket of his slacks.

67
00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.129
This wedding ring.

68
00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.829
What? Then, the victim's missing ring wasn't taken after all.

69
00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:11.329
It seems that he took it off for some reason

70
00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:14.029
and put it in his pocket.

71
00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.229
And the other?

72
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.629
Yes.

73
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.629
In his coat pocket, we found this black necktie.

74
00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:26.429
Could this be the murder weapon?

75
00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:30.129
No, because there aren't any wrinkles on it,

76
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.129
and it doesn't even look like it's been opened.

77
00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.029
Which means it's not the murder weapon?

78
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.229
Yeah.

79
00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.129
Come on, let's give Dad a call.

80
00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.629
Dad did say he was going drinking

81
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.229
with the master of Poirot and others tonight,

82
00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.529
but I'm sure he's not drunk yet.

83
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.029
Hey, Mom. Say something!

84
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.529
Geez, be quiet! Just quiet down a little!

85
00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.029
Hello, Dad?

86
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:03.929
Mom has something she wants to talk to you about!

87
00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:05.829
What? Eri does?

88
00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:07.929
-Here! -Hey!

89
00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:11.329
Well, I doubt think it'll do much good.

90
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.229
It's me.

91
00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.629
Well, it's not really anything important, but...

92
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.029
If it's not anything important, then don't call, idiot!

93
00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:23.029
Stop! Don't hang up!

94
00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.029
Yeah, yeah, I see.

95
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:32.029
So, you suspect the former All-Japan champion.

96
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:35.329
But when the crime occurred, she was with all of you,

97
00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.129
and since she didn't even know where the victim went to a wake,

98
00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.929
you say it was impossible for her to commit the crime?

99
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:42.429
Yeah.

100
00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:44.629
Then, the answer is simple.

101
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.729
That woman is innocent!

102
00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.229
-What? -That's it, isn't it?

103
00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.029
Her alibi is solid and the best evidence is that,

104
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.729
you answered the call from the victim yourself!

105
00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.829
But there are other things that bother me about her.

106
00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:01.229
-Ron! -Ron?

107
00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:05.629
Sorry. I'm playing mahjong with the neighbors.

108
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.129
Well, that's the story.

109
00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:08.729
So, if you want to find the culprit,

110
00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.929
I suggest you go looking elsewhere.

111
00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:13.829
What did Dad say?

112
00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:17.729
He says he's busy playing mahjong, so to go look somewhere else.

113
00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.829
I know he's not playing mahjong.

114
00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:22.529
It was recording, a tape recording!

115
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.629
I know because he used it a number of times in the past

116
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:26.729
when he used to be a police detective!

117
00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.829
It was the same sound as what he used to use back then, too.

118
00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:33.029
What? What do you mean by sound?

119
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:37.029
In other words, if he doesn't want to let you know his whereabouts,

120
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:39.729
or when he wants to hang up right away, he used to...

121
00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.929
That's it. Her husband didn't want her to know.

122
00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:49.229
That was the reason for the underhanded trick.

123
00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.629
Could it be that his trick was seen through without his being aware that

124
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:54.229
the trick would be carried out on him instead?

125
00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:02.029
Despite the various unexplained points that remain,

126
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:04.229
we can assume that the stalker using the wiretap

127
00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:05.829
found out that no one was at home.

128
00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:07.929
While the culprit was ransacking something,

129
00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:10.629
Shiro happened to return from his friend's wake,

130
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:12.029
and encountered the culprit.

131
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:13.829
The necktie Shiro was wearing, was taken from him

132
00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:16.229
and he was strangled to death.

133
00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.829
Shiro probably wasn't wearing his necktie or his wedding ring

134
00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:22.229
because he was getting ready to take a bath.

135
00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:26.229
I see! The stalker was hiding in the bathroom!

136
00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:28.029
Shiro found him,

137
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:30.429
so the culprit strangled him with the necktie that Shrio had taken off.

138
00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:31.829
The only remaining question is just

139
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:39.029
why Shiro had an unopened black tie package in his suit pocket.

140
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:41.329
Perhaps someone asked him to buy it?

141
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:43.629
Wakes are generally held without warning.

142
00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:44.929
Maybe one of his colleagues

143
00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:47.229
that had to go to the wake directly from work,

144
00:08:47.229 --> 00:08:49.129
asked him to buy the tie

145
00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:52.529
but ended up not being able to make it.

146
00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:54.029
I see.

147
00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.829
If so, it's understandable that

148
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:57.829
he'd have a brand new extra tie on him!

149
00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:02.329
At any rate, at around 9:00 p.m.,

150
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:04.729
that is, the time the murder was committed

151
00:09:04.729 --> 00:09:06.429
after finishing the dinner with Shiro's wife Yuko,

152
00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:08.529
we were about to leave the hotel restaurant

153
00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:11.429
that is a 10 minute drive from here.

154
00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:13.929
So, we've got nothing to do with this case.

155
00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:15.629
May we leave now?

156
00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:18.029
I... I guess so.

157
00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:20.729
For the time being, we need to find out

158
00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:23.229
whether or not anyone suspicious was seen leaving the house.

159
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.729
Go and look into that.

160
00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:26.229
Yes, sir!

161
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:29.829
-Yuko. -Yeah?

162
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:34.229
May I speak to you in the living room for a moment?

163
00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:36.029
Sure.

164
00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:43.029
So? What's it about?

165
00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:46.029
Article 42, sub-paragraph 01 of the penal code...

166
00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:47.029
What?

167
00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:48.429
Criminal offenders who turn themselves in

168
00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:52.029
before authorities discover anything

169
00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:55.929
will have their sentence reduced.

170
00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:59.829
That's why I want you to turn yourself in

171
00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:04.229
for strangling your husband.

172
00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:17.504
Wait! Is this some sort of joke?

173
00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:19.904
Didn't you say so earlier?

174
00:10:19.904 --> 00:10:22.104
That at the approximate time of the murder, around 9:00,

175
00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:25.904
I had just finished having dinner with you at the hotel restaurant

176
00:10:25.904 --> 00:10:27.804
and was about to leave.

177
00:10:27.804 --> 00:10:31.404
But just before leaving, you went to the restroom, didn't you?

178
00:10:31.404 --> 00:10:33.804
Just for 10 minutes, right?

179
00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:35.604
What could I have done in such a short time?

180
00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:36.804
Within the 10 minutes,

181
00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:39.704
you could've pretended to go to the restroom, leave the restaurant,

182
00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:44.004
commit the crime and come back to the restaurant, couldn't you?

183
00:10:44.004 --> 00:10:48.204
For you, the former All-Japan judo champion in the 70kg class

184
00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:51.104
and for you who currently train others as the coach of a dojo,

185
00:10:51.104 --> 00:10:52.804
it's possible!

186
00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:55.004
What're you talking about?

187
00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:57.904
How could I have called my husband over to the hotel

188
00:10:57.904 --> 00:11:00.404
when I didn't even know whose wake he was at?

189
00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:03.004
You didn't need to call him over

190
00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:06.504
because your husband was already at the hotel.

191
00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:09.204
"Already" there?

192
00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:10.704
You heard him too, didn't you?

193
00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:14.504
His voice on the phone saying he was at a wake!

194
00:11:15.604 --> 00:11:18.104
So I came to the wake.

195
00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:19.904
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

196
00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:23.304
Don't tell me you're denying hearing that!

197
00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:26.604
The chanting was from a tape.

198
00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:29.104
It was to hide his extra-marital affair, wasn't it?

199
00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:30.404
Extra-marital ffair?

200
00:11:30.404 --> 00:11:33.404
My dorky husband use to use the same trick

201
00:11:33.404 --> 00:11:34.904
when he used work for as a police detective!

202
00:11:34.904 --> 00:11:38.604
He would play a recording of patrol car sirens next to the phone

203
00:11:38.604 --> 00:11:39.904
and say "A sudden case has come up,

204
00:11:39.904 --> 00:11:43.604
so I'll be home late, go to bed without me."

205
00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:47.404
That guy was actually drinking at a cabaret club!

206
00:11:47.404 --> 00:11:49.004
Mom...

207
00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:51.004
I don't see your point in getting angry.

208
00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:54.304
But that was in the case of your husband,

209
00:11:54.304 --> 00:11:56.204
my husband would never do that.

210
00:11:56.204 --> 00:11:59.504
Prior to taking a bath, do you normally remove your wedding band

211
00:11:59.504 --> 00:12:03.404
and store it in your pocket?

212
00:12:03.404 --> 00:12:07.404
Now, if he were going out to meet someone else,

213
00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:09.704
it would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

214
00:12:12.004 --> 00:12:16.504
And as for that unopened black tie...

215
00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:18.704
He planned to put it on before returning home

216
00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:21.604
in order to make it look like he had been to a wake.

217
00:12:21.604 --> 00:12:23.604
However, before he could do that,

218
00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:27.704
you strangled him with the tie which he took off, didn't you?

219
00:12:27.704 --> 00:12:30.404
And further evidence is the restaurant matchbooks

220
00:12:30.404 --> 00:12:33.504
that were found in the trash bag by the garage door.

221
00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:37.304
Your heavy smoker husband brought them back, right?

222
00:12:37.304 --> 00:12:38.904
You also mentioned that

223
00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:42.804
you go to the restaurant on a weekly basis.

224
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.804
This would mean you both visited that restaurant often.

225
00:12:45.804 --> 00:12:48.404
Then, why did you say you only go alone?

226
00:12:48.404 --> 00:12:50.704
I come alone without telling him.

227
00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:53.104
My husband has zero tolerance for new food.

228
00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:55.504
Yes. Even though you always went there alone,

229
00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:58.304
your husband always had somebody with him.

230
00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.504
You saw them, didn't you?

231
00:13:00.504 --> 00:13:04.504
Your husband happily enjoying a meal with another woman.

232
00:13:05.104 --> 00:13:08.604
They always used that hotel to have an affair.

233
00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:11.704
You found out that they were going to have an affair tonight

234
00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:14.104
so you set up wiretaps in the house

235
00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:16.404
and fabricated the story of a stalker.

236
00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:22.504
Then, you invited us to that hotel restaurant for dinner.

237
00:13:23.304 --> 00:13:27.104
When you contacted your husband on the phone from my office,

238
00:13:27.104 --> 00:13:28.804
you expected him to play something in the background

239
00:13:28.804 --> 00:13:31.104
that he'd prepared as an alibi,

240
00:13:31.104 --> 00:13:33.204
and also predicted he would say

241
00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:35.704
he'd be home late and not to wait up for him.

242
00:13:35.704 --> 00:13:37.004
At just about the same time

243
00:13:37.004 --> 00:13:38.704
that your husband would leave his extra-marital partner

244
00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:42.504
and leave the hotel room, you left to go to the restroom.

245
00:13:42.504 --> 00:13:45.104
You then caught your husband in the parking lot

246
00:13:45.104 --> 00:13:48.904
where you proceeded to drag him to your car and strangled him!

247
00:13:50.304 --> 00:13:53.104
Next, you put him in the trunk of your car

248
00:13:53.104 --> 00:13:57.204
and came back as if nothing had happen.

249
00:13:57.204 --> 00:13:59.704
Afterwards, you drove both us and his dead body

250
00:13:59.704 --> 00:14:01.804
together back to your house.

251
00:14:01.804 --> 00:14:04.804
You instructed us to wait here in the living room

252
00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:08.404
while you transported his body from the trunk to the closet.

253
00:14:08.404 --> 00:14:10.904
And lastly, you called him so we would discover the body.

254
00:14:12.104 --> 00:14:15.804
Well, am I wrong?

255
00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:21.604
That story sure sounds like a plausible one.

256
00:14:21.604 --> 00:14:23.004
Do you have any proof?

257
00:14:23.004 --> 00:14:26.804
We can probably find out by checking the hotel parking lot.

258
00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:29.204
Your husband, who headed home,

259
00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:31.004
had to come alone to the parking lot

260
00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.104
or the crime couldn't have been committed!

261
00:14:33.104 --> 00:14:35.504
That's why, it should still be there!

262
00:14:35.504 --> 00:14:39.804
The car that your husband drove to the hotel in!

263
00:14:39.804 --> 00:14:41.404
Because if your husband used his lover's car

264
00:14:41.404 --> 00:14:43.004
to go in and out of the hotel,

265
00:14:43.004 --> 00:14:46.404
you would never have chosen the parking lot to commit the crime,

266
00:14:46.404 --> 00:14:50.804
not wanting to risk your face being seen.

267
00:14:50.804 --> 00:14:54.904
The garage here only has space for one car.

268
00:14:54.904 --> 00:14:58.804
Most likely, your husband rented a car behind your back.

269
00:14:58.804 --> 00:15:02.804
Then, why not investigate it? That hotel parking lot!

270
00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:06.304
And, should you not find a car like that,

271
00:15:06.304 --> 00:15:07.704
I will not, despite it being you, attorney at law, Kisaki

272
00:15:07.704 --> 00:15:10.804
-get away with it. -Say!

273
00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:13.404
Mrs. Arisawa, you're really good at judo, right?

274
00:15:13.404 --> 00:15:16.704
-What? -Wait, Conan!

275
00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:20.104
Could you teach me the inner thigh throw?

276
00:15:20.104 --> 00:15:23.004
That's when you use your opponent's attacking power

277
00:15:23.004 --> 00:15:25.404
to your advantage and throw them, right?

278
00:15:25.404 --> 00:15:27.904
You use their power to throw them to the ground

279
00:15:27.904 --> 00:15:29.304
and gain points, right?

280
00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:32.804
Using your opponent's power to your advantage...

281
00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:34.904
Geez! What are you up to?

282
00:15:34.904 --> 00:15:36.204
But back then,

283
00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:41.404
didn't Mrs. Arisawa teach us how to adjust our seats?

284
00:15:41.404 --> 00:15:43.704
You know how to adjust the seat, don't you?

285
00:15:43.704 --> 00:15:45.004
There's a lever on the right side of the seat.

286
00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:46.504
And if you pull it...

287
00:15:46.504 --> 00:15:49.604
See, like this, the seat will move.

288
00:15:50.404 --> 00:15:51.904
I see.

289
00:15:51.904 --> 00:15:56.504
The car that you ended up driving us back in...

290
00:15:56.504 --> 00:15:59.904
That was the car your husband drove to the hotel, was it not?

291
00:16:01.004 --> 00:16:06.604
That's why you demonstrated how to adjust the seat, right?

292
00:16:06.604 --> 00:16:08.904
Your husband is smaller and shorter than you.

293
00:16:08.904 --> 00:16:11.704
It's natural for his seat to be in a different position.

294
00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:17.304
Should you adjust it on a whim, it would look suspicious.

295
00:16:17.304 --> 00:16:18.604
That's right.

296
00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:22.604
That would also explain your adjusting of the rear-view mirror.

297
00:16:22.604 --> 00:16:25.504
Which means it should come as no surprise

298
00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:28.904
why you couldn't find the car in the parking lot.

299
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:32.204
Most likely, you trailed him closely

300
00:16:32.204 --> 00:16:35.504
and avoided letting him take notice of you.

301
00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:36.904
You probably got into the car

302
00:16:36.904 --> 00:16:40.104
at the same time your husband got on and strangled him.

303
00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:44.404
Afterwards, you most likely rushed back full speed to the restaurant.

304
00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.004
And, due to this, you didn't have enough time

305
00:16:47.004 --> 00:16:50.104
to remember the car position, right?

306
00:16:50.104 --> 00:16:53.004
If you think about it, it's really a strange story.

307
00:16:53.004 --> 00:16:56.604
Your reason for inviting us to that hotel

308
00:16:56.604 --> 00:16:59.204
was because you could get a discount for parking.

309
00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:04.004
Then, you should've shown the ticket when you paid the parking fee.

310
00:17:04.004 --> 00:17:05.804
Despite not having gone anywhere else,

311
00:17:05.804 --> 00:17:09.304
the ticket was suspiciously missing.

312
00:17:09.304 --> 00:17:11.704
This is peculiar, isn't it?

313
00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:14.504
When you said you had lost the ticket, what you really meant was

314
00:17:14.504 --> 00:17:18.804
that you weren't sure where your husband put it, right?

315
00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:21.904
If your husband were the type to put things away at random,

316
00:17:21.904 --> 00:17:23.704
it could be behind the sun visor

317
00:17:23.704 --> 00:17:26.004
or even in the ashtray.

318
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:28.204
With a proper search of the car,

319
00:17:28.204 --> 00:17:29.704
I imagine we'll find it.

320
00:17:29.704 --> 00:17:33.704
The hotel parking ticket with your husband's fingerprints on it.

321
00:17:33.704 --> 00:17:35.704
That would be proof that

322
00:17:35.704 --> 00:17:39.304
your husband was also at the hotel tonight.

323
00:17:39.304 --> 00:17:41.804
Well, if we check the trunk,

324
00:17:41.804 --> 00:17:45.704
we should find evidence that he was moved from there.

325
00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:47.304
Maybe his hair

326
00:17:47.304 --> 00:17:50.704
and possibly even the tie used as a weapon,

327
00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:52.404
as well as his shoes.

328
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:56.804
And as for the shoes that we saw at the front entrance tonight,

329
00:17:56.804 --> 00:17:59.604
those were likely prepared by you.

330
00:17:59.604 --> 00:18:03.004
Now, before the police come across this evidence,

331
00:18:03.004 --> 00:18:04.704
hurry and turn yourself in.

332
00:18:04.704 --> 00:18:07.604
-The sock on his left foot... -What?

333
00:18:07.604 --> 00:18:09.404
I just remembered.

334
00:18:09.404 --> 00:18:13.404
That's where my husband usually puts his parking tickets.

335
00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:16.004
So if they check there, they should find it.

336
00:18:16.004 --> 00:18:18.704
Then, Yuko really did...

337
00:18:18.704 --> 00:18:20.204
But why?

338
00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:24.804
How could someone like you esort to murder over a mere affair?

339
00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:28.804
If it were only an affair, a divorce would have sufficed,

340
00:18:28.804 --> 00:18:32.204
but the other woman was Kajimoto's wife.

341
00:18:32.204 --> 00:18:34.304
I just couldn't allow it.

342
00:18:34.304 --> 00:18:35.904
Mr. Kajimoto...

343
00:18:35.904 --> 00:18:38.504
That's the gold medallist you mentioned before, right?

344
00:18:38.504 --> 00:18:42.404
But wouldn't that give you even mere reason to work it out?

345
00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:45.504
It isn't like you weren't acquainted with his wife.

346
00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:47.604
Yeah, my husband and I

347
00:18:47.604 --> 00:18:51.204
visited Kajimoto's house often in the past.

348
00:18:51.204 --> 00:18:54.504
Such a good wife, such a cute child...

349
00:18:54.504 --> 00:18:57.404
They were the ideal family you see in pictures.

350
00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:59.804
But my husband ruined it!

351
00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:06.104
When I considered the suffering that was to come,

352
00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:08.704
I couldn't live on that way.

353
00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:11.204
Not even a divorce would've been enough!

354
00:19:12.204 --> 00:19:15.704
Right. I never should've gotten close.

355
00:19:15.704 --> 00:19:18.904
If only we never visited Mr. Kajimoto's house,

356
00:19:18.904 --> 00:19:22.404
my husband and his wife wouldn't have met.

357
00:19:22.404 --> 00:19:24.404
If only I had kept my admiration to myself,

358
00:19:24.404 --> 00:19:27.604
none of this would have come to be.

359
00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:31.304
This is merely an assumption.

360
00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:35.404
Could it be that your husband just wanted more attention from you?

361
00:19:35.404 --> 00:19:38.204
-What? -The tape trick for an alibi

362
00:19:38.204 --> 00:19:39.804
would have only worked two, maybe three times.

363
00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.304
After that, it doesn't work anymore.

364
00:19:41.304 --> 00:19:45.504
And, when it comes to those matches from the restaurant...

365
00:19:45.504 --> 00:19:49.004
He may as well have told you directly that he went there often.

366
00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:50.704
Are you saying my husband

367
00:19:50.704 --> 00:19:52.804
deliberately wanted me to think he was having an affair?

368
00:19:52.804 --> 00:19:55.404
Yes. He was jealous

369
00:19:55.404 --> 00:19:58.904
that you still thought of Mr. Kajimoto despite being married.

370
00:19:58.904 --> 00:20:01.704
That can't be...

371
00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:06.304
But he crossed the line and angered you, caught fire,

372
00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:08.204
and plunged to his death.

373
00:20:08.204 --> 00:20:12.604
Maybe the sun that burned Icarus's wings

374
00:20:12.604 --> 00:20:15.204
was actually you.

375
00:20:20.104 --> 00:20:22.804
-It was all thanks to Dad! -What?

376
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:25.504
You know, the alibi tapes!

377
00:20:25.504 --> 00:20:27.504
A coincidence! Just a coincidence!

378
00:20:27.504 --> 00:20:29.204
Definitely an accidental hit!

379
00:20:29.204 --> 00:20:31.404
Was it really a coincidence?

380
00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:36.304
What if it was a deliberate hint just for Mom?

381
00:20:36.304 --> 00:20:39.304
No way.

382
00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:41.904
He was probably too embarrassed to say anything!

383
00:20:41.904 --> 00:20:43.604
Is that so?

384
00:20:43.604 --> 00:20:46.004
If you want to find out, here's the phone!

385
00:20:47.304 --> 00:20:51.204
Well, I should at least inform him that the case is over.

386
00:20:54.304 --> 00:20:55.804
It's me.

387
00:20:55.804 --> 00:20:57.904
About the case...

388
00:21:00.704 --> 00:21:03.504
Sorry, I'm still playing mahjong.

389
00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:05.604
Silly, still using those tapes.

390
00:21:05.604 --> 00:21:08.004
Kogoro, hurry!

391
00:21:08.004 --> 00:21:09.404
Darn it!

392
00:21:11.004 --> 00:21:12.704
This is...

393
00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:16.704
What?

394
00:21:16.704 --> 00:21:20.004
As I thought, it was just a coincidence.

395
00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:21.804
How do you know?

396
00:21:21.804 --> 00:21:25.304
Mom! Wait up!

397
00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:53.704
It looks like Pop's back already.

398
00:22:53.704 --> 00:22:56.004
Oh, really? Who cares!

399
00:22:56.004 --> 00:22:58.004
Lewd old man!

400
00:23:00.104 --> 00:23:02.304
"Tonight's drinking party has been canceled!"

401
00:23:02.304 --> 00:23:04.904
"Sorry about that, Kogorou. - Poirot Master"

402
00:23:11.204 --> 00:23:12.504
I see.

403
00:23:12.504 --> 00:23:14.904
Since he'd used this strategy so often before,

404
00:23:14.904 --> 00:23:17.404
he saw throught it instantly.

405
00:23:17.404 --> 00:23:19.304
And he was able to find his own alibi tapes so quickly

406
00:23:19.304 --> 00:23:21.904
because he skipped on the party.

407
00:23:23.104 --> 00:23:28.604
Then, he tried to play it one more time over the last call, but...

408
00:23:28.604 --> 00:23:31.304
Kogoro, hurry!

409
00:23:31.304 --> 00:23:34.204
Next, we'll have a friend of the groom, Kogoro Mouri,

410
00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:35.204
give a congratulatory speech!

411
00:23:35.204 --> 00:23:36.804
Thank you!

412
00:23:38.304 --> 00:23:41.004
What a bad luck, recording that part

413
00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:42.904
and accidentally playing it as well.

414
00:23:42.904 --> 00:23:44.704
Yes, quite a pity!

415
00:23:44.704 --> 00:23:48.604
Eri! Don't be fooled!

416
00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:50.904
Do your best!

417
00:23:53.104 --> 00:23:54.904
You too, Pops!

418
00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:02.704
Because it's hard to believe that

419
00:24:02.704 --> 00:24:05.404
we're staking out accompanied by girl high school students

420
00:24:05.404 --> 00:24:08.704
and an elementary school child, right?

421
00:24:08.704 --> 00:24:10.704
That goes for Hammer man, too.

422
00:24:12.704 --> 00:24:13.704
It can't be...

423
00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:16.104
He's waiting to ambush us?

424
00:24:16.104 --> 00:24:17.304
No.

425
00:24:17.304 --> 00:24:21.104
I don't think he had any intention to ambush anybody.

426
00:24:21.704 --> 00:24:27.204
Next Conan, "The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 1)"

427
00:24:43.004 --> 00:24:45.004
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:45.004 --> 00:24:47.204
"Hammer man"

429
00:24:47.204 --> 00:24:49.504
Next story is a love story.

430
00:24:49.504 --> 00:24:51.322
Please stay happy.
