1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,140
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,840
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,640
On the floor below the detective agency is Cafe Poirot.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,340
A forgotten cell phone invites a case.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:54,068
My name's Kogoro Mouri.

9
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,468
I run a detective business that fights against

10
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:59,768
the darkness of society called crime.

11
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:02,668
Conan, sonny, let's go have breakfast!

12
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:04,268
Conan, sonny?

13
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:06,668
"Cafe Poirot" -Hello!

14
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,068
Two morning sets, please.

15
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:12,268
Although it's a daily repetition of investigating

16
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,768
extra-marital affairs and searching for people...

17
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,668
There are times when I'm involved in bloody cases.

18
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:22,568
The many sad incidents that are in the papers everyday.

19
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:24,468
Motives vary from revenge, money matters,

20
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:27,068
complications in love affairs and so on forth.

21
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:31,368
It sure is a sick world.

22
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,568
I come here often when I get sick and tired

23
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,068
of all the bonds involved in the detective business.

24
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,568
Thank you for waiting.

25
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:43,068
Yes, this cup of warm coffee

26
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:44,468
is indeed what relieves my heart

27
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:47,168
that is exhausted from all bonds I have in life.

28
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,068
Hot!

29
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:55,168
What's wrong with him?

30
00:02:56,668 --> 00:03:02,368
"Forgotten Cell Phone (Part 1)"

31
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:08,268
How unusual of you to come here from morning?

32
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,768
Are you going to be meeting a client today?

33
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:15,568
No, no, Ran's gone to Karate Club Camp from yesterday.

34
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:17,368
So, we're having a late breakfast.

35
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,768
Besides, today is Sunday.

36
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:24,368
I should take a break from the heap of cases

37
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:26,468
that come avalanching in everyday.

38
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:28,268
People!

39
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,368
Good morning!

40
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:33,468
I'm Shuhei Baisho! Shuhei Baisho here!

41
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,568
I will do whatever is in my power

42
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:38,268
and work for you with my entire heart and soul!

43
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:39,668
With your valuable ballot,

44
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:40,968
I Shuhei Baisho will work with you

45
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,968
to create a quiet town!

46
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,368
Work?

47
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:49,868
-Yes! Mouri Detective Agency. -Wake up, Hiroshi.

48
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:51,968
Come on, it's already 8:00 in the morning.

49
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:55,168
You're going to get me, Yuka, in trouble

50
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,768
if you don't get up.

51
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,468
You're the one who's still groggy and not awake!

52
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,368
Check the number before you make the call!

53
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,568
Darn!

54
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:06,868
Excuse me, but could it be that...

55
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:10,668
business is slow?

56
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,368
Yes, yes.

57
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:16,068
We didn't get any calls all this week.

58
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,968
The thing is...

59
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,568
But...

60
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,368
I wonder if it's okay to ask a detective

61
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,468
to do something like this.

62
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,668
Is something troubling you, Azusa?

63
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,468
A strange thing was forgotten here

64
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,868
and I was wondering if you could locate its owner,

65
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,468
who is a customer of our shop.

66
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,268
Oh, a search for somebody.

67
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:41,768
What is it? That strange thing that was forgotten.

68
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,368
It's this.

69
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,268
A cell phone?

70
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,768
It looks to be an ordinary cell phone but...

71
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:55,368
The pattern is pretty odd.

72
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:57,468
Other than that, it isn't really all that strange.

73
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,868
If the person who forgot this cell phone

74
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:01,268
is really looking for it,

75
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,968
I'm sure that person will call.

76
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:05,468
Well, someone did call three times.

77
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:06,568
Three times?

78
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:09,168
Yup, when I answered the phone,

79
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:11,668
this is what the first person said...

80
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:15,668
"Oh? I'm sorry, I seem to have made a mistake."

81
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,068
A mistake?

82
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,068
What about the second time?

83
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:21,768
The second time this is what the person said.

84
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:25,368
"That's strange, did it ring?"

85
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,968
It seemed like someone else was beside that person.

86
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,168
Right after saying so, the phone was cut again.

87
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,268
Oh! I'm sure that the person

88
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:35,068
was looking for the cell phone by listening for it.

89
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,168
But, since he was looking in the wrong place,

90
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,368
he could have thought that

91
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,768
he had dialed the wrong number!

92
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:44,768
But, it didn't sound like this person

93
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,968
was the owner of this cell phone.

94
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,568
-Why not? -Because with the third call,

95
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,868
that person's tone of voice suddenly changed and...

96
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:57,368
"Hey, you! I'll bet you're his broad?"

97
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:58,968
Get him on the line!

98
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,768
He shouted saying, "I'm going to kill you!"

99
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,568
-Kill? -Kill you?

100
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,068
And?

101
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,568
What did you tell him, Azusa?

102
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,268
Well...

103
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:12,968
I hope you explained the circumstances to him. Did you?

104
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:14,468
I was scared...

105
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,068
so I switched the phone off.

106
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,768
Oh, I see.

107
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,168
Please show me the cell phone!

108
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:24,468
I told the master about it the following day, and was scolded.

109
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,968
So I kept the phone switched on all day since then,

110
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,768
but the phone hasn't rung so far.

111
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,968
Sure enough.

112
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,568
No wonder nobody's calling back on this cell phone.

113
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:37,768
Why do you say that?

114
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:40,468
Because this phone isn't working!

115
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,568
See! Even if I try to make a call,

116
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,768
I get the busy signal right away, right?

117
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:48,868
True.

118
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,868
I get it! The owner of this cell phone

119
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:53,068
probably couldn't pay his phone bill

120
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,968
and so his phone was cut off!

121
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:59,268
Which means the rude one who called was a money collector!

122
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,968
In other words, he called the owner of the phone

123
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,768
thinking he was living alone, but a woman answered

124
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:06,268
so thinking he made a mistake, he hung up.

125
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:09,768
He checked the number and called back.

126
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:13,168
But, he probably blew his top at the third call!

127
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:16,768
Then, why did the one who called the second time say,

128
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,168
"Did it ring?"

129
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:22,368
It's most likely that

130
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:23,868
when the collector went to the home

131
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:25,068
of the owner of this cell phone

132
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,968
and called him from in front of the apartment,

133
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,268
he didn't hear any sound from inside the apartment

134
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:30,768
so he thought it was odd.

135
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:33,868
Do you remember what kind of person

136
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:36,468
who forgot this cell phone was?

137
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:39,468
He came here a little after noon.

138
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:40,468
He was a chubby man wearing glasses

139
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,868
and his hair was parted on the side.

140
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:46,968
He was eating and touching that flashy cell phone all the while

141
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,868
so I remember him very well.

142
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:54,268
The phone rang for the first time about an hour after he left.

143
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:57,668
The second call came right after the first

144
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,968
and the third call came in about 30 minutes later.

145
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:06,368
The number of the one who called was not displayed.

146
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,268
On top of that, the record of calls made before that,

147
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,268
as well as the call received records are not saved at all.

148
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:15,368
Oh, there were a lot of names and numbers left on it.

149
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,068
Then, why don't you try calling those numbers?

150
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,968
Well, I sort of did.

151
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,268
They all seem to have been random numbers.

152
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,368
Besides,

153
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,168
the names all seemed to be fake too.

154
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,468
It's true and strange that all the names

155
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,768
are in Katakana characters.

156
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,668
As to the phone numbers...

157
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,568
1022?

158
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,768
I see, this is strange.

159
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:45,468
There are no 10 digit numbers that start with the number 1.

160
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:49,368
What's this black mark on the side of the names?

161
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:51,368
There are some names with black marks beside them

162
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,568
and some without!

163
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,468
True, there are marks on some and none on others.

164
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,468
Don't tell me that that all these numbers

165
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:05,368
are all some kind of code?

166
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,468
How annoying!

167
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:08,868
Darn!

168
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:12,668
Where was this cell phone placed when it was forgotten?

169
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:15,268
Well...

170
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:18,768
Over there.

171
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:23,368
Under the sofa where you're sitting right now, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:25,468
He probably dropped it accidentally

173
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:26,968
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

174
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:30,168
Without realizing he dropped it,

175
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,868
he kicked the cell phone with his foot.

176
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:34,868
That's how think it got there but...

177
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,968
Like I just explained,

178
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,168
I found the cell phone right after

179
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:42,668
the man called the first time.

180
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,868
-The antenna was sticking out besides! -What?

181
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:53,368
Was the cell phone folded in two like this back then?

182
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:54,668
Yup.

183
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:56,268
That's why I thought he dropped it

184
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,368
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

185
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,068
Don't you think it's odd?

186
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:01,368
Huh? Why is that so?

187
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:05,468
Because if he folded the cell phone to put into his pocket,

188
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:09,168
don't you think he'd naturally push the antenna back in too?

189
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:13,368
Right! Because you don't want the antenna to break!

190
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:15,068
He probably didn't do so

191
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:17,068
because he's either a very sloppy guy.

192
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:20,168
Or he did so and deliberately hid it,

193
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,468
wanting someone to find it when it rang.

194
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:26,768
What do you think, Pops?

195
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:31,068
Yeah, I was just about to say so.

196
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,868
But if so, for whatever reason...

197
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:39,168
You can't figure out who the owner is after all.

198
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:41,868
If it's the owner of this cell phone, I know who it is.

199
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,968
But how?

200
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:47,468
Azusa, every cell phone

201
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:52,168
has seal with its product number written on it.

202
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:56,268
If we give that number to the manufacturer,

203
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,068
then find out where the cell phone was bought,

204
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,968
explain the circumstances to the shop,

205
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:03,868
we can get the name of the owner of the cell phone!

206
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:06,568
Wow!

207
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:08,968
You take off the back cover of the cell phone.

208
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,368
And under the place where the battery is removed...

209
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,968
-Not inside. -The seal...

210
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,368
-The seal is peeled off! -Why?

211
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:21,568
Can you tell us more in detail about the customer

212
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,868
who forgot this cell phone?

213
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,968
More in detail?

214
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,668
Even the slightest detail, even if it seems trivial.

215
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:32,168
-Anything! -Well...

216
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:37,568
Come to think of it, that customer

217
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:40,068
ordered fried noodles, spaghetti, fruit parfait,

218
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,168
tomato juice and Caesar's salad

219
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,268
and paid exactly 3,000 yen!

220
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:47,868
3,000 yen?

221
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,568
Well, ordering the 5 items he ordered is the only way

222
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,468
to come up with a total of exactly 3,000 yen,

223
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:55,668
so I was sort of impressed!

224
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:59,668
Since Conan said that any trivial detail would do,

225
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,968
-I thought I'd mention it. -But...

226
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:06,568
the guy sure is a big eater, eating 5 items from noon.

227
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:09,068
Right, he seemed to be on the job and yet

228
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,468
I thought to myself he sure can eat.

229
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,768
On the job?

230
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:17,668
Because he asked for a receipt.

231
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:18,968
Receipt?

232
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,568
What the name on it?

233
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:23,668
Of course, "Customer".

234
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,168
I guess so.

235
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:31,368
Thank you so much! I'll be waiting for your ballot for me!

236
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:35,568
I will do my best for you all as I have been doing so far!

237
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:42,668
But if he was eating alone and still wanted a receipt,

238
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,668
the probability of him being an ordinary office worker

239
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:45,968
becomes quite unlikely.

240
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:50,268
If so then, what on earth...

241
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:59,231
He is most probably an office worker on a business trip

242
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,231
or a man who owns his own business.

243
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:05,931
He could be a person with that kind of habit.

244
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:09,231
If so, maybe he's a journalist or a detective.

245
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:12,431
Even the police ask for receipts.

246
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:16,731
Police officers in police boxes ask for receipts for meals they have?

247
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,831
Oh, no.

248
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,931
Hello...

249
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:24,931
That only goes for police detectives.

250
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,431
I hope you don't mind me joining you.

251
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,931
Hello.

252
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,031
When they go asking around or on a stake out,

253
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,431
or have to follow the suspect,

254
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,631
police detectives ask for receipts for transportation fee

255
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,131
and food and drinks needed during the investigation.

256
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:41,131
But, we officers in uniforms rarely use investigation fee.

257
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:44,731
Oh, you're the one who's always hanging around with Officer Takagi.

258
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:46,631
What brings you here, Yumi?

259
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,831
What else

260
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:52,231
but to urge Mr. Detective here who takes forever to pay

261
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,731
for his parking ticket?

262
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:57,531
Oh, well, I was thinking of going to pay today.

263
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:59,431
Today is Sunday!

264
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:03,231
I'm only joking.

265
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:07,031
We're looking for a man.

266
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,531
But this is the only clue we have.

267
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,031
Three...

268
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,231
Three thousand yen?

269
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,731
Is his by chance

270
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,531
wearing glasses and has his hair parted on the side?

271
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,931
-A chubby man? -Yes.

272
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:22,831
Do you know where he is?

273
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:24,331
Well, sort of.

274
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,631
I'm glad!

275
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,131
I can finally give the cell phone back to its owner.

276
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,931
What do you mean give back?

277
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:34,031
That man forgot his cell phone here.

278
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:37,631
I also got strange calls too so I was really concerned.

279
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:41,831
But, you can't return it to him.

280
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:44,831
Because he passed away the night before last.

281
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:47,831
Passed away?

282
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,831
Oh, no.

283
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:52,431
Don't tell me he was killed?

284
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,631
No!

285
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:57,531
He was run over by a truck at the 3-chome intersection.

286
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,931
A car accident?

287
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:05,131
I remember. They aired that accident on the news.

288
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,231
Yes. The accident occurred

289
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,431
the day before yesterday just before 14:00.

290
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,531
He was taken to the hospital immediately,

291
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,031
but he didn't make it.

292
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,431
He passed away that night.

293
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:20,231
That's why we're investigating trying to identify who he is.

294
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:21,831
Wait a minute.

295
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:25,231
Don't tell me this was a hit-and-run case?

296
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,731
No.

297
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,531
The driver of the truck that hit the man didn't flee,

298
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,431
nor was he under the influence of alcohol.

299
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,031
According to testimony by the witness, the man

300
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:42,031
seems to have suddenly come running out from behind a parked car.

301
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:46,731
Which means this excludes the possibility of homicide.

302
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:48,731
Don't tell me? Could it have been suicide!

303
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,731
That's very unlikely,

304
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:53,231
because he seems to have asked for directions

305
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:56,331
at the convenience store near the accident site before he was hit.

306
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,131
He seems to have been in a great big rush, and asked,

307
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:02,031
"Do you know where a shop called Poirot is?"

308
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,031
If he was planning to kill himself,

309
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,931
why would he need to ask about the location

310
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,831
of a shop that is 2km away?

311
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:08,931
True.

312
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,231
But, I kind of have an idea

313
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,731
why that person rushed out into the street.

314
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:17,131
Yeah. In other words, the man wanted to go back to the shop

315
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:19,731
to retrieve the cell phone he had forgotten there,

316
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:21,531
and was run over by the truck.

317
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,731
No, wrong.

318
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:26,731
The dead man's lips are sealed, eh?

319
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,831
We're back to zero again.

320
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,431
The cell phone was folded in two

321
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,931
with it's antenna sticking out

322
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,331
and left here as if it were hidden here.

323
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,131
It's like the cell phone was ringing

324
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,631
just so that somebody would find it.

325
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:46,331
Those strange names and numbers that were saved in the cell phone.

326
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,631
What were they anyway?

327
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,031
What on earth was that man trying to do here?

328
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:54,731
But two days have already gone by since the accident.

329
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:58,231
It sure took you long to get here.

330
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,931
We couldn't help it

331
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,631
because he had nothing on him

332
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:03,831
that would give us a clue to who he was.

333
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,331
Oh, right.

334
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,531
But he did have all these receipts on him.

335
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:10,631
All of these here.

336
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:14,831
He sure meticulously kept all these receipts.

337
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:18,531
Haido. Rizen. Kenbashi.

338
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,931
He's gone all around the city.

339
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,231
Right.

340
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,931
We checked those receipts in order of the dates,

341
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:26,431
and it took us one whole day.

342
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:29,431
But, we finally got here.

343
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:32,931
There were people who remembered him too, however,

344
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:37,031
nobody knew who he was or where he came from.

345
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:40,131
But, things as they are, there's a possibility

346
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:43,531
that he was being pursued by loan sharks too.

347
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:44,931
Loan sharks?

348
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,531
That's right. There seems to have been a call

349
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,231
on the cell phone that he forgot.

350
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:52,331
"If you don't put him on, I'll kill you!",

351
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:55,031
a dangerous sounding man shouted so.

352
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,631
Really?

353
00:17:56,631 --> 00:18:01,331
Yes, three times, about an hour after the man left.

354
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:05,031
At any rate, I'd advise you to go check the loan sharks.

355
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,631
If he did borrow money,

356
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:13,031
he would've left his address and name with them too.

357
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,431
Huh? What?

358
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:18,231
I think you can easily find out without doing something like that.

359
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,331
Because the dangerous man who called

360
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:24,231
knows the number of the cell phone, right?

361
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:27,831
If I were him and the phone didn't work,

362
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:30,331
I would give the number to the telephone company

363
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,631
and have them check on who the man is!

364
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:33,931
And?

365
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:38,831
So! If you call the phone company, you'll be able to find out

366
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,431
if the dangerous man called.

367
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,731
You fool!

368
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:45,831
Unless you're the police or something, the telephone company

369
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:51,031
would never give out the name and address of anyone!

370
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,031
Understand, Conan, sonny?

371
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,631
Oh, but there are times when we panic and rush to make a call,

372
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,831
don't you think?

373
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:05,131
There was a time when I got lost going to my friend's house,

374
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:08,831
and when I tried calling her, her cell phone was switched off.

375
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:12,431
So, I called the telephone company and asked for her address.

376
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,831
I asked them if they could find my friend's address

377
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:18,131
-from her cell phone number. -Right, right!

378
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:21,331
Does everybody often do things like that?

379
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,731
And? Did they find her address for you?

380
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:26,031
No, they didn't.

381
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,231
So, I had the police officer at the police box

382
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:29,431
look up her address for me.

383
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:32,531
Well, it's true though, that if the man

384
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:35,531
was in a rush to look for the owner of the phone,

385
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:36,831
he would've tried calling the phone company,

386
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,731
despite knowing that it might not work.

387
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,631
Ms. Numata, please look up the number of the phone companies.

388
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:45,031
-Okay! -Let's try each and every one and ask them

389
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,131
whether they got a call or not.

390
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:51,131
It's nice that the police get to ask anything they want.

391
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:57,231
I guess so! Although it may take a while to get through the red tape.

392
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,131
So long as we have the phone number,

393
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:03,331
it's as if we've already got his address and name!

394
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:04,631
Yes.

395
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:07,931
As long as we kept that e-mail address,

396
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,631
we could've gotten to them

397
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:13,131
if we had what the lady had entered on her cell phone.

398
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,731
We would've been able to find the hide-out of the boss

399
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,631
who controls them all.

400
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:19,231
Yes, from about day before yesterday.

401
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,431
Yes, that's right.

402
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:24,131
Yes.

403
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:27,131
I understand, thank you so much.

404
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,131
-How'd it go? -I don't know yet.

405
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:32,031
I've got to wait for them to call me back.

406
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,131
I'll try elsewhere too.

407
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:37,231
Azusa, please serve the customer on table no.1

408
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,131
another cup of coffee.

409
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:40,631
Oh, yes, sir.

410
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:45,431
Thank you.

411
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,931
No problem. Hang in there and keep up your studies.

412
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:49,831
Oh, I will.

413
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:53,631
Yes, the address, name and phone number.

414
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,631
Did you get any calls asking for personal information on a man?

415
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,931
Would you like another serving?

416
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,231
-Oh, thank you. -Yes.

417
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,231
Yes, from 2 days ago.

418
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,731
Yes, yes.

419
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,531
This is on the house.

420
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:08,631
Thank you!

421
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:15,831
-I leave it here. -Oh! Thank you, so very much.

422
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:19,831
Here you go! Orange juice for you, Conan!

423
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:22,731
Thank you, Azusa!

424
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,331
I'm sorry to have got you involved in something like this

425
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,731
on a precious Sunday, your day of rest.

426
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:32,031
Will you show me that cell phone that was forgotten one more time?

427
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,331
Sure.

428
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:36,531
-Here you go. -Thank you.

429
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,931
This is funny!

430
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:46,531
The clue that's left on the cell phone.

431
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:49,831
A mysterious 10 digit number that begins with the number "1".

432
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:54,931
And the unexplainable black marks that are beside the names.

433
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,431
What on earth do they mean?

434
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:00,531
Thank you for your support! Shuhei Baisho!

435
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:04,631
Will do my best for this town with all my might!

436
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,531
Thank you!

437
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:17,131
Yes. Hello.

438
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:21,031
Yes, that's right. Yes! Yes!

439
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,531
Did she get something?

440
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,731
A clue on the man.

441
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,631
Three people called?

442
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:58,731
The telephone numbers that are in this cell phone

443
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:02,331
all start with the same four numbers!

444
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:04,531
All the numbers are similar.

445
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:08,031
Maybe they all live in the same neighborhood!

446
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,831
This is?

447
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:14,031
Yes, they said that they heard a loud sound on the other side.

448
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:17,331
A sound loud enough to interrupt conversation.

449
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,131
Next Conan,

450
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:22,919
"Forgotten Cell phone (Part 2)"

451
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,758
Next Conan's Hint:

452
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:27,758
"Big shot"

453
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,658
The next episode is part 2.

454
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:29,858
Don't forget your cell phones, everybody.

455
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:30,758
Take care and don't catch cold.

456
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:32,804
Brush your teeth, okay?
