1
00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.699
Blink!

2
00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.199
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:06.699
He finally finds the tricks of the men in the Black Organization.

4
00:00:06.699 --> 00:00:09.299
Bring up the big guns and beat the case and evil organization!

5
00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:10.699
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.299
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.199
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.684 --> 00:01:57.784
With the testimony provided by a family

9
00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.084
who visited the Mouri Detective Agency,

10
00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:03.584
we solved a murder case.

11
00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:06.784
At that time, Eisuke Hondo who was with us

12
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:08.684
used a lie detection technique to figure out

13
00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:10.584
whether someone's lying or not.

14
00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:12.084
In exactly

15
00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:15.184
the same way as Rena Mizunashi used to do.

16
00:02:16.884 --> 00:02:18.684
No doubt about it.

17
00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:21.084
This guy is trying to get information...

18
00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:25.884
on Rena Mizunashi.

19
00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:32.784
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Mysterious Hefty Reward"

20
00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:35.884
"Haido Central Hospital"

21
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.284
Kir.

22
00:03:31.284 --> 00:03:35.084
Our organization is trying to find her but we have no idea where she is.

23
00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.984
I guess the FBI is not stupid.

24
00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:41.484
Kir is dead.

25
00:03:41.484 --> 00:03:42.884
This is for sure.

26
00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:47.684
We should be happy if she simply did.

27
00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:50.884
What if she was brainwashed and turned against us?

28
00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:51.884
That's not going to happen.

29
00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:55.384
She didn't confess anything even after being shot,

30
00:03:55.384 --> 00:03:59.384
injected a truth drug and beaten until her ribs were broken.

31
00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:01.984
There's nothing to worry about, Chianti.

32
00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:07.384
Are you talking about Kir getting his recognition?

33
00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:10.584
-Yeah. -I have heard about that story, too.

34
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.584
Kir found a guy who snucked into the organization.

35
00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:15.684
She got him cornered,

36
00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:17.984
but ended up being caught.

37
00:04:17.984 --> 00:04:21.684
By the time you guys found her, she was almost dead because of torture.

38
00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:25.084
But I still don't get it.

39
00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:27.784
How come she got his recognition

40
00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.584
and happened to be in the same team with us?

41
00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:31.784
It's her teeth.

42
00:04:31.784 --> 00:04:32.784
Huh?

43
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.084
It was the only weapon left of her.

44
00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:42.084
She bit the guy's wrist so hard that his bone came out from his wrist.

45
00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.784
In addition to that,

46
00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:49.584
she took the gun away from him who already lost the will to fight

47
00:04:49.584 --> 00:04:51.284
and blew up his head.

48
00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:56.784
Only crazy animals can do that.

49
00:04:56.784 --> 00:05:00.284
But I wonder. The guy died, right?

50
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:02.984
How do we know that Kir didn't leak anything?

51
00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:06.484
The guy was hiding a MD recorder

52
00:05:06.484 --> 00:05:10.284
which actually recorded his voice torturing her.

53
00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:13.284
An MD?

54
00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:14.784
I see.

55
00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:19.084
So there was no voice of Kir or whatsoever in that MD.

56
00:05:20.484 --> 00:05:25.684
But we still don't know anything about this guy, right?

57
00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:27.584
Right.

58
00:05:27.584 --> 00:05:30.884
He had tons of driver's license and passports

59
00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:33.884
with fake names and disguised pictures.

60
00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:36.384
Certainly, he was no ordinary guy.

61
00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:40.584
But we actually found out his real name.

62
00:05:40.584 --> 00:05:43.784
I remember when you and I got there,

63
00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:47.684
the guy's partner showed up at that place and kept whispering the name.

64
00:05:47.684 --> 00:05:51.884
Yeah. He was whispering the name to the guy's ear who no longer responded.

65
00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.684
It was the name we couldn't find from driver's licenses or the passports.

66
00:05:53.684 --> 00:05:58.084
He kept calling the name like a scratched record.

67
00:05:58.084 --> 00:06:00.784
Over and over.

68
00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:06.984
He killed himself after he realized that we were there.

69
00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:09.684
But what was his name anyway?

70
00:06:09.684 --> 00:06:11.884
It was too far from where I was. I couldn't hear anything.

71
00:06:13.284 --> 00:06:14.884
Well,

72
00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:19.284
I can't really remember dead men's faces and names.

73
00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:31.484
Well, I think I know where those guys are coming from.

74
00:06:31.484 --> 00:06:33.784
Anyway, let's ask Kir when she comes back.

75
00:06:35.184 --> 00:06:39.084
She probably heard that name, too.

76
00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:41.884
I hope we'll find her soon.

77
00:06:41.884 --> 00:06:43.184
We will.

78
00:06:46.184 --> 00:06:49.984
We've already made a guess where she could be.

79
00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:57.384
Gosh, what are you thinking?

80
00:06:59.484 --> 00:07:01.084
I've been waiting for this Sunday.

81
00:07:01.084 --> 00:07:03.084
I was supposed to forget about all the depressing things

82
00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:08.284
and enjoy an easygoing day with a hot coffee at Poirot.

83
00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:10.684
And why do I see you here?

84
00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:12.884
Eisuke Hondo.

85
00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:16.184
Come on. Don't be a mean.

86
00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:19.384
You were the one who told him that he could visit us anytime, you know.

87
00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:23.284
That's true, but it's 7:00 am.

88
00:07:23.284 --> 00:07:25.084
I think it's kind of early.

89
00:07:25.084 --> 00:07:28.784
I actually brought an interesting case today.

90
00:07:28.784 --> 00:07:30.384
What? A case?

91
00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.084
What's the pay? Is the client rich?

92
00:07:34.084 --> 00:07:36.084
No. Well,

93
00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:40.284
I just found something that looks like a case on a website,

94
00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:42.284
-so there's no client. -Thank you very much!

95
00:07:45.684 --> 00:07:46.684
That hurts...

96
00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:47.984
Dad!

97
00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:49.384
Are you stupid?

98
00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:51.784
What we are doing is not charity work!

99
00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:53.984
But you should at least listen to his story.

100
00:07:53.984 --> 00:07:55.484
He came all the way here.

101
00:07:55.484 --> 00:07:57.184
I told you.

102
00:07:57.184 --> 00:07:59.184
-I don't have time. -That's right!

103
00:08:00.484 --> 00:08:03.284
Today is the day that you are going to clean and organize

104
00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:05.384
Yoko Okino's VCRs that you recorded.

105
00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:06.384
Right?

106
00:08:06.384 --> 00:08:08.184
Yeah, that's right!

107
00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:10.684
Conan, what happened to you?

108
00:08:10.684 --> 00:08:13.584
You're usually interested in new cases.

109
00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:18.384
Yeah, I would.

110
00:08:18.384 --> 00:08:20.884
But not with the case he brought.

111
00:08:20.884 --> 00:08:22.684
I'm sorry, Eisuke.

112
00:08:22.684 --> 00:08:24.784
That's okay.

113
00:08:24.784 --> 00:08:28.184
It looks kind of interesting, but it's not a major case at all.

114
00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:34.284
Maybe somebody got the idea from the "Red-headed League" and made it up.

115
00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:35.784
"The Red-headed League"?

116
00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:37.984
Oh, I know that!

117
00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:41.284
It's a famous case in a Sherlock Holmes series, right?

118
00:08:42.384 --> 00:08:45.684
I remember that this red-headed person gets a high salary,

119
00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:50.084
but has to work in a room all day to copy an encyclopedia.

120
00:08:50.084 --> 00:08:52.784
The truth is, he was digging a hole on the basement of the store

121
00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:56.384
to sneak into a bank.

122
00:08:57.584 --> 00:09:00.084
Hey, tell me about the case you found.

123
00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:01.084
What?

124
00:09:01.084 --> 00:09:03.584
Yeah, tell us. We'll listen.

125
00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:05.284
But really, it's not a big case.

126
00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:08.884
Just tell us!

127
00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.284
Hey, Dad!

128
00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:14.784
It was last night when I found it.

129
00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:18.484
It was the diary page of the website on the internet.

130
00:09:18.484 --> 00:09:19.984
Diary?

131
00:09:19.984 --> 00:09:22.884
Hey, you stole a glance at somebody's diary?

132
00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:24.184
No.

133
00:09:24.184 --> 00:09:28.884
The owner of the home page laid the diary open so everybody could see it.

134
00:09:28.884 --> 00:09:31.984
Really? That's an unusual hobby he has.

135
00:09:31.984 --> 00:09:36.384
So the owner of that home page has red hair?

136
00:09:36.384 --> 00:09:39.184
No. What's similar to the "Red-headed League"

137
00:09:39.184 --> 00:09:40.884
is the money this person pays.

138
00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:43.084
In the diary, it said,

139
00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:45.284
"Part-time job with super high wage!

140
00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:46.284
Hurray for the economy!

141
00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:49.084
I got some good luck this year!"

142
00:09:50.384 --> 00:09:52.884
The people who are offering this job

143
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.684
are actually a research organization that studies about detoxifying wastes

144
00:09:55.684 --> 00:09:58.684
and they need household wastes for their research.

145
00:09:58.684 --> 00:10:00.284
All you need to do

146
00:10:00.284 --> 00:10:03.084
is to pick up trash bags from dump sites on burnable trash day,

147
00:10:03.084 --> 00:10:05.484
before the garbage truck comes.

148
00:10:05.484 --> 00:10:07.284
You return the trash bags on the next burnable trash day

149
00:10:07.284 --> 00:10:08.784
and pick up new ones.

150
00:10:11.384 --> 00:10:13.384
When you pick up trash,

151
00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:16.484
you use a car that's parked near the dump site.

152
00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:19.784
After loading trash bags, you put the car back to where it was.

153
00:10:19.784 --> 00:10:23.284
On that afternoon, money will be sent to your bank account.

154
00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:25.484
It's 50,000 yen.

155
00:10:26.484 --> 00:10:27.584
50,000 yen?

156
00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:30.084
But wait...

157
00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:32.884
50,000 yen per pick up.

158
00:10:32.884 --> 00:10:34.884
There are two burnable trash days a week.

159
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.984
That'll be 450,000 yen per month.

160
00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:38.384
450,000 yen.

161
00:10:38.384 --> 00:10:39.584
450,000 yen?

162
00:10:39.584 --> 00:10:41.584
Come on, Dad.

163
00:10:41.584 --> 00:10:44.184
That's a crime. You know that, right?

164
00:10:45.584 --> 00:10:50.284
But since it pays well for this stupid job,

165
00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:52.484
it's similar to the "Red-headed League".

166
00:10:52.484 --> 00:10:53.484
You're right.

167
00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:54.684
The person who wrote this diary

168
00:10:54.684 --> 00:10:56.784
found this job on the internet job advertisement,

169
00:10:56.784 --> 00:10:58.884
and then communicated with the client by e-mail.

170
00:10:58.884 --> 00:11:01.384
Three days later, a car key was sent to his house.

171
00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:04.384
It was about two weeks ago that he started the job.

172
00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:07.584
But under the agreement that he cannot quit until the client says so.

173
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.184
I got it.

174
00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:15.184
Perhaps, some celebrities are living around that area

175
00:11:15.184 --> 00:11:18.284
and this rich stalker is enjoying rummaging through their garbage.

176
00:11:18.284 --> 00:11:21.584
The writer thought the same thing at first,

177
00:11:21.584 --> 00:11:24.384
but he later wrote that no celebrity lived near there.

178
00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:26.884
Really?

179
00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:28.284
But there's one thing that's bugging me.

180
00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:32.184
This guy said that there was no sign of anyone going through the garbage.

181
00:11:32.184 --> 00:11:33.284
Huh?

182
00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:35.184
Since the deal was too good,

183
00:11:35.184 --> 00:11:40.784
he got suspicious, so he took pictures of the trash in the trunk.

184
00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:43.884
On the next trash pickup day, he checked if there was any difference.

185
00:11:43.884 --> 00:11:47.484
Yet, nothing seemed to be moved from the way they were.

186
00:11:47.484 --> 00:11:49.984
Then why did the organization offer the job?

187
00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:51.384
I don't know.

188
00:11:51.384 --> 00:11:53.384
Just like the novel,

189
00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:57.484
the client must have been doing something bad near this guy's house

190
00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:01.784
while he was picking up the garbage.

191
00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:04.784
Anyway, do you know this guy's address?

192
00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:08.884
No. He didn't write his home address on his website,

193
00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:11.784
but he wrote where the dump site was.

194
00:12:11.784 --> 00:12:16.984
I think it was near the 3rd street park in Toriya Town.

195
00:12:16.984 --> 00:12:18.684
Toriya Town?

196
00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:23.284
What's the matter, Dad? Do you have something in mind?

197
00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.784
Well, actually...

198
00:12:27.584 --> 00:12:30.884
A new Pachinko parlour has just opened.

199
00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:33.784
I was just thinking about going there!

200
00:12:35.184 --> 00:12:37.884
All right. Why don't we go there now?

201
00:12:37.884 --> 00:12:41.584
It's only 7:30 am. This guy might be there, you know.

202
00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:43.484
All right. Let's go, guys!

203
00:12:44.484 --> 00:12:46.184
Toriya Town?

204
00:12:55.334 --> 00:12:57.834
What is this?

205
00:12:57.834 --> 00:13:01.634
Look. Today is February 5th, Sunday.

206
00:13:01.634 --> 00:13:04.534
The burnable trash day in this area is tomorrow on Monday

207
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.034
and four days later on Thursday.

208
00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:08.234
Looks like it.

209
00:13:08.234 --> 00:13:09.734
What?

210
00:13:09.734 --> 00:13:12.334
What do you mean by that?

211
00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:15.434
No place does garbage pickup on Sunday.

212
00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:18.234
Well, actually...

213
00:13:18.234 --> 00:13:21.334
This guy said on his diary

214
00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.634
that he was told to pick up garbage quietly at early morning

215
00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:25.434
to avoid any problems that might occur.

216
00:13:25.434 --> 00:13:27.434
Because their garbage detoxification research was not yet approved.

217
00:13:27.434 --> 00:13:29.834
You fool! You should've said that beforehand!

218
00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:30.834
Gosh!

219
00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:31.934
That's it!

220
00:13:31.934 --> 00:13:35.134
I'll be walking around here until the Pachinko parlour opens.

221
00:13:35.134 --> 00:13:37.334
-You guys take a train and go home! -What?

222
00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:38.634
Gosh.

223
00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:41.134
-Excuse me, sir. -Huh?

224
00:13:41.134 --> 00:13:43.434
Did see you any tall person with a suspicious look around here

225
00:13:43.434 --> 00:13:45.734
between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm the night before?

226
00:13:45.734 --> 00:13:47.934
-Hey, Takagi. -What?

227
00:13:49.134 --> 00:13:50.434
Mr. Mouri!

228
00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:52.334
What are you doing here?

229
00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:53.434
What are you doing here, too?

230
00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:55.734
Hey, hey, Mouri! You again?

231
00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:57.834
Oh, Inspector!

232
00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:01.734
Please don't tell me that you are involved in this case, too?

233
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:02.934
Case?

234
00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:05.934
There was a murder. Didn't you see the news on TV?

235
00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:07.634
What?

236
00:14:07.634 --> 00:14:08.734
There was a murder?

237
00:14:16.434 --> 00:14:17.534
It's this house.

238
00:14:17.534 --> 00:14:19.834
Well, it looks great.

239
00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:22.334
They are a family of considerable wealth.

240
00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:23.934
Let's see.

241
00:14:23.934 --> 00:14:26.634
The householder is Tatsuhito Funemoto.

242
00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:31.134
And the victim is his wife, Kaneyo, 39 years old.

243
00:14:31.134 --> 00:14:34.434
Yesterday morning, she didn't get out of bed,

244
00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:37.034
so their housekeeper went to Kaneyo's room to call her.

245
00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:40.534
There she was found dead, leaning against the veranda wall.

246
00:14:40.534 --> 00:14:43.934
She was actually shot in the back of the head.

247
00:14:45.434 --> 00:14:47.534
Assuming by the angle of the bullet that was shot into her head,

248
00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:52.334
it seems the criminal is a tall person, perhaps above 180 cm.

249
00:14:52.334 --> 00:14:54.334
Also, considering the estimated time of death,

250
00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:56.834
it was between 9:00 pm to 10:00 pm,

251
00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:59.734
the night before yesterday that Kaneyo was shot.

252
00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:03.634
It was right after she came back from her friend's home party.

253
00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:07.234
I see. Home party?

254
00:15:07.234 --> 00:15:09.334
The bullet is missing because it penetrated the victim's head completely.

255
00:15:09.334 --> 00:15:14.234
We asked the neighbours in this area to search for it,

256
00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:16.734
but we haven't found it yet.

257
00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:19.334
So, what was the motive of the crime?

258
00:15:19.334 --> 00:15:22.134
It was most likely robbery.

259
00:15:22.134 --> 00:15:26.934
Kaneyo was wearing a pearl necklace and bracelet.

260
00:15:26.934 --> 00:15:29.134
But both of them were gone.

261
00:15:30.334 --> 00:15:32.234
And, is there any witnesses?

262
00:15:32.234 --> 00:15:33.934
Well,

263
00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:39.834
we haven't got any information related to the criminal.

264
00:15:41.134 --> 00:15:42.634
I see.

265
00:15:42.634 --> 00:15:45.534
This criminal knows what to do.

266
00:15:45.534 --> 00:15:48.334
This person may be a professional.

267
00:15:48.334 --> 00:15:50.834
I was thinking the same thing.

268
00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.634
What's wrong, Inspector?

269
00:15:52.634 --> 00:15:54.334
You fool!

270
00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:57.534
Why are you explaining every single detail about the case

271
00:15:57.534 --> 00:16:00.334
to this man who has nothing to do with it?

272
00:16:02.134 --> 00:16:04.034
Come on, Inspector.

273
00:16:04.034 --> 00:16:06.334
That's my habit, sir. I'm sorry.

274
00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:07.334
Toriya Town.

275
00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.334
A murder.

276
00:16:12.734 --> 00:16:14.534
No way.

277
00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:15.934
Could it be...

278
00:16:17.534 --> 00:16:19.234
But this guy is involved in this case,

279
00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:21.934
so I shouldn't take this as a normal murder case.

280
00:16:21.934 --> 00:16:23.534
What's the matter, Conan?

281
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.234
Did you figure something out?

282
00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:28.534
No!

283
00:16:28.534 --> 00:16:29.934
No way! No Way!

284
00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:32.534
You guys are not involved in this case, so go home!

285
00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:36.034
The police are going to take care of this.

286
00:16:36.034 --> 00:16:37.934
We do not need Mouri's help.

287
00:16:39.434 --> 00:16:42.334
Gosh, I'm late!

288
00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.334
-Mr. Mouri? -All right, Inspector.

289
00:16:44.334 --> 00:16:46.134
We wish you a good luck on your investigation.

290
00:16:46.134 --> 00:16:47.634
Now, excuse me.

291
00:16:47.634 --> 00:16:49.234
So you're going home?

292
00:16:49.234 --> 00:16:51.434
Hey, Dad!

293
00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:55.034
Why did Mr. Mouri run off in such a hurry?

294
00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:57.934
Well, he's investigating something.

295
00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.434
Investigating something?

296
00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:01.934
Mr. Mouri?

297
00:17:01.934 --> 00:17:03.134
Yes?

298
00:17:03.134 --> 00:17:05.734
Are you the famous Detective Mouri?

299
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.434
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

300
00:17:07.434 --> 00:17:09.234
Yes. I am Kogoro Mouri.

301
00:17:09.234 --> 00:17:10.234
"Takami Shigeno (48)"

302
00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:11.434
Please!

303
00:17:11.434 --> 00:17:14.634
Find the criminal who took away Mrs. Funemoto's life!

304
00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:15.734
What?

305
00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:17.434
Well, but...

306
00:17:17.434 --> 00:17:21.034
You should leave it to the police. They are reliable.

307
00:17:21.034 --> 00:17:24.034
I cannot count on those people!

308
00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:26.134
Please, Mr. Mouri!

309
00:17:26.134 --> 00:17:29.334
I really understand how you're feeling right now,

310
00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:32.734
but I have something that's really important to do.

311
00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:34.234
I will return the favour if you do this for me.

312
00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.034
What? Favour?

313
00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:37.634
Dad!

314
00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:39.934
All right.

315
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.834
Leave it up to me.

316
00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:46.334
I, Kogoro Mouri, shall take revenge in her place.

317
00:17:46.334 --> 00:17:47.734
Thank you very much!

318
00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.934
What's going on?

319
00:17:50.934 --> 00:17:52.934
Tonight is Kaneyo's wake.

320
00:17:54.234 --> 00:17:55.534
Master.

321
00:17:55.534 --> 00:17:57.334
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:57.334 --> 00:17:59.734
This is the famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

323
00:18:00.734 --> 00:18:01.734
"Tatsuhito Funemoto (43)"

324
00:18:01.734 --> 00:18:02.834
Mouri?

325
00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:05.634
Oh, you are that famous...

326
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:09.834
Yes. I am the famous Kogoro Mouri.

327
00:18:09.834 --> 00:18:12.234
But why are you here?

328
00:18:12.234 --> 00:18:14.834
Well, it's kind of a coincidence.

329
00:18:14.834 --> 00:18:16.234
No, it's not a coincidence.

330
00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:17.634
Hey, Mouri!

331
00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:19.934
I've got this.

332
00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:22.434
You don't need to worry about anything because I'm here to help you.

333
00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:24.934
I will catch the criminal.

334
00:18:25.934 --> 00:18:30.934
Master, Mr. Mouri is going to take care of this case.

335
00:18:30.934 --> 00:18:33.134
You don't have to return me the favour right now.

336
00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:34.434
Mouri.

337
00:18:34.434 --> 00:18:36.534
Well, what's your concern, Inspector?

338
00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:41.934
Mr. Mouri has helped us out on a lot of cases.

339
00:18:41.934 --> 00:18:42.934
Takagi.

340
00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:45.834
Gosh, Dad.

341
00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:49.634
Well, I knew it was going to end up like this.

342
00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:51.734
I'm so sorry, Eisuke.

343
00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:54.434
Don't worry about it. I didn't have anything to do actually.

344
00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.634
Am I thinking too hard?

345
00:18:59.034 --> 00:19:02.234
It's very hard to think that he has something to do with them.

346
00:19:02.234 --> 00:19:03.634
Mr. Detective!

347
00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.234
I know who the criminal is!

348
00:19:07.234 --> 00:19:09.234
-What? -Hey, Toji!

349
00:19:09.234 --> 00:19:11.234
Who is this kid?

350
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.734
This is my son, Toji.

351
00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:16.834
"Toji Funemoto (8)" -No wonder he looks bright.

352
00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:21.334
It was a foreign woman in black who killed my mom!

353
00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:23.234
Hey, that's enough!

354
00:19:23.234 --> 00:19:24.734
Why, Dad?

355
00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:27.434
How come you are not listening to me?

356
00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:29.834
Young master, why don't we go over there?

357
00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:32.334
No! Leave me alone!

358
00:19:34.534 --> 00:19:36.534
A foreign woman

359
00:19:36.534 --> 00:19:37.634
dressed in black?

360
00:19:40.134 --> 00:19:42.034
Also, that boy...

361
00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:44.834
Young master!

362
00:19:44.834 --> 00:19:45.934
Toji!

363
00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:49.434
You have to believe me! Mister, you have to believe what I'm saying!

364
00:19:49.434 --> 00:19:51.834
That female foreigner looked suspicious!

365
00:19:51.834 --> 00:19:54.834
She must have killed Mom!

366
00:19:54.834 --> 00:19:56.334
Have I met him before?

367
00:19:56.334 --> 00:19:57.734
I really saw her!

368
00:19:57.734 --> 00:20:00.934
-Mister, please believe me! -Hey, you.

369
00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:04.734
Why do you think that this foreign woman is suspicious?

370
00:20:04.734 --> 00:20:07.434
Because she was asking me strange questions.

371
00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:08.634
Strange questions?

372
00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.134
It was about the accident!

373
00:20:10.134 --> 00:20:12.034
She asked me whether I really saw the accident,

374
00:20:12.034 --> 00:20:14.734
or if I saw the face of the person who got into the accident,

375
00:20:14.734 --> 00:20:18.034
and whether I talked about the accident to Mom and Dad!

376
00:20:18.034 --> 00:20:19.034
Accident?

377
00:20:21.334 --> 00:20:22.934
No way.

378
00:20:22.934 --> 00:20:25.734
And what did you tell her?

379
00:20:25.734 --> 00:20:28.634
I told her that I talked a little bit about it.

380
00:20:28.634 --> 00:20:31.234
She started showing an evil smile after she heard that.

381
00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:35.534
So that must be her!

382
00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:38.134
That woman killed Mom!

383
00:20:38.134 --> 00:20:39.634
I remember it now!

384
00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:48.534
He happened to be...

385
00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:51.734
in that accident.

386
00:20:53.534 --> 00:20:55.134
One of the members of the Black Organization...

387
00:20:56.934 --> 00:20:59.634
Kir, also known as Rena Mizunashi.

388
00:21:02.134 --> 00:21:06.134
She was brought to the hospital because of that accident.

389
00:21:24.634 --> 00:21:26.834
He was at the scene of the accident.

390
00:21:26.834 --> 00:21:28.134
The boy back then...

391
00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:31.134
No doubt about it.

392
00:21:31.134 --> 00:21:32.434
Which means...

393
00:21:32.434 --> 00:21:35.734
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

394
00:21:39.034 --> 00:21:41.534
What is he thinking?

395
00:21:41.534 --> 00:21:43.134
Does he know about this boy?

396
00:21:43.134 --> 00:21:47.034
No, does he even know about the accident?

397
00:21:47.034 --> 00:21:50.234
The accident that FBI is trying to keep secret.

398
00:21:54.334 --> 00:21:57.034
I guess running away is not an option.

399
00:21:59.334 --> 00:22:00.734
That accident

400
00:22:00.734 --> 00:22:02.134
and...

401
00:22:02.134 --> 00:22:03.834
Rena Mizunashi.

402
00:22:03.834 --> 00:22:08.034
Perhaps, the guys in the Black Organization are trying to find her.

403
00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:09.934
The one who is being protected by FBI,

404
00:22:09.934 --> 00:22:11.434
Rena Mizunashi.

405
00:22:11.434 --> 00:22:13.434
No, Kir.

406
00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:17.334
Finally, it's getting interesting.

407
00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:19.834
I don't know what's coming.

408
00:22:19.834 --> 00:22:21.334
All right.

409
00:22:21.334 --> 00:22:22.334
I will take it.

410
00:22:23.734 --> 00:22:24.934
This case.

411
00:22:29.934 --> 00:22:33.634
I am not going to run away.

412
00:24:03.134 --> 00:24:04.734
"Next Episode" -You're talking about...

413
00:24:10.034 --> 00:24:11.734
Maybe they are in the trash?

414
00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:14.034
In the trash?

415
00:24:15.934 --> 00:24:18.334
There's something here.

416
00:24:18.334 --> 00:24:19.334
Onion?

417
00:24:23.834 --> 00:24:25.434
Hey! Don't tell me that...

418
00:24:25.434 --> 00:24:26.634
It's a shooting star.

419
00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:33.134
Next Conan, "The Shadow of the Black Organization: Pearl Shooting Star"

420
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:50.834
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:50.834 --> 00:24:53.034
"Scattering beans for Setsubun"

422
00:24:53.034 --> 00:24:54.434
-Devils out! -It hurts!

423
00:24:54.434 --> 00:24:56.534
-Next week, I'm going to fight the men in the Black Organization! -Ouch!

424
00:24:56.534 --> 00:24:57.934
Do you hear me, Conan?
