1
00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:03.945
Pitcher Inao!

2
00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:06.645
This is his 100th ball. There it goes!

3
00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:12.045
He hit the ball!

4
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:14.845
Did it go up too high?

5
00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:16.445
You idiot!

6
00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:18.745
The centre spreads his hands out wide

7
00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:20.845
and is waiting for the ball to come his way.

8
00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:23.145
Konan High School, is it over for them?

9
00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:25.345
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

10
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:27.545
Here goes, Hiroshi.

11
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.445
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

12
00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.645
I'm going over to where you are.

13
00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:39.345
The Ohgane nine are overjoyed because victory seems near!

14
00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.645
The centre is still in position to catch the ball

15
00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.745
and backs off slowly.

16
00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:52.045
He still backs off.

17
00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:01.345
He made it! He did it! It's a homerun!

18
00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:05.145
It's a tie! A tie!

19
00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.045
Konan High School, the bottom of the ninth inning at the very last minute

20
00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:12.645
with two outs, thanks to their big slugger Nagashima

21
00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:16.345
ties their opponent with a score of 2-2!

22
00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:18.645
That high fly...

23
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.445
Made it.

24
00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:22.945
Amazing.

25
00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:29.845
What's this?

26
00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:34.145
What is going on?

27
00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.245
Dead ball!

28
00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:43.745
Dead ball.

29
00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:45.545
Two players in a row!

30
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:48.745
Ohgane's ace Inao suddenly pitches out of control!

31
00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.545
Is the homerun a while ago affecting him after all?

32
00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:58.945
That's why they should've let number four walk.

33
00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:02.845
He puts on airs,

34
00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:05.745
gets hit and goes out of control, talk about getting worked up.

35
00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:08.645
This is going to be a walk-off homer.

36
00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.845
Struck out swinging!

37
00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:29.645
All right!

38
00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:32.445
What's with that pitcher?

39
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:36.045
The game is 2-2 and will be extended!

40
00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:40.245
What's this sound?

41
00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:43.445
Behind your feet, Kazuha.

42
00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:44.645
Huh?

43
00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:50.545
The cell phone again.

44
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.545
Gosh.

45
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:54.545
Shall we answer it?

46
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.945
Hey! I found the last cell phone!

47
00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:03.945
Come on and show yourself!

48
00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:05.445
Heiji?

49
00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:08.045
The game's not over yet.

50
00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:12.045
It's an extended game.

51
00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.645
An extended game?

52
00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:14.745
Yes.

53
00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:19.845
The Demon of Koshien favours showing itself just before game sets.

54
00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:21.845
Hey?

55
00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:23.945
He says it's an extended game

56
00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.645
but the next code is nowhere!

57
00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:29.145
Darn it!

58
00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:31.345
Mr. Ohtaki, please look for him!

59
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:32.845
I'm sure he's still somewhere around here!

60
00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.345
Okay!

61
00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:38.845
Mail?

62
00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:41.945
I'll look to the right. So please take care of the left, Mr. Ohtaki!

63
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:43.045
Okay!

64
00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:44.145
Wait!

65
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:48.545
It seems we don't need to look for him anymore.

66
00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:20.945
Just as expected of the finals of Koshien!

67
00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.545
It's a great game!

68
00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:25.445
Nonsense.

69
00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:28.345
This isn't such a great place.

70
00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:33.145
Right.

71
00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:37.645
If you guys didn't root, encourage and cheer him on like that...

72
00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:44.745
If this place didn't exist...

73
00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:49.545
my son wouldn't have...

74
00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:19.545
He dropped the ball, he dropped it!

75
00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:23.145
He dropped an ordinary catcher's fly!

76
00:05:23.145 --> 00:05:25.745
Ohgane High School is playing the bottom of the 10th inning

77
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:28.845
as if possessed by the Demon of Koshien!

78
00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:30.145
Faced up against an irregular hit,

79
00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:32.645
fielder's choice and error along with two outs and bases loaded,

80
00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.545
they are in a pinch!

81
00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:37.945
Moreover, the next batter

82
00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:40.845
is number four,

83
00:05:40.845 --> 00:05:42.345
Nagashima!

84
00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.545
They're really up against the wall.

85
00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:53.045
The Ohgane nine gather on the mound!

86
00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:57.045
The disappointed catcher who had dropped the ball cannot lift his head.

87
00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:01.645
Of course he can't.

88
00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:06.845
He made a blooper in front of a large crowd like this.

89
00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:09.545
The other nine members of the team will hold a grudge against him,

90
00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:13.845
and the player as well as his parents, siblings and even his relatives

91
00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:17.745
will face embarrassment.

92
00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:22.445
Just for something like this.

93
00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.945
They're laughing.

94
00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:37.045
That pitcher's laughing.

95
00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:38.745
Really?

96
00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:40.845
They split running to their positions with smiles on their faces,

97
00:06:40.845 --> 00:06:42.145
the nine members of Ohgane!

98
00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.045
It can't be.

99
00:06:45.045 --> 00:06:47.845
How can they keep laughing?

100
00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:51.045
Why at this stage?

101
00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:52.545
Because this is baseball.

102
00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:58.945
You can't play baseball unless all nine members are there.

103
00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:04.545
I'm sure that the pitcher of Ohgane

104
00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:08.545
is thinking for himself as well as for the team

105
00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:11.745
and for the catcher who made an error,

106
00:07:11.745 --> 00:07:15.445
that he's going to slug this ball even if his arms break!

107
00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.645
He hit the ball!

108
00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:23.845
But the ball veered slightly to the left and is a foul!

109
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:26.945
Well, the number number that follows

110
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:29.945
probably wants to send the runner to home, so he's stepping out

111
00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:31.645
and pitching the ball the way he is, even if the ball may hit him.

112
00:07:31.645 --> 00:07:34.245
Although no one knows which team will win yet!

113
00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.945
Absurd.

114
00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:38.845
If they go out of their way and get hurt, they can't become professionals.

115
00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:42.045
They could be throwing their whole life away, you know?

116
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.645
What is it anyway?

117
00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:46.745
What is there to this Koshien?

118
00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:50.645
Devastating! It's a right this time!

119
00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:53.145
The ball has enough distance! Will it make it?

120
00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:55.945
It's a foul! Another big foul!

121
00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.145
There's nothing.

122
00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:03.945
Of course, I think there are many kids here who want to stand out

123
00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:06.245
and become professionals.

124
00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:09.645
But that's all before the game.

125
00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:12.245
Once you set foot on the field

126
00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:14.945
and hear the voice play ball,

127
00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.845
for those kids out there,

128
00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:23.445
it's a battlefield of whether you win or lose.

129
00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:35.445
-Strike! -Strike three!

130
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:38.245
With three players left on base, no points have been scored!

131
00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:41.145
All they want to do is win,

132
00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:43.945
and win the championship.

133
00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:46.745
They have no feelings of profit or loss at this time.

134
00:08:46.745 --> 00:08:49.245
It's just a very simple feeling.

135
00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:55.245
And since you've been involved with baseball,

136
00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:57.945
you should already know of things like this.

137
00:08:57.945 --> 00:08:59.645
Isn't that right?

138
00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:03.345
Teito Jitsugyou High School's advisor for their baseball club,

139
00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:05.445
Mr. Yukio Torimitsu.

140
00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:16.545
Your son was run over,

141
00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:20.845
not because of the truck nor because of Koshien.

142
00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:23.045
Your son tried too hard during club practice,

143
00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:28.045
was pooped and braked too late.

144
00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:32.045
Yeah, that's right.

145
00:09:32.045 --> 00:09:33.845
I knew that.

146
00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:38.145
I knew it, but unless I blamed it on somebody,

147
00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:40.845
I couldn't stand it.

148
00:09:40.845 --> 00:09:43.445
I had to do so to calm my heart

149
00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:46.645
that had been torn apart from losing my beloved son.

150
00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:55.545
But you wouldn't let me push the bomb button after all.

151
00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:06.245
You, as well as both those teams.

152
00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:11.545
Of course not.

153
00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:16.045
This is a place where all the ones in Japan who hate to lose are gathered!

154
00:10:17.045 --> 00:10:18.845
He's right!

155
00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:20.845
Shall we go, then?

156
00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:25.845
The top of the 11th inning top,

157
00:10:25.845 --> 00:10:28.345
Ohgane High School will be batting.

158
00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:08.345
Yes, that's right.

159
00:12:08.345 --> 00:12:09.345
Yes.

160
00:12:09.345 --> 00:12:11.945
Okay, thank you.

161
00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:17.045
Somebody from this jurisdiction will be coming to pick you up.

162
00:12:21.145 --> 00:12:24.245
It's amazing how you deciphered that code

163
00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:25.445
that I thought up at the spur of the moment.

164
00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:33.045
We figured out that 8, 1 and 2 was the Alps seat right away...

165
00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:36.145
Thanks to the greatest man in Japan who likes to crack jokes.

166
00:12:41.945 --> 00:12:43.145
What's up?

167
00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:44.545
A cold?

168
00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:47.145
Idiot! I'd never catch cold!

169
00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:49.245
This seat is in the outfield, you know?

170
00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:51.445
It's not the Alps seat, you know?

171
00:12:55.845 --> 00:12:57.345
Such a great joke!

172
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.145
Sure, sure.

173
00:13:09.742 --> 00:13:11.742
Next Conan's Hint:

174
00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:14.242
"Service Coupon"

175
00:13:14.242 --> 00:13:15.242
It's almost time for long awaited Christmas.

176
00:13:15.242 --> 00:13:16.442
I wonder what I'll get for Christmas this year?

177
00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:18.742
-What a kid! -I look to be in elementary school, you see.
