1
00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:03,099
The encounter with a certain girl

2
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:05,599
was what triggered Inspector Shiratori

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,599
to become a police officer.

4
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:12,499
The Inspector was sure that the girl was Officer Sato,

5
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:14,999
however, it turns out that our homeroom teacher,

6
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:18,399
Ms. Kobayashi was that girl.

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,299
Ms. Kobayashi happened to run into a murder being committed.

8
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,799
The person who was killed

9
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,199
was the woman owner of a pawn shop named Ms. Akira Sumida.

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,599
Many people seemed to have a grudge against her

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,499
for the evil way she did business.

12
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,399
Three clues were acquired from the questioning

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,799
that Ms. Kobayashi underwent with Inspector Shiratori.

14
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,899
The first, is the argument that she heard

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,599
at the site between the killer and the victim.

16
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,799
The second, was a mover's truck like vehicle

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,899
that was parked near the scene of the crime.

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,799
And, the third was the silhouette of the killer

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,599
that Ms. Kobayashi witnessed.

20
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,699
Brooding over passing seasons

21
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,699
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

22
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:22,499
Inspector Shiratori and Ms. Kobayashi.

23
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,699
Where is the case and love affair headed toward?

24
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,299
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,399
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:30,199
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,920
"Inspector Shiratori's Heartbreak"

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,020
Like I said,

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,420
I was at home alone watching TV.

30
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,220
Because I soccer game that I didn't want to miss was on air.

31
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,920
"Kikuna Kagitan (25)" -If it hadn't been for that program,

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,720
I would've wanted to go killer her myself.

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,520
Did you hate her that much?

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,820
Yes. I was hard up for money

35
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,920
so I gave my mother's keepsake ring up to the pawn shop

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,220
as reluctant as I was,

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,020
but when I went to ask her to wait a while longer

38
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,420
because I couldn't come up with enough money in time

39
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,520
to buy back the ring,

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,220
I saw her wearing the ring.

41
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,720
But, she told me, "If it's that cheap ring,

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,420
it got bought right away.

43
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,720
This ring looks like it, but it's a different one.

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,820
It costs 20 times more than the other one too."

45
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,120
She had the nerve to say something like that!

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,520
How about it? You'd want to kill her too, wouldn't you?

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,920
Well... no...

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,220
Inspector?

49
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,720
"Ryoko Takimoto (31)" -I hope you're not thinking

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,220
that I killer her?

51
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,720
Well, no...

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,720
But, on the day that she was killed,

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,520
you said you took off from work

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,820
and was sleeping alone in your room.

55
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,920
I can't help it.

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
My cold took a bad turn.

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,020
And, what is your relationship with the victim?

58
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,620
I heard that you really hated her.

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,220
I didn't really hate her.

60
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,720
The antique plate that I bought

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,020
from that pawn shop for 500,000 yen smelled funny,

62
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,420
so I had an expert check on it and found...

63
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,320
that it was a well-made replica costing 300 yen.

64
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,720
Moreover, the smell that was on the plate was that of cat food,

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,220
because she fed her cat using that plate,

66
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,820
but I don't hate her at all.

67
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
Yes, it's true

68
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,320
that she loaned me money about 500,000 yen.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,820
I finally came up with the cash

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
and was ready to give it back to her,

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,620
but how can I now that she's dead.

72
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,920
"Ryusuke Kodama (27)" -To proof my innocence,

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,420
the time that she is dead,

74
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,620
I was drunk and totally out.

75
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,420
But, I heard that even the day before she was killed

76
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,320
she went to your apartment shouting

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,120
that she wanted her money back.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,620
She was just putting on an act, an act.

79
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,020
She used to put on that kind of act to come and see me.

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,820
After all, I'm a former hero of high school baseball.

81
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,920
Well, I hurt my left shoulder before

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I was drafted and couldn't become a professional player,

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,420
so I don't think anyone remembers me though.

84
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,820
In other words...

85
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,320
That woman was in love with me.

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Do you get it?

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
You're able to record the voices of all three suspects, right?

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,820
Yes.

89
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,220
All we need to do is to have Ms. Kobayashi check it

90
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,720
and we're done.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,820
Well, it seems that the killer is a woman,

92
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
so I guess the man has nothing to do with the case.

93
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,120
What kind of person is that Ms. Kobayashi?

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,920
I heard that Inspector Shiratori is head over

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
heels over her from Yumi.

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,420
She's Conan and the others homeroom teacher

97
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,120
at their elementary school.

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
It seems that they coincidentally got to know each other the other day,

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
because of the incident.

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
I was under the impression that Inspector Shiratori

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,820
liked someone who was working

102
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
inside the metropolitan police department here,

103
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,720
but I guess I was mistaken.

104
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,320
It was you, you.

105
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,520
At any rate, will you let me see her?

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,320
I think you'd be better off not seeing her.

107
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Why shouldn't I meet her?

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
Well... That's because there are many things involved.

109
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
A lot of things involved, is not an answer, is it?

110
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,220
It's just not a good idea...

111
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,520
She really is here.

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
The one who looks just like me.

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
If I remember correctly, her name is...

114
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Ms. Miwako Sato.

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,420
How envious...

116
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,020
I wanted to be a woman detective too.

117
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Really, that Takagi is making lovey dovey again

118
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,320
with our Miwako.

119
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,920
I think he's getting carried away

120
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,220
because Shiratori backed off.

121
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
Yes.

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,720
After all, he was the top in charge of protecting Miwako Sato.

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,920
Shiratori, really made out, didn't he?

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,820
Yes. I didn't think she would look that much like Sato.

125
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,720
I wonder if there's another one somewhere?

126
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,920
-That teacher's the last. -Yes, right?

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,620
Ms. Kobayashi.

128
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,720
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

130
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,820
Ms. Kobayashi?

131
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,320
"This ring looks like it, but it's a different one.

132
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,520
It costs 20 times more than the other one too."

133
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,620
She had the nerve to say something like that!

134
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,720
How about it? You'd want to kill her too, wouldn't you?

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,120
This is the voice of the first suspect, Ms. Kikuna Kagitani.

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
I see.

137
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,720
This next one is...

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,020
Moreover, the smell that was on the plate was that of cat food,

139
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,420
because she fed her cat using that plate,

140
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,520
but I don't hate her at all!

141
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,020
The voice of the second suspect, Ms. Ryoko Takimoto.

142
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,520
I see.

143
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,320
And, the next one is the voice of the third suspect

144
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,220
Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

145
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,420
Well, I don't think he's part of it

146
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,120
because he is a man, but just to be safe.

147
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,920
If he's not part of it, why bother?

148
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,620
I see.

149
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,820
So, out of the two voices of the women

150
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,520
you just listened to do you remember hearing either one?

151
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,020
The voice that you heard at the scene of the crime,

152
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,320
which voice sounded like the shouting of the killer?

153
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,920
I selected and had you listen to the part

154
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
where both women got excited during the interrogation.

155
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,620
Teacher.

156
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,020
What's wrong?

157
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,220
You heard the voice of the killer, didn't you?

158
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,220
I think it was different from either of their voices.

159
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,820
The woman's voice I heard was lower and gruffer.

160
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,620
I see.

161
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,820
So, I think you should look for another suspect

162
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,320
or that it would be better if you talk to the person

163
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
who was driving the mover-like truck

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,420
that I saw move away.

165
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,420
About that vehicle...

166
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,220
We can't find it

167
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,220
a car with large prints of "0" and "9" on it.

168
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
No.

169
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,920
Maybe you saw different numbers?

170
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,420
If the wall was in the way and blocked

171
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,120
you vision "5" and "9" resemble each other.

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,620
Just because they look alike,

173
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,320
I wouldn't make a mistake!

174
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,420
Not me!

175
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,820
"Not me"?

176
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, it could be that the car stopped

177
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,420
by there because of something besides work too.

178
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,120
Of course, we took that into consideration too

179
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,720
and pried deeper.

180
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Moreover, we asked the residents

181
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
who live in the vicinity too.

182
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,620
Nobody seems to have called the movers

183
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,220
or a delivery truck either.

184
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,020
Then are you saying that...

185
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm saying something unreliable,

186
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,620
leading the police into confusion,

187
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,020
and making fun of all of you here at the station?

188
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,320
No way.

189
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,520
I've already told you everything

190
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,320
that I've seen and heard, so...

191
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,620
if you will excuse me, I would like to leave.

192
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,220
Let me drive you home.

193
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,220
There's a possibility that you may run into the suspects too, so...

194
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,320
I'll be fine.

195
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,120
I can very well take of myself, thank you.

196
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,820
Will you please let me be already?

197
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,120
Goodbye.

198
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,920
Mr. Shiratori.

199
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,820
Teacher.

200
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,620
Inspector Shiratori.

201
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,020
I think you should take Ms. Kobayashi home.

202
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,820
After all, the killer has seen her face.

203
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Yes.

204
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,120
Officer Chiba,

205
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,420
could I ask you to take her home?

206
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,820
Sure, but are you sure about it?

207
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,020
Yes.

208
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,320
It seems that she doesn't like me anymore.

209
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,820
Ms. Kobayashi! Please wait.

210
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
Hey, you!

211
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,120
Why doesn't she like you anymore?

212
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,920
Did you say something you shouldn't have to her?

213
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,520
I have no idea.

214
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,720
There's only one thing thinkable.

215
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,620
I think it's because Ms. Kobayashi met Officer Sato.

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,220
What? Ms. Kobayashi met Officer Sato?

217
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,720
In addition, if she found out that you

218
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,620
were head over heels over Officer Sato,

219
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm sure that Ms. Kobayashi would think

220
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Inspector Shiratori is kind to her

221
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,320
only because she looks like Officer Sato.

222
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,120
That maybe she was just a substitute for Officer Sato.

223
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,520
No, Ms. Kobayashi is not a substitute,

224
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,320
but rather, she's my destiny.

225
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,220
But, it's a fact that you mistook the woman of your destiny

226
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,720
for Officer Sato, right?

227
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,220
I don't mean to deny that but...

228
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,220
I think it's about time you tell her, don't you?

229
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,720
That Ms. Kobayashi is the person of your destiny

230
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,320
who during your childhood,

231
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,820
you tried to protect at a bookstore from some shoplifters.

232
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,520
Of course, I feel that way too, but...

233
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
I couldn't find the right timing to tell her about it.

234
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,320
Hello! Inspector in love.

235
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,620
How were the voices of the suspects?

236
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,120
She already listened to them, didn't she?

237
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,220
Yes, but it seems that none of them had the voice she heard.

238
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Is that so?

239
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,920
And? Where's the teacher that Shiratori is head over heels over?

240
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,220
Well...

241
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,920
Since you said that you wanted to meet her at all cost.

242
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,620
Mr. Shiratori?

243
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,820
That...

244
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,520
Well... I don't think I should, at least not right now.

245
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
What?

246
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,484
"Next day in school"

247
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:16,284
Goodbye.

248
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,084
-Bye, teacher! -Bye, teacher!

249
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,684
Yes, goodbye.

250
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:21,584
Bye, teacher!

251
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,084
Goodbye, don't run, it's dangerous!

252
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,984
Okay!

253
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,784
Teacher, doesn't look too cheerful.

254
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,684
I wonder if she hasn't heard

255
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:36,784
from Inspector Shiratori that she's the woman of his destiny.

256
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:39,884
Okay, maybe I should go tell her then?

257
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,484
No!

258
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:44,784
It's not romantic unless he tells her himself!

259
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:50,184
But, if left as is, she'll probably end up never knowing.

260
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:52,384
Well, maybe all for the better?

261
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:55,384
After all there's a great big liar who's not disclosing his identity

262
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,384
for the longest time even to the one he loves.

263
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:58,484
Hey.

264
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:01,484
But, I wonder why the person

265
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:02,984
with the killer's voice wasn't there?

266
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:07,284
Yes. I heard that there were only three suspects

267
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:09,584
who had a grudge against the victim Mrs. Sumida

268
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:10,784
as well as not have an alibi.

269
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,384
Three people.

270
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,284
We only heard the voices of two people, right?

271
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:17,284
That's why...

272
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:19,884
the third suspect is a man, they cut him out

273
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:24,184
because the voice that teacher heard was that of a woman!

274
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,984
By the way...

275
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,284
Mr. Ryunosuke Kodama who was cut out

276
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,184
used to be a hot high school baseball player

277
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:35,184
but he hurt his shoulder and wasn't drafted.

278
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:38,884
He seems to be working at a host club now.

279
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,384
But, unable to give up his dream,

280
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:43,484
he was trying to get up the ladder

281
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,084
joining a baseball club team in between his work time.

282
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:49,384
But, he seriously hurt his shoulder again

283
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:52,084
and this time had to really give up playing.

284
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:54,884
You really know the details, don't you?

285
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,484
Yes. Because after that,

286
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:59,184
Officer Takagi gave me the details.

287
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:01,184
Then, what about the remaining two?

288
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,984
Let's see... the first one,

289
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:06,084
Ms. Kikuna Kagitani is unemployed.

290
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,084
She was previously the leader of a women motorbike gang.

291
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,184
But, she got into an accident and hurt someone,

292
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,384
so her driver's license is suspended for now.

293
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:14,484
Leader of a motorbike gang?

294
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:17,284
Yes, if she calls out,

295
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,784
she could easily gather at least 100 people.

296
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:23,384
Maybe she's the killer?

297
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:25,584
I wonder... But, because of that accident,

298
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,784
she had to come up with fee for court

299
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:30,284
as well as gratuity cash, so she was in need of money.

300
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,684
What about the last one?

301
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:32,784
Yeah.

302
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:36,384
Ms. Ryoko Takimoto is the owner of a Japanese cuisine restaurant

303
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:38,384
and daughter of a rich family.

304
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,184
It seems that she was deceived

305
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:41,784
into buying a plate worth nothing,

306
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:43,884
and in order to get back the cash she paid for it,

307
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,884
she dished out a large amount of cash

308
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,384
to hire an attorney in preparation

309
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:50,484
to charge a complaint against Ms. Sumida who was killed.

310
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:54,184
Well, she seems to have been having discussions with her lawyers,

311
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,684
not even taking time out for sleeping and caught a cold.

312
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:58,084
The last time she was summoned by the police,

313
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:00,184
she was also wearing a mask.

314
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:01,384
A mask?

315
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:05,084
I see. She deliberately wore a mask to hide her voice.

316
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,384
I thought the same thing in the beginning too,

317
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,584
but the masks nowadays are thin and let the voice through.

318
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:13,884
Her voice didn't sound muffled either.

319
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:17,484
But, if the voice of the killer that teacher heard was that of a woman,

320
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:21,684
and if one of the two of them is the killer,

321
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,784
then wouldn't the one who was wearing the mask

322
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,884
be the most suspicious?

323
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,784
That's what's bothering me.

324
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:32,684
How did Ms. Kobayashi know that it was the voice of the killer

325
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:34,784
when all she did was hear the voice?

326
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,784
Of course, she would know.

327
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,984
Because the woman shouted,

328
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:42,284
"Give that to me. I'll kill you!"

329
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:45,084
Besides, Ms. Kobayashi said that the killer who got away,

330
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:47,084
had pretty big breasts.

331
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:50,584
But, the victim Ms. Sumida is also a woman.

332
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:56,084
It could be that Ms. Sumida was the one who said, "I'll kill you."

333
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:58,384
Right. After being told, "I'll kill you"...

334
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,584
The person may have in an act of aggression

335
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,284
from fear took drastic action.

336
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:03,684
And the car that Ms. Kobayashi said

337
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:07,784
that she saw move away with the number "0" and "9" on it...

338
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:09,784
Why can't it be found?

339
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:13,684
There was no number on the car of the person

340
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,584
that doctor helped move the other day either.

341
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,184
Did you see that car?

342
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:21,984
No. I asked, just in case.

343
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:25,084
Whether there were any numbers on the car.

344
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:29,384
The name of the mover was "Osaka Niko Niko Transport Co."

345
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,484
It had no number on it,

346
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,084
just the name of the company in big print.

347
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,384
Company name... was it?

348
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:39,684
Doctor said that the driver of the truck

349
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,584
wasn't used to Tokyo,

350
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,184
and the car navigator was not working too well either,

351
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,984
so he got lost.

352
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:47,684
Then, they started moving after 8 pm,

353
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,884
so it was a lot of trouble.

354
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,384
Genta.

355
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,884
You've been in deep for some time now.

356
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,984
Is something bothering you?

357
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,684
What? No...

358
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:02,584
My cavity hurts so I was just holding it down.

359
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:03,884
A cavity?

360
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:04,984
You've been talking about it

361
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,884
from before summer vacation, haven't you?

362
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,284
I don't like going to the dentist.

363
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,384
Then, just stop posing in a way

364
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,284
to make others worry and hurry on off to the dentist.

365
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:18,684
I see... Maybe...

366
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,484
Inspector Shiratori?

367
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,884
What brings you here?

368
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,084
Haven't I already told you

369
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,884
that I have nothing more to tell the police?

370
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:31,084
Yes, but...

371
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:33,684
after checking a lot of things since then,

372
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,784
we've come to the conclusion that the suspects that we've come up

373
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:38,984
with are the only ones that could be the killer.

374
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,184
So, will you please listen

375
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,584
to the voices of the three suspects once again?

376
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,684
There's no need for that.

377
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:44,984
I already told you, didn't I?

378
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:47,884
That no one in the voice that I heard in the recorder

379
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,484
matched the voice of the killer.

380
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:51,984
Or, are you accusing me of lying?

381
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:54,184
I'm lying.

382
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,984
Me wanting you to confirm the voices

383
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,784
of the suspects again is just an excuse.

384
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:03,984
I really came to see you.

385
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,984
To undo the misunderstanding between us.

386
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:09,084
I haven't misunderstood anything.

387
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,484
Looks good!

388
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,184
Go for it, Inspector Shiratori!

389
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:18,284
The fact is, the incident that occurred the other day

390
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:21,084
is not the first time I saw you.

391
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:24,384
I've met you long, long time ago.

392
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:26,484
The little girl that stopped some boys

393
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:29,284
from shoplifting in a bookstore.

394
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,784
Bookstore? Shoplifting?

395
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,284
Yes.

396
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:36,384
I was moved by that girl.

397
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,284
That's why I became a police officer.

398
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,384
After seeing how courageous you were.

399
00:19:42,384 --> 00:19:45,184
Courageous... Police officer...

400
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:50,684
How about it? Do you remember?

401
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:53,884
No. I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

402
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:54,984
What?

403
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:57,384
Besides, isn't that girl...

404
00:19:57,384 --> 00:20:01,084
I think you've mistaken Officer Sato for me, haven't you?

405
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,884
No, that's...

406
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,084
If you will excuse me...

407
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:06,584
Wait.

408
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:10,784
Teacher.

409
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:28,584
Goodbye, Ms. Kobayashi.

410
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:30,484
I'll be leaving now,

411
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:32,884
so please make sure you lock all the doors.

412
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:35,184
Yes.

413
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:36,484
Goodbye.

414
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,984
Bye.

415
00:20:57,984 --> 00:20:59,284
"Incoming call, 8:27 pm"

416
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,084
Yes, this is Teitan Elementary.

417
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,784
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

418
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:12,684
I'm calling from the police.

419
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:14,984
May I speak to Ms. Kobayashi please?

420
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,484
I'm Kobayashi.

421
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,984
I said I have nothing more to tell the police.

422
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:22,384
The car with the numbers "0" and "9"

423
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:26,084
that you witnessed has been found.

424
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,384
We've taken a picture of it,

425
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:29,184
so I was wondering if you could confirm it.

426
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:34,284
Yes. Then please come with that picture at a later date.

427
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,384
No, since I wanted you to confirm it right away,

428
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,684
I had the guard open the gate for me,

429
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:40,884
and I'm already in the school building.

430
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,984
I see.

431
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,784
Then, please come to the teachers' room.

432
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:46,784
How about the music room?

433
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:49,384
The thing is, this is my alma mater,

434
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:51,284
and I used to belong to the brass band club.

435
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:54,584
I felt so nostalgic that I was looking around here and there.

436
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,584
Really?

437
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:58,284
I'll see you in the music room, then.

438
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,184
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

439
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,384
This school is his alma mater?

440
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:07,384
I wonder what year he graduated.

441
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:10,784
Maybe he used to be my classmate.

442
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:24,684
But the music room was renovated last year

443
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,484
and all the walls and desks were changed,

444
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:29,584
so how could he feel nostalgic?

445
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:35,784
Besides, his voice just now sounds familiar.

446
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:10,684
It seems that your trump card didn't work for you.

447
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:14,284
If we can prove that her testimony was correct,

448
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:17,184
maybe she'll open her heart.

449
00:24:17,184 --> 00:24:18,184
Who is it?

450
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,084
Was someone there?

451
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:25,684
Yes, a suspicious looking silhouetted figure

452
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:27,484
was looking in on us.

453
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:32,884
Next Conan,

454
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:36,308
"Timeless Cherry Blossom Love Affair"

455
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:54,253
Next Conan's Hint:

456
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:56,053
"Giraffe".

457
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,953
We'll be on air starting at 7:30 pm next week

458
00:24:57,953 --> 00:24:59,553
because of a special program "24 Hours" TV that will be aired.

459
00:24:59,553 --> 00:25:00,953
Don't forget, okay!
