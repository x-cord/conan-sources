1
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,840
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,840
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,640
Today we take a slow drive along a mountain path.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
At the bottom of the valley is the smell of murder.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,540
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,999
"Mt. Ryujin in West Tama County"

9
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,999
"Tsuzura Ori Pass"

10
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,299
Some hill this is!

11
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,799
We've come so far up.

12
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,999
We've still got a long way to go.

13
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,599
We've only come about halfway.

14
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,599
Oh, no. You've gotta be kidding.

15
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,299
What's up?

16
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,899
Oh, man.

17
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,599
With all that right and left swinging,

18
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,599
my head's spinning.

19
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,599
Come on, what a sissy.

20
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,699
This place called Tsuzura Ori Pass,

21
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,699
has a succession of 99 curves, big and small in all.

22
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:38,799
I feel nauseated just listening to you.

23
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,699
Where is Mitsuhiko?

24
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,199
Mitsuhiko's reading a book in the car.

25
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,099
What?

26
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,799
Mitsuhiko!

27
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,499
It feels just great out here!

28
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:55,099
No, thanks. I'm reading the best part now!

29
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,499
Dr. Agasa, Ai didn't come along again.

30
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:05,999
Ai was saying she had something to do.

31
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,099
Dr. Agasa, I'll bet you that...

32
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,499
This was what happened,

33
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:17,099
"I'm not interested in camps."

34
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,599
You're really good, Genta. It's just like her.

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,999
Bull's eye.

36
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,099
What's that?

37
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,499
Oh, no!

38
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,399
Dr. Agasa! Get the police and an ambulance!

39
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,599
Okay!

40
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,999
"Great Fall From Mt. Ryujin"

41
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,699
You said you were resting at the scenic spot there

42
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:01,099
when you witnessed the car go over the cliff,

43
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,199
-so you came running over, right? -Yes.

44
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,899
That dent?

45
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,299
If so...

46
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,499
I'd like to ask you once again...

47
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:15,099
Did you notice something else suspicious, like a car or a person?

48
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,899
No, nothing at all.

49
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,999
I see.

50
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,199
That's it.

51
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,999
Officer.

52
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,499
What is it, sonny?

53
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,099
May I go and take a look at what the men are doing above?

54
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:32,799
No, no. It's not something for a child to watch!

55
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,799
I think they're almost finished up there anyway.

56
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,199
It should be okay.

57
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,999
But...

58
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,199
But, sonny,

59
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,399
make sure you don't get in the way of their work when you watch them.

60
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,699
Yes, sir!

61
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,999
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

62
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,199
don't we have to go, too?

63
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,599
Conan's going to go off on his own like always, you know?

64
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,499
Who cares?

65
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,399
Let him do what he pleases.

66
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,899
We've got something better here.

67
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,099
Something better?

68
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,899
Okay, here!

69
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,399
Okay!

70
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,299
16.33 meters.

71
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,199
16.33...

72
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,799
There.

73
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,399
It's a piece of polish that rubbed off!

74
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,399
Really?

75
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,299
Look, it's dark blue!

76
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,699
Dark blue.

77
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,099
Which means...

78
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:38,499
Yeah!

79
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,099
So that's what happened.

80
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:47,299
We came all the way out here to have a picnic

81
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:50,099
and get messed up in an accident like this.

82
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,999
It's not an accident.

83
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,499
What do you mean it's not an accident?

84
00:05:55,499 --> 00:06:00,699
Didn't the officer there ask you if you saw any other cars?

85
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,999
Yeah.

86
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:06,999
That car fell over because it was pushed from behind by another car.

87
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,999
What?

88
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,599
That car had a dent in the rear,

89
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,599
an indication of it having been hit from behind.

90
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,499
Besides, the paint that seemed to have rubbed off

91
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,099
from the other car was also found.

92
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,099
Moreover,

93
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,899
the car that hit from behind most likely did so deliberately.

94
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,799
Then it's homicide.

95
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,299
Yeah.

96
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:30,499
Don't we have to cooperate with the police?

97
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,999
It'll be fine, after all, they've got so much evidence.

98
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:38,599
But, all they've got is rubbed off paint and a dent in the rear.

99
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,099
The Japanese police are usually very efficient.

100
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,999
So long as a piece of rubbed off paint is found,

101
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,999
from the color and substance they can figure out the model of the car, too.

102
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,199
Then all they have to do is go asking around for details

103
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,999
to get to the one who did it.

104
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,699
I see.

105
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,699
Mitsuhiko,

106
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,099
what do you mean by something better?

107
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,499
Quiet. Conan will hear you.

108
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,399
This is it, Genta.

109
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,899
What is this?

110
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,299
It's a code.

111
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,299
A codes?

112
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,699
I picked it up near the site of the accident just a while ago.

113
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,999
Then, shouldn't you have told the police about it?

114
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:29,199
But, what we saw was just an accident, wasn't it?

115
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,699
It's hard to believe that a code has anything to do with it.

116
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:33,899
You're right.

117
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,699
Codes are usually used for figuring out

118
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,199
where treasures are hidden, aren't they?

119
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,099
Right, exactly.

120
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,399
Treasure.

121
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,099
So, take a good look at this!

122
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,799
See, on the very top in the square, the equation "100 minus 1" is written.

123
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,299
Okay, Genta, what is 100 minus 1?

124
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,799
Nine...

125
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,599
Ninety-nine?

126
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,299
Right.

127
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,699
Is there something that crosses your mind

128
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,899
when you think of the number 99?

129
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,699
99...

130
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,799
Nine...

131
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,999
911, ambulance.

132
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,699
Nope.

133
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,299
Whatever gave you the idea of 911 at this point?

134
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,299
First aid bandage then?

135
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,099
I got it!

136
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,999
It's the Tsuzura Ori Pass, right?

137
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,199
Dr. Agasa just explained

138
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,499
that there is a succession of 99 hairpin curves, didn't he?

139
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:31,399
Correct.

140
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,999
Which means that this code indicates

141
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,999
a place somewhere in the Tsuzura Ori Pass area.

142
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,699
And, did you figure out where it is, Mitsuhiko?

143
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:44,299
No, but this code sure looks familiar.

144
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,499
Where did you see it, Mitsuhiko?

145
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,899
Hey, you guys!

146
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,699
What's with all the racket?

147
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,099
It's nothing!

148
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,899
Right, right. We're not talking about any codes.

149
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:58,999
Codes?

150
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:03,099
Oh, well, the novel that I was reading you see...

151
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,499
Some codes came out...

152
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:08,299
They're too easy for you, Conan, so...

153
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,199
Gosh, so it's children's stuff.

154
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,799
I've got it.

155
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,799
Okay then, you guys,

156
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,199
Dr. Agasa and I are going fishing,

157
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,799
don't forget to chop the firewood.

158
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,599
Okay...

159
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,899
Bye.

160
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,299
Here goes!

161
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,199
Mitsuhiko, did you really figure it out?

162
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:38,499
It was in the book that I was reading!

163
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:39,899
Really?

164
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,999
This!

165
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,699
What is this?

166
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,799
The keyboard of a computer?

167
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,199
Yes.

168
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,699
Numbers are written in numerical order from the top left,

169
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,699
and they correspond to the same hiragana keys!

170
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:55,999
For instance, 1 and 4 equal the hiragana "ta".

171
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,999
2 and 7 equals "to" and so forth.

172
00:09:58,999 --> 00:09:59,999
All right!

173
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,099
Let's try it!

174
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:05,599
Genta, please read the number codes.

175
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,199
Okay!

176
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,499
0 and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 8.

177
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,399
0 and 4 ecuals "u".

178
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,199
2 and 3 equals "se".

179
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,899
3 and 8 equals "tsu".

180
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,899
A right turn?

181
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,499
What is this mark supposed to mean?

182
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,699
Maybe this is the shape of the road?

183
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,199
Right! You're probably right.

184
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,999
That's why the first code can be deciphered as

185
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,099
"Turn right at the intersection".

186
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,699
You're fantastic, Mitsuhiko.

187
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:38,699
Let's continue.

188
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,399
I'll write it down.

189
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,899
This is boring.

190
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,099
There, it's done!

191
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,599
Please read it.

192
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,199
I'll follow along on the map.

193
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,299
Okay!

194
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,699
Turn right at the intersection after passing Tsuzura Ori Pass.

195
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,799
Turn right at the forked road,

196
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,099
then turn left at the next fork.

197
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,299
Cross two bridges,

198
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,299
turn left after the 2nd bridge and goal.

199
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,599
Okay, it's over here.

200
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:17,099
The pension house is over here, so it's pretty close.

201
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,899
Let's go check it out.

202
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,699
Maybe we'll find the treasure.

203
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,199
I'm sure Conan will be vexed.

204
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,199
We're here.

205
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:37,999
Hey, are you guys upstairs?

206
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:40,899
We've had a big catch!

207
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,099
What is this?

208
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,199
Hey, bad news.

209
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:50,599
The kids are nowhere in sight!

210
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,799
What?

211
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,699
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

212
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,799
Are we not there yet?

213
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,399
We've only got a little more to go, so hang in there, Genta.

214
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,899
We're crossing the 2nd bridge now.

215
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,799
After we turn right at the next fork, we'll get there!

216
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,999
We've still got that much more to go.

217
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,999
Hang in there, Genta!

218
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,799
If we find the treasure, you'll get a luxurious serving of eels over rice!

219
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,799
Eels over rice.

220
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,599
Okay, if we find the treasure,

221
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,699
I'll eat all the eels over rice I can eat!

222
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,099
Let's go, Mitsuhiko, for 100,000 eels over rice.

223
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,999
All right, that's the spirit.

224
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,699
This is bad. Could this be...

225
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,299
Did you figure it out?

226
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,699
Dr. Agasa, call the police right away!

227
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,799
What?

228
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,999
They went to the hideout of the one

229
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,099
who pushed the car over just a while ago.

230
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,899
What?

231
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,399
So this was the code they were talking about in the car a while ago.

232
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,899
Darn!

233
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,888
We did it! We've finally come, Genta!

234
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,188
It's over there!

235
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:20,588
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

236
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,688
are you sure this is the right place?

237
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:26,488
It doesn't look to have anything to do with treasure, does it?

238
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:27,988
What a thing to say!

239
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:31,788
We came exactly as the code said, so it's got to be right!

240
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:36,988
Besides, it's places like this that treasures are usually hidden.

241
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:39,188
Okay, let's go inside then!

242
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:49,388
Yes, thank you.

243
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,888
The police will rush over to the site immediately.

244
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,988
Let's hurry on over, too.

245
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:56,988
Okay.

246
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:00,988
It seems that nobody is in...

247
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,988
Hey, Mitsuhiko, where's the treasure?

248
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:13,688
The building farthest beyond...

249
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,488
Look!

250
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,288
That building over there is capable of being locked.

251
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,588
-I'm sure it's there. -Yep.

252
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:24,488
Let's check it out!

253
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,588
This is...

254
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,488
Amazing!

255
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:43,688
Look at all those foreign model cars!

256
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:46,088
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

257
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:48,988
there's no treasure anywhere, though.

258
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:52,088
Strange.

259
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:54,588
Hey, you two.

260
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:56,888
There's something funny about this car.

261
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:57,888
See.

262
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:00,588
It has no license plate.

263
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:02,988
You're right.

264
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:04,688
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

265
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,788
There's none on this one, too.

266
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,788
Maybe they're all stolen cars.

267
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:15,888
I'm sure they're planning to sell it off to some foreign country.

268
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:19,888
We've come to the hideout of car smugglers!

269
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,788
Exactly!

270
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,188
You're the brats that were at the site of the accident...

271
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,288
Who cares!

272
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:41,688
Where's the guy with the mustache and the other kid?

273
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:44,088
Just who are you referring to?

274
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,988
Don't you play dumb with me!

275
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,688
What was that sound?

276
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,888
-The sound of gunfire! -What?

277
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,688
Hurry up will you, Dr. Agasa?

278
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,488
All right!

279
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:03,188
I'll ask you once more.

280
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:07,588
Where's the guy with 4 the mustache and the other kid?

281
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,888
I have no idea what you're talking about.

282
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,088
What?

283
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,888
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

284
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,688
Mitsuhiko.

285
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:17,688
No, I can't get Conan and Dr. Agasa involved in something

286
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:20,288
I got messed up in because of my actions.

287
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:22,488
He's right.

288
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:23,688
Yeah.

289
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:28,088
You must really want to die.

290
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,088
It's me.

291
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:40,988
Sorry, I've only got 5 for now.

292
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:44,888
Sada chickened out and rode off with one.

293
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,388
Yeah, I took care of that.

294
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:49,288
I hit him from behind at the ridge,

295
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:51,788
and he fell headfirst all the way down.

296
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:55,188
I'm no goof.

297
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,988
I'll scrap the car before the police get to it.

298
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:01,588
Once it's scrapped, there's no proof.

299
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,288
That's...

300
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,988
Hey, what's with you guys?

301
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,688
What's with you?

302
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,088
Swinging around a rifle at children!

303
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,388
Dr. Agasa.

304
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,388
You're the one who was at the scene of the accident.

305
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,688
There couldn't be better timing. You saved me time looking for you!

306
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,688
No use, mister.

307
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,488
See, you hear it, don't you?

308
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,388
That police car is headed here.

309
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:33,888
What?

310
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:37,188
They're coming here

311
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:39,888
to arrest you, mister!

312
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,288
What?

313
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,288
All right...

314
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:50,488
Hey, hey, officers...

315
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:53,488
I haven't done anything wrong.

316
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:57,088
Before we hear you out, give us that gun of yours.

317
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,488
Oh, you mean this gun?

318
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:03,588
I was only trying to scare the kids

319
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,788
because they trespassed on my property.

320
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:08,088
I see.

321
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,088
By the way, is that your car?

322
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,888
Yeah, that's right. Anything wrong?

323
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:19,688
Well, a car happened to go over the cliff at Tsuzura Ori Pass

324
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:22,588
and it seems that a car of the same model as your

325
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,988
pushed that car over from behind.

326
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:29,088
Your car has a dent too and it looks like to have struck something.

327
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,488
What? Are you suspecting me?

328
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,288
There are several hundreds of cars like this, aren't there?

329
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,388
Just how many of those hundreds do you think

330
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:40,288
happened to be at the scene of the accident?

331
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,588
And where were you, May I ask, at that time?

332
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:47,088
Sorry, that was an accident.

333
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:48,688
Since the scenery was so beautiful,

334
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,488
I took my eyes off the road.

335
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,788
And the next thing I knew, crash!

336
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,188
He's lying, officer!

337
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,288
Shut up, stay out of this, brat!

338
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,388
No, I'm not shutting up!

339
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,788
You just said on the phone

340
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,688
that you struck the car and pushed it over the cliff!

341
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:04,388
I heard you say so, too!

342
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:06,088
Me, too!

343
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:11,188
Hey, officer. Are you going to believe what those brats say?

344
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:14,188
Just how do you think I can push a car over a cliff

345
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,588
by crashing from behind at a sharp bend like that?

346
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,988
You did exactly that!

347
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:20,488
You succeeded perfectly!

348
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:22,788
Old man! Quit your gibberish!

349
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,988
Do you have proof, or what? Proof!

350
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,588
Of course there's proof.

351
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:29,488
In the foreground of the curve where that car fell over,

352
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:32,188
there were two pairs of tire marks,

353
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:36,288
that were left behind when the car was hit from behind.

354
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:40,388
In other words, you collided twice.

355
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,088
So what?

356
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:45,688
I wasn't looking at the road and I collided twice.

357
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:49,688
Well, there is a possibility too, however...

358
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:55,088
Do you know the space between the tires of the car that fell over?

359
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,588
Yes, 16.33 meters.

360
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:04,188
And, at what speed were you going at on that road?

361
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,788
Just about 30 kilometers!

362
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:11,188
Well, I guess so...

363
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:14,988
The fact that you were going at 30 kilometers means

364
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:18,388
you were going at about 8.3 meters per second.

365
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:24,088
In order to leave skid marks at a spacing of 16.33 meters.

366
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,288
It would take you approximately 2 seconds.

367
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:28,888
After colliding into the car in question, the first time,

368
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:30,188
for a period of 2 seconds,

369
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,288
you never steered to avoid another collision,

370
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,188
nor did you step on the brakes.

371
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:36,988
Rather, you collided again!

372
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:38,288
If this is not called colliding deliberately,

373
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,888
what else would you call it?

374
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:44,088
So, if you have anything more you want to say,

375
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:47,088
we'll hear you out at the station.

376
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:48,388
Darn!

377
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,088
Officer...

378
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:55,588
There are luxurious cars without license plates in the building beyond.

379
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,588
I'm sure those cars are all stolen cars.

380
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:01,988
Good work, all of you!

381
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,488
But, listen.

382
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,388
Don't ever do something dangerous like this again!

383
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:09,788
Yes, sir...

384
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:49,988
Darn. I just don't seem to have the knack for chopping firewood.

385
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,788
Darn, darn it!

386
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,888
Hey, we need more firewood!

387
00:22:55,888 --> 00:23:00,588
Hey, Conan, why don t you help us a bit on this side, too?

388
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,288
No way!

389
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:04,688
It's your fault for loafing around without chopping firewood

390
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:08,488
like you should've been, serves you right.

391
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,888
Yes, yes, all right.

392
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,488
One "yes" is enough!

393
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:13,788
Yes!

394
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:17,788
I hope they learn their lesson and quit doing dangerous things.

395
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:22,188
How disappointing, though.

396
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:23,488
What is?

397
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:27,788
Conan deciphered that code in no time at all!

398
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:30,188
You were fantastic too, Mitsuhiko!

399
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:31,788
Not only did you figure out the code,

400
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,988
you also were right about the smugglers.

401
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:38,088
Oh, I just thought so because it was in the book I was reading.

402
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:42,188
Just great. Maybe I should look through it, too.

403
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:45,688
Oh, I've got just the thing for you, Genta!

404
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:48,488
"Children's Lunch Murder Case" is the title of it.

405
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:49,688
What a funny title!

406
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:53,788
I would rather have eels over nice than a children's lunch.

407
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,888
Hey, haven't you guys learned your lesson or what?

408
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,988
"Next Episode" -How nice and bitter!

409
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:03,488
This is indeed what you call the world of 'Wabi-Sabi'!

410
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:07,888
I wonder what's up? Why is she looking around like that?

411
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:11,188
Are you saying that the master is afraid of a monster?

412
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,488
I wonder if there really is such a thing as a monster?

413
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:18,088
Don't be ridiculous! No way should such a thing exists!

414
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:22,488
Ryozo has...

415
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:24,888
Next Conan,

416
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:28,509
"The Legend of The Five Colored Water Palace (Part 1)"

417
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,606
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,406
"Hanging Scroll"

419
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,206
The next episode is an original animation that is difficult to solve.

420
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:37,406
No matter how many times I watch it, I can't figure it out.
