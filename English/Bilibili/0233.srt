1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.340
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.440
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.840
Three cute doggies and four fishy breeders.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.340
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:04.153
"The Nonvanishing Evidence (Part 1)"

8
00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:06.853
How cute!

9
00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:12.353
He's a male Shiba Dog.

10
00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:14.453
What's his name?

11
00:02:14.453 --> 00:02:15.953
"Teruya Kanou (26)" -Arthur!

12
00:02:15.953 --> 00:02:18.653
We named him after Arthur Conan Doyle,

13
00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:21.953
the creator the renowned detective, Sherlock Holmes.

14
00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:24.353
If he joins up with Conan,

15
00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:26.753
it'll be the start of the world's greatest detective agency, right?

16
00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:29.353
Hey, you want me to join up with a dog?

17
00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:32.853
Sounds good! It's a very cute girlish concept.

18
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:35.153
You're too picky.

19
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:36.853
All right, all right.

20
00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:40.453
Well, it's been 10 year

21
00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.153
since I've been here and this town has really changed.

22
00:02:43.153 --> 00:02:45.953
Did you find the new parking lot?

23
00:02:45.953 --> 00:02:48.553
That area resembles a we-like pattern and is very complicated.

24
00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:52.453
Ai navigated me using the map so I didn't get lost.

25
00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.753
Hey, Arthur. Stop it, will you?

26
00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:06.453
Strange, he rarely gets excited and barks like this.

27
00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:07.653
Hey, Doctor.

28
00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:08.653
Huh?

29
00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:12.453
Did you touch a dog before you came here?

30
00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:16.253
Moreover, a male dog that is larger than this Shiba dog.

31
00:03:16.253 --> 00:03:18.753
Yes, together with Ai.

32
00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:22.353
I saw a Doberman that a friend brought along with him this morning.

33
00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:24.453
But, why?

34
00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:27.053
You had dog hair on your slacks.

35
00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:30.853
Dogs are able to tell the size and sex of another dog by smell.

36
00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:32.253
Among male dogs,

37
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.953
when they find that there is another dog bigger than themselves,

38
00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:36.553
a sense of enmity is aroused at times.

39
00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:40.853
Besides, you and Ai came over to this gate once,

40
00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.153
and were told by Mr. Kanou to go park your car again,

41
00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:45.453
and then came back, right?

42
00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:46.653
Therefore,

43
00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:50.453
Arthur got the impression that you and Haibara are his owner's enemy,

44
00:03:50.453 --> 00:03:52.753
because despite being shooed away once,

45
00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:54.953
you came back again.

46
00:03:54.953 --> 00:03:56.853
Oh, I see.

47
00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:58.953
You're not too bright, are you?

48
00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:00.953
You seem to resemble Conan

49
00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:03.653
when it comes to being slightly absentminded, don't you?

50
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.353
Hey, hey.

51
00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:07.553
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

52
00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:08.653
Because his mistaken impression

53
00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.953
is due to his natural behavior as a dog.

54
00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:13.853
Dangerous people who are not of his kind.

55
00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.853
In my case,

56
00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:19.153
maybe he's not all that mistaken.

57
00:04:19.153 --> 00:04:21.453
Hey, Haibara...

58
00:04:21.453 --> 00:04:22.953
Just kidding.

59
00:04:24.653 --> 00:04:27.253
You know...

60
00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:29.553
And one more thing.

61
00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:33.153
There is one other reason why Arthur barks.

62
00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:37.953
It's your voice when you hold Arthur down.

63
00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:39.753
"Yoshio Tsunashima (45)" -You're too soft.

64
00:04:39.753 --> 00:04:42.153
When you scold him, you've got to be stern.

65
00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:48.153
Otherwise, the dog will think you, the master is cheering him on.

66
00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.653
So, keep that it mind, will you?

67
00:04:49.653 --> 00:04:50.753
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:52.353
Who is he?

69
00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:55.653
He is Mr. Tsunashima who I met at the Dog Lovers Club.

70
00:04:55.653 --> 00:04:59.253
He's here for the same reason as you are, Dr. Agasa.

71
00:05:00.953 --> 00:05:02.253
How nice!

72
00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:04.153
So cool!

73
00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:06.353
This plane is mine!

74
00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:08.253
This doll is for me!

75
00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:11.853
This antique hour-glass is for me, then.

76
00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.253
But are you sure you don't mind?

77
00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:15.153
They look so expensive.

78
00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:16.253
Of course, not.

79
00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:18.253
Those are just objects that my grandfather bought

80
00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:21.053
and collected as a pastime while traveling abroad.

81
00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:24.353
Although all three of us in the family have no interest in antiques,

82
00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:26.853
we wouldn't feel right selling his things off either.

83
00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:28.753
Therefore, both my parents decided

84
00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:30.453
to give them away to our acquaintances.

85
00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:33.753
Come to think of it, where are they?

86
00:05:33.753 --> 00:05:36.453
They've both gone over to the new house,

87
00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:37.753
that was just built and are getting ready to move,

88
00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.253
so they're not here.

89
00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:42.453
I'm going to be moving to England because of work,

90
00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:44.153
so my parents are going to move to the country

91
00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:47.553
where my father's younger brother lives.

92
00:05:47.553 --> 00:05:49.453
That's why I'm trying to clear

93
00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:53.053
all kinds of things out of this house.

94
00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:56.153
The only thing I'm going to take with me to England is Arthur.

95
00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:58.553
All that my parents will be taking with them is

96
00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:01.453
my mother's dear dog, Doyle.

97
00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:06.953
It's a Papillon!

98
00:06:06.953 --> 00:06:08.853
If there's Arthur and Doyle,

99
00:06:08.853 --> 00:06:10.853
there must be a dog named Conan, too?

100
00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:14.053
My father had a dog named Conan,

101
00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:16.753
but it died due to an illness two years ago.

102
00:06:16.753 --> 00:06:18.353
Oh, I see.

103
00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:19.753
But it's okay.

104
00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:21.453
Because we have Conan with us.

105
00:06:21.453 --> 00:06:24.053
Just what do you mean, Ayumi?

106
00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:27.453
But the name Papillon is sure a funny name.

107
00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.853
Papillon means butterfly in French.

108
00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:33.053
They were really hailed

109
00:06:33.053 --> 00:06:34.953
by the Imperial Court of France in the 16th Century.

110
00:06:34.953 --> 00:06:39.153
It is said that Marie Antoinette also owned a pet Papillon.

111
00:06:41.053 --> 00:06:44.953
What a fine coat of fur indeed!

112
00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:48.153
It's no surprise that he was awarded the championship award.

113
00:06:48.153 --> 00:06:49.453
Championship award?

114
00:06:49.453 --> 00:06:52.553
He just happened to win the award at the contest my mother entered in.

115
00:06:52.553 --> 00:06:54.153
Well, this dog is fine dog indeed

116
00:06:54.153 --> 00:06:57.753
that there's people asking to buy him for a million yen.

117
00:06:57.753 --> 00:06:59.553
A million yen?

118
00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:03.753
Really, what a gracious and refined dog he is.

119
00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:05.653
He is so much like the spoiled, selfish

120
00:07:05.653 --> 00:07:09.053
and beheaded Queen of France.

121
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.753
Ms. Tosabayashi.

122
00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:13.553
"Aki Tosabayashi (39)" -The front door was open,

123
00:07:13.553 --> 00:07:16.253
so I took the liberty of letting myself in.

124
00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:20.553
Because you mother told me that she'd give me anything I want.

125
00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:21.853
As for this living room,

126
00:07:21.853 --> 00:07:25.653
the only thing that I'm interested in is that large flower vase.

127
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.353
You people can go help yourselves for all I care.

128
00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:31.453
No offense, but I'm going to hunt around on my own.

129
00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:33.653
Is she a member of your dog lovers club, too?

130
00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:34.753
Yes.

131
00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:37.353
She wasn't like that before, though.

132
00:07:38.353 --> 00:07:42.853
She's just all sulky because her dog lost to Doyle at the contest.

133
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:44.653
Oh, no.

134
00:07:44.653 --> 00:07:47.253
I can't have that lady claiming the clock in the Japanese room

135
00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:49.353
that I reserved for myself.

136
00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:50.653
I'll have to stick a note on that clock

137
00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:53.053
noting that it's already reserved.

138
00:07:53.053 --> 00:07:55.753
Why don't you get yourself something too, Haibara?

139
00:07:56.453 --> 00:07:59.053
We should take this opportunity to go help ourselves.

140
00:07:59.053 --> 00:08:02.253
There are a lot of interesting things here.

141
00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:04.153
I guess so.

142
00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:06.753
Maybe I should take Doyle.

143
00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.853
Huh?

144
00:08:08.853 --> 00:08:11.153
Because if I am put to the guillotine

145
00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:14.053
and disappear as mist like Marie,

146
00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:15.053
don't you think this dog will come after me

147
00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:17.953
and jump into the Seine River

148
00:08:17.953 --> 00:08:21.153
as did her dog Thisbe, right?

149
00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:22.853
Right?

150
00:08:22.853 --> 00:08:24.753
Hey, come on.

151
00:08:24.753 --> 00:08:26.953
She sure is quite an odd girl, isn't she?

152
00:08:26.953 --> 00:08:29.753
Yes, sort of...

153
00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:33.553
Hey, Shinichi. Can't you cheer her up a bit?

154
00:08:33.553 --> 00:08:35.053
I really had a hard time bringing Ai

155
00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:39.953
who refused leave the house after that bus incident, you know.

156
00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.353
Strange.

157
00:08:42.353 --> 00:08:43.453
After the incident,

158
00:08:43.453 --> 00:08:46.653
I called her on the phone and told her not to worry

159
00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:49.253
since no suspicious or unidentified people came up

160
00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:52.853
during police interrogation.

161
00:08:52.853 --> 00:08:56.353
But the way she's freaked out is not normal.

162
00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:58.653
She even refuses to eat.

163
00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:01.353
She doesn't seem to be sleeping much at night either.

164
00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.653
The only thing I can say for sure now is that

165
00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:07.253
even if there were any men on that bus

166
00:09:07.253 --> 00:09:09.153
who were members of the Black Organization,

167
00:09:09.153 --> 00:09:11.353
it was mere coincidence.

168
00:09:11.353 --> 00:09:15.253
And not because they knew of her existence.

169
00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:18.653
Besides, it's been 10 days since the incident.

170
00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:21.753
If it weren't a coincidence, we would've been killed by now.

171
00:09:21.753 --> 00:09:24.153
Including you and them too, because you were all there.

172
00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:28.253
-Because... -It might be good.

173
00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:31.453
Hey, not again.

174
00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:34.753
Dr. Agasa, if you find something you want,

175
00:09:34.753 --> 00:09:36.453
please feel free to take it too.

176
00:09:36.453 --> 00:09:38.253
Oh, I guess so.

177
00:09:38.253 --> 00:09:40.853
Let's see.

178
00:09:40.853 --> 00:09:45.353
Then, I guess I'll take this stereo.

179
00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:46.553
Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:49.153
Somebody has already reserved that.

181
00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:50.353
Huh?

182
00:09:51.553 --> 00:09:52.653
Arthur.

183
00:09:52.653 --> 00:09:55.653
No, you can't come in with dirty feet like that.

184
00:09:56.653 --> 00:09:58.053
Hey!

185
00:09:58.053 --> 00:09:59.153
What is it, Arthur?

186
00:09:59.153 --> 00:10:01.253
Hey! All right.

187
00:10:01.253 --> 00:10:04.153
I get the message, so let go of me, Arthur.

188
00:10:05.653 --> 00:10:07.453
What is it?

189
00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:10.053
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:12.253
I pushed the door bell many times,

191
00:10:12.253 --> 00:10:14.053
but it seems to be broken.

192
00:10:14.053 --> 00:10:17.153
"Shino Hasuki (27)" -Arthur was nice enough to go and get you,

193
00:10:17.153 --> 00:10:19.553
so please don't scold him.

194
00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:20.653
Oh, no.

195
00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.853
I'm very sorry for not knowing you had come.

196
00:10:22.853 --> 00:10:24.853
Go on, and play with Arthur.

197
00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:31.853
They really get along, don't they?

198
00:10:31.853 --> 00:10:34.753
A Shetland Sheep Dog!

199
00:10:34.753 --> 00:10:36.853
Yes, her name is Christie!

200
00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:41.253
I see, the King and Queen in a detective story.

201
00:10:41.253 --> 00:10:43.053
By any chance, is she the one

202
00:10:43.053 --> 00:10:44.453
who reserved that stereo set?

203
00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:45.753
Yes.

204
00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:47.953
I thought it'd be a good gift to give to my younger brother

205
00:10:47.953 --> 00:10:50.153
in celebration of his enrollment into high school.

206
00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:51.253
If you ask me,

207
00:10:51.253 --> 00:10:53.853
the sooner you separate the two dogs, the better.

208
00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:54.853
Huh?

209
00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:58.653
You can't sell cross breed babies for a high price.

210
00:10:58.653 --> 00:11:00.853
Needless to worry,

211
00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:04.453
because Arthur is going to be leaving for England soon.

212
00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:05.853
Isn't that right, Kanou?

213
00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:07.853
Yes.

214
00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:15.353
I wonder what's got onto Doyle?

215
00:11:15.353 --> 00:11:16.953
It's his snack time.

216
00:11:16.953 --> 00:11:18.153
What?

217
00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:22.153
My grandfather liked dogs a lot, too.

218
00:11:22.153 --> 00:11:26.553
In an attempt to show Doyle to my late grandfather,

219
00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:28.053
my mother used to feed Doyle

220
00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:30.253
in front of the Buddhist altar in the Japanese room.

221
00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:34.653
And Doyle acquired the habit of doing so ever since.

222
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:37.953
So, when the clock in the Japanese room strikes 12:00 noon,

223
00:11:37.953 --> 00:11:39.453
he runs over to the room,

224
00:11:39.453 --> 00:11:42.253
sits on the cushion and waits.

225
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.253
A cushion?

226
00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:48.453
Yes, Doyle loves the blue cushion,

227
00:11:48.453 --> 00:11:51.953
so he bring it in front of the altar himself.

228
00:11:51.953 --> 00:11:56.053
But doesn't the clock ring at midnight, too?

229
00:11:56.053 --> 00:11:58.953
What happens if Doyle mistakenly brings the cushion, then?

230
00:11:58.953 --> 00:12:00.453
That's no problem

231
00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.253
because we asked the clock maker to fix the clock

232
00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:05.253
so that it would only ring at 12:00 noon.

233
00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:06.653
Are you sure you don't mind

234
00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:09.753
me taking such a precious clock with me?

235
00:12:09.753 --> 00:12:10.753
Yes.

236
00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:13.253
Because mother mentioned that it's about time we stop pampering Doyle

237
00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:16.753
and start feeding him only twice a day, in the morning and at night.

238
00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:18.553
Oh, I guess it's all right then.

239
00:12:18.553 --> 00:12:21.253
Go ahead and look through that space.

240
00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:25.053
Doyle is sitting there, isn't he?

241
00:12:25.053 --> 00:12:27.853
On the blue cushion...

242
00:12:27.853 --> 00:12:29.753
Doyle's not there.

243
00:12:29.753 --> 00:12:32.553
The blue cushion is not out either.

244
00:12:32.553 --> 00:12:33.953
Huh?

245
00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:39.353
Maybe he couldn't pull out the blue cushions

246
00:12:39.353 --> 00:12:41.153
because there in between the brown ones?

247
00:12:41.153 --> 00:12:44.053
No, because he usually pulls the blue cushion out

248
00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:47.353
from under the others with his mouth and puts it on the floor.

249
00:12:47.353 --> 00:12:50.253
Strange. I wonder where he went.

250
00:12:50.253 --> 00:12:53.253
Anyway, let's split up and look for him.

251
00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:56.553
What if he's stuck some place and cannot come out?

252
00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.853
Yes.

253
00:12:57.853 --> 00:12:59.553
Doyle!

254
00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:01.753
Where are you?

255
00:13:01.753 --> 00:13:04.353
Come out here, Doyle!

256
00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:06.553
Doyle!

257
00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:08.053
He's nowhere in sight.

258
00:13:09.753 --> 00:13:11.153
Hey, did you find him?

259
00:13:11.153 --> 00:13:12.353
No, we didn't!

260
00:13:12.353 --> 00:13:14.553
We even looked in the bath tub.

261
00:13:16.153 --> 00:13:17.453
Arthur's barking!

262
00:13:17.453 --> 00:13:20.053
Christie's barking, too!

263
00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:22.053
The backyard. Let's go!

264
00:13:29.153 --> 00:13:31.753
Smoke is coming out of the incinerator!

265
00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:35.653
We've stopped using that incinerator long time ago.

266
00:13:35.653 --> 00:13:36.953
Don't tell me that...

267
00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:40.353
Shoes?

268
00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:49.053
It can't be...

269
00:13:52.253 --> 00:13:54.153
A collar?

270
00:13:54.153 --> 00:13:56.753
Don't tell me that's...

271
00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.553
Doyle's...

272
00:13:58.553 --> 00:14:01.753
It can't be...

273
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:21.861
Doyle...

274
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.161
Don't worry.

275
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:27.561
Only this collar was burned.

276
00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:30.561
There was no dead body of a dog in the incinerator.

277
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:33.461
By the way, is this really Doyle's collar?

278
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:35.061
I didn't see anything just a while ago.

279
00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:36.261
Yes.

280
00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:39.361
It's usually covered with his fur and is not visible.

281
00:14:39.361 --> 00:14:42.561
It's burnt black, but I'm sure of the color and the print on it.

282
00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:46.761
Grandpa bought this collar in France for the Papillon

283
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.861
that he used to own.

284
00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:50.061
It's very old.

285
00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:52.161
Please take a look over here!

286
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.661
The lock of the back door is open.

287
00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.861
Really...

288
00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:58.161
I see.

289
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:03.261
The one who took Doyle away, fled from this back gate.

290
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:05.061
But why?

291
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:08.161
Why was the collar is in the incinerator?

292
00:15:08.161 --> 00:15:09.561
The one who took Doyle away took off the collar

293
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:12.461
so that it would be hard to tell one Papillon from the other.

294
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:15.861
Besides, that collar was a unique collar with decoration on it.

295
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:18.061
I don't think so.

296
00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:21.861
Because why would somebody who steals a dog and is in a rush to flee

297
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:25.561
go out of the way to burn a collar which is covered under the fur

298
00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.961
that can't be seen and leave traces of how he or she escaped?

299
00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.061
I'm sure that the one who did it

300
00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:33.161
wanted to make it look like he or she fled outside of the premises.

301
00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:35.361
Which means that Doyle is still...

302
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:37.961
Yes. It's most likely that Doyle

303
00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:40.961
is being hidden somewhere in this house.

304
00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:43.361
Hey, does that mean...

305
00:15:43.361 --> 00:15:47.561
Don't tell me that the person who hid Doyle is still in this house?

306
00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:52.261
Hey, don't tell me that you suspect us?

307
00:15:52.261 --> 00:15:54.561
Oh, no. But...

308
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:56.761
But if it's as that boy's says,

309
00:15:56.761 --> 00:15:59.561
we already have a definite idea of who did it.

310
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:02.061
Look over there.

311
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:04.361
Those ladies shoes.

312
00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:07.461
Those are mine, but why?

313
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:09.261
Come on, let's not play dumb!

314
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:12.161
Aren't those your shoes that you brought from the front entrance?

315
00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:13.661
No.

316
00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:15.161
That can't be.

317
00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:17.761
The criminal would never leave shoes out like that

318
00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:20.561
and if someone is seen carrying their shoes in the house,

319
00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:22.961
anyone would deem that person to be acting suspicious?

320
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:27.961
Ms. Hasuki, you've been here more than one or two times, right?

321
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:30.461
That's right.

322
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:31.961
If so, that you could've trained Christie

323
00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:35.461
to bring your shoes from the front entrance to here,

324
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:39.961
then back to the front entrance again, right?

325
00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:42.361
That's ridiculous.

326
00:16:42.361 --> 00:16:46.561
Anyway, let's go and look for Doyle again!

327
00:16:46.561 --> 00:16:49.661
We'll go with him,

328
00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:52.361
so why don't you three go and search for Doyle together, Doc?

329
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:54.361
Okay.

330
00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:01.761
But, Conan, how are we going to look for the dog?

331
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.661
We've looked practically all over the house just a while ago.

332
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:09.461
That's why we don't search for places where dog might hide this time,

333
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:12.661
but we look for places where humans would hide them.

334
00:17:12.661 --> 00:17:16.261
That's right! Let's have Arthur help us!

335
00:17:16.261 --> 00:17:17.461
Don't you get it?

336
00:17:17.461 --> 00:17:19.061
His nose.

337
00:17:19.061 --> 00:17:20.661
We'll make him help us by using the best weapon he has,

338
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:23.261
which is his nose.

339
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:24.361
A dog's nose

340
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:26.961
is much more capable of sniffing out smell than humans.

341
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:30.961
So, if we make Arthur sniff Doyle's smell,

342
00:17:30.961 --> 00:17:33.261
I'm sure he will help us find him.

343
00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:36.161
Here it is.

344
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.461
The cushion used in Doyle's bed.

345
00:17:38.461 --> 00:17:41.361
Come on, Arthur.

346
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:44.861
But he's not a police dog.

347
00:17:44.861 --> 00:17:48.361
But it may work!

348
00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:51.661
Because father used to play around with Arthur doing things like this.

349
00:17:54.861 --> 00:17:56.661
I think he's found him.

350
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:59.361
He's going into the Japanese room!

351
00:17:59.361 --> 00:18:01.661
That means Doyle is in there!

352
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:03.961
Huh?

353
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:08.061
A blue cushion?

354
00:18:09.261 --> 00:18:13.861
Come to think of it, Doyle likes blue cushions too, right?

355
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:16.461
Do dogs like blue?

356
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:18.661
Huh?

357
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:19.861
That's strange.

358
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.561
Just a while ago, there were only two blue cushions.

359
00:18:24.761 --> 00:18:28.261
Counting the one that Arthur brought out makes three blue cushions.

360
00:18:30.461 --> 00:18:32.661
One extra cushion.

361
00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:34.961
What does this all mean?

362
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:40.561
Maybe he can't do it.

363
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:45.161
Hey, did Arthur ever do something like hide shoes?

364
00:18:45.161 --> 00:18:47.661
No, he once did the opposite, though.

365
00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:50.561
It was back when Arthur was still a puppy.

366
00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:51.661
When I stood up,

367
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:53.861
Arthur, thinking that I was going to take him for a walk,

368
00:18:53.861 --> 00:18:55.661
would rush over to the front door,

369
00:18:55.661 --> 00:18:59.561
take my shoes out of the shoe cabinet and bringing it to me.

370
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:04.161
But once he found out that it wasn't always the case,

371
00:19:04.161 --> 00:19:05.461
he stopped doing it.

372
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:06.761
But that's fantastic.

373
00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:10.261
Arthur is no ordinary dog, after all!

374
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:13.761
Go ahead and sniff Doyle's smell once more!

375
00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:18.761
There he goes!

376
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.861
But he stopped in front of the living room.

377
00:19:23.861 --> 00:19:26.361
He looks like to be thinking.

378
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:29.461
Oh, he's walking again.

379
00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:32.561
He's heading for the front entrance!

380
00:19:34.061 --> 00:19:36.761
Huh? He's gone outside.

381
00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:39.761
Maybe Doyle was taken outside!

382
00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:46.961
Oh, come on. All he's doing is flirting with Christie.

383
00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:49.861
Maybe he's just tired of searching already.

384
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:51.561
I guess it can't be helped.

385
00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:56.461
Hey, is there any place that Doyle usually hides when he was scolded?

386
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:00.261
Maybe when the person removed the collar by force,

387
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:03.861
Doyle got scared and hid somewhere on his own?

388
00:20:05.361 --> 00:20:08.761
Arthur used to hide under my bed a lot.

389
00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:10.461
Under the bed?

390
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:13.261
Yes. When I first got Doyle,

391
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:15.261
I used scold Arthur a lot.

392
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:18.761
When I was hugging Doyle as a puppy in the living room,

393
00:20:18.761 --> 00:20:20.461
Arthur used to get jealous

394
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:23.361
and tear the cushion in the living room apart.

395
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:27.161
They get along now, though.

396
00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.061
I wonder where Doyle is hiding though.

397
00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:33.261
Poor thing if he's trembling in fright somewhere.

398
00:20:33.261 --> 00:20:34.761
Right.

399
00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:39.161
The people who are looking for you are bound to find you one day.

400
00:20:39.161 --> 00:20:41.561
There are nothing tougher than to live in terror hiding.

401
00:20:41.561 --> 00:20:43.361
Hey! That's enough.

402
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:45.561
-What are you all sulky about? -Nothing.

403
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:47.861
I'm just trying to tell an optimist with no real strategy prepared

404
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:51.161
of the dangerous situation involved here.

405
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:53.561
I don't know for what reason,

406
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:54.861
but what I know for sure is that

407
00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:57.561
one of their men were on that bus.

408
00:20:57.561 --> 00:21:02.761
If they even had the slightest notion of my identity back then,

409
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:06.261
me, you and everyone else...

410
00:21:06.261 --> 00:21:08.061
Don't worry about it!

411
00:21:08.061 --> 00:21:10.861
I can assure you that you haven't been identified.

412
00:21:10.861 --> 00:21:13.961
Why? How can you be so sure?

413
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:16.861
Just as you can sniff them out, I just know.

414
00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:21.661
I can tell when someone has a threatening air about them.

415
00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:24.161
I guess you could call it the intuition of a detective.

416
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.561
Well, if I were able to tell who possesses this threatening air,

417
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:29.061
I wouldn't have problems.

418
00:21:29.061 --> 00:21:32.261
But I know for sure that no such person was on board that bus.

419
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:35.461
That is, the person that is making you feel threatened.

420
00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:38.061
What's with that look on your face?

421
00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:39.561
Do you despise detectives or what?

422
00:21:39.561 --> 00:21:42.461
No, I'm just totally bored.

423
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:44.261
Oh, I see.

424
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:47.661
Let me recall once again.

425
00:21:47.661 --> 00:21:49.961
Back when Doyle disappeared...

426
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:55.061
At the chime when the clock struck 12:00,

427
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.261
Doyle headed for the Japanese room where he could get his snack,

428
00:21:57.261 --> 00:22:00.061
and disappeared from our view.

429
00:22:00.061 --> 00:22:01.061
After that,

430
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:04.461
we all followed Mr. Kanou who went into the kitchen

431
00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:07.061
to get the cheese snack.

432
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:11.061
Then we went to the Japanese room and found that Doyle was not there.

433
00:22:11.061 --> 00:22:15.061
So, we split up and looked all over the house for Doyle.

434
00:22:15.061 --> 00:22:17.261
This is approximately how the layout of the house is.

435
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:20.561
We don't really know who searched where yet.

436
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:25.161
But where on earth did the person hide Doyle?

437
00:22:25.161 --> 00:22:29.761
And how is that person planning to carry Doyle out of here?

438
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:06.661
"Next Episode" -Wait a second.

439
00:24:06.661 --> 00:24:08.261
When I looked at it while ago...

440
00:24:09.161 --> 00:24:10.861
What's this cotton like thing?

441
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:13.261
It looks like some sort of chemical fiber.

442
00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:15.861
What's the matter, Conan?

443
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:19.461
Was Doyle burnt in there?

444
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:21.061
I see.

445
00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:23.461
That's what the person used.

446
00:24:25.561 --> 00:24:27.561
This is the sound of...

447
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:29.861
The sound of the wall clock in the Japanese room.

448
00:24:29.861 --> 00:24:35.182
Next Conan, "The Nonvanishing Evidence (Part 2)"

449
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:37.879
Next Conan's Hint:

450
00:24:37.879 --> 00:24:39.979
"Traces of the cushion"

451
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.379
Let's mimic Doyle's bark.

452
00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:43.379
Arthur! Christie!

453
00:24:43.379 --> 00:24:44.579
They all sound the same.
