00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,490
There was a case the old man solved
before he was known by that name.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,910
And it was the beginning of everything
that happened in this case.

Someone stole my precious brooch.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,270
I don't know when it was stolen,

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,220
but I noticed this morning because
I found this in my mailbox.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,350
Kaetsu Kanae-sama
but I noticed this morning because
I found this in my mailbox.

Kaetsu Kanae-sama

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,120
Let me take a look.

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,370
"I have your precious brooch.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,030
If you want it back, come and
get it in the underworld.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,680
Come to Kuroochi Park.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,160
If you notify the police, I'll dispose
of your treasure immediately."

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,350
The underworld, huh?

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,160
Why is this brooch a treasure?

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,120
It's not expensive, but it's a keepsake from
my mother who passed away the other day.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,550
I'd like to settle this quietly, which is why
I'm asking you for help rather than the police.

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,920
I understand.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,430
But this word...

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,430
Underworld
But this word...

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,680
It's possible they're using this stolen treasure
as bait to lure her into her own murder.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,780
But she sure is pretty!

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,920
Is there a problem?

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,440
Oh, no!

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,130
You can count on me.

29
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,910
The great Mori Kogoro has never
accepted a job and failed!

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,470
Thank you.

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,430
You really are as great
a detective as they say.

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,670
What's he talking about?

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,400
But what do they mean by "underworld?"

34
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,530
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

35
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,340
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,200
The beautiful woman's mysterious letter!

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,340

Always determining the one truth

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,610

and the mind of an adult,

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,990

This is actually my first
time at Kuroochi Park.

48
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,297
Where's the entrance?

That's right. This place...

51
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:22,437
Mori-san, is something wrong?

52
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:23,817
Oh, no!

53
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,787
Let's go.

54
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,547
Now, where is it?

55
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:36,827
The brooch... The brooch... The brooch...

56
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:43,097
We haven't found a sign of
your treasure or the culprit.

57
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:44,807
What should we do?

58
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:47,547
What's that sound?

59
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:50,207
What's that?

60
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,847
Kaetsu Kanae-sama

61
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,397
What's this?

62
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:59,307
It's just like the letter I received.

63
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,107
Let's see. What's inside?

64
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,127
"So you hired Detective Mori.

65
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:09,307
The two of you can enjoy
the road to hell together.

66
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:13,867
If you want your treasure back,
come to Dadagaya Concert Hall."

67
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:17,967
How does the culprit know I hired you?

68
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:23,877
They were probably watching from somewhere
inside the park to see if you'd bring the police.

69
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:29,127
While we were searching
every inch of the park,

70
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,467
the culprit wrote this letter.

71
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:38,337
Then they stuffed it inside that clock
so it would be discovered and left.

72
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:42,557
Then the culprit was here
somewhere in this park.

73
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:43,397
Yes.

74
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:48,947
But they make it sound like they're fine
dealing with a detective and not the police.

75
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,907
They've underestimated Mori Kogoro!

76
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:55,607
Let's go to Dadagaya Concert Hall.

Yes, it's a wonderful place.

85
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:15,807
Watch out!

86
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:28,107
That car...

87
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,907
So they are trying to kill us.

88
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,367
It's all right.

89
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:35,867
What's that?

90
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:43,827
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,337
It's important.

92
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,737
Let's go.

93
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:50,627
All right.

94
00:06:56,757 --> 00:07:01,977
Do they want us to find the brooch
since they hid it here somewhere?

95
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,067
What's this?

96
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:09,357
"Next go to Sutero Art Museum?"

I'm sorry for making you travel
from one end of Tokyo to the other.

103
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,247
It's fine.

104
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,867
You don't need to apologize.

105
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:39,007
That was close.

106
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,697
Maybe a crow knocked it over.

107
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,517
Well, it happens.

108
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,807
Shall we go?

109
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:47,307
All right.

110
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,727
I found an envelope.

111
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:55,817

00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:16,467
This place is a famous date destination!

120
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,727
It's midday on a weekday!
What are these people doing?

121
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:21,967
Don't they have jobs? Right?

122
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,557
Uh, well...

123
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,187
What's going on? Is it the culprit?

124
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:32,857
You're the great detective
Mori Kogoro, aren't you?

125
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,277
Could you take a picture with us?

126
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,777
No!

127
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:42,077
Actually, we...

128
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:46,657
We have to look after our cows,
so we couldn't go on a honeymoon.

129
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:51,577
But we finally made time to
come to Tokyo for two days.

130
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:53,777
But the cows are waiting for us,

131
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:57,377
so we have to fly home by tonight.

132
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,507
One photo, please.

133
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:02,677
What?

134
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:04,617
Now smile!

135
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:09,937
Thank you!

136
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:11,307
We're overjoyed!

137
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:14,287
We'll never forget this day!

138
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,317
Thank you so much!

139
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,447
Good luck with your marriage!

140
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:21,237
Wait!

141
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:21,697
Yes?

142
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:24,197
This is no time to be doing this!

143
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:29,337
Shall we search around that monument?

144
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:34,027
Ouch...

145
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:34,837

you're heading straight home.

Huh? Oh, go ahead.

163
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:28,727
So, what do you think of this case?

164
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:29,807
Huh?

165
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:36,937
Have you figured out what the places
you've been visiting have in common?

166
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,157
I have no idea!

167

This is my first time...

168
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,067
No.

00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:08,307
who managed an art book publishing
company with his friend.
Nagakura Ryoji (31)
Publishing Company Manager

181
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:08,927
who managed an art book publishing
company with his friend.

182
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:15,017
I brought him to the roof of the publishing
company and confronted him with my deduction.

183
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:20,257
He accepted everything I said
without objection, but...

184
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,737
He's a cancer on society.

185
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:30,897
I don't regret killing him based on my beliefs.

186
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:36,247
Though I doubt the courts
or society would understand.

187
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,957
After being arrested,

188
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:42,757
Nagakura took his own life in
prison before his trial began.

189
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:46,567

Nagakura took his own life in
prison before his trial began.

Defendant Takes His Own Life in Prison

191
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,747
You solved that case?

192
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:57,017
Yeah! I'm telling you, I'm a great detective.

193
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:03,547
It's possible he decided to commit suicide
when I revealed the truth on that rooftop.

194
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:07,457
It happened on the roof of the
building across from Kuroochi Park.

195
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:12,127
Well, it's ancient history.

196
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:15,407
Someone is definitely trying to kill Kanae-san.

197
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:17,417
Actually, those were...

198
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:20,917
I can't believe a family
of cats ran into the road.

199
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,917
I dropped it from the third
floor, but it's not broken.

200
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:27,267
I knew it was too dangerous to practice here.

201
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:30,307
...just plain old accidents.

202
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:31,727
Mori Detective Agency

203
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:32,967
Let me handle the case.
Mori Detective Agency

204
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,807
Let me handle the case.

205
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:38,117
Go do your homework or something.

206
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,187
Tell Ran I'll be home late.

207
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:42,687
Okay.

208
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:58,497
There must be some meaning behind the
locations specified by the culprit.

209
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,117
That must be it.

210
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:02,917
What's going on?

211
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,217
Did something happen?

212
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:12,517
Oh, yeah. I was wondering what that meant.

213
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,427
Aren't they an offering of some kind?

214
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:18,047
But there's never been an accident here.

215
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,177
I haven't heard of anyone dying either.

216
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:25,787
They started at the park,

217
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:31,447
then visited the concert hall, the art
museum, the seaside park, the church, and...

218
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:34,547
Could it be?

219
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,714
I've given the case some thought.

220
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:53,164
Why is the culprit leading us around?

221
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:57,394
It's possible they want
us to notice something.

222
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:04,194
Kuroochi Park, Dadagaya Concert Hall,
Sutero Art Museum, Hadoson Seaside Park,

223
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:07,404
and our next destination, Hebunzaka Church.

224
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:11,414
Each location has a special meaning
or memory associated with it,

225
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,704
and they want you to notice that.

226
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:18,414
I have a feeling the culprit is
desperately asking you to do that.

227
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:23,514
Any ideas what that might be, Kanae-san?

228
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,504
What do you think, Mori-san?

229
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:27,424
Me?

230
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:31,544
I just happened to be hired.
There's no way for me to know.

231
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:33,764
Even though you're the
country's greatest detective?

232
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,434
I'm sorry, but I can't
know what I don't know.

233
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,634
I'm at a total loss.

You work here, right?

00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:53,164
I'm the detective Mori Kogoro's assistant.

240
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,454
You work for Mori-san?

241
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:59,754
He told me to ask you
about Nagakura Ryoji-san,

242
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:02,204
who passed away two years ago.

243
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:03,644
Hebunzaka Church

244
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:04,654
I found it.
Hebunzaka Church

245
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,214
Hebunzaka Church

246
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:08,264
Where are we being taken next?

247
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:08,514

Where are we being taken next?

00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:08,954

Where are we being taken next?

Omagari Intersection
One Road

250
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,384
Is it a map?

251
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:17,534
12, 1, 29. What do those numbers mean?

252
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,644
Could it be an address?

253
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:24,064
In any case, let's use these
clues to determine the location.

254
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:30,554
Omagari Intersection is way
on the outskirts of Tokyo.

255
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,734
And if it's between there and
Shiraito Intersection, then...

256
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,274
Shiraito Intersection
And if it's between there and
Shiraito Intersection, then...

257
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:34,574
Shiraito Intersection

258
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:40,584
So that's how it is! When
you think of it that way...

259
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,944
Mori-san. Mori-san!

260
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,774
"Come and get it in the underworld."

261
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:49,844
It seems our next destination
is the finish line.

262
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:52,344
Okagaoka Cemetery
It seems our next destination
is the finish line.

263
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,914
Isn't that...?

264
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,084
Yes, it's a graveyard.

265
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:03,354
Does the culprit plan to lure me there and...?

266
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,354
Let's head there.

267
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,864
Really?

268
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:13,364
That person left these flowers
here this morning and said that?
Bibibi Publishing

269
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:15,594
That person left these flowers
here this morning and said that?

270
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:16,894
That's right.

271
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,154
Hey, wait!

272
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,124
That was definitely them.

273
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:26,374
Incoming call
Conan

274
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,634
He hung up!

275
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,544
What should I do?

276
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,644
Underworld

277
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:43,514
I have one more question!

278
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:45,774
Where is Nagakura-san's grave?

279
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:49,144
Okagaoka Cemetery

280
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:55,484
Zone 12
Area 1
Section 9

281
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:03,144
You wanted to bring me here.

282
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:09,924
When I learned our next destination was
Okagaoka Cemetery, I finally noticed.

283
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:15,134
It wasn't you who was being
dragged around, but me.

284
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:16,464
I'd been here to visit this grave before.

285
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:19,794
Nagakura Ryoji
I'd been here to visit this grave before.

286
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:20,134
Nagakura Ryoji

287
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,824
You figured it out, old man?

288
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,144
Then I don't need to make an appearance.

289
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:32,154
You lied about your treasured brooch
being stolen so you could bring me here.

290
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,404
I didn't know about you,

291
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:39,404
but judging by that ring
you have in your bag,

292
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:44,414
you were probably engaged
to Nagakura Ryoji-san.

293
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:49,414
You brought me to places full of
memories, and finally, at his grave...

294
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:50,914
Aren't you going to sleep?

295
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:53,424
What?

296
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:57,334
Don't you always sleep when you
arrogantly lay out your reasoning?

297
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:59,344
Oh, actually, that's...

298
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:01,974
If you can't sleep...

299
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:06,224
Then I'll put you to sleep!

300
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:08,314
You're wrong!

301
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,754
You may not know,

302
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:15,974
but I wasn't asleep when
I solved that case then.

303
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:20,264
Since the day Nagakura ended his life,

304
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:24,244
you swore you'd have your revenge on me.

305
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:25,924
Of course!

306
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:28,944
If you hadn't arrogantly revealed the truth,

307
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:31,544
then he wouldn't have been arrested!

308
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:41,594
Uh, oh...

309
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:44,264
So you're sleeping after all.

310
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:49,184
I thought it would only be proper to assume
this pose while explaining my reasoning.

311
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:53,894
People who knew him well said the following:

312
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:58,944
"Nagakura-san was a quiet man
who loved music and art."

313
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:05,114
Did the two of you meet
at Dadagaya Concert Hall?

314
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:10,704
And the first place you went
together was Sutero Art Museum.

315
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:16,344
You nurtured your love at beautiful
Hadoson Seaside Park,

316
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:22,664
and planned to get married
at Hebunzaka Church.

317
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:29,474
But Nagakura-san's death turned
it into an impossible dream.

318
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,364
That's right.

319
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:36,614
You ruined our history and future.

320
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,944
After showing you that, I...

321
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:42,364
Nagakura Ryoji

322
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:47,494
Here, in his presence, I planned
to send you to hell!
Nagakura Ryoji

323
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:49,744
And you...

324
00:19:55,984 --> 00:20:01,254
It all ended when he
cornered you on that roof.

325
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:05,424
I'll be there soon.

326
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:09,264
...planned to follow Nagakura-san here.

327
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:12,514
It's the decision I made when he died.

328
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,024
But you did nothing for two years.

329
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:18,224
This isn't what Nagakura-san wants.

330
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,214
You're wrong.

331
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,044
You know that, too.

332
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:25,034
You're wrong! It's because my
mother was alive until last week!

333
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,314
If I did that, my mother
would have been sad—

334
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:30,414
Regardless of who it saddens,
people who will act, will act!

335
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,614
Put that knife away.

336
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:36,524
You've waited until today because you
knew Nagakura-san wouldn't want—

337
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:37,414
You're wrong!

338
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:38,004
Shit!

339
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:53,354
But I can't do it...

340
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,064
I saw you.

341
00:20:56,724 --> 00:21:01,284
I saw the unhateable face of the man I hated.

342
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,574
Your perfect kindness.

343
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,574
The way you acknowledged
your own powerlessness.

344
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:11,074
And you protected me numerous times.

345
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:14,374
After seeing that side of you,

346
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:18,594
I can't kill you anymore.

347
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:21,684
Not anyone.

348
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,264
Kanae-san! Don't be hasty!

349
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:04,804
Huh?

350
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:08,364
Sh-She's not here. Kanae-san!

351
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:10,664
Ow! My head...

352
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,924
The lady left.

353
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,624
What?! You followed me again?

354
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:20,564
More importantly, she planned to
kill me and then kill herself!

355
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,434
Seems like everything worked out fine.

356
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,374
What?

357
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:30,384
She asked me to thank you for her.

358
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,564
Really?

359
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:34,744
You prevented a crime before it happened.

360
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:36,554
That's amazing, mister.

361
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:37,864
You're right.

362
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:40,104
You really are the country's
greatest detective!

363
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:41,394
You're right!

364
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:42,504
You see that?

365
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:48,244
I protected a young woman and
made her turn over a new leaf!

366
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:52,354
Well, that's not entirely incorrect.
