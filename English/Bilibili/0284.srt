1
00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:02,424
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:04,124
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,724
Today, it's Chinatown in Yokohama.

4
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,924
The surprise figure linked to Ran.

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:13,624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,911
Who presented Emperor Daigo

9
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,711
the Twelve-Article Recommendations?

10
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:09,711
Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki.

11
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,811
What is the name of the Jodo painting

12
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:14,811
depicting the descension of Buddha on earth?

13
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:17,911
The "Shouju-raikou-zu".

14
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,811
Hey. Get done with it.

15
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,511
I can feel my brain beginning to hemorrhage.

16
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:24,211
I can't help it.

17
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,911
I have a Japanese history test tomorrow.

18
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,611
I didn't have time to study

19
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,611
with all the extracurricular activities I have.

20
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,411
Then, why not do it at home?

21
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:33,711
Did I hear you say something?

22
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:35,711
You're telling me to stay home when I was the one

23
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:39,211
who won the meal coupon for dinner in Chinatown in the lottery?

24
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,611
That's why, I'm telling you to do it when you get back home.

25
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,011
That's not enough time.

26
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:48,411
There're a lot of TV programs I want to watch tonight.

27
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:51,911
But, reading inside a car can make you sick.

28
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,911
Worry not. I have superb sense of balance,

29
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:55,711
thanks to my vestibular system.

30
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,911
It's started to rain.

31
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:09,511
Yep. It's starting to rain pretty hard.

32
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:11,411
Rain.

33
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:14,711
Yes... he...

34
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:19,611
He was standing in the rain.

35
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,511
But I can't tell where it was.

36
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,911
A backstreet in a strange city.

37
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,511
But why?

38
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,111
Every time I try to recall that man...

39
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,011
His image comes back in my mind.

40
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:43,411
Yes. Standing in the rain just like this.

41
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:46,411
That lonely but gentle face.

42
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,511
Shinichi's face.

43
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,911
Why are you wet?

44
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,111
Why that lonely look?

45
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,711
Tell me, Shinichi.

46
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,511
Ran...

47
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:05,011
What happened, Ran?

48
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,011
You looked scary with wrinkles between your brows.

49
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,911
Oh. I couldn't remember the answer to a question in this book.

50
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,311
Well...

51
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,111
Insei rule, Fujiwara no Kiyohara...

52
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,811
Oh, no. I think I'm getting carsick.

53
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:34,111
"Chinatown Dejavu In The Rain (Part 1)"

54
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,611
What are we to do?

55
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,611
The shoot is about to begin,

56
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:50,211
and the female lead suffers bone fracture in a motorbike accident.

57
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:53,511
Well, it probably means this movie project must be scrapped.

58
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:56,011
It seems to me that it's cursed.

59
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:57,011
Hey, hey.

60
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,511
Are you going to throw away this moneymaker?

61
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:03,011
We're attracting attention for this sequel to a hit movie.

62
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,311
But, Mr. Kawabata.

63
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:08,611
The girl we finally managed to find to play the role got hurt.

64
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,811
"Motohiro Ito (38)" -There's no one else.

65
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,311
"Assistant director" -This is an omen.

66
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,211
You might be right. If we continue,

67
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:19,011
"Keigo Kitaura (29)" -we might end up the same

68
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,911
"Writer" -with a major accident.

69
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,711
Anyway, as the author of the book,

70
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,311
that girl wasn't exactly my image of the character.

71
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,011
It turned out lucky for me.

72
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,711
Mr. Kitaura.

73
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:36,411
Shoot. I wonder where I can find

74
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:40,111
a girl who's young and pretty and can handle stunts.

75
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:42,911
What do you mean?

76
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,911
We can't use the coupon?

77
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,411
So, I'm telling you...

78
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:50,911
Look here. The name of your restaurant.

79
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:53,411
Yes, that's us.

80
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,711
We issued the coupon.

81
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:56,711
But...

82
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,611
Then, why can't we use it?

83
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,111
I demand an explanation and a clear one.

84
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,911
-So, that's why... -Hey, kiddo.

85
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:09,111
What's your sister's name?

86
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:14,511
Who in the world are you?

87
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:18,411
Who am I?

88
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,611
I'll tell you, kiddo. My name is...

89
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,511
What kind of joint is this?

90
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:25,111
Don't tell me you pick your customers?

91
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,911
No. Of course not.

92
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:30,111
If you want to pick up a fight...

93
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,911
Excuse me, mister.

94
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,611
Let's talk outside.

95
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:43,811
You're not forcing us out of here.

96
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:46,911
We're not moving unless you give us a good reason.

97
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,311
Your sister's got brawn, too.

98
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:56,711
We're trying to tell you that it is written in the coupon

99
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,911
that it cannot be used on Sundays and holidays.

100
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,111
What?

101
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,011
Oh, yes. It's written in the fine print.

102
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,311
What?

103
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:09,011
"This coupon is not applicable during Sundays and holidays"

104
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,811
Oh...

105
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,111
Oh, no. I sincerely apologize.

106
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,111
I'm so sorry.

107
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,511
Oh, no, we're happy that you understand the provisions.

108
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:21,711
Geez, why didn't you check in the first place?

109
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,611
What about you? You're the one who rushed out first,

110
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,111
saying that early bird catches the worm?

111
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,611
Who says?

112
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:31,611
Well, young lady, that was a good kick.

113
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:35,611
How about you and me going to see a Bruce Lee movie?

114
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:37,811
Who's talking?

115
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,111
Me?

116
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,811
Hello.

117
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,611
Mike Hama?

118
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:49,511
I've heard that before.

119
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,411
So, that's Mike Hama.

120
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:56,611
I've got an office on the 2nd floor of Yokohama Nichigeki in Kogane-cho.

121
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,911
Yes, I remember.

122
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,511
That second-rate private eye who has an office

123
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,111
on the second floor of a movie theater.

124
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,211
Well, that's that.

125
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:10,511
Well, lady,

126
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:15,111
call me when you feel like going out with me.

127
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,611
See you later, kiddo.

128
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,411
What was that?

129
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,911
Don't know.

130
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,411
Sir.

131
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:29,211
Your dinner, sir. What would you like to do?

132
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,611
Well... actually...

133
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,011
Excuse me.

134
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:37,211
If you don't mind, how about dinner with us?

135
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,011
Of course, it's on us.

136
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,311
Thanks, but...

137
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:46,911
"Restaurant Conan Doyle"

138
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,911
What? A leading role in a movie?

139
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:53,911
You're exactly what we want.

140
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,711
Of course, if you're interested.

141
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,811
-Well... -Don't even think about it.

142
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:02,111
You'll only embarrass yourself, blowing your lines.

143
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:08,711
Unless you have the skills of elocution and persuasion I have.

144
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:12,111
The skills are not yours but mine.

145
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:13,411
Well...

146
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,111
But, young lady,

147
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:16,611
if you become popular with the movie,

148
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:19,111
you're going to join the stars.

149
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,911
You'll get to be friends with a lot of show biz celebrities.

150
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,511
-What? -Not only the celebrities.

151
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:28,311
There will be pro baseball players, pro soccer players, race drivers.

152
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:32,911
There may be shoots in America or Britain or France.

153
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:36,011
You can get to foreign countries around the world.

154
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,311
Why don't you try it?

155
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,911
Go for it. Take on challenges.

156
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,011
Really?

157
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:45,211
But you should be resolved to take anything

158
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,911
if you intend to take the plunge.

159
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:50,311
Yeah, considering a movie producer

160
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,911
who likes add a kissing scene

161
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:55,311
that is irrelevant to the plot of the book.

162
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,311
Kissing?

163
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:01,611
Mr. Kitaura, you don't mean me...

164
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,811
I changed my mind. Don't.

165
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,511
Don't. I didn't know that.

166
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,611
Me neither.

167
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:12,911
Forget it if you're intimidated by kissing.

168
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:17,611
You might even die during the shoot if you're unlucky.

169
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:20,211
Hey. Stop scaring her.

170
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,011
She's a gold mine.

171
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:24,911
I am not.

172
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:27,211
-Ouch. -I'm sorry.

173
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,611
Are you all right?

174
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:30,011
Never mind.

175
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:32,311
I'll wipe it off with this towel.

176
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,411
Waiter, can you get me a new pair of chopsticks?

177
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:40,211
Yes, sir. Coming up.

178
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:43,211
Huh?

179
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,911
You definitely have a fever. Are you okay?

180
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:53,211
I'm okay. Just a nose cold.

181
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:55,811
But, if you should faint like before...

182
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:58,911
-Before? -Nothing.

183
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:02,411
Come and sit here away from your pig-headed father.

184
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,911
Let's talk.

185
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,511
Tell me what you want.

186
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,511
I'll serve some up on a plate for you.

187
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:12,911
Oh, thanks.

188
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,211
Here you are.

189
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,011
Thanks.

190
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:21,511
Hey! I said no "pitans" and egg dishes!

191
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,511
What's wrong?

192
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:26,211
I'm allergic to eggs.

193
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:29,011
I hate even the sight of them.

194
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:37,011
Anyway, young lady, eat all you want.

195
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,811
Thank you. Well...

196
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,911
I want curry with rice.

197
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:46,111
Hey, kid, this is a Chinese restaurant.

198
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,111
They don't serve curry here.

199
00:11:48,111 --> 00:11:50,211
What? I want curry.

200
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,911
Curry. Curry. Curry.

201
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:55,411
No curry? This place stinks.

202
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,011
Let's go home.

203
00:11:57,811 --> 00:12:01,711
Please, we'd better go home, Ran.

204
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:04,711
You're being so pesky.

205
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:05,611
Okay.

206
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,911
How about this meat dumplings?

207
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:11,711
You liked it when you had it the last time, remember?

208
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,611
Oh, yeah.

209
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:16,911
Boy, are you good at picking up my message?

210
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:20,011
Well, where's the soy sauce?

211
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:22,511
There. In front of the old man.

212
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,611
There.

213
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:30,811
Darn it, it's back in front of Kogoro.

214
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,511
I'll get it this time.

215
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:35,311
Again...

216
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,511
What is it, Conan? What do you want?

217
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:40,411
Well, some soy sauce.

218
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:44,211
-Here. -Thanks.

219
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:47,911
Next, the chili oil is in front of that fox-eyed guy.

220
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,111
Here it comes.

221
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:52,511
What? Darn.

222
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,011
Here, chili oil, right?

223
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,411
Yeah.

224
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:05,711
Now she's taking care of me.

225
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,911
Oh. Here it comes.

226
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:10,911
Peking Duck here is the best.

227
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:15,411
By the way, are there actresses who you like?

228
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,811
Yes. There are two.

229
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,811
One is Yukiko Fujimine.

230
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,811
Actually, she is the mother of a friend since kindergarten.

231
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,711
I've idolized her since I was a child.

232
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,111
Who is the other one?

233
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:29,911
The other is an American actress.

234
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:32,011
Sharon Vinyard.

235
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,511
Though she died a year ago.

236
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,811
Oh. That great actress.

237
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,311
I had the opportunity to meet her once.

238
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:41,311
She was wonderful.

239
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:44,611
When did that happen? Meeting an American celebrity.

240
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,811
When you weren't around.

241
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:50,011
Yukiko Fujimine and Sharon Vinyard

242
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:51,711
more substance than glitz seems to be your taste.

243
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:55,011
They both have gained legendary status.

244
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:58,211
If she still alive,

245
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:02,211
she could have been a legend, too.

246
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,111
Huh?

247
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,211
Who's she?

248
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,916
The victim is Mr. Shiro Kawabata, age 46,

249
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,116
film producer.

250
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:36,016
Death by asphyxiation triggered by cyanide poisoning.

251
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:39,816
Gosh, cyanide, arsenic, caustic soda.

252
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:44,916
Where do criminals these days get these toxins?

253
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,916
And, did he eat something before he died?

254
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,816
Yes, Peking Duck.

255
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:53,816
According to the waiter who served him,

256
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:57,116
he started to suffer right after he put it in his mouth.

257
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:01,516
Peking Duck for his last dinner.

258
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:02,816
What a way to go.

259
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:08,216
But, poison was not found in that piece of duck meat,

260
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:11,716
and the waiter did not have it in his possession.

261
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:15,216
The victim probably had cyanide on his hand

262
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:18,916
before he bit into the food.

263
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,116
I see.

264
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:24,116
That means that the murderer

265
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:29,416
was sitting among you here at the table?

266
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:32,416
Anyway, I would like to ask all of you

267
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,416
your relationship with the victim.

268
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,916
Yes, member of the movie production staff.

269
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,516
The female lead in the movie

270
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:40,716
got hurt before the shooting started.

271
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:43,616
That's why we were discussing it.

272
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,416
Whether we should find a replacement

273
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,816
or scrap the project altogether.

274
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:51,116
Then, Mr. Kawabata took on a liking for that girl

275
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,016
and invited her and her father to our table.

276
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,416
You, with the beard.

277
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:00,616
I've seen you somewhere before.

278
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:04,216
Yes, of course. I am the...

279
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,016
Probably a criminal on the run.

280
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:08,016
Huh?

281
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:11,216
No, no.

282
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,216
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

283
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:14,916
Mo... Mouri?

284
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,216
Don't tell me...

285
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,616
That famous detective?

286
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:18,916
Yes, yes.

287
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,916
Oh, that two-bit detective called Smoking Kogoro.

288
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,316
Sleeping. Not Smoking.

289
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:28,016
Inspector. I found positive toxic reaction.

290
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:29,616
All right.

291
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,816
We didn't find it in the other dishes.

292
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,316
Cyanide has been found

293
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:38,516
on the chopsticks, plate and towel the victim used.

294
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:41,716
It was strongest on the towel.

295
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:47,116
Who sat beside him when he fell?

296
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:50,416
Me. I sat on his right.

297
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:52,116
Then, who was at his left?

298
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:53,216
Me.

299
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:58,516
I sat on his left eating my dumpling.

300
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,916
That makes things easy.

301
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,516
The person who poisoned the victim

302
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:07,216
by lacing his towel with cyanide is...

303
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:10,216
You, Mr. Detective.

304
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:11,516
What? Me?

305
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:14,516
A kid like him won't be able to commit murder,

306
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,116
and with you sitting on his right,

307
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:17,716
switching must have been easy.

308
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,216
If the victim was right-handed,

309
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:22,216
he most probably had his towel on his right.

310
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:26,316
You expected him to wipe his hands

311
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,216
before he ate his Peking Duck, right?

312
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,216
How's that?

313
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,216
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

314
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,916
Don't try to distract attention.

315
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,216
I have the same feeling.

316
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,316
You do, too?

317
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:44,316
I've only seen your face on TV and newspapers.

318
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,616
Inspector Yokomizo. Sir.

319
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,016
What is it?

320
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,016
Yokomizo?

321
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:54,616
Yes! You're Yokomizo! Yokomizo!

322
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,616
I suspect that you committed a blunder

323
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,216
and had to shave your head.

324
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,216
That's why you're so embarrassed

325
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:02,816
and are pretending not to know us.

326
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,216
Hey. Hey. You, the great pretender.

327
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:08,316
Well, to tell you the truth, that hair you had was quite unkempt.

328
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:11,116
You look much cleaner.

329
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:16,616
You are talking about my brother Sango with the Shizuoka Police.

330
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:20,116
I am Jugo Yokomizo of the Kanagawa Police.

331
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,216
A brother?

332
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,416
For real?

333
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,516
It appears that the naive and trusting brother of mine respected you,

334
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,416
but I'm different.

335
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,716
I don't have an inkling of respect for shady people like detectives.

336
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,316
Sir. Inspector.

337
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:35,816
Oh, kept you waiting.

338
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,816
Look what I found on the jeans the victim was wearing.

339
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,916
Some sort of the stain.

340
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,816
Beats me.

341
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,716
Oh, that's Mr. Kawabata's soup.

342
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,216
I spilled it when I sat next to him.

343
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,916
What? Next to him?

344
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,316
I thought that you and the kid were sitting next to him!

345
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,816
Mr. Kawabata changed seats just before he fainted.

346
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,516
He took a seat between Ran and me.

347
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:04,316
Later, Conan sat next to him.

348
00:19:04,316 --> 00:19:06,716
Then, before he changed seats,

349
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:09,416
he was sitting next to the girl...

350
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,316
And me.

351
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,816
But, I just happened to sit there because Mr. Kawabata

352
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:17,716
invited that detective and others to our table.

353
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:20,616
Incidentally, before Mr. Mouri arrived,

354
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:23,816
we sat beside Mr. Kawabata.

355
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:28,716
But then, we were seated quite apart from each other.

356
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:33,816
I was seated right at opposite of him, so I'm innocent.

357
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:36,016
We will know after we investigate.

358
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,916
Then, why not check his jeans?

359
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:43,516
Mr. Kawabata changed his seat after he got the soup on his lap.

360
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,716
He wasn't trying to wipe it off with the towel.

361
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:49,316
If you check the stain, you'll probably know

362
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,216
when the towel was tampered with, right?

363
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:54,716
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

364
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,716
Well, yeah.

365
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,916
What? There was no cyanide in the stain?

366
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,516
Did you check it thoroughly?

367
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:05,716
Yeah. The waiter said he replaced the chopsticks

368
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,816
that fell on the floor with the soup on the victim's order,

369
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,816
there was no cyanide on the chopsticks either.

370
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,216
That means,

371
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:17,616
the culprit replaced that towel with a poisoned one

372
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,916
after all these event,

373
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:25,516
which means the suspect is you, who sat on his right.

374
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:29,016
Nonsense.

375
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:31,016
Why would I have to kill Mr. Kawabata, when I have seen him

376
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:35,316
for the first time at a restaurant I came for the first time?

377
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:37,816
There's no telling.

378
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:39,316
Well, the story about your daughter been asked to

379
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,416
appear in the movie at a restaurant you came for the first time

380
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,016
sounds suspicious, too.

381
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,216
Hey, that's...

382
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:45,516
That's true.

383
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:49,116
We came here just by coincidence...

384
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,616
Huh?

385
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,116
Rain.

386
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,416
A rainy day again.

387
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,816
I saw him.

388
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:20,016
Who is he?

389
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:25,216
Or, is it somebody else who looks like the Inspector?

390
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,516
I can't remember.

391
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:31,016
That faint image of three faces.

392
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:34,716
A mouth smiling.

393
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:37,916
Angry eyes.

394
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,116
And...

395
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:42,416
What?

396
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,216
What are you saying?

397
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:51,816
I can't hear, Shinichi.

398
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:56,016
Ran.

399
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,416
What happened?

400
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,416
You look pale.

401
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:03,816
Oh, I'm okay. I just felt faint.

402
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:06,416
Why don't you sit down here?

403
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,216
I think Uncle will solve the case soon.

404
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:12,816
Yeah, thanks.

405
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:15,616
And, don't get in the way, Conan.

406
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,716
Yep.

407
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:23,116
We're in trouble.

408
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:26,116
Ran must be really sick.

409
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,816
We have to get her to the hospital soon.

410
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:06,516
I get it. You brought the towel to the restrooms

411
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:09,216
and laced it with cyanide.

412
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,116
How many times do I have to tell you? I didn't do it!

413
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,116
Don't want to see?

414
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,516
Did you find something else?

415
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,416
Well, none in particular.

416
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,216
Really?

417
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:27,216
Nothing on it.

418
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,116
Next Conan,

419
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:32,716
"Chinatown Dejavu In The Rain (Part 2)"

420
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,243
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:37,643
"Wet towel"

422
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,343
The private eye Mike Hama?

423
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:43,043
Frivolous old man Kogoro will be put to test.
