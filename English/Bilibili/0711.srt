1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.140
Triggered by the crime that occurred in Osaka,

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.240
Heiji Hattori, Kazuha Toyama

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.340
and Inspector Otaki of the Osaka Police Department

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.940
came to Tokyo to launch investigations.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.240
The crime site that we, all six of us

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.840
including Pops, Ran and I headed for

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.540
was a condo in Tokyo.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.140
However, the incident turned out to be a suicide case,

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.440
and was solved just like that.

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.540
While we were ready to leave the site

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.040
and waiting for the elevator...

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.540
Talk of the devil.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.840
-Wh... -What?

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.340
Although it looked be suicide at first glance,

15
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.540
due to the many unsettling points that emerged,

16
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.340
we decided to investigate it as homicide.

17
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.240
And through the questioning carried out

18
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.540
by Officer Takagi and the others,

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.040
the suspects were narrowed down to three people.

20
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.440
By the way, what do you do for a living?

21
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.340
I'm employed at a building maintenance company.

22
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.640
I handle intercoms and locker deliveries.

23
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.240
I also handle air conditioners.

24
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.440
Which means you also handle

25
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.840
elevator and security maintenance?

26
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.340
By the way, you.

27
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.640
What's your relationship with Mr. Fuura, the deceased?

28
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.740
Your name was in Mr. Fuura's cell phone, you see.

29
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.240
Oh, well, I talked to him a bit about stocks.

30
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.440
Which means that you lost out on stocks because of Mr. Fuura,

31
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.040
and hated him too?

32
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.440
It's true that I had a grudge against him,

33
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.240
but I wouldn't kill him because of it.

34
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.640
Oh. It's true that I lost out too,

35
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.840
because of the stocks Mr. Fuura recommended me to buy.

36
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.740
But, I don't have any grudge against him!

37
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.740
Because it's my fault too

38
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
for not being able to read the direction of

39
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.540
where the stocks were headed for, you see.

40
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.540
This room smells of thinner.

41
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.840
That's because I was coloring

42
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.240
the freshly severed-like dolls' necks.

43
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.040
Freshly severed necks?

44
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.740
That one over there looks exactly like my Dad.

45
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.640
If so, I'm sure you can make it then, no?

46
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.740
A freshly made severed neck

47
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.040
that looks exactly like Mr. Fuura?

48
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.340
Well...

49
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.740
Ms. Izutsu, what do you do for a living?

50
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.840
Can't you tell by looking?

51
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.240
A tracing table, tone, cutter knife.

52
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.940
A G-pen, mapping pen, a brush,

53
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.140
calligraphy paint and ink.

54
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.440
I'm a cartoonist!

55
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.640
Haven't you ever heard of my pen name Kotori Misono?

56
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.540
Oh, you're the author

57
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.640
of the beautiful detective girl cartoon

58
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.740
that Chiba is hooked on.

59
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.840
Which means it wouldn't be hard for you

60
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.640
to come up with a story.

61
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.140
To make it look as if someone committed suicide

62
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.440
in the elevator by using a gun,

63
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140
and kill him.

64
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.240
If I came up with such an amusing story,

65
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.340
I would've drawn a comic about it already.

66
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.240
The culprit is probably that person

67
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.440
who was hiding that thing.

68
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.340
The question is the trick...

69
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.840
How did the culprit kill Mr. Fuura?

70
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.140
Aim for a 100% solution.

71
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.540
Clear all mysteries and codes.

72
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.340
Murder in an elevator.

73
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.440
Expose the shocking trick together with Hattori.

74
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.540
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:59.604
"Everyone was Watching (Part 2)"

78
00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:03.204
I tell you that Heiji!

79
00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:05.704
What's taking him so long?

80
00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:07.004
Come now.

81
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:08.404
You're going to be spending the night

82
00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:09.904
at our place already so...

83
00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:11.204
But...

84
00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:13.404
Oh, he's back.

85
00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:15.004
And, how was it?

86
00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:16.804
Did you figure out who the culprit was?

87
00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:20.804
No. We did talk to the three suspects though.

88
00:05:20.804 --> 00:05:23.804
They all seem suspicious and yet unsuspicious too.

89
00:05:23.804 --> 00:05:27.604
All three of them seem to have a motive, though.

90
00:05:27.604 --> 00:05:30.704
No, the culprit is probably that person.

91
00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:32.904
The question is the trick that was used.

92
00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:36.704
Oh, that's right. By the way, on the doors of the elevators,

93
00:05:36.704 --> 00:05:38.804
all except for the ones on the 2nd and 3rd floors,

94
00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:41.804
there seem to have been an "under inspection" sign!

95
00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:45.304
I see. That's how people were kept away.

96
00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:47.604
Well, if it was suicide

97
00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:49.204
you'd think that Mr. Fuura put it there

98
00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:51.304
to avoid being interrupted.

99
00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:52.504
Yes.

100
00:05:52.504 --> 00:05:57.004
Hey! If you can't figure it out, why don't you call Kudo?

101
00:05:57.004 --> 00:05:59.204
Huh?

102
00:05:59.204 --> 00:06:00.804
Shinichi?

103
00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:03.004
Yep! Even during that incident

104
00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:04.604
at the family restaurant the other time,

105
00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:06.304
the case was solved in no time at all

106
00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:08.404
after Conan merely placed a call to him, right?

107
00:06:08.404 --> 00:06:11.404
Idiot. He hasn't figured anything out yet either.

108
00:06:13.004 --> 00:06:16.304
Well, I guess that's one way to do it.

109
00:06:16.304 --> 00:06:18.904
You two are full-fledged only when you work together too so...

110
00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:22.404
Hey, hold it! Just who are you talking about?

111
00:06:23.504 --> 00:06:24.704
The two of us?

112
00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:26.504
Make us full-fledged?

113
00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:27.504
Wait a sec.

114
00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:29.204
If that is used...

115
00:06:30.104 --> 00:06:32.304
I get it! That's why.

116
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:36.104
Yeah. That word 'Goodbye'...

117
00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.904
That was not a message made to look like a mere will.

118
00:06:41.304 --> 00:06:42.704
It was written there deliberately

119
00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:44.604
because it needed to be written there!

120
00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.704
In order to join the tricks together.

121
00:06:50.504 --> 00:06:52.804
Huh? Really?

122
00:06:52.804 --> 00:06:54.704
Is it true that no discharge residue

123
00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:58.604
was detected from the three suspects?

124
00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:00.904
Yes, definitely.

125
00:07:00.904 --> 00:07:03.804
I got a report from forensics a while ago.

126
00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:05.504
I see.

127
00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:07.004
I'm sorry I'm late.

128
00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:08.904
I'm Megure from MPD.

129
00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:12.104
Oh. I'm Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

130
00:07:12.104 --> 00:07:14.504
I'm sorry for sticking my nose

131
00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:18.604
into a case that occurred outside our jurisdiction.

132
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.604
No, don't be. Officer Takagi told me that

133
00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:23.604
you helped out a lot with the questioning and all.

134
00:07:23.604 --> 00:07:27.404
But, is it true that this is a homicide?

135
00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:31.604
You saw Mr. Fuura shoot himself in the head with a gun

136
00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:35.904
through the window of this elevator, didn't you?

137
00:07:35.904 --> 00:07:37.204
Speak of the devil!

138
00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:41.904
Yes.

139
00:07:42.804 --> 00:07:45.104
If so, isn't it suicide?

140
00:07:45.104 --> 00:07:48.004
I thought so too at first but...

141
00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:50.404
The surveillance camera in the elevator

142
00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:54.504
was blotted out with spray paint with the left hand.

143
00:07:54.504 --> 00:07:57.704
The wristwatch that the corpse was wearing was stopped

144
00:07:57.704 --> 00:07:58.704
and so forth,

145
00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:00.704
there were many ambiguous points to consider.

146
00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:03.404
It seemed quite strange to me too,

147
00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:07.604
but you witnessed Mr. Fuura commit suicide.

148
00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:11.204
Inspector.

149
00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:13.504
Let me answer your question.

150
00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:18.104
The culprit held the gun against Mr. Fuura's head

151
00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:19.904
and remarked like so...

152
00:08:19.904 --> 00:08:21.104
'If you don't want to get shot,

153
00:08:21.104 --> 00:08:24.204
look out through the window of the elevator.'

154
00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:27.104
And when the elevator passed through this floor,

155
00:08:27.104 --> 00:08:28.604
the gun was fired.

156
00:08:30.704 --> 00:08:33.404
That's why when we saw that,

157
00:08:33.404 --> 00:08:36.004
we all thought it was suicide.

158
00:08:36.004 --> 00:08:37.704
I guess that's the truth.

159
00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:40.304
That's impossible, no?

160
00:08:42.204 --> 00:08:44.604
You'd all be aware no matter what

161
00:08:44.604 --> 00:08:47.304
if the culprit's hand comes out from the side.

162
00:08:47.304 --> 00:08:50.204
The position of the culprit's hand that is holding the gun

163
00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:51.904
and the position of Mr. Fuura's body that was shot

164
00:08:51.904 --> 00:08:53.504
wouldn't match.

165
00:08:53.504 --> 00:08:57.004
True. I wouldn't do it if I were the culprit.

166
00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.204
Such a special effect would be so obvious.

167
00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:03.704
Besides, if so, Mr. Fuura would've put up more of a fight.

168
00:09:03.704 --> 00:09:06.504
It's hard to think he would stay still enough

169
00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.504
to make it look like a suicide.

170
00:09:08.504 --> 00:09:11.104
Are these three people...

171
00:09:11.104 --> 00:09:14.104
Yes. They are the three residents of this condo

172
00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:15.704
who had no alibi.

173
00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:18.204
But why are you here?

174
00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:20.704
I didn't want to come but...

175
00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:22.204
We were told to come here.

176
00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:23.504
We were told that if we came here

177
00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:25.904
we'd find out the truth to the case,

178
00:09:25.904 --> 00:09:27.504
by this boy here.

179
00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:31.104
Yes, I brought the three here!

180
00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:35.104
Because Officer Takagi and Heiji told me to do so!

181
00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:36.304
Conan?

182
00:09:38.704 --> 00:09:41.804
Hey, Conan. Where's Heiji?

183
00:09:41.804 --> 00:09:44.304
I haven't seen him for about an hour.

184
00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:47.704
He said he was going somewhere with Officer Takagi.

185
00:09:47.704 --> 00:09:49.504
Something about he had something to do

186
00:09:49.504 --> 00:09:51.704
at the store in back of this condo.

187
00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:53.004
The store in the back?

188
00:09:53.004 --> 00:09:54.704
What store in the back?

189
00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:56.404
If I remember correctly...

190
00:09:56.404 --> 00:09:57.904
I see! The back!

191
00:09:57.904 --> 00:10:00.004
The culprit used this method of "Helping Hands".

192
00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:03.104
That is, the culprit hid behind Mr. Fuura and shot him!

193
00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:04.104
It would look more natural

194
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.204
than to shoot him from the side, wouldn't it?

195
00:10:07.204 --> 00:10:11.504
If so, when fired at, wouldn't Mr. Fuura's head move

196
00:10:11.504 --> 00:10:14.504
exposing the face of the culprit behind him?

197
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:20.204
True.

198
00:10:20.204 --> 00:10:22.104
Oh! It's Officer Takagi!

199
00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:24.304
Bang!

200
00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:32.604
Hey, what are you doing, Takagi?

201
00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:44.096
Oh, it's Officer Takagi!

202
00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:45.996
Bang!

203
00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:52.896
Hey, what are you doing?

204
00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:55.096
But what we saw...

205
00:10:55.096 --> 00:10:57.096
It was just like that!

206
00:10:57.096 --> 00:10:59.796
So, two people were playing one person after all then!

207
00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:01.896
Takagi and the detective boy from Osaka

208
00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:03.896
tried acting it out!

209
00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.896
To show us that if you do it right, it would look natural!

210
00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:08.096
That Takagi...

211
00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:12.596
Hurry down here and explain, Takagi!

212
00:11:12.596 --> 00:11:13.896
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:17.696
Officer Takagi?

214
00:11:17.696 --> 00:11:19.196
Oh, well you see...

215
00:11:20.496 --> 00:11:23.096
Takagi! Just what was that about?

216
00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:25.996
I just... I was just told to stay here

217
00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:30.396
and watch how everyone reacted by Hattori, you see.

218
00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:31.996
Watch?

219
00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:35.196
And, since when were you there?

220
00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:37.996
Just a little before the elevator came.

221
00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:39.396
No way!

222
00:11:39.396 --> 00:11:41.896
You were in the elevator a while ago, weren't you?

223
00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.096
That was...

224
00:11:45.096 --> 00:11:47.796
Officer Takagi's in the elevator again.

225
00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:57.896
In other words, this is the truth of the trick!

226
00:11:57.896 --> 00:12:00.296
A tablet?

227
00:12:00.296 --> 00:12:03.796
Yeah. I had Officer Takagi borrow it for me

228
00:12:03.796 --> 00:12:06.596
from the electric shop behind the condo!

229
00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:10.396
The movie of the face of Officer Takagi

230
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.096
that I read into this tablet a while ago.

231
00:12:13.096 --> 00:12:15.096
I played it again on the tablet by pushing it

232
00:12:15.096 --> 00:12:17.496
against the window of the elevator.

233
00:12:17.496 --> 00:12:18.496
Bang!

234
00:12:19.596 --> 00:12:21.196
Since the window of the elevator

235
00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:23.596
is partitioned with the word 'Goodbye',

236
00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:26.096
if the tablet is used, the trick won't be exposed.

237
00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:29.796
In fact, even though it was all my body apart from the head,

238
00:12:29.796 --> 00:12:33.296
it really looked as if Officer Takagi was on the elevator, right?

239
00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:35.896
In other words, the tablet and my body

240
00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:38.796
both worked to make up just one of me!

241
00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:44.896
But, Heiji. Isn't that a bit too far-fetched?

242
00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:48.896
All you did was pretend to fire, Heiji.

243
00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:53.796
We saw him shoot himself in the head, you know?

244
00:12:53.796 --> 00:12:55.296
If it were as you say,

245
00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:57.296
he had to hold the tablet in his hand

246
00:12:57.296 --> 00:13:00.096
and fire right in front of his eyes

247
00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:02.896
it would've been very dangerous.

248
00:13:02.896 --> 00:13:04.996
And, you can't even be sure

249
00:13:04.996 --> 00:13:08.396
if that movement will match the tablet's either.

250
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:11.096
Besides there should be another trace

251
00:13:11.096 --> 00:13:15.296
of the remains of a bullet in the elevator too.

252
00:13:15.296 --> 00:13:16.496
Wrong, wrong!

253
00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:20.296
I didn't have time just now so I used only one tablet!

254
00:13:20.296 --> 00:13:23.396
I think the culprit used four tablets!

255
00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:25.996
Using four tablets, you can stream a movie

256
00:13:25.996 --> 00:13:27.696
with timing that matches perfectly!

257
00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:29.496
Four?

258
00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:31.196
Then, are you saying that what we saw

259
00:13:31.196 --> 00:13:33.496
were all movie images?

260
00:13:33.496 --> 00:13:35.796
Right. All except for the face,

261
00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:37.996
it was a movie taken by the culprit who was wearing

262
00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:39.896
the same type of suit that Mr. Fuura was wearing.

263
00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:44.996
But can you hold four tablets with one hand?

264
00:13:44.996 --> 00:13:46.696
I wonder.

265
00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:48.096
The culprit probably stuck four

266
00:13:48.096 --> 00:13:50.096
onto one large board or something.

267
00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:53.496
If so, all that needed to be done was to place it against the door.

268
00:13:54.496 --> 00:13:56.596
Isn't that how it was done?

269
00:13:56.596 --> 00:14:00.196
You hid the fact that you had four tablets.

270
00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:02.596
Cartoonist, Ms. Naoko Izutsu.

271
00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:12.296
You're the one, aren't you? The culprit?

272
00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:14.396
Hey, wait a minute there!

273
00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.496
As for the trick you just mentioned,

274
00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:18.696
anyone could've done it using four tablets.

275
00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:20.996
So, why do I end up being the one who did it?

276
00:14:20.996 --> 00:14:23.896
It's because you're hiding the tablets!

277
00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:26.596
The machine you had on the side of the tracing table

278
00:14:26.596 --> 00:14:28.396
on top of your work area.

279
00:14:28.396 --> 00:14:30.396
That's a mobile router, isn't it?

280
00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:33.196
I'm saying it's strange that you had no computer or tablet

281
00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:36.096
connected to the internet despite having the router!

282
00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:38.596
How should I know?

283
00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:42.196
Maybe the editor in charge forgot it there.

284
00:14:42.196 --> 00:14:43.696
I'm an analog person

285
00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:45.496
and don't use computers and such.

286
00:14:45.496 --> 00:14:49.496
Oh, cartoonists are super, aren't they?

287
00:14:49.496 --> 00:14:52.696
Because you're drawing detective cartoons, aren't you Miss?

288
00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:54.696
Despite that there were only

289
00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:56.596
a few comic books on your bookshelf!

290
00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:58.596
To be able to draw and write all kinds of things

291
00:14:58.596 --> 00:14:59.996
without having to look at anything.

292
00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:02.296
I think that's really super!

293
00:15:04.296 --> 00:15:08.896
True, that unlike fairy tales and fantasy novels,

294
00:15:08.896 --> 00:15:10.796
detective comics would require

295
00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:12.396
a realistic description to some extent.

296
00:15:12.396 --> 00:15:13.996
As for the background of the crime site

297
00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.896
or the murder weapon and such.

298
00:15:15.896 --> 00:15:19.196
It's quite impossible to do all that without reference.

299
00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:21.096
If I remember correctly, I think Ms. Izutsu

300
00:15:21.096 --> 00:15:24.596
mentioned having three assistants.

301
00:15:24.596 --> 00:15:27.396
So, three assistants and herself,

302
00:15:27.396 --> 00:15:29.796
would add up to four tablets, eh?

303
00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:35.496
But, how did she make up the image of Mr. Fuura being shot?

304
00:15:35.496 --> 00:15:36.996
She couldn't possibly have told him

305
00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:39.996
to act like he was being shot with a gun, could she?

306
00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:42.096
That's easy!

307
00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:44.496
When she was taking the movie like this,

308
00:15:44.496 --> 00:15:47.296
all she had to do was move the camera a bit.

309
00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:50.396
See! You get an image like he was shot!

310
00:15:50.396 --> 00:15:53.596
Bullets aren't visible either way, besides!

311
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.196
The problem is that the things in the background

312
00:15:56.196 --> 00:15:58.696
also get blurred.

313
00:15:58.696 --> 00:16:03.196
But, it's hard to tell because there's nothing in the elevator.

314
00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:04.496
True.

315
00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.596
Wow, Conan.

316
00:16:06.596 --> 00:16:10.396
Well, Heiji told me all this, you see.

317
00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:13.496
Right, Heiji?

318
00:16:13.496 --> 00:16:15.196
Yeah.

319
00:16:16.096 --> 00:16:19.596
I feel like I've become the Sleeping Kogoro, or something.

320
00:16:19.596 --> 00:16:20.896
But...

321
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.196
If we weren't coincidentally

322
00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:23.696
in front of the elevator back then,

323
00:16:23.696 --> 00:16:25.296
this trick wouldn't work.

324
00:16:25.296 --> 00:16:26.696
It's not us! That she wanted to show what she did.

325
00:16:26.696 --> 00:16:28.996
She wanted to show it to Nanami who goes to

326
00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:31.796
the esthetic salon every week at that hour.

327
00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:34.496
First, Ms. Izutsu, probably ask Mr. Fuura

328
00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:36.196
to come to a coffee shop nearby

329
00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:39.196
so that she could introduce a new client to him,

330
00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:41.296
after which she told him that she'd go ahead

331
00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:43.296
and wait for him by the elevator.

332
00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:45.896
She also instructed him to wear the same suit

333
00:16:45.896 --> 00:16:47.896
that was in the image.

334
00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:51.696
Then, Ms. Izutsu who got to the elevator before him,

335
00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:53.496
blotted out the surveillance camera in the elevator

336
00:16:53.496 --> 00:16:55.396
with spray paint.

337
00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:56.596
She closed the door once

338
00:16:56.596 --> 00:16:58.596
and after spraying the word 'Goodbye',

339
00:16:58.596 --> 00:17:00.396
she opened the door again.

340
00:17:00.396 --> 00:17:02.096
Because nobody would push the button

341
00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:04.096
since the "under inspection" sign was hung out,

342
00:17:04.096 --> 00:17:07.796
the elevator would be stopped in position.

343
00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:10.496
All she had left to do was to kill Mr. Fuura

344
00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:14.696
when he was taken aback at seeing the word 'Goodbye'.

345
00:17:15.596 --> 00:17:16.796
Then, she waited for the time

346
00:17:16.796 --> 00:17:19.796
Nanami left for the esthetic salon.

347
00:17:19.796 --> 00:17:22.896
Of course the door of the elevator was left open,

348
00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:24.596
and she pushed the button of the floor that she lived on

349
00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:25.796
which was above the 3rd floor

350
00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:27.496
where Nanami would get on the elevator.

351
00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:32.996
And, just about when Nanami would come to the elevator,

352
00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:34.496
she closed the door and placed the board

353
00:17:34.496 --> 00:17:37.296
with the four tablets attached to it against the door.

354
00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:40.196
She streamed the movie after matching the timing with

355
00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:42.496
when he would be shot in the head

356
00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:46.296
just as the elevator was going pass the 3rd floor!

357
00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:50.396
I see.

358
00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:53.196
After that if she got off at her own floor

359
00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:54.696
and took the board away,

360
00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:56.296
it would end up a perfect murder.

361
00:17:56.296 --> 00:17:59.896
There is no perfect murder to what a human commits.

362
00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:03.696
Ms. Izutsu, in fact, goofed here and there.

363
00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:06.396
One of them was when you stuck out your left hand

364
00:18:06.396 --> 00:18:07.596
when the police said

365
00:18:07.596 --> 00:18:10.096
they wanted to check for discharge residue.

366
00:18:10.096 --> 00:18:12.196
It washes off with water, doesn't it?

367
00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:14.196
The discharge residue.

368
00:18:14.196 --> 00:18:16.696
You were holding the towel, the comic and the lighter

369
00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.096
in your right hand,

370
00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:20.196
so I suppose you're right-handed.

371
00:18:26.196 --> 00:18:28.196
You went out of your way to shoot Mr. Fuura

372
00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:30.696
who was left-handed with your left hand

373
00:18:30.696 --> 00:18:32.296
to match his actions.

374
00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:34.096
If you shot him as is with your right hand,

375
00:18:34.096 --> 00:18:36.596
there would be a discrepancy in the discharge residue

376
00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:39.496
that would remain on the grip of the gun.

377
00:18:39.496 --> 00:18:43.196
And the other mistake was the automatic winding wristwatch.

378
00:18:43.196 --> 00:18:45.496
Since Mr. Fuura was wearing a wristwatch

379
00:18:45.496 --> 00:18:47.796
different from yours in the image,

380
00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:49.996
you switched your watch with his

381
00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:51.596
that he gave you some time ago, right?

382
00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:55.096
You also shook it a bit to match the time too.

383
00:18:55.096 --> 00:18:56.396
Well, I guess the two

384
00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:59.496
who are always wearing it already know, though.

385
00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:02.696
If it's shaken only for a little while, it stops right away.

386
00:19:02.696 --> 00:19:04.096
The fact that you didn't know about it,

387
00:19:04.096 --> 00:19:05.696
means that you're the culprit.

388
00:19:05.696 --> 00:19:09.096
That wristwatch isn't mine, you know.

389
00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:13.496
The one Mr. Fuura gave me

390
00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:16.396
was a woman's watch and much smaller.

391
00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:19.096
Then, whose watch was it?

392
00:19:20.196 --> 00:19:22.196
Teacher Mizuki's.

393
00:19:22.196 --> 00:19:23.596
You remember, don't you?

394
00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:26.296
The old man who hung himself to death last month

395
00:19:26.296 --> 00:19:27.696
in this condo?

396
00:19:27.696 --> 00:19:30.496
The teacher? Don't tell me that...

397
00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:33.996
He was my homeroom teacher in high school.

398
00:19:33.996 --> 00:19:36.296
I didn't think he was living in this condo

399
00:19:36.296 --> 00:19:39.096
until I ran into him coincidentally at this elevator, though.

400
00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:41.696
Then, was this murder committed to avenge

401
00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:45.996
the death of your mentor who was driven to commit suicide?

402
00:19:45.996 --> 00:19:48.396
Well, sort of.

403
00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:53.796
My primary motive was because I was sad, maybe.

404
00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:55.596
Sad?

405
00:19:57.096 --> 00:19:59.296
After he committed suicide,

406
00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:03.596
I remembered that I had left my high school album with him

407
00:20:03.596 --> 00:20:08.196
so I asked the manager to let me into his room.

408
00:20:08.196 --> 00:20:10.196
I happened to realize.

409
00:20:10.196 --> 00:20:12.396
That he'd set up a trick to make it look like

410
00:20:12.396 --> 00:20:14.096
he was killed by somebody

411
00:20:14.096 --> 00:20:16.896
while he actually committed suicide.

412
00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:21.396
Don't you think it's sad?

413
00:20:21.396 --> 00:20:22.896
In my cartoons,

414
00:20:22.896 --> 00:20:25.796
a detective would make all kinds of deductions.

415
00:20:25.796 --> 00:20:30.396
And yet, no one realized the trick that was set up.

416
00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:33.596
And the case was closed as a suicide case.

417
00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:51.196
That's why.

418
00:20:51.196 --> 00:20:55.196
I just wanted to carry out what Mr. Mizuki left unfinished.

419
00:20:55.196 --> 00:20:58.796
If not, it would be too unsettling.

420
00:22:30.996 --> 00:22:32.596
You're letting me spend the night

421
00:22:32.596 --> 00:22:34.396
at your place too, Mr. Mouri?

422
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:35.596
Yes.

423
00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:39.096
It'll probably be difficult to get a hotel room from now anyway.

424
00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:41.096
Thank you very much.

425
00:22:41.096 --> 00:22:42.596
Hey, hold it!

426
00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:44.596
You mean all four of us, you,

427
00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:47.596
this brat, Mr. Otaki and I are going to sleep in your room?

428
00:22:47.596 --> 00:22:49.596
Packed sardines.

429
00:22:49.596 --> 00:22:54.996
Then, why don't you sleep with us in our room, Conan?

430
00:22:54.996 --> 00:22:55.996
Right!

431
00:22:55.996 --> 00:22:58.996
We'll sleep in one line with Conan in the middle.

432
00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:03.696
If it's okay with you two, Ran, I don't mind.

433
00:23:03.696 --> 00:23:05.496
Watch it, you little pervert.

434
00:23:07.996 --> 00:23:09.496
Please excuse me.

435
00:23:10.796 --> 00:23:13.796
Yes, hello. Otaki here.

436
00:23:13.796 --> 00:23:15.596
It's me.

437
00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:17.196
Chief of headquarters!

438
00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:20.096
What seems to be the matter? At this time of day?

439
00:23:20.096 --> 00:23:23.896
A troublesome case has just been reported, you see.

440
00:23:23.896 --> 00:23:25.696
I thought of rejecting it

441
00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.696
because it's not in our jurisdiction but...

442
00:23:27.696 --> 00:23:29.696
Since you're in Tokyo now,

443
00:23:29.696 --> 00:23:32.096
I figured I'd have you check it out.

444
00:23:32.096 --> 00:23:36.196
What is it? This troublesome case?

445
00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:41.196
Otaki, do you think they exist in this world?

446
00:23:41.196 --> 00:23:42.996
Vampires?

447
00:23:52.996 --> 00:23:56.196
If you're going to come out, be careful.

448
00:23:56.196 --> 00:23:57.796
The talk about the inheritance

449
00:23:57.796 --> 00:24:01.496
of the estate in question will be discussed after dinner.

450
00:24:01.496 --> 00:24:04.296
The master's whereabouts are still unknown?

451
00:24:04.296 --> 00:24:07.496
No. We've split up and are looking for him though.

452
00:24:07.496 --> 00:24:08.696
A coffin?

453
00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:12.896
No one should go into something like this before dying!

454
00:24:16.696 --> 00:24:18.296
Next Conan,

455
00:24:18.296 --> 00:24:22.196
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (One)"

456
00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:39.896
Next Conan's Hint:

457
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:42.096
"Coffin"

458
00:24:42.396 --> 00:24:43.696
Hattori? Talking in his sleep?

459
00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:45.196
You want me to suck your blood?

460
00:24:45.196 --> 00:24:46.896
Oh, the preview of next week.
