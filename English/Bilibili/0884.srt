1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.810
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.010
The unfinished pop-up book Pops

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.310
received in the mail

4
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.010
contained a series of bomb threats.

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.910
It was thought to be the work of the dead author's half-brother

6
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.910
with a previous conviction of manufacturing explosives, Takuji Hirukawa.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.810
Through the Pops' efforts,

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.910
the second explosion was successfully avoided.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.410
All right.

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.410
We did it!

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.610
"Private Caller"

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.610
Tick tock, tick tock.

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.410
Boom!

14
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.310
Well done, Detective Kogoro Mouri.

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.010
But the game isn't over yet.

16
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.110
What?

17
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.110
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks"

18
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.510
"Grandpa Tick Tock is a clockmaker.

19
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.310
Tick tock, tick tock.

20
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.510
Deliver the final clock to the middle of the 7."

21
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

22
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.410
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

23
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.510
The pop-up book and the final bomb.

24
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.910
The mystery of seven takes us in an unexpected direction.

25
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.510
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.510
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.910
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.909
"The Pop-up Book Bomber (Part 2)"

29
00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.109
"Deliver the final clock to the middle of the 7."

30
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.909
Darn it! What does the middle of seven mean?

31
00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.009
Divide seven by two is 3.5.

32
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.209
"7 is read 'Nana'" -"Nana".

33
00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.509
Between "na" and "na"?

34
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.109
Seven!

35
00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.409
"V"?

36
00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.909
None of them seem right.

37
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.009
I have no idea!

38
00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.609
Hey, you!

39
00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.709
You really don't remember the answer to the riddle?

40
00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.109
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.109
"Hiroyuki Tomonaga (45), Editor In Chief" -Like I mentioned before,

42
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.709
publication was delayed.

43
00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.509
I was too busy handling the incident to read it.

44
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.509
But I do remember the end.

45
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:56.909
The end?

46
00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.609
It's not a 100% happy ending.

47
00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.309
Our company wasn't sure it was appropriate

48
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.309
for a children's book.

49
00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.509
I thought the same thing after reading it.

50
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.509
Although the drawings and pop-ups are really cute.

51
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.009
What do you mean?

52
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.209
Grandpa Tick Tock dies.

53
00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.009
You learn at the end that he's actually really sick.

54
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.609
But in the epilogue,

55
00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:26.909
his grandson takes over his business

56
00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.709
ten years later,

57
00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:30.909
so that's kind of a relief.

58
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.209
That's right.

59
00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:36.309
Seriously? It's not a clue to the bomb's location.

60
00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.909
Anyway, what's the answer to the riddle?

61
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.709
I don't know.

62
00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:42.809
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.309
What does the number seven remind you of?

64
00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.809
What's expressed in sevens?

65
00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:51.909
Expressed in sevens?

66
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.709
Oh, right. Like the seven days of the week?

67
00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:56.809
Yeah.

68
00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.809
Or the seven colors of the rainbow?

69
00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:03.609
There are seven notes on a musical scale, too.

70
00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:06.209
What's the middle of those?

71
00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.209
In a week, that would be Thursday.

72
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.509
In a rainbow...

73
00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.309
I think it's green.

74
00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.809
In a musical scale, it's fa.

75
00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.809
But there are too many things it could be.

76
00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:19.909
Yeah.

77
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.009
But what if a bomb were to explode

78
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.209
at a location related to those?

79
00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:26.909
Inspector!

80
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.809
Of course, we can't ignore it.

81
00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.309
Have the entire department

82
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:33.109
begin searching for the bomb immediately.

83
00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:34.109
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

84
00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.009
Inspector, I'd only be getting in the way

85
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.309
if I stayed any longer.

86
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:43.709
You're right.

87
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.309
Now that the investigation has established a direction,

88
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:48.909
you're free to go.

89
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.709
Thank you.

90
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:55.209
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

91
00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:59.209
Oh, the picture book.

92
00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:01.409
Give me the book, Conan.

93
00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.109
Excuse me.

94
00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:05.109
Don't you need this?

95
00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:10.809
Well, that's odd.

96
00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:11.809
Until now,

97
00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:17.709
the riddles were limited to a single answer,

98
00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:21.209
but this time the riddle itself is rather broad.

99
00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:22.209
"Kinomiri Park, Midori Elementary School"

100
00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:24.109
"Midori Law Office, Green Green Restaurant" -Why?

101
00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:25.109
"Jupiter Research Center and Observatory"

102
00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:27.009
And I'm also curious about the bomb

103
00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.909
that Pops threw into the manhole.

104
00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:37.309
And finding the unexploded bomb has been put on hold

105
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:41.209
since the entire department has been mobilized.

106
00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:44.809
Could it be?

107
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.309
-Okay, good. -Hey, Inspector!

108
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.109
What is it, Conan?

109
00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:55.309
What exactly did the bomber Hirukawa do?

110
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:57.109
What did he do?

111
00:06:57.109 --> 00:06:59.509
Caused explosions, of course.

112
00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.609
He manufactured explosives,

113
00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:04.309
blew up the safes

114
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.109
and cash transport vehicles,

115
00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:09.109
and stole a lot of money.

116
00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.609
What about it?

117
00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:14.409
Nothing.

118
00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.909
That's nothing like this crime which seems

119
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:21.009
to be motivated

120
00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:22.209
by resentment.

121
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:39.709
"Megrez Security"

122
00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:45.809
Did something happen?

123
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:47.109
I'm not sure.

124
00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:52.109
What? You found the bomb?

125
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:57.809
The garbage collection point at the #3 Thursday Building in Toriya City?

126
00:07:57.809 --> 00:07:59.609
We found one, too.

127
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:02.609
"Green Garden" -It's at the orchard in Kenbashi City.

128
00:08:02.609 --> 00:08:05.409
It was inside the management office's trash can.

129
00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:07.509
"F.A. Alloy" -We found one at "F.A. Alloy"

130
00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:08.909
in Daitoma City.

131
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:13.309
It's a gilding factory known locally as "Fa Alloy".

132
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:16.409
It was found inside a garbage can.

133
00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:19.509
Three bombs at once?

134
00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.309
Is something wrong?

135
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:30.409
I'm sorry, but a bomb was discovered up ahead.

136
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.909
What? A bomb?

137
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.409
We found all three of the bombs!

138
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.409
Tell us how to disarm them!

139
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.109
Hey, answer me!

140
00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:42.409
Answer me!

141
00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:54.509
"Wow! Were you surprised?"

142
00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:57.909
What?

143
00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:00.809
They're all fake?

144
00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:02.809
What does this mean?

145
00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:06.909
Darn it.

146
00:09:06.909 --> 00:09:09.609
What is Hirukawa trying to do?

147
00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:10.809
It's a trap.

148
00:09:11.809 --> 00:09:14.109
Like the previous riddles,

149
00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:16.309
the three fake bombs are trick answers.

150
00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:18.509
The real one is somewhere else.

151
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:19.709
-What? -What?

152
00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:23.809
Okay, okay.

153
00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:27.109
Okay...

154
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:35.809
Okay...

155
00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:41.409
Is something wrong?

156
00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:43.609
Hello, officer?

157
00:09:45.909 --> 00:09:47.809
Is something wrong?

158
00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:08.009
"Megrez Security" -Megrez Security.

159
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.909
Is something wrong, Conan?

160
00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:14.809
The Megrez in Megrez Security

161
00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:16.709
refers to this star.

162
00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:19.009
That's...

163
00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:23.509
A picture of Ursa Major.

164
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:25.109
The Big Dipper?

165
00:10:25.109 --> 00:10:26.109
That's right.

166
00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:31.309
The seven stars forming the tail of Ursa Major

167
00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:34.209
are known as the Big Dipper.

168
00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:35.809
And the center star is Megrez.

169
00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:38.209
So it's the middle of seven.

170
00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:40.009
Yeah.

171
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:43.009
Darn it. The culprit included the answer

172
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:47.109
because he knew we wouldn't get there in time.

173
00:10:47.109 --> 00:10:49.309
Inspector Megure, take a look at this.

174
00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:52.709
"Bomb Site, Kanematsu Park"

175
00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:54.809
What is this?

176
00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:56.609
A map of the sewer?

177
00:10:56.609 --> 00:10:57.809
That's right.

178
00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:00.209
Going from the manhole at Kanematsu Park

179
00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:04.309
where Mr. Mouri threw the bomb to here.

180
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:10.109
Did that bomb flow all the way here?

181
00:11:10.109 --> 00:11:12.509
Almost certainly.

182
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:17.509
Carried along by the increased water level from yesterday's rain,

183
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:20.309
the bomb most likely stopped at the grate under here.

184
00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:23.709
Forensics says it's likely the explosion

185
00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:27.809
was triggered by remote and not by a timer.

186
00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:31.009
So, what does that mean?

187
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:32.009
In other words,

188
00:11:32.009 --> 00:11:34.809
he always meant to blow up

189
00:11:34.809 --> 00:11:37.509
the cash transport vehicle.

190
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:39.509
What?

191
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:42.309
Looks like he's right.

192
00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:45.909
He made you throw the bomb in the manhole

193
00:11:45.909 --> 00:11:49.109
so it would end up here.

194
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:51.809
Which means the first bomb

195
00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:55.709
was meant to camouflage this, too.

196
00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:57.709
I don't believe it.

197
00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:02.009
What does he think he's doing?

198
00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:03.109
Inspector Megure!

199
00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:06.709
What?

200
00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:09.009
You found Hirukawa's hideout?

201
00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:15.009
We'll head there.

202
00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.509
Inspector, we're coming with you.

203
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:20.409
Okay.

204
00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:22.209
Hey, wait!

205
00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:24.509
How do you know it's his hideout?

206
00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:28.709
We received an anonymous tip.

207
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:33.109
They asked us to arrest the bomber Takuji Hirukawa

208
00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:34.709
since they spotted him.

209
00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:37.409
Then they left an address and hung up.

210
00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:41.009
I see.

211
00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:42.909
So that's how it is.

212
00:13:44.276 --> 00:13:45.876
Well, well.

213
00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:49.876
Looks like you've recovered from your injury,

214
00:13:49.876 --> 00:13:53.076
Editor Tomonaga.

215
00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:56.976
It's as though you were never injured in the first place.

216
00:13:56.976 --> 00:13:59.576
What's the meaning of this?

217
00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:02.876
By the way, I heard you're going independent soon.

218
00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.776
Will you be funding yourself

219
00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:07.376
using the cash Hirukawa stole from the transport truck?

220
00:14:07.376 --> 00:14:09.676
What are you talking about?

221
00:14:09.676 --> 00:14:11.476
I don't know what you mean.

222
00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.476
Didn't you see the news?

223
00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:14.576
What?

224
00:14:14.576 --> 00:14:18.276
Hirukawa's hideout exploded and burned down.

225
00:14:18.276 --> 00:14:20.476
Oh, I just saw that.

226
00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:22.276
According to the forensics team,

227
00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:24.576
even when including the bills thought to have burned,

228
00:14:24.576 --> 00:14:27.176
the remaining bills they found in the wreckage

229
00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:30.376
didn't add up to the amount that was stolen.

230
00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:33.476
I was wondering where the remaining money went.

231
00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:36.376
Don't ask me.

232
00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.376
And apparently the location of the hideout

233
00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:41.376
came from an anonymous tip.

234
00:14:42.776 --> 00:14:45.576
They said come to arrest the bomber Takuji Hirukawa

235
00:14:45.576 --> 00:14:48.976
since they spotted him.

236
00:14:48.976 --> 00:14:50.876
So what?

237
00:14:50.876 --> 00:14:56.576
It sounded like they were using a voice changer.

238
00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:59.076
That makes it difficult to determine whose voice it was.

239
00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:02.576
What does that have to do with me?

240
00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:06.276
The problem isn't the voice, but what was said.

241
00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:08.576
What was said?

242
00:15:08.576 --> 00:15:09.576
That's right.

243
00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:13.676
Hirukawa's name hadn't been released to the press at that time.

244
00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:17.976
The only ones who knew it was him were the police, us,

245
00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:19.376
and you.

246
00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:23.076
No one else could have known.

247
00:15:23.076 --> 00:15:26.676
That's because they remembered

248
00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.476
when his face was shown

249
00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:31.076
during his last bombings.

250
00:15:31.076 --> 00:15:32.076
You did?

251
00:15:32.776 --> 00:15:35.876
Me? Why would I remember?

252
00:15:35.876 --> 00:15:38.676
Mr. Mouri, do you think I did it?

253
00:15:38.676 --> 00:15:40.876
Yes, I do.

254
00:15:40.876 --> 00:15:43.376
Actually, I'm sure you did.

255
00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:48.376
Tomonaga, you were standing behind Hirukawa

256
00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:52.176
like an editor guiding a new author.

257
00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:58.176
If you think I did it, show me the proof.

258
00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:02.676
While the bombs were equipped with timers,

259
00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:06.276
they were all rigged to explode by remote.

260
00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:11.176
According to forensics, the radio waves from the remotes

261
00:16:11.176 --> 00:16:13.976
only worked at a range of about thirty meters.

262
00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:16.476
So what?

263
00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:21.276
So only someone at the scene with us could have

264
00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:25.976
sped up the timer on the second bomb,

265
00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:28.376
or sent me messages accordingly.

266
00:16:28.376 --> 00:16:33.176
Only you, Hiroyuki Tomonaga.

267
00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:36.276
Later, you asked the inspector

268
00:16:36.276 --> 00:16:38.876
if you could accompany us,

269
00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:40.976
and sent me messages

270
00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:44.276
in response to my actions.

271
00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:47.376
Am I wrong?

272
00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:53.076
You suggested to Hirukawa that he attack the transport truck

273
00:16:53.076 --> 00:16:57.076
while making it look like he was out to avenge his brother.

274
00:16:57.076 --> 00:17:01.176
You also involved and used me, Kogoro Mouri,

275
00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:04.276
to hide your true intentions.

276
00:17:04.276 --> 00:17:08.276
And you silenced Hirukawa himself

277
00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:10.676
by using the extra bomb you had him make.

278
00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:13.576
Impressive, detective.

279
00:17:13.576 --> 00:17:16.076
What a truly interesting deduction.

280
00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:20.376
Once I go independent, why not write mysteries for me?

281
00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:22.576
A mystery by a great detective.

282
00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:25.676
That's sure to become a best seller.

283
00:17:25.676 --> 00:17:28.876
But it's all just speculation. You have no proof.

284
00:17:28.876 --> 00:17:33.276
Hardcore mystery fans will surely criticize you for that.

285
00:17:33.276 --> 00:17:35.576
This isn't a mystery.

286
00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:37.876
This is an actual case.

287
00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:42.576
A confession from Hirukawa would change the story.

288
00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:44.476
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:44.476 --> 00:17:45.876
He should be dead...

290
00:17:46.876 --> 00:17:50.276
At least, that's what they said on the news.

291
00:17:50.276 --> 00:17:54.576
No, the news didn't mention anything about that.

292
00:17:54.576 --> 00:17:55.976
Neither did I.

293
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.576
You don't mean...

294
00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:02.076
That's right.

295
00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:03.576
Hirukawa survived.

296
00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:06.776
Thanks to Mouri's reasoning.

297
00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:11.676
I didn't understand then why a man who'd forgotten

298
00:18:11.676 --> 00:18:15.676
the answer to the riddle suddenly started talking about

299
00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:18.076
the illustrations in the picture book,

300
00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:20.976
but you wanted them to be the same.

301
00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:23.276
You wanted the culprit's suicide

302
00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:25.076
and the illustration in the book

303
00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:27.876
to overlap.

304
00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:33.676
Realizing that, Mr. Mouri asked us to drive ahead of the force

305
00:18:33.676 --> 00:18:37.576
to take Hirukawa into custody.

306
00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:40.276
We passed the police cars on their way

307
00:18:40.276 --> 00:18:42.276
and used the rear entrance to his hideout.

308
00:18:44.876 --> 00:18:48.676
We just barely got Hirukawa out in time.

309
00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:50.476
Without realizing that,

310
00:18:50.476 --> 00:18:53.676
as soon as the police surrounded the hideout,

311
00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:57.176
you pressed the switch on the remote control.

312
00:18:58.976 --> 00:19:02.576
I'm sure Hirukawa will have some interesting things to say

313
00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:07.176
once he learns he was used and nearly killed by you.

314
00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:15.176
When did you realize it was me?

315
00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:19.576
When you said the author left that proof to his brother.

316
00:19:21.476 --> 00:19:22.276
Conan.

317
00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:23.676
Here.

318
00:19:23.676 --> 00:19:25.476
Look at this.

319
00:19:25.476 --> 00:19:29.576
This isn't a proof of the book. It's clearly a copy.

320
00:19:29.576 --> 00:19:33.276
It doesn't make sense for a proof to be misaligned, right?

321
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:41.876
Hirukawa naturally would have demanded the original,

322
00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:44.676
but he said he didn't have it.

323
00:19:44.676 --> 00:19:49.476
In other words, you must still have it.

324
00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:52.476
Which means you would've looked through it

325
00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:54.876
during this case,

326
00:19:54.876 --> 00:19:57.876
but you lied about reading it.

327
00:19:57.876 --> 00:19:59.076
Why?

328
00:19:59.076 --> 00:20:03.176
Because you were the mastermind

329
00:20:03.176 --> 00:20:05.676
who planned this crime.

330
00:20:29.276 --> 00:20:31.876
Finally, I have a question for you.

331
00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:37.276
Why didn't you give Hirukawa the original?

332
00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.676
Because...

333
00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:45.776
Because it was a masterpiece.

334
00:20:45.776 --> 00:20:47.976
I'm still an editor.

335
00:20:47.976 --> 00:20:49.676
I could tell.

336
00:20:49.676 --> 00:20:53.376
Even if he was family, I didn't want to turn it over to a criminal.

337
00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:57.576
And tearing out the pages that contained the clues.

338
00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:01.076
Even though it was my plan,

339
00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:03.576
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

340
00:21:03.576 --> 00:21:08.976
Someday I planned to publish that manuscript.

341
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:09.976
Don't!

342
00:21:10.876 --> 00:21:12.376
Please don't.

343
00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:15.376
You don't have the right!

344
00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.176
It may have been a copy,

345
00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:22.476
but you used that wonderful picture book to commit a crime.

346
00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:26.276
The author must be crying in heaven.

347
00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:30.776
Ran...

348
00:23:03.476 --> 00:23:04.976
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks"

349
00:23:04.976 --> 00:23:06.376
Six months later,

350
00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:10.976
whether according to the editor's prediction or not,

351
00:23:10.976 --> 00:23:12.876
the completed picture book was published...

352
00:23:12.876 --> 00:23:14.876
"Winner of the 34th New Author Award" -and won...

353
00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:16.876
"Recommended by the staff" -the new author award.

354
00:23:18.176 --> 00:23:20.176
It was an appropriate farewell gift

355
00:23:20.176 --> 00:23:23.476
for the author who passed away before his time,

356
00:23:23.476 --> 00:23:26.376
"Picture Book Author, Kenichi Imai" -but that's another story.

357
00:23:26.376 --> 00:23:30.676
Seriously, despite all the running I did this time,

358
00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:32.976
I don't feel like I accomplished anything.

359
00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:35.276
I'm just tired.

360
00:23:35.276 --> 00:23:36.976
Whatever, though.

361
00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:40.176
Beer tastes better after a good workout.

362
00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:47.676
That's good!

363
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:49.776
You always say that.

364
00:23:50.776 --> 00:23:52.476
That's that.

365
00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:57.776
"Next Episode" -We just happened to be in London.

366
00:23:57.776 --> 00:23:58.976
Oh, yeah?

367
00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:03.276
I'd like to say a line as cool as that.

368
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:05.976
Anyway, are you sure about today?

369
00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:08.276
The date.

370
00:24:08.276 --> 00:24:09.476
Yeah.

371
00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:11.476
After all, today is...

372
00:24:11.476 --> 00:24:13.476
Friday the 13th.

373
00:24:19.176 --> 00:24:20.576
Next Conan,

374
00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:24.376
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 1)"

375
00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:27.419
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:29.419
"Seating Locations"

377
00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:30.819
Kazuha's coming next time.

378
00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:32.419
-Which means Hattori is, too. -I sense love in the air.

379
00:24:32.419 --> 00:24:33.819
I sense a case.
