1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,940
Officer Sato?

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,940
What important thing did you want to talk to me about?

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,440
Never mind, just get in!

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
Okay.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,740
Wait a second.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,440
This feels familiar.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,140
Back then, when I opened the door of the car.

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,540
You fell for it, you fell for it.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,840
Back then, Officer Sato was really catching her thrills.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,840
So maybe I'll make like I really fell for her trick today too.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,340
Please cut out jokes like this!

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,940
What?

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,640
Just what're you doing?

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,040
Oh, no, well...

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,640
I just thought that you were going to play a prank on me again.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,940
I told you I have something important to talk to you about, didn't I?

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,240
You said so some time ago and I fell for it back then, didn't I?

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,740
Hey.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,740
Yes?

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,140
Can't you tell?

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Tell, what?

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,040
All I can see is that you're as beautiful as always.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Just what're you talking about? Oh boy.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,240
So, what is it you want anyway?

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,340
I don't have it...

26
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,640
You know, that.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,640
That? You don't have it?

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,240
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Oh boy.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,840
Don't tell anybody because it's embarrassing.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,540
No, I won't! Of course not!

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,040
But, what shall I do?

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,640
This is a grave case of responsibility, isn't it?

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,340
I'll take full responsibility!

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,140
Officer Takagi.

36
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,640
Wait a second.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,740
If between two police officers,

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,440
moreover, between officers working in the same department

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,040
become married taking into consideration,

40
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,340
that married couples working together may encounter various problems,

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,140
either one of the partners would have to transfer.

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,740
Officer Sato is popular here, so if she's transferred...

43
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,240
God knows what the senior officers would do to me.

44
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,940
If so, it'd be better if I transfer elsewhere.

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,040
No, rather, I should just quit

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,240
and become a house-husband.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
Yes, sir! I understand!

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,240
We'll be right over!

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,940
There was an eye-witness report of the suspect at Beikacho!

50
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
We're heading for the site right now!

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,740
Okay!

52
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,540
Miwako's having a baby?

53
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,540
She's pregnant, right?

54
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,740
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

55
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,340
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

56
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Sato finally confesses to Takagi?

57
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,440
A perfect alibi, the mystery of the language of flowers.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

59
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,940
His name is Detective Conan!

61
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:05,795
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Confession)"

62
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:17,395
Hey, hey, all three of you yawning.

63
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,295
I mean you're taking after Ai.

64
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:22,295
Well, sorry that I yawn so much.

65
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,595
But...

66
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:27,095
The Titan Fighter that came out the other day was really interesting!

67
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,495
We overplayed it, you see.

68
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,595
I mean you guys want to waste your summer vacation

69
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:33,195
playing games all the while or what?

70
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:38,695
Right! I had Daddy help me and I'm on rank five now!

71
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,195
No joke?

72
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:43,795
I was eaten by the blue giant so many times.

73
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:45,595
What kind of game is it?

74
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,995
Something about it being a role playing game

75
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:49,395
in which you protect you castle

76
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,895
from the giants who come to attack it.

77
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,095
Come to think of it,

78
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,795
the hint book's coming out today, isn't it?

79
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:58,895
Right! Right!

80
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:02,195
Hey, maybe they have it at the convenience store over there?

81
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,395
Let's go!

82
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,095
Hey, you guys!

83
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,295
Weren't we going to play soccer in the park?

84
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,595
It can't be helped.

85
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:18,395
I wonder if there was an accident there or something?

86
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,895
If so, those flowers...

87
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:23,995
If I remember correctly, those flowers are called False Dragonheads.

88
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:25,195
The flower language is...

89
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,495
Hey, Conan.

90
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:28,895
Just what're you doing?

91
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:30,395
I'm leaving you behind.

92
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:32,095
Okay.

93
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:37,395
"Flower Shop, Nostalgia"

94
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,795
Well, it sure was a surprise

95
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:42,595
to think that there's somebody who looks so much alike.

96
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:44,495
Yes, it sure was.

97
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,795
It's a bit late,

98
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:49,895
but would you like to have lunch somewhere nearby?

99
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,695
Okay.

100
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:54,195
Then, would you like something sour?

101
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,095
Why?

102
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,395
"24 Hour Mart" -Wow! Fantastic.

103
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,195
It says Haoken!

104
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,895
How awesome.

105
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:05,095
It says here that it an attacking power of over 10,000,

106
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:09,695
and it's the one and only sacred sword that the giant tribe fears!

107
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,295
But, the picture's black and white so it's hard to tell.

108
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:16,195
It says you can't get a hold of it

109
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:19,295
unless you defeat the super huge red giant.

110
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,695
It's going to take quite a while yet.

111
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,695
I've got that sword.

112
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:26,395
The handle is shiny gold

113
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,795
"Noriya Makabe (7)" -and the pattern on the blade is red!

114
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,195
"First Grader" -Even after getting hold of the sword

115
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:34,995
you've got to reinforce it with many reinforcement items, though!

116
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:38,695
Wow. Which means you're already rank eight?

117
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:41,995
-Yes! -You belong to the class next to ours, right?

118
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,095
I hope you're not lying.

119
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,995
I'm not lying!

120
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:48,895
Right, Toshinari!

121
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,695
Yeah!

122
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,695
Noriya really hung in there, you see!

123
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:56,195
He's the man I saw a while ago.

124
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:59,695
If you really got hold of the Haoken, I'd like to see it!

125
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,795
-Me too! -Same here.

126
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:05,195
Would you all like to come to Toshinari's home with me, then?

127
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:08,595
It's okay, isn't it, Toshinari?

128
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:12,595
"Toshinari Shiga (25)" -Then, go on ahead to the car.

129
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,495
"Graduate student" -I'll finish paying for the stuff.

130
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:18,095
It'll be 1350 yen.

131
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,895
I'll pay by credit card.

132
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:22,295
Yes, sir. How many payments?

133
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,295
One.

134
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,795
All right, sir.

135
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,595
A key for a foreign car and a platinum card.

136
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,595
I wonder if he comes from some rich family.

137
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,395
What a shabby apartment.

138
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,895
Hey, Genta!

139
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,195
It may look shabby

140
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:43,995
but it's home sweet home once you live in it!

141
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:46,995
I'll go park the car, so you guys go on inside!

142
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:47,995
Okay!

143
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:54,795
"Room 3, Shiga"

144
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:56,895
It's really Haoken!

145
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,495
The handle is really shiny!

146
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,395
-That's really awesome. - So cool.

147
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:04,895
Gosh.

148
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,695
The trash bag is full of candies,

149
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:10,295
containers of cup noodles, and packed foods.

150
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,195
Talk about unhealthy diet.

151
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:15,795
Hey, Ai.

152
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,495
What?

153
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:19,295
Didn't something smell?

154
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,795
Not really.

155
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,695
There seems to be no kitchen garbage, though.

156
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:26,695
No, I mean in the corridor before we entered this room.

157
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:28,095
Beats me.

158
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,495
I didn't notice anything, why?

159
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:30,495
I see.

160
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:43,795
Hey, what're you searching other people's houses for?

161
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,495
Noriya.

162
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,595
Did your big brother Toshinari just move here?

163
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:52,895
Nope. It was about a month ago.

164
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,995
Before summer vacation

165
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:56,695
he was living in the same condo I was living in.

166
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:02,595
Besides, Toshinari's not my big brother, he's my cousin.

167
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:05,495
He's my mother's older sister's son.

168
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:09,495
Daddy's on something called an overseas business trip

169
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:12,695
and Mommy went along with him to stay for a week to help him,

170
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,195
so I'm staying over at Toshinari's place during that time.

171
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,095
You're staying here a week?

172
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,195
Yes.

173
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:22,595
Besides Mommy told me to stay here.

174
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:27,495
Toshinari's older sister died 6 months ago

175
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:30,095
and he's depressed after the incident.

176
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:34,995
That's why Mommy sent me to help cheer him up.

177
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,095
Then, he went to offer those flowers a while ago

178
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,595
to the site where his older sister had the accident?

179
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,595
That's right! He showed me a picture of his older sister some time ago!

180
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,095
She used to be a very kind person

181
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,495
who used to take me camping a lot.

182
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:54,095
I wonder if there were so many pictures of her?

183
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:56,195
Let me see it.

184
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:57,195
Okay.

185
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,695
Strange, these pictures toward the end...

186
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:06,995
All of these pictures...

187
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,895
She's not looking this way.

188
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:11,895
Besides, what's this?

189
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,795
There's a small hole at the upper part of the pictures.

190
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,295
It's Toshinari's voice?

191
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,495
The corridor?

192
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:24,595
Don't tell me...

193
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,595
Room number 4 next door!

194
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,395
It's the thing I smelled a while ago.

195
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,395
Conan.

196
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,995
What on earth?

197
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,795
You guys stay here!

198
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,195
Ai! Call the police!

199
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:46,495
And tell them someone's dead!

200
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:48,095
-What? -Okay.

201
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:57,295
What's that?

202
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:04,595
This picture that is on the board...

203
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,895
The place where the board is discoloured

204
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,595
and where the picture's placed is slightly shifted.

205
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,195
That's not only for 1 or 2 pictures.

206
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,595
Why?

207
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:17,695
All of these pictures...

208
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,795
She's not looking this way.

209
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:24,495
There's a small hole at the upper part of the pictures.

210
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,395
Don't tell me...

211
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:33,095
That the perp who did this...

212
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,795
It can't be.

213
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:48,246
But...

214
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:51,146
to think that those two were that far into each other.

215
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,746
They're headed directly for goal now, aren't they?

216
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:55,146
But...

217
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:57,546
It doesn't look all that great for Officer Takagi.

218
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:58,946
What do you mean?

219
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,246
Think what'll happen to him

220
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,846
if the police detectives find out about this.

221
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:05,146
True.

222
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:07,846
Officer Sato's got a large group of fans so...

223
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,646
This is bad, no joke.

224
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,146
True.

225
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,146
No joke, this is bad.

226
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,246
Yumi?

227
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:23,246
What you're saying and your facial expression aren't jiving.

228
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:30,346
The victim is Mr. Hiroto Yasutomi, age 31,

229
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:31,846
a free lancer.

230
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:34,246
According to the ME,

231
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,546
the estimated time of death

232
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:38,246
is between 07:00 pm and 09:00 pm last night.

233
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:42,246
He's been stabbed multiple times in the chest and stomach.

234
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:45,746
And? The one who first found the corpse

235
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:50,446
was you who lives next door, Mr. Toshinari Shiga, correct?

236
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:51,746
Yes.

237
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:54,346
I parked the car in the parking lot

238
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:56,646
and was on my way to my room

239
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:59,146
I smelled a foul odor from this room.

240
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,846
The door wasn't locked so I opened it,

241
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,446
and this is what I found.

242
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:06,546
I was shocked, then found this boy, a friend of my cousin Noriya

243
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,346
had helped himself inside.

244
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,846
It's you, Conan!

245
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:15,046
Then, the girl who reported this to the police is...

246
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:16,446
Me.

247
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:19,746
We all came over to play at Noriya's cousin,

248
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:22,146
Toshinari's home today.

249
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:24,746
But, you're just as much a caller of Death yourself

250
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:26,146
as Mr. Mouri, aren't you?

251
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:28,946
You show up at murder sites one after the other.

252
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:33,446
But, you sure got here quickly too, didn't you, Officer Sato?

253
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,346
We got a call saying that the salesclerk

254
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:40,646
at a florist near here resembled a suspect at large.

255
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,246
It turned out to be a mistake though.

256
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,846
We were coincidentally in this neighborhood

257
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:49,046
so we were dispatched here!

258
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:51,046
Well, if Officer Takagi didn't dilly-dally

259
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:54,046
whispering to the salesclerk back then,

260
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,646
we would've been able to leave much earlier, you see.

261
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:59,646
We were nearby because we were having lunch, right?

262
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,446
Were you talking about flowers?

263
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:03,046
Are you going to give flowers to anyone?

264
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,546
But, if you're giving them to Officer Sato

265
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,546
you don't have to be secretive about it, do you?

266
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:07,646
Flirting?

267
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,446
-You think so too? -No way!

268
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:13,446
Hey, by the way...

269
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,846
If the victim died between 07:00 pm and 09:00 pm last night,

270
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:19,946
why don't you ask Noriya or Toshinari about it?

271
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,646
If they were in the room next door,

272
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:24,846
they may have heard some suspicious noises or something.

273
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:26,746
If at that time last night,

274
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,346
I was watching TV with Toshinari!

275
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,046
A Masked Yaiba movie was playing, you see.

276
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:34,446
Oh, I was watching it too!

277
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:37,746
Me too! It was really interesting!

278
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:40,046
It was from 07:00 pm to 09:00 pm

279
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,146
and it was the first TV premier!

280
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,546
And, while you were watching it,

281
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:47,346
didn't you hear any strange sounds or groans?

282
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,446
No! Part way, the man next door pounded on the door yelling,

283
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:53,946
to cut the noise down though...

284
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:56,046
About what time was that?

285
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:59,346
I think it was about 07:30.

286
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:02,046
I apologized from behind the door

287
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,846
and turned the volume down.

288
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:08,746
Which means that Mr. Yasutomi was alive till then.

289
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:10,946
Did you hear any strange sounds after that?

290
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,046
Not that I'm aware of.

291
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,746
Since Masked Yaiba is an action hero movie,

292
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:18,446
people screaming and explosions were frequent,

293
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:20,346
so even if there were any suspicious noises,

294
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,146
I may not have noticed.

295
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,946
Besides, the place where the corpse

296
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:27,446
of the next door neighbor was found was in the kitchen by the sink,

297
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:31,446
two rooms away from where we were watching TV.

298
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:32,546
Now that you mentioned it,

299
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:33,646
I saw the next door neighbor

300
00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:36,346
at a convenience store around sundown yesterday.

301
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,446
Around what time was that?

302
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,746
I'm not sure.

303
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:43,246
It was when I went to buy packed food for dinner.

304
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:45,646
I was bothered by the expiration date on the packed food

305
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:49,046
and remembers asking Noriya what the date on it was.

306
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:50,746
You asked the child the date?

307
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:54,246
Yes! I was holding the shopping basket.

308
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,546
The newspaper that we bought at the convenience store was inside it,

309
00:16:57,546 --> 00:17:01,646
so I told Toshinari that the date was August 13th!

310
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,546
That it was the day that Yaiba's movi e was going to be playing on TV!

311
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:07,546
If it was the 13th, it's unmistakably yesterday.

312
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:11,546
Was Mr. Yasutomi with someone back then?

313
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:14,946
No, I think he was alone.

314
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,746
Hey, Noriya.

315
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,846
While you were watching the Yaiba movie,

316
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,746
did Toshinari go to use the restroom or something?

317
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:26,546
No, because I was watching leaning against Toshinari right through.

318
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,846
What did you do after you finished watching?

319
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,446
The movie ended before 09:00 pm, didn't it?

320
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:34,446
Yes! I went to take a pee right afterwards

321
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:36,446
and resumed playing the game.

322
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,946
Which means you were playing the game before that too?

323
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,646
Yes! After coming back from the convenience store

324
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,846
till the time when the movie began.

325
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:48,146
Then, Toshinari looked at his wristwatch and said,

326
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:50,146
"Oh no!" It's already 07:00!

327
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,546
Let's save it because the movie's going to start."

328
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,146
So, we saved the game right away

329
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:56,946
and switched to watching TV.

330
00:17:56,946 --> 00:18:00,346
We made it just as the movie was about to start!

331
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,246
Then, after you finished watching the movie

332
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,546
and while you were in the restroom,

333
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:07,146
didn't Toshinari leave the room?

334
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,946
No, besides, he asked me what snack I'd like to eat

335
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,846
from outside the restroom too.

336
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,646
Then, after that you both continued playing

337
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,946
the game together right through?

338
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:18,146
Right! We played until quite late,

339
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:21,146
woke up early in the morning played again,

340
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:24,846
then went to the convenience store to buy breakfast

341
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:28,346
and played until around noon but,

342
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,646
I got sleepy so I took a nap

343
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:33,646
and resumed playing the game again

344
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,946
after I got up. Then, we got hungry

345
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,546
so we went to the convenience store again.

346
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,846
And, that's where we met you!

347
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:42,046
Nothing but playing games.

348
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:44,446
That's why you ranked so high!

349
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,946
How lucky!

350
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:49,746
And? What did you have for lunch?

351
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:52,746
I was eating snacks so I wasn't hungry at all!

352
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:55,346
Eating snacks and playing the game right through.

353
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:56,546
How lucky!

354
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:58,146
It's heaven!

355
00:18:58,146 --> 00:18:59,746
Make sure you don't copy him.

356
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:05,146
Which means you were with Toshinari right through today again?

357
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,746
After eating breakfast,

358
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,046
he told me that he had something to do and left,

359
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,946
after telling me to stay put and keep playing.

360
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:13,946
He also told me to play using the headset

361
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,046
so that the man next door wouldn't come

362
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:17,846
to complain of it being noisy again.

363
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,146
Around what time was that?

364
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,746
It was about...

365
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:26,046
We went to the store to buy breakfast around 06:00 am,

366
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:28,446
came home and ate it right away,

367
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,746
so I think it was about 07:00 am.

368
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:33,346
The clock behind the salesclerk of the convenience store indicated

369
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,746
a little after 06:00 am, you see.

370
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:38,746
What?

371
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:41,346
Don't tell me that you suspect him?

372
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:47,146
may I be excused to go back to my room already?

373
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:51,146
I don't want to keep the children near the corpse any longer.

374
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,846
I guess so.

375
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:56,146
Just in case, I'd like to check the contents

376
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,646
inside your trash bag, okay?

377
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,146
Yes, go right ahead.

378
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,346
That rear view.

379
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:06,746
Weren't you at the florist a while ago?

380
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:10,046
Yes, I did buy flowers.

381
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:11,446
Just as I thought.

382
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,146
When I asked the salesclerk there,

383
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:17,846
what flower I should send when a wish was fulfilled,

384
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:20,146
she suggested that I buy a fake dragonhead

385
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:23,646
like the one the customer just before had purchased.

386
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:27,646
I happened to see you leaving the shop!

387
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:30,846
Then, something good happened to you, right, Officer Takagi?

388
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,846
You won another ice cream or something?

389
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,646
Come on, tell us.

390
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:36,346
Oh, no.

391
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:38,746
Please help me out.

392
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:39,746
Why?

393
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,346
I said I'd take full responsibility, didn't I?

394
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,746
Oh that?

395
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:49,146
Well, you are partly responsible too.

396
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:52,746
So, it's only natural that you do.

397
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:55,246
Yeah. Sort of.

398
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,246
You bought those flowers too, didn't you?

399
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,346
Yeah.

400
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:01,346
If so...

401
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:05,846
Did one of your wishes come true or something?

402
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,946
Yeah.

403
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:15,446
Then, shall we go to your room, Mr. Shiga?

404
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,646
Okay.

405
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,846
Officer Takagi?

406
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,446
What is it, Conan?

407
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:26,946
I've got something I want you to check for me.

408
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:30,546
I was wondering if there was an accident or something

409
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:32,446
because Toshinari was offering flowers

410
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:35,146
on the road in front of the florist.

411
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:36,546
Is that so?

412
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,446
Come on, stop dilly-dallying, Officer Takagi.

413
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:41,246
Okay.

414
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:42,346
Hurry up.

415
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,546
You're being impulsive, Officer Sato.

416
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:45,846
Go easy on me, please.

417
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:53,146
He's probably the one who killed Mr. Yasutomi,

418
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,846
Mr. Toshinari Shiga, no doubt about it.

419
00:21:56,846 --> 00:22:00,946
Besides, he's motive for killing is probably...

420
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:04,446
But, the problem is his alibi

421
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:08,046
August 13th, between 07:00 pm to 09:00 pm,

422
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,246
the time when the crime was committed.

423
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:15,246
The alibi that he was by Noriya right through.

424
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:16,946
Darn.

425
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:21,246
How on earth did he kill Mr. Yasutomi?

426
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:25,746
And?

427
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:30,146
Officer Takagi. Did something good happen?

428
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,246
Yes?

429
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:57,446
What is it? This sinister atmosphere?

430
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,146
The fact is...

431
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:05,246
Motherly instinct is growing in Officer Sato?

432
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:08,446
The Yaiba movie you saw last night...

433
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,146
Yeah, that's right!

434
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:13,946
I watched it and holding back wanting to go pee!

435
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:16,146
Just as I thought...

436
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:17,446
Next Conan,

437
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:21,346
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Truth)"

438
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:39,446
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,746
"Newspaper".

440
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,946
Summer time is...

441
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:44,046
-A time for games. -A time for candies.

442
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:46,346
-A time for taking afternoon naps. -A time to play outside!
