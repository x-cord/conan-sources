1
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.940
Officer Sato?

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.940
What important thing did you want to talk to me about?

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.440
Never mind, just get in!

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.440
Okay.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.740
Wait a second.

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.440
This feels familiar.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.140
Back then, when I opened the door of the car.

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.540
You fell for it, you fell for it.

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.840
Back then, Officer Sato was really catching her thrills.

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.840
So maybe I'll make like I really fell for her trick today too.

11
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.340
Please cut out jokes like this!

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.940
What?

13
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.640
Just what're you doing?

14
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040
Oh, no, well...

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.640
I just thought that you were going to play a prank on me again.

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.940
I told you I have something important to talk to you about, didn't I?

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.240
You said so some time ago and I fell for it back then, didn't I?

18
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.740
Hey.

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.740
Yes?

20
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.140
Can't you tell?

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.840
Tell, what?

22
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.040
All I can see is that you're as beautiful as always.

23
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.040
Just what're you talking about? Oh boy.

24
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.240
So, what is it you want anyway?

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340
I don't have it...

26
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.640
You know, that.

27
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.640
That? You don't have it?

28
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.240
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240
Oh boy.

30
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840
Don't tell anybody because it's embarrassing.

31
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.540
No, I won't! Of course not!

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.040
But, what shall I do?

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.640
This is a grave case of responsibility, isn't it?

34
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.340
I'll take full responsibility!

35
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.140
Officer Takagi.

36
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.640
Wait a second.

37
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.740
If between two police officers,

38
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.440
moreover, between officers working in the same department

39
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.040
become married taking into consideration,

40
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.340
that married couples working together may encounter various problems,

41
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.140
either one of the partners would have to transfer.

42
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.740
Officer Sato is popular here, so if she's transferred...

43
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.240
God knows what the senior officers would do to me.

44
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.940
If so, it'd be better if I transfer elsewhere.

45
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.040
No, rather, I should just quit

46
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.240
and become a house-husband.

47
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.440
Yes, sir! I understand!

48
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.240
We'll be right over!

49
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.940
There was an eye-witness report of the suspect at Beikacho!

50
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940
We're heading for the site right now!

51
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.740
Okay!

52
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.540
Miwako's having a baby?

53
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540
She's pregnant, right?

54
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.740
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

55
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.340
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

56
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340
Sato finally confesses to Takagi?

57
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.440
A perfect alibi, the mystery of the language of flowers.

58
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

59
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

60
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.940
His name is Detective Conan!

61
00:05:00.595 --> 00:05:05.795
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Confession)"

62
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:17.395
Hey, hey, all three of you yawning.

63
00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.295
I mean you're taking after Ai.

64
00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:22.295
Well, sorry that I yawn so much.

65
00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:23.595
But...

66
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:27.095
The Titan Fighter that came out the other day was really interesting!

67
00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:29.495
We overplayed it, you see.

68
00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.595
I mean you guys want to waste your summer vacation

69
00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:33.195
playing games all the while or what?

70
00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:38.695
Right! I had Daddy help me and I'm on rank five now!

71
00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:40.195
No joke?

72
00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:43.795
I was eaten by the blue giant so many times.

73
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:45.595
What kind of game is it?

74
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.995
Something about it being a role playing game

75
00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:49.395
in which you protect you castle

76
00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:51.895
from the giants who come to attack it.

77
00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:55.095
Come to think of it,

78
00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:57.795
the hint book's coming out today, isn't it?

79
00:05:57.795 --> 00:05:58.895
Right! Right!

80
00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:02.195
Hey, maybe they have it at the convenience store over there?

81
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.395
Let's go!

82
00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:05.095
Hey, you guys!

83
00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:08.295
Weren't we going to play soccer in the park?

84
00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:11.595
It can't be helped.

85
00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:18.395
I wonder if there was an accident there or something?

86
00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:20.895
If so, those flowers...

87
00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.995
If I remember correctly, those flowers are called False Dragonheads.

88
00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:25.195
The flower language is...

89
00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:27.495
Hey, Conan.

90
00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:28.895
Just what're you doing?

91
00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:30.395
I'm leaving you behind.

92
00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:32.095
Okay.

93
00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:37.395
"Flower Shop, Nostalgia"

94
00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:39.795
Well, it sure was a surprise

95
00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:42.595
to think that there's somebody who looks so much alike.

96
00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:44.495
Yes, it sure was.

97
00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:47.795
It's a bit late,

98
00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:49.895
but would you like to have lunch somewhere nearby?

99
00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:51.695
Okay.

100
00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:54.195
Then, would you like something sour?

101
00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:57.095
Why?

102
00:06:57.095 --> 00:06:59.395
"24 Hour Mart" -Wow! Fantastic.

103
00:06:59.395 --> 00:07:01.195
It says Haoken!

104
00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:02.895
How awesome.

105
00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:05.095
It says here that it an attacking power of over 10,000,

106
00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:09.695
and it's the one and only sacred sword that the giant tribe fears!

107
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:14.295
But, the picture's black and white so it's hard to tell.

108
00:07:14.295 --> 00:07:16.195
It says you can't get a hold of it

109
00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:19.295
unless you defeat the super huge red giant.

110
00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:21.695
It's going to take quite a while yet.

111
00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:23.695
I've got that sword.

112
00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:26.395
The handle is shiny gold

113
00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:28.795
"Noriya Makabe (7)" -and the pattern on the blade is red!

114
00:07:28.795 --> 00:07:30.195
"First Grader" -Even after getting hold of the sword

115
00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:34.995
you've got to reinforce it with many reinforcement items, though!

116
00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:38.695
Wow. Which means you're already rank eight?

117
00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:41.995
-Yes! -You belong to the class next to ours, right?

118
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:45.095
I hope you're not lying.

119
00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:46.995
I'm not lying!

120
00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:48.895
Right, Toshinari!

121
00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:50.695
Yeah!

122
00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:52.695
Noriya really hung in there, you see!

123
00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:56.195
He's the man I saw a while ago.

124
00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:59.695
If you really got hold of the Haoken, I'd like to see it!

125
00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:01.795
-Me too! -Same here.

126
00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:05.195
Would you all like to come to Toshinari's home with me, then?

127
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:08.595
It's okay, isn't it, Toshinari?

128
00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:12.595
"Toshinari Shiga (25)" -Then, go on ahead to the car.

129
00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:14.495
"Graduate student" -I'll finish paying for the stuff.

130
00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:18.095
It'll be 1350 yen.

131
00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:19.895
I'll pay by credit card.

132
00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:22.295
Yes, sir. How many payments?

133
00:08:22.295 --> 00:08:23.295
One.

134
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:24.795
All right, sir.

135
00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.595
A key for a foreign car and a platinum card.

136
00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:29.595
I wonder if he comes from some rich family.

137
00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:38.395
What a shabby apartment.

138
00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:39.895
Hey, Genta!

139
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.195
It may look shabby

140
00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:43.995
but it's home sweet home once you live in it!

141
00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:46.995
I'll go park the car, so you guys go on inside!

142
00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:47.995
Okay!

143
00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:54.795
"Room 3, Shiga"

144
00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:56.895
It's really Haoken!

145
00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:59.495
The handle is really shiny!

146
00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:03.395
-That's really awesome. - So cool.

147
00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:04.895
Gosh.

148
00:09:04.895 --> 00:09:06.695
The trash bag is full of candies,

149
00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:10.295
containers of cup noodles, and packed foods.

150
00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:14.195
Talk about unhealthy diet.

151
00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:15.795
Hey, Ai.

152
00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:17.495
What?

153
00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:19.295
Didn't something smell?

154
00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:20.795
Not really.

155
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.695
There seems to be no kitchen garbage, though.

156
00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:26.695
No, I mean in the corridor before we entered this room.

157
00:09:26.695 --> 00:09:28.095
Beats me.

158
00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.495
I didn't notice anything, why?

159
00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:30.495
I see.

160
00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:43.795
Hey, what're you searching other people's houses for?

161
00:09:43.795 --> 00:09:46.495
Noriya.

162
00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:49.595
Did your big brother Toshinari just move here?

163
00:09:49.595 --> 00:09:52.895
Nope. It was about a month ago.

164
00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:53.995
Before summer vacation

165
00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:56.695
he was living in the same condo I was living in.

166
00:09:57.895 --> 00:10:02.595
Besides, Toshinari's not my big brother, he's my cousin.

167
00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:05.495
He's my mother's older sister's son.

168
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:09.495
Daddy's on something called an overseas business trip

169
00:10:09.495 --> 00:10:12.695
and Mommy went along with him to stay for a week to help him,

170
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:16.195
so I'm staying over at Toshinari's place during that time.

171
00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:18.095
You're staying here a week?

172
00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:19.195
Yes.

173
00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:22.595
Besides Mommy told me to stay here.

174
00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:27.495
Toshinari's older sister died 6 months ago

175
00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:30.095
and he's depressed after the incident.

176
00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:34.995
That's why Mommy sent me to help cheer him up.

177
00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:37.095
Then, he went to offer those flowers a while ago

178
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.595
to the site where his older sister had the accident?

179
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:43.595
That's right! He showed me a picture of his older sister some time ago!

180
00:10:45.095 --> 00:10:47.095
She used to be a very kind person

181
00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:49.495
who used to take me camping a lot.

182
00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:54.095
I wonder if there were so many pictures of her?

183
00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:56.195
Let me see it.

184
00:10:56.195 --> 00:10:57.195
Okay.

185
00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:05.695
Strange, these pictures toward the end...

186
00:11:05.695 --> 00:11:06.995
All of these pictures...

187
00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:08.895
She's not looking this way.

188
00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:11.895
Besides, what's this?

189
00:11:11.895 --> 00:11:14.795
There's a small hole at the upper part of the pictures.

190
00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:22.295
It's Toshinari's voice?

191
00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:23.495
The corridor?

192
00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:24.595
Don't tell me...

193
00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.595
Room number 4 next door!

194
00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:35.395
It's the thing I smelled a while ago.

195
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.395
Conan.

196
00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:39.995
What on earth?

197
00:11:39.995 --> 00:11:41.795
You guys stay here!

198
00:11:41.795 --> 00:11:44.195
Ai! Call the police!

199
00:11:44.195 --> 00:11:46.495
And tell them someone's dead!

200
00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:48.095
-What? -Okay.

201
00:11:56.095 --> 00:11:57.295
What's that?

202
00:12:01.695 --> 00:12:04.595
This picture that is on the board...

203
00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:05.895
The place where the board is discoloured

204
00:12:05.895 --> 00:12:08.595
and where the picture's placed is slightly shifted.

205
00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:12.195
That's not only for 1 or 2 pictures.

206
00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:13.595
Why?

207
00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:17.695
All of these pictures...

208
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.795
She's not looking this way.

209
00:12:21.795 --> 00:12:24.495
There's a small hole at the upper part of the pictures.

210
00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:29.395
Don't tell me...

211
00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:33.095
That the perp who did this...

212
00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:34.795
It can't be.

213
00:12:46.246 --> 00:12:48.246
But...

214
00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:51.146
to think that those two were that far into each other.

215
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.746
They're headed directly for goal now, aren't they?

216
00:12:53.746 --> 00:12:55.146
But...

217
00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:57.546
It doesn't look all that great for Officer Takagi.

218
00:12:57.546 --> 00:12:58.946
What do you mean?

219
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.246
Think what'll happen to him

220
00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:02.846
if the police detectives find out about this.

221
00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:05.146
True.

222
00:13:05.146 --> 00:13:07.846
Officer Sato's got a large group of fans so...

223
00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:09.646
This is bad, no joke.

224
00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:11.146
True.

225
00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:14.146
No joke, this is bad.

226
00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.246
Yumi?

227
00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:23.246
What you're saying and your facial expression aren't jiving.

228
00:13:25.946 --> 00:13:30.346
The victim is Mr. Hiroto Yasutomi, age 31,

229
00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:31.846
a free lancer.

230
00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:34.246
According to the ME,

231
00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.546
the estimated time of death

232
00:13:35.546 --> 00:13:38.246
is between 07:00 pm and 09:00 pm last night.

233
00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:42.246
He's been stabbed multiple times in the chest and stomach.

234
00:13:42.246 --> 00:13:45.746
And? The one who first found the corpse

235
00:13:45.746 --> 00:13:50.446
was you who lives next door, Mr. Toshinari Shiga, correct?

236
00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:51.746
Yes.

237
00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:54.346
I parked the car in the parking lot

238
00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:56.646
and was on my way to my room

239
00:13:56.646 --> 00:13:59.146
I smelled a foul odor from this room.

240
00:13:59.146 --> 00:14:01.846
The door wasn't locked so I opened it,

241
00:14:01.846 --> 00:14:03.446
and this is what I found.

242
00:14:03.446 --> 00:14:06.546
I was shocked, then found this boy, a friend of my cousin Noriya

243
00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:09.346
had helped himself inside.

244
00:14:09.346 --> 00:14:10.846
It's you, Conan!

245
00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:15.046
Then, the girl who reported this to the police is...

246
00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:16.446
Me.

247
00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:19.746
We all came over to play at Noriya's cousin,

248
00:14:19.746 --> 00:14:22.146
Toshinari's home today.

249
00:14:22.146 --> 00:14:24.746
But, you're just as much a caller of Death yourself

250
00:14:24.746 --> 00:14:26.146
as Mr. Mouri, aren't you?

251
00:14:26.146 --> 00:14:28.946
You show up at murder sites one after the other.

252
00:14:29.946 --> 00:14:33.446
But, you sure got here quickly too, didn't you, Officer Sato?

253
00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:35.346
We got a call saying that the salesclerk

254
00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:40.646
at a florist near here resembled a suspect at large.

255
00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:43.246
It turned out to be a mistake though.

256
00:14:43.246 --> 00:14:45.846
We were coincidentally in this neighborhood

257
00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:49.046
so we were dispatched here!

258
00:14:49.046 --> 00:14:51.046
Well, if Officer Takagi didn't dilly-dally

259
00:14:51.046 --> 00:14:54.046
whispering to the salesclerk back then,

260
00:14:54.046 --> 00:14:55.646
we would've been able to leave much earlier, you see.

261
00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:59.646
We were nearby because we were having lunch, right?

262
00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:01.446
Were you talking about flowers?

263
00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:03.046
Are you going to give flowers to anyone?

264
00:15:03.046 --> 00:15:04.546
But, if you're giving them to Officer Sato

265
00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:06.546
you don't have to be secretive about it, do you?

266
00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:07.646
Flirting?

267
00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:11.446
-You think so too? -No way!

268
00:15:11.446 --> 00:15:13.446
Hey, by the way...

269
00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:16.846
If the victim died between 07:00 pm and 09:00 pm last night,

270
00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:19.946
why don't you ask Noriya or Toshinari about it?

271
00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:21.646
If they were in the room next door,

272
00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:24.846
they may have heard some suspicious noises or something.

273
00:15:24.846 --> 00:15:26.746
If at that time last night,

274
00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:29.346
I was watching TV with Toshinari!

275
00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.046
A Masked Yaiba movie was playing, you see.

276
00:15:32.046 --> 00:15:34.446
Oh, I was watching it too!

277
00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:37.746
Me too! It was really interesting!

278
00:15:37.746 --> 00:15:40.046
It was from 07:00 pm to 09:00 pm

279
00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:42.146
and it was the first TV premier!

280
00:15:42.146 --> 00:15:44.546
And, while you were watching it,

281
00:15:44.546 --> 00:15:47.346
didn't you hear any strange sounds or groans?

282
00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:51.446
No! Part way, the man next door pounded on the door yelling,

283
00:15:51.446 --> 00:15:53.946
to cut the noise down though...

284
00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:56.046
About what time was that?

285
00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:59.346
I think it was about 07:30.

286
00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:02.046
I apologized from behind the door

287
00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:03.846
and turned the volume down.

288
00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:08.746
Which means that Mr. Yasutomi was alive till then.

289
00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:10.946
Did you hear any strange sounds after that?

290
00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:12.046
Not that I'm aware of.

291
00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:14.746
Since Masked Yaiba is an action hero movie,

292
00:16:14.746 --> 00:16:18.446
people screaming and explosions were frequent,

293
00:16:18.446 --> 00:16:20.346
so even if there were any suspicious noises,

294
00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.146
I may not have noticed.

295
00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:24.946
Besides, the place where the corpse

296
00:16:24.946 --> 00:16:27.446
of the next door neighbor was found was in the kitchen by the sink,

297
00:16:27.446 --> 00:16:31.446
two rooms away from where we were watching TV.

298
00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:32.546
Now that you mentioned it,

299
00:16:32.546 --> 00:16:33.646
I saw the next door neighbor

300
00:16:33.646 --> 00:16:36.346
at a convenience store around sundown yesterday.

301
00:16:36.346 --> 00:16:38.446
Around what time was that?

302
00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:39.746
I'm not sure.

303
00:16:39.746 --> 00:16:43.246
It was when I went to buy packed food for dinner.

304
00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:45.646
I was bothered by the expiration date on the packed food

305
00:16:45.646 --> 00:16:49.046
and remembers asking Noriya what the date on it was.

306
00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:50.746
You asked the child the date?

307
00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:54.246
Yes! I was holding the shopping basket.

308
00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:57.546
The newspaper that we bought at the convenience store was inside it,

309
00:16:57.546 --> 00:17:01.646
so I told Toshinari that the date was August 13th!

310
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.546
That it was the day that Yaiba's movi e was going to be playing on TV!

311
00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:07.546
If it was the 13th, it's unmistakably yesterday.

312
00:17:07.546 --> 00:17:11.546
Was Mr. Yasutomi with someone back then?

313
00:17:11.546 --> 00:17:14.946
No, I think he was alone.

314
00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:16.746
Hey, Noriya.

315
00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:18.846
While you were watching the Yaiba movie,

316
00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.746
did Toshinari go to use the restroom or something?

317
00:17:21.746 --> 00:17:26.546
No, because I was watching leaning against Toshinari right through.

318
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.846
What did you do after you finished watching?

319
00:17:28.846 --> 00:17:31.446
The movie ended before 09:00 pm, didn't it?

320
00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:34.446
Yes! I went to take a pee right afterwards

321
00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:36.446
and resumed playing the game.

322
00:17:36.446 --> 00:17:39.946
Which means you were playing the game before that too?

323
00:17:39.946 --> 00:17:42.646
Yes! After coming back from the convenience store

324
00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.846
till the time when the movie began.

325
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:48.146
Then, Toshinari looked at his wristwatch and said,

326
00:17:48.146 --> 00:17:50.146
"Oh no!" It's already 07:00!

327
00:17:50.146 --> 00:17:53.546
Let's save it because the movie's going to start."

328
00:17:53.546 --> 00:17:55.146
So, we saved the game right away

329
00:17:55.146 --> 00:17:56.946
and switched to watching TV.

330
00:17:56.946 --> 00:18:00.346
We made it just as the movie was about to start!

331
00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.246
Then, after you finished watching the movie

332
00:18:02.246 --> 00:18:04.546
and while you were in the restroom,

333
00:18:04.546 --> 00:18:07.146
didn't Toshinari leave the room?

334
00:18:07.146 --> 00:18:08.946
No, besides, he asked me what snack I'd like to eat

335
00:18:08.946 --> 00:18:11.846
from outside the restroom too.

336
00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.646
Then, after that you both continued playing

337
00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:14.946
the game together right through?

338
00:18:14.946 --> 00:18:18.146
Right! We played until quite late,

339
00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:21.146
woke up early in the morning played again,

340
00:18:21.146 --> 00:18:24.846
then went to the convenience store to buy breakfast

341
00:18:24.846 --> 00:18:28.346
and played until around noon but,

342
00:18:28.346 --> 00:18:31.646
I got sleepy so I took a nap

343
00:18:31.646 --> 00:18:33.646
and resumed playing the game again

344
00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:34.946
after I got up. Then, we got hungry

345
00:18:34.946 --> 00:18:37.546
so we went to the convenience store again.

346
00:18:37.546 --> 00:18:39.846
And, that's where we met you!

347
00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:42.046
Nothing but playing games.

348
00:18:42.046 --> 00:18:44.446
That's why you ranked so high!

349
00:18:44.446 --> 00:18:45.946
How lucky!

350
00:18:45.946 --> 00:18:49.746
And? What did you have for lunch?

351
00:18:49.746 --> 00:18:52.746
I was eating snacks so I wasn't hungry at all!

352
00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:55.346
Eating snacks and playing the game right through.

353
00:18:55.346 --> 00:18:56.546
How lucky!

354
00:18:56.546 --> 00:18:58.146
It's heaven!

355
00:18:58.146 --> 00:18:59.746
Make sure you don't copy him.

356
00:19:00.846 --> 00:19:05.146
Which means you were with Toshinari right through today again?

357
00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:07.746
After eating breakfast,

358
00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.046
he told me that he had something to do and left,

359
00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:11.946
after telling me to stay put and keep playing.

360
00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:13.946
He also told me to play using the headset

361
00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:16.046
so that the man next door wouldn't come

362
00:19:16.046 --> 00:19:17.846
to complain of it being noisy again.

363
00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:20.146
Around what time was that?

364
00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:21.746
It was about...

365
00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:26.046
We went to the store to buy breakfast around 06:00 am,

366
00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:28.446
came home and ate it right away,

367
00:19:28.446 --> 00:19:30.746
so I think it was about 07:00 am.

368
00:19:30.746 --> 00:19:33.346
The clock behind the salesclerk of the convenience store indicated

369
00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.746
a little after 06:00 am, you see.

370
00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:38.746
What?

371
00:19:38.746 --> 00:19:41.346
Don't tell me that you suspect him?

372
00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:47.146
may I be excused to go back to my room already?

373
00:19:47.146 --> 00:19:51.146
I don't want to keep the children near the corpse any longer.

374
00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:52.846
I guess so.

375
00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:56.146
Just in case, I'd like to check the contents

376
00:19:56.146 --> 00:19:58.646
inside your trash bag, okay?

377
00:19:58.646 --> 00:20:01.146
Yes, go right ahead.

378
00:20:01.146 --> 00:20:03.346
That rear view.

379
00:20:03.346 --> 00:20:06.746
Weren't you at the florist a while ago?

380
00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:10.046
Yes, I did buy flowers.

381
00:20:10.046 --> 00:20:11.446
Just as I thought.

382
00:20:11.446 --> 00:20:13.146
When I asked the salesclerk there,

383
00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:17.846
what flower I should send when a wish was fulfilled,

384
00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:20.146
she suggested that I buy a fake dragonhead

385
00:20:20.146 --> 00:20:23.646
like the one the customer just before had purchased.

386
00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:27.646
I happened to see you leaving the shop!

387
00:20:27.646 --> 00:20:30.846
Then, something good happened to you, right, Officer Takagi?

388
00:20:30.846 --> 00:20:32.846
You won another ice cream or something?

389
00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:34.646
Come on, tell us.

390
00:20:34.646 --> 00:20:36.346
Oh, no.

391
00:20:36.346 --> 00:20:38.746
Please help me out.

392
00:20:38.746 --> 00:20:39.746
Why?

393
00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:42.346
I said I'd take full responsibility, didn't I?

394
00:20:42.346 --> 00:20:44.746
Oh that?

395
00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:49.146
Well, you are partly responsible too.

396
00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:52.746
So, it's only natural that you do.

397
00:20:52.746 --> 00:20:55.246
Yeah. Sort of.

398
00:20:55.246 --> 00:20:58.246
You bought those flowers too, didn't you?

399
00:20:58.246 --> 00:20:59.346
Yeah.

400
00:20:59.346 --> 00:21:01.346
If so...

401
00:21:01.346 --> 00:21:05.846
Did one of your wishes come true or something?

402
00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:07.946
Yeah.

403
00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:15.446
Then, shall we go to your room, Mr. Shiga?

404
00:21:15.446 --> 00:21:16.646
Okay.

405
00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:22.846
Officer Takagi?

406
00:21:22.846 --> 00:21:24.446
What is it, Conan?

407
00:21:24.446 --> 00:21:26.946
I've got something I want you to check for me.

408
00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:30.546
I was wondering if there was an accident or something

409
00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:32.446
because Toshinari was offering flowers

410
00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:35.146
on the road in front of the florist.

411
00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:36.546
Is that so?

412
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:39.446
Come on, stop dilly-dallying, Officer Takagi.

413
00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:41.246
Okay.

414
00:21:41.246 --> 00:21:42.346
Hurry up.

415
00:21:42.346 --> 00:21:44.546
You're being impulsive, Officer Sato.

416
00:21:44.546 --> 00:21:45.846
Go easy on me, please.

417
00:21:48.946 --> 00:21:53.146
He's probably the one who killed Mr. Yasutomi,

418
00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:56.846
Mr. Toshinari Shiga, no doubt about it.

419
00:21:56.846 --> 00:22:00.946
Besides, he's motive for killing is probably...

420
00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:04.446
But, the problem is his alibi

421
00:22:04.446 --> 00:22:08.046
August 13th, between 07:00 pm to 09:00 pm,

422
00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:10.246
the time when the crime was committed.

423
00:22:11.446 --> 00:22:15.246
The alibi that he was by Noriya right through.

424
00:22:15.246 --> 00:22:16.946
Darn.

425
00:22:17.946 --> 00:22:21.246
How on earth did he kill Mr. Yasutomi?

426
00:22:24.246 --> 00:22:25.746
And?

427
00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:30.146
Officer Takagi. Did something good happen?

428
00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:31.246
Yes?

429
00:23:53.646 --> 00:23:57.446
What is it? This sinister atmosphere?

430
00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:01.146
The fact is...

431
00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:05.246
Motherly instinct is growing in Officer Sato?

432
00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:08.446
The Yaiba movie you saw last night...

433
00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.146
Yeah, that's right!

434
00:24:10.146 --> 00:24:13.946
I watched it and holding back wanting to go pee!

435
00:24:13.946 --> 00:24:16.146
Just as I thought...

436
00:24:16.146 --> 00:24:17.446
Next Conan,

437
00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:21.346
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Truth)"

438
00:24:36.946 --> 00:24:39.446
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:39.446 --> 00:24:41.746
"Newspaper".

440
00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:42.946
Summer time is...

441
00:24:42.946 --> 00:24:44.046
-A time for games. -A time for candies.

442
00:24:44.046 --> 00:24:46.346
-A time for taking afternoon naps. -A time to play outside!
