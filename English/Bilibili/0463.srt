1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,699
Trump!

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,899
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,399
The presence of the Black Organization is uncomfortably felt.

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,699
Solve the mystery of the shiny hammer,

5
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:09,299
and bring the case out in the light!

6
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:10,599
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,199
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:01,811
A father and son comes to the Mouri Detective Agency.

10
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:05,411
The son, Takumi, witnessed a body being thrown into the Teimusu River

11
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:08,511
from the bridge on the way to visit a shrine on New Year's day.

12
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,211
Moreover, he said that there's nail drawing on the arm of the culprit.

13
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:17,811
He also mentioned that he saw a big shiny hammer near the site.

14
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,211
And the dead body of a popular musician

15
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:28,711
named Roku Itagaki is found in the river.

16
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:37,211
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Queer Lightning"

17
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,211
This is the New Haido Bridge.

18
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,911
The bridge on the other side of this bridge is Central Haido Bridge.

19
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:46,311
And the one beyond it is Big Haido Bridge.

20
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,011
How about it, Takumi?

21
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,211
Do you remember anything?

22
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,511
Nope.

23
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,211
You can at least tell us

24
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:57,811
where the guy who threw the bag with the body inside was, right?

25
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,611
I don't remember.

26
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,511
Did you see fireworks behind him, then?

27
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:07,811
If I'm not mistaken, that firework...

28
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:13,511
was supposed to have been shot up from this side,

29
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,211
so I thought that he could tell us where the fireworks went up.

30
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,611
We could tell which side the suspicious man was.

31
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,311
How about it, Takumi?

32
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,711
Fireworks?

33
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,211
I see!

34
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,211
Maybe...

35
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,711
The big hammer that Takumi saw

36
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,011
was the fireworks reflected on the surface of the water?

37
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,211
-Huh? -You know,

38
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:39,311
when fireworks go up, they create a tail of light

39
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,011
and that probably looked like the handle of a hammer to you.

40
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:44,211
But...

41
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:47,011
Then it's not the tip of a hammer.

42
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:50,811
The most fireworks would look like is a tadpole,

43
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:52,211
and even if it disperses,

44
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,811
it would look more like a frying pan than a hammer, wouldn't it?

45
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,011
I see.

46
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,511
Hey.

47
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,711
I didn't see any fireworks.

48
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,111
I heard the sound but I couldn't see it.

49
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,911
Which means the suspicious guy

50
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,111
was on the side where the fireworks didn't go up?

51
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:12,011
I hate to butt in, but I wouldn't be too sure about that.

52
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,611
Huh?

53
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,511
That day,

54
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:18,411
Takumi was sitting in the backseat,

55
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,011
but both lanes were crowded.

56
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,811
I was in the center lane.

57
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,911
So the window of my car was blocked by the car next to us.

58
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,611
That's why he may have been at an angle where he couldn't see it.

59
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:33,511
I guess we'll have to go on to the next bridge then.

60
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,311
This is the Central Haido Bridge,

61
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,111
which is in the center of the two other bridges.

62
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,811
Anything that comes to mind is a clue.

63
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,311
Yes, yes.

64
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,911
Hello.

65
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,811
Sonoko. What?

66
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,411
Ran, did you hear about it?

67
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,411
About what?

68
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,711
What? What do you mean by that?

69
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,511
Roku! Roku died!

70
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,311
Yes, I saw it on the news a while ago.

71
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,011
It seems he can't remember for now,

72
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:16,611
so shall we keep the shiny hammer on hold for a while?

73
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:17,811
Okay, okay.

74
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:18,911
I guess we have no choice

75
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,311
-but to search for those with a nail tattoo on his arm. -Sonoko, don't cry.

76
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,011
But unlike in the past,

77
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:28,411
tattoos have become a part of fashion nowadays, so many people have them.

78
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,811
Hey, Sonoko.

79
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:33,511
Does Roku Itagaki have anything to do with a nail?

80
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:37,111
Yes, a drawing of a nail that looks sort of grotesque.

81
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,211
What?

82
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,811
Sonoko, can you say that again please?

83
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:47,211
Like I told you, it's the logo for his old indies band, Nail Snake.

84
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:50,411
It is a snake with its head pierced through with a nail.

85
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,211
Do you know anybody that is wearing a tattoo of that logo?

86
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:55,311
There are many.

87
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:59,711
There seems to be a tattoo shop that is also a fan shop of the band.

88
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:03,911
So if you're a fan and want a tattoo, that's the place to go.

89
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:08,111
I'm sure that shop was somewhere near Central Haido Bridge.

90
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,811
Huh? Ran?

91
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,011
Ran?

92
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,211
Hey.

93
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,811
No!

94
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,811
This isn't the drawing that I saw!

95
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,311
Are you sure it's not this drawing?

96
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:24,211
It's true that this drawing isn't a grotesque drawing of a nail.

97
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:26,111
That logo of the band,

98
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,011
has it been changed to a new one?

99
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,511
Huh?

100
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,611
Look!

101
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:34,011
The thumb tack on the lower right that holds the flag in place isn't there.

102
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,511
You were just about to put a new one on, right?

103
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:39,011
Besides, there is a part of the wall that isn't discoloured

104
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:41,011
because it was overshadowed by that flag.

105
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,811
There are also places on other parts of the wall

106
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,511
that aren't discoloured, too.

107
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:48,011
So I thought maybe there must've been something there

108
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,911
that was recently removed.

109
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,811
I'm amazed you noticed, sonny.

110
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,511
That's right.

111
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,811
This is the new logo.

112
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,611
It won't be official until next week.

113
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:01,711
It's this drawing!

114
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,911
I saw this drawing on his arm!

115
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:07,111
Have you given this tattoo to anyone yet?

116
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,711
Huh? Yeah.

117
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:12,811
Some hardcore fans heard about the logo change.

118
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:17,011
They insisted on having the new logo tattoo.

119
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,211
Here it is.

120
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:21,511
Look. It was these three.

121
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,711
From the right, Mr. Kiritani,

122
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,911
Mr. Yasui,

123
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,011
and Mr. Kannai, I think.

124
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:32,311
The customers who get tattooed send us their pictures later.

125
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:36,711
Takumi, do any of these men look familiar?

126
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:40,511
It was dark and he was wearing a hat, so I can't tell.

127
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:46,111
But I saw the nail as he was getting into his car, which was nearby.

128
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:47,911
Car?

129
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:50,611
Does the person in the middle owns the foreign car

130
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,111
that he's leaning against?

131
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:56,111
Yes. I think he said that he's been riding it for 10 years.

132
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:58,711
Hey, wasn't it this car?

133
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,811
It's black, too.

134
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,611
I can't tell.

135
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:05,811
What about the cap that the person to the right is wearing?

136
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,411
It wasn't that kind of hat.

137
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,811
Hey, why did they decide to change the logo?

138
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:17,411
Actually, this logo was designed by Roku, who debuted as a soloist.

139
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:21,511
It seems that many fans requested the logo to change.

140
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:24,211
Because of what happened to Roku,

141
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:27,911
Nail Snake is going to hold a memorial live performance tonight.

142
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:31,511
Despite all kinds of things happening, Roku was the leader's best friend.

143
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:36,311
The person behind this person is...

144
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:42,511
Yoko Okino.

145
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,911
I mean the thing that she's holding

146
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,511
is the pot I was talking about this afternoon

147
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:48,911
that you can get from buying the drip type coffee.

148
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,311
So Yoko was the one advertising it.

149
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:57,511
You didn't even see the commercial so how did you find out about it?

150
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,711
Well...

151
00:09:00,411 --> 00:09:02,111
It's because of this.

152
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:04,311
The advertisement vehicle.

153
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,311
It was so cute that I took a picture of it with my cell phone.

154
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:09,811
Wait a second.

155
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,711
If there's an advertisement vehicle for the pot, maybe...

156
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,511
No, there couldn't be.

157
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,711
May I have a look at it, too?

158
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:19,711
Sure.

159
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,211
But it really is a cute coffee pot.

160
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:33,711
I'm sorry. I think I mistakenly pushed the wrong button.

161
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,011
No problem, really.

162
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:42,111
And here we are at Big Haido Bridge, the last bridge.

163
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:44,711
I guess you don't remember anything, right?

164
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,511
About which bridge you saw that suspicious man on.

165
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:52,911
Let's go to the police.

166
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:09,511
There are some things Takumi said that are incomprehensible,

167
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,411
but it seems that he's telling the truth.

168
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:16,911
But I'm sure the police will question him persistently

169
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:19,111
about the shiny hammer and all.

170
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,911
I see. So that's the story.

171
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,211
I've figured out

172
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:53,911
who put Roku Itagaki in the bag and threw him in the river.

173
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,161
But I really saw it!

174
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:21,561
A big shiny hammer.

175
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:22,961
You know what, kiddo?

176
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,761
I think he's talking about a dream that he had.

177
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,161
A dream?

178
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:28,561
It's not a dream!

179
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,061
The part about Mr. Itagaki being thrown in the river

180
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:32,961
was probably a coincidence.

181
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,961
But about him having seen Mr. Itagaki's face from inside the bag,

182
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,161
and the thing about the nail tattoo on the arm

183
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,161
were all probably what he dreamt, too.

184
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:43,761
Back then, it was about this dark, right?

185
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:46,861
You can't see a person's face or a tattoo.

186
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,961
I guess not.

187
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,861
Wait.

188
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,761
Maybe it's the fireworks?

189
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:56,761
He saw a lot of things because the place was lit up by the fireworks.

190
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:59,761
It seems that the fireworks were shot up at the start of the New Year.

191
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,561
Which means that the suspect was on the other side,

192
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:07,161
where you could see the fireworks.

193
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,661
If he was on the side where the fireworks went up,

194
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,061
it wouldn't be too easy to see that tattoo

195
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:14,161
because it would be overshadowed by backlight.

196
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,461
I see.

197
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:18,361
But if he was on the other side of the bridge,

198
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,561
he would be able to see the face that stuck out of the bag.

199
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,861
I don't think he'd be able to make out the tattoo drawing on the arm.

200
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:26,161
Even if the car Takumi was riding was in the middle lane,

201
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:29,161
it'd still be hard to see the handrail.

202
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:32,261
So how could he see the man's arm?

203
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:37,161
I told you, I saw it because the car's driver side window was down.

204
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:39,861
That means you saw the tattoo on the man's arm

205
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:44,561
when the man got in his car, right?

206
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:46,561
But he would've had to sit in the driver's seat.

207
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:48,961
If so, I don't think that you could've seen the tattoo.

208
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,761
But I saw it.

209
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:52,161
Maybe...

210
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:56,061
the man had his arm out of the driver's window?

211
00:12:56,061 --> 00:13:00,561
Wait! That means that his tattoo is on his right arm.

212
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:01,861
If the car was in the other lane,

213
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,861
the car would be facing right if looking from this side.

214
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,661
His right arm can't be seen.

215
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,461
Okay, let's go to the tattoo shop that we went earlier

216
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:11,061
and have them show us the picture again.

217
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:12,361
I don't think we can.

218
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,661
Because they said they would be closing at 18:00 today

219
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,261
to go to a memorial live performance.

220
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:20,561
Hey...

221
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:22,061
Maybe...

222
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,961
there's a snapshot of them on your cell phone, Ran?

223
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,861
Right, Eisuke?

224
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,761
I found it! It's here!

225
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:40,561
I don't remember taking a picture like this though.

226
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,261
Well,

227
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:44,961
when I mistakenly pushed the button,

228
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,361
I guess I took it coincidentally.

229
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:48,461
Well, I guess it was an unexpected success born of failure.

230
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,361
Thanks to this picture,

231
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:54,261
the guy to the left with the tattoo on his left arm is ruled out,

232
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:56,161
so the culprit's been narrowed down to the guy on the right

233
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,361
and the one in the middle.

234
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,761
The culprit was riding his car, right?

235
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:04,061
So the person with his car in the picture is the most suspicious.

236
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,061
Idiot.

237
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,861
The guy to the right may be riding it, too.

238
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:12,261
But the sales clerk said he's been driving foreign cars for 10 years.

239
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:15,361
That's more the reason why the guy in the middle could be a car lover,

240
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,061
driving around in a foreign car and...

241
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,661
A foreign car?

242
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,561
The steering wheel of a foreign car is on the left.

243
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,461
That means if he had a foreign car, the wheel would be on the left.

244
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,961
The inside is dark so it cannot be seen from this side.

245
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:31,061
Ran, give that to me.

246
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:34,861
But he could've rented a Japanese car on that day.

247
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:35,861
No.

248
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:39,861
If he rented a car, he would've rented a foreign car.

249
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,061
Because everything would go to waste if he gets into an accident

250
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,761
while driving a car with the steering wheel that he's not used to

251
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:47,261
when transporting the corpse.

252
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,661
So the culprit is?

253
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:53,261
Yeah. The guy to the right, the one wearing the cap.

254
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:55,161
If I remember correctly, his name is Kiritani.

255
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,861
Let's report it to the police right away and have him arrested.

256
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,761
No. It's still impossible to get him arrested.

257
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:02,861
Everything we've come up with till now is just circumstantial evidence.

258
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,361
We don't have any conclusive evidence yet.

259
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,761
But with all that we have,

260
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:11,361
the police could take him to the station and interrogate him.

261
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,561
Possibly making him confess.

262
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,261
After all, there's Takumi's testimony, too.

263
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:18,061
However,

264
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:20,461
he shouldn't say anything about the shiny hammer.

265
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,061
Yes, I understand.

266
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,061
But I...

267
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:26,261
I really saw it!

268
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:27,461
Takumi.

269
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,161
Hey.

270
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,661
Maybe he's talking about this building?

271
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:34,161
Look. The lights on both sides of the elevator connects

272
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:37,361
and it looks like the handle of a hammer.

273
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,661
Hey, like I've been saying, unless there's the tip of the hammer,

274
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,261
it doesn't look like one.

275
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:45,261
What did the tip of a hammer look like?

276
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,661
I guess there are all kinds.

277
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,061
Cylindrical ones,

278
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,061
ones with nail removers on one side that look like an upside down boat.

279
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,361
Talking of upside down,

280
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,661
there may be ones that are inflated in the middle

281
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:59,861
that kind of looks like a pot turned upside down.

282
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,061
-Pot! -Pot!

283
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,361
Come to think of it...

284
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,161
Just as I thought. Look!

285
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:10,461
There are decorative lights around the pot.

286
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:13,261
Which means that the hammer was upside down, right?

287
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:18,161
What Takumi saw was the decorative lights on the advertisement vehicle

288
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,761
and elevator light overlapping each other,

289
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,361
resulting in what resembled a large hammer.

290
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:24,961
So you weren't dreaming after all.

291
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,261
I'm sorry, Takumi.

292
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:27,261
It's okay.

293
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:30,461
Why didn't he say it was upside down in the first place?

294
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:34,261
But the fireworks went up on this side, right?

295
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:37,461
If the culprit was on the side opposite the fireworks,

296
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,661
I don't think Takumi could've seen the building in question.

297
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:44,061
It's true that it doesn't look that way from this bridge,

298
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:48,861
but he can see it from Central Haido Bridge that is between that building.

299
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,461
Which means that the culprit threw the bag with the dead body inside

300
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,161
from Central Haido Bridge.

301
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,561
Yeah, most probably.

302
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,361
We'll probably be able to find some evidence over there.

303
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,061
Over there?

304
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,361
The elevator of that building is round and protruded.

305
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,961
In order for the light on the other side to come into view

306
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,661
and become two beams of light,

307
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:08,961
you've got to move along a bit.

308
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,461
But then if you move too much,

309
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:14,061
the pot will look too backwards that it won't look like a hammer.

310
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:17,961
So you have to be at a specific place to see a perfect glowing hammer.

311
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,361
So if we match all this,

312
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:22,361
the place where the culprit dropped the bag with the corpse inside

313
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,461
can more or less be specified.

314
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,461
But what kind of evidence could there be?

315
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:27,661
Probably...

316
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,561
If the culprit threw the lighter away,

317
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,161
the fingerprints of the culprit may at least be found on the lighter.

318
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:37,261
He may have been wearing gloves when he dropped the bag,

319
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,961
but if he drove off soon after he threw the lighter away,

320
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:42,061
I'm sure he took them off.

321
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,861
Since the tattoo was near his wrist,

322
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:48,261
Takumi couldn't see the nail tattoo if the culprit was wearing gloves.

323
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:51,661
Maybe he's at Roku's memorial live?

324
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:55,561
It could be, but we've got to find the evidence before we...

325
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:56,861
You know,

326
00:17:56,861 --> 00:18:01,061
I've thought up an interesting way to make the culprit confess right away.

327
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,361
So the final song for today

328
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:10,361
is the song that my best friend, Roku, loved the most.

329
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,961
Just what do you think you're doing?

330
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:30,761
This is a parking lot, you know!

331
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:33,361
It'll be a disaster if the flames touch the cars.

332
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,061
Oh, just some kid.

333
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,261
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

334
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,361
I'm very sorry,

335
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:43,161
but I'd like to ask you to come with us for questioning.

336
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,461
Why?

337
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,561
We've got a witness saying that somebody who resembled you

338
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:51,861
threw a bag with a dead body inside from Central Haido Bridge.

339
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,561
He's watching you from the car on the other side

340
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,761
and he said that he's certain you're the one.

341
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,361
You mean he's saying he saw my face?

342
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:01,161
No, he didn't see your face.

343
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:04,861
He saw that tattoo of yours.

344
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:05,961
What?

345
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:09,261
And he also says he heard your voice.

346
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:11,961
Huh? The guy must be lying.

347
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:14,061
He couldn't have heard my voice

348
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,561
because there were fireworks at that time.

349
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,161
He couldn't have heard you because of the fireworks?

350
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,961
Officer Takagi, you heard him just now, didn't you?

351
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,161
Yes, sir! I definitely heard him!

352
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,861
The fact that there were fireworks shot up

353
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,661
is something that only the culprit and witness know.

354
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:33,561
We'd like you to explain at the station

355
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,361
why you made such a remark just now.

356
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:39,161
Don't tell me that you guys set up the fireworks just now, too?

357
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:40,861
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,261
We recreated the circumstances of what happened that day

359
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:46,461
and pretended to show you to the witness,

360
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:50,461
but we just wanted you to recall the events of that day,

361
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:54,661
to make you say the word "fireworks" from your side.

362
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,261
Well, setting up something as simple as this,

363
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,561
can only be thought up by a brat, though.

364
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,761
After that, Mr. Kiritani was taken to the station

365
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,461
and confessed without resisting.

366
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:11,161
His motive was a grudge he held against Mr. Itagaki

367
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,961
for betraying the band and debuting alone.

368
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:17,261
He firstly intended to dispose the corpse in a mountain some distance away,

369
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:18,961
but he noticed that the police

370
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,461
were checking for drunk driving on Central Haido Bridge

371
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,361
and decided instantly to throw the corpse over the bridge.

372
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,661
By the way, the thing he threw down from the bridge

373
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,961
was Roku's lighter after all.

374
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:34,561
In order to hide the blood that splattered on him while hitting Roku,

375
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:37,961
he seems to have worn Roku's jacket that was in the room.

376
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:38,961
When he disposed the corpse,

377
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:42,261
he absentmindedly used Roku's lighter that was in the jacket.

378
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,661
The lighter was also found in Teimusu River.

379
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:52,961
With Takumi's testimony, Mr. Kiritani is sure to be arrested, too.

380
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,761
With this in mind, we finished interrogation and head for home.

381
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:00,661
Today was really exciting!

382
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:04,561
After all, I was able to work and solve the case

383
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,761
where a famous person was killed.

384
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,161
No, no.

385
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:10,161
I bet you've disclosed various kinds of cases

386
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,561
involving famous people.

387
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:15,461
Or at least cases about them, right?

388
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:17,161
Of course.

389
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:20,161
Yoko Okino asked me to work for her several times.

390
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:22,461
What? You mean that top idol?

391
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:24,061
You're indeed a renown detective, aren't you?

392
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,361
I guess so.

393
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:29,361
Then I bet there have been cases with famous people that didn't go public.

394
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:34,161
You know, when a famous person comes to you in secret.

395
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,061
And you solve the case

396
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:40,961
even before it makes the news.

397
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,161
I wonder if I have ever handled a case like that?

398
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,161
What? Come on.

399
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:49,661
Please tell me without being bashful, Detective Mouri.

400
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:57,161
If it's okay with you, we can talk about it over dinner from now.

401
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,861
I'm feeling pretty sleepy.

402
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:05,161
I'm sorry, Eisuke. Can we make it some other day?

403
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:07,061
It seems that Conan's tired.

404
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:08,661
Okay.

405
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,661
No doubt about it.

406
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:15,361
There was someone recently, too.

407
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:16,761
Let's see...

408
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,561
You know, they were on TV a lot,

409
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:22,961
but is taking a rest and now they don't appear anymore.

410
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,161
This guy is trying to get information...

411
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,261
on Rena Mizunashi.

412
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:34,161
I can't be showing you our cards that easily.

413
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:38,861
So long as you keep your cards covered.

414
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:06,961
"Next Episode" -What? A case?

415
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,161
Toriya Town?

416
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,561
The boy back then...

417
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,061
No doubt about it.

418
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:20,361
Which means...

419
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:23,861
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

420
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:30,961
Next Conan,

421
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:34,761
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Mysterious Hefty Reward"

422
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,761
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,961
"The Red-headed League"

424
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,361
I love Holmes!

425
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,761
You're just like a certain Holmes freak that I know.

426
00:24:58,761 --> 00:24:59,861
That's true.
