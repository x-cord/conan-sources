1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,970
This is it.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,770
"Kagami Studio" -This is amazing!

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,170
Shall we go?

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,670
Good work.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,470
Good work.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,570
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,070
Genta.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,570
Sorry.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,970
Are they coming to see the studio on their day off?

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,070
Mr. Agasa requested a tour for the kids.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,870
So they're our future regulars.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,070
If this place lasts that long.

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,370
Are we really in trouble?

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,370
Have you heard something?

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,470
Well, I heard a top-class corporation

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,070
called dibs on the place.

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,770
It's just a rumor, though.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,370
In my eyes are maximum creation.

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,170
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,870
The security guards' anxious conversation

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,070
leads to some toy-related crime!

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,370
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:56,211 --> 00:03:01,911
"The Killer Fist of Talos (Part 1)"

26
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:04,411
I've been waiting for you.

27
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,911
Sorry to trouble you, Ms. Shinobu.

28
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,111
"Shinobu Kagami (23), President's Daughter, Secretary" -Well...

29
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:13,111
The president said he wanted to speak with you.

30
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,211
It must be about the plan we discussed the other day.

31
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,711
What did that...

32
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,211
Oh, excuse me.

33
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:23,011
What did your father say?

34
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,311
I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask him yourself.

35
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,411
He's in his office.

36
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,811
I'll show the rest of you around.

37
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,911
Thank you. Please do.

38
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,011
I will.

39
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:45,611
That dome over there is for tours.

40
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,811
It's big.

41
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,111
The children must love it.

42
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,211
Unfortunately, it's designed for professionals.

43
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,811
It's for requests for event characters and modeling.

44
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,811
You can take all the pictures you want.

45
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:00,911
Really?

46
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,611
In that case, say cheese.

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,811
No... You can't take pictures of me.

48
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,011
-She must be shy. -Yeah.

49
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,611
Geez...

50
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:16,811
But what if another company copies your figures?

51
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,711
Yeah. You should watch out for corporate spies.

52
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,211
Yeah. You don't want any bad supplies.

53
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,011
-Genta. -Genta...

54
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,311
Don't worry.

55
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,411
We check everyone's identity and possessions

56
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,411
before taking them on tours.

57
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:36,111
Besides, it's not that easy to get inside the studio.

58
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:38,711
Really?

59
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,611
Come in.

60
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,311
First!

61
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,811
Is this...

62
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:51,311
It's a goblin, like the ones that appear in Western stories.

63
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,811
They're mischievous little imps.

64
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:57,211
This is the Greek mythological ship, Argo.

65
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,811
Heroes like Perseus and Orpheus,

66
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:03,211
who became constellations, rode on this ship.

67
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,011
You sure are knowledgeable.

68
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,711
-This is cool! -This is cool!

69
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,011
It's like a dreamland.

70
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,711
It's Sun Wukong!

71
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:21,811
That's right. He's riding the Jindou cloud.

72
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:24,811
He appears in China's "Journey to the West."

73
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,711
What a beautiful ship.

74
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,611
That's the floating boat in the sky.

75
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,711
It's a legendary flying ship

76
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:40,011
that appears in Japanese mythology.

77
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,311
It's facing this way.

78
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,911
Despite its appearance,

79
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:00,211
it's made of fiberglass, so it's light.

80
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,411
Really?

81
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,911
It doesn't seem that way at all.

82
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:06,711
You can control its position and orientation?

83
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,911
Yes, easily.

84
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,611
With this single remote,

85
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,111
you can control all the facilities

86
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:15,111
and even the security in the dome.

87
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:18,311
It would be terrible if it broke.

88
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,211
If the remote detects any shocks or malfunctions,

89
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:25,111
control switches to the control room

90
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,011
inside the dome.

91
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,211
When control switches over,

92
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:31,611
the power inside the dome goes out for a second,

93
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:33,311
but it's safe.

94
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,111
As long as there's nothing wrong with the remote,

95
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:37,411
control switches back to it.

96
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,611
It's a mandragora!

97
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,611
People die if they hear its voice!

98
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,711
It's incredible!

99
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:51,711
Isn't that the roc?

100
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,811
Yeah, from "The Adventures of Sinbad".

101
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,211
The Garuda?

102
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:00,011
They've even got Indian mythological creatures.

103
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,611
It's the bronze giant.

104
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:16,211
-Talos! -Talos!

105
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,011
You kids sure are knowledgeable.

106
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:30,611
There aren't many adults who know who he is.

107
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,411
We're brimming with curiosity.

108
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,611
We're even part of the Youth Detective Squad.

109
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:38,511
Talos moves even though he's so big.

110
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,511
That's right.

111
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:41,411
We only move Talos and the floating boat

112
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:44,611
for special occasions.

113
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:47,311
Talos in particular took an incredible amount of effort.

114
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:51,011
His fists and arms alone were redone countless times.

115
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:56,311
Make Talos stand up.

116
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,011
I bet that's amazing.

117
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,411
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,111
He's not finished from the legs down.

119
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,611
What? When is he going to be finished?

120
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,411
Well...

121
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:12,211
Unfortunately, he'll never be finished.

122
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:15,711
"Tadashi Hanyu (25)" -We wouldn't want to get people's hopes up.

123
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,811
Honestly, it's quite difficult to build the entire body

124
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,511
of something that large.

125
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:23,011
Because it's too expensive?

126
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:26,111
Children these days are so smart.

127
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,711
I wish Mr. Yamagata could've heard that.

128
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,711
Mr. Hanyu!

129
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,811
Who's Yamagata?

130
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:38,811
"Tokuichi Yamagata (35)" -Let's not talk about that anymore,

131
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,411
Mr. Hanyu.

132
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:44,711
Didn't we decide that we'd leave it up to the president?

133
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:47,111
That's easy for you to say

134
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,911
but as the one holding the company's purse strings,

135
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,911
I'll never agree to it.

136
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,811
Hey...

137
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:03,011
It's true that Talos was expensive,

138
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:06,511
but without having legs will kill him.

139
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,311
Do you kids know the story of Talos' heel?

140
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:11,311
-Yeah! -Yeah!

141
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,511
The only weakness of the bronze automaton Talos,

142
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:19,311
who protected the island of Crete in Greek mythology,

143
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:22,011
was his heel, right?

144
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,511
That's right.

145
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,611
Well, Mr. Hanyu?

146
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,911
For Talos to truly be Talos,

147
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:31,411
he needs legs.

148
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:38,911
The Talos you saw is too big to leave the dome,

149
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,311
but look...

150
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:44,611
By breaking him down into parts and transporting them,

151
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:46,711
the bronze giant Talos can appear

152
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,311
before audiences around the world.

153
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,011
Look at this!

154
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,111
It's really light!

155
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:57,611
What are you doing, Genta?

156
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,311
Put it back where you found it!

157
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:01,211
What if you break it?

158
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:03,211
It's important!

159
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,811
Go on. Apologize.

160
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,111
Sorry.

161
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:10,511
It's fine.

162
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:14,511
You're free to look at and touch everything in here.

163
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:16,711
Really?

164
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,011
Yes.

165
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,811
-All right! -All right!

166
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:23,911
It even looks like bronze up close.

167
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,711
It looks so heavy.

168
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:29,511
I hope we get to see the completed Talos soon.

169
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:32,611
I'm so excited.

170
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,111
Mr. Yamagata.

171
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,211
Yeah. We were right.

172
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:41,111
Your sense of professional self-satisfaction won't fix the problem.

173
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:43,611
Whether we live or die

174
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:45,711
is a matter of business.

175
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,911
Then we should be investing in our future!

176
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:52,011
Under current circumstances, our company has no future.

177
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,511
That's enough, you two.

178
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:58,211
It's not that easy a matter to compromise, Ms. Shinobu.

179
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:59,311
What?

180
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,811
This day...

181
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,211
No, every second is important.

182
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:06,611
In that regard, we agree.

183
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:11,011
Fine. Let's go get the president's decision now.

184
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,911
Don't go bringing your family's hobby

185
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,711
into my business.

186
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:17,311
Tadashi!

187
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,811
Sorry.

188
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:33,711
Was it just a hobby?

189
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:46,111
"President's Office" -I'll say it again!

190
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,411
I'm rejecting your plan!

191
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:49,711
Do you understand?

192
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,011
No!

193
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,611
"Eizo Kagami (58)" -Ms. Shinobu placed the order.

194
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,311
She asked me to design Talos' driving system

195
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:57,911
as cheaply as possible.

196
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,011
What?

197
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,311
I wracked my brains

198
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,811
because I understood your daughter's suffering.

199
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:06,211
How can you say that without hearing me out?

200
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,311
You've lost your humanity.

201
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:13,011
You've gone too far.

202
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:14,811
Why shouldn't I?

203
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:16,511
Because of your cowardice,

204
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,411
Mr. Yamagata will never be able to show off his talents.

205
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:23,111
You're not an employee. You've no right to talk.

206
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,911
I employed Yamagata's father.

207
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,111
If he doesn't stop showing off his talents,

208
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,611
the company won't last.

209
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,611
Doesn't this studio exist

210
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:36,611
because of Mr. Yamagata's talent?

211
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,911
You don't know anything.

212
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,711
My company's been in the red

213
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,311
since his father worked here.

214
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,811
No way...

215
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,711
That can't be...

216
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:58,278
"President's Office"

217
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,878
I'm out of time.

218
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,478
Wait, Kagami.

219
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,778
What's this?

220
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:22,578
Dr. Agasa's meeting sure is taking a long time.

221
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:24,878
You're right. He's late.

222
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:27,478
If he's not coming, I'm eating his food.

223
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,278
That's right.

224
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:33,978
The rumors about the company being sold are true.

225
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:37,478
The president is acting without telling Mr. Yamagata.

226
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:40,978
I've been talking to other companies

227
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:43,478
but it's not going well.

228
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:45,478
I see.

229
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:49,278
Our top priority is keeping the Kagami name,

230
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,878
but that's become difficult.

231
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:54,178
It's been around since the Edo Period.

232
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,178
I'm sure my father can't stand

233
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:59,878
to let it fail in his generation.

234
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:02,778
They said they'd consider it

235
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:05,478
if we had a special plan in place.

236
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,378
What's wrong, Ran?

237
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:12,878
I feel like I recognize Mr. Hanyu...

238
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:14,278
That's it.

239
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:16,578
He was at a Suzuki family party.

240
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,778
Sonoko loved him.

241
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,478
Her uncle seemed happy about it, too.

242
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,578
That can't be good.

243
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,378
Doesn't she have Kyogoku?

244
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,178
We're talking about Sonoko.

245
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:32,578
She was just excited to talk to a handsome man.

246
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,478
Well, I guess that's nothing new.

247
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:38,178
The buyer you're talking about

248
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,178
is the Suzuki Financial Group, isn't it?

249
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:42,078
You knew?

250
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,878
A classmate said she saw you at a Suzuki family party.

251
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:50,378
She said you were dancing with their daughter all night.

252
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:54,678
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki took a strange liking to me.

253
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,978
Isn't she young and pretty?

254
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,778
Not as much as you.

255
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:08,878
Those two are in love.

256
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:12,578
There's no room for Sonoko.

257
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,678
In any case, I need a plan

258
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:17,178
to present them to seal the deal.

259
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,778
That's the feeling I got, but...

260
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:23,178
If only you could ask Mr. Yamagata for help.

261
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:26,278
"Future dreams for children!" -I was a little too hard on him earlier.

262
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:30,878
I'm stuffed.

263
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:33,678
Mitsuhiko, where's the washroom?

264
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:36,178
I think I saw one around there.

265
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,578
I see. Around there, huh?

266
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:41,178
Around there...

267
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,478
Where are you going?

268
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:43,978
Around there.

269
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,578
They've got snacks.

270
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:50,878
I really need to go.

271
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:53,078
Around there...

272
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:58,378
Sir, my kids are young.

273
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:00,278
What if the company goes under?

274
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:05,178
This place does pay better than other companies.

275
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:09,378
Why is a company as clean as ours going under?

276
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:10,778
Who knows?

277
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:13,778
Maybe that's just how the world works.

278
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,178
This doorknob is broken.

279
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:26,578
It won't lock?

280
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,878
This isn't good.

281
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,478
Let's make sure it gets fixed immediately.

282
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:31,678
Got it.

283
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:49,178
That was close.

284
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,878
I almost wet myself.

285
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:01,778
Is someone there?

286
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,178
It's broken.

287
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,978
How careless.

288
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:18,978
We don't want any bad supplies getting in.

289
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:20,978
That should do it.

290
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:25,378
You're back?

291
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,078
You seem down.

292
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,178
Where have you been?

293
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,478
I was looking for the washroom.

294
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:33,578
The washroom's right there.

295
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:35,378
Oh, no!

296
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,678
Anyway, Dr. Agasa, I'm sorry.

297
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:40,278
For what?

298
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:43,178
I ate your food.

299
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,478
But I left your dessert.

300
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:48,678
Really? Then you can have my dessert, too.

301
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:49,978
Really?

302
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,278
Thanks for the food!

303
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:57,278
Children are so energetic.

304
00:17:57,278 --> 00:18:00,078
Sounds like your plan was rejected.

305
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:03,678
The company doesn't have time for it right now.

306
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,478
What's happening?

307
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:06,978
They're selling.

308
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:09,778
What? They're selling?

309
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:11,378
They've steeled their resolve.

310
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:14,678
The president's set his focus overseas.

311
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,578
What a waste.

312
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,078
The company's technology and designs

313
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,378
have an established reputation here.

314
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,678
You can spend all the money you want building good products,

315
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,778
but if they don't sell, it's over.

316
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:27,578
It's ironic.

317
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:31,978
Their exceptional technology has become a burden for them.

318
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,678
We had a shouting match like the old days,

319
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,778
but that was the end of it.

320
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,178
It's a harsh world.

321
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,178
Wait.

322
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:42,178
Tadashi, where are you going?

323
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:45,278
I'm going to ask the president how negotiations are going.

324
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:52,478
"President's Office" -Get your boss on the phone immediately.

325
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:57,378
Tell him that Kagami has finally made his decision.

326
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:59,978
I won't take much of his time.

327
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:03,278
Let's drop all pretenses and have one last conversation.

328
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,178
Sorry, but wait there.

329
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,378
I can't come to the door right now.

330
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:13,478
Your father is a compassionate man,

331
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,278
but he's stubborn.

332
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:18,878
He has a habit of suffering alone.

333
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:20,378
I know.

334
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:23,678
He's often misunderstood because of it.

335
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,478
He's no good with people.

336
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:30,078
His nickname in college was the Wild Pitcher.

337
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:32,078
I was the Clumsy Catcher.

338
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:35,578
I constantly failed to catch his pitches.

339
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:39,478
Well? This is the most I'm willing to compromise.

340
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,378
I hope you'll consider signing a contract under these terms.

341
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,578
Later!

342
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:49,478
What? Franklin?

343
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:52,478
He's negotiating with Franklin Planning?

344
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:56,278
Yes. That's what Mr. Hanyu told me.

345
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,678
That's a top foreign corporation.

346
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:01,178
They make a killing in transmedia business.

347
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:04,478
Conan, how do you know that?

348
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:07,378
Well, Shinichi said so.

349
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,478
There it is.

350
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:13,578
He's asking them to keep the Kagami name.

351
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,878
Keep the Kagami name?

352
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:19,578
They do care a lot about their honor.

353
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:21,278
Because he expects negotiations to move slowly,

354
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:25,078
Mr. Hanyu has been talking to other companies.

355
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:27,678
But their conditions are hard to swallow.

356
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:30,778
Then we'll exchange documents

357
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:35,578
confirm the conditions we agreed upon over the phone.

358
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:40,378
Tell your boss I hope his business does well.

359
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:42,178
I'll talk to you later.

360
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,978
Sorry...

361
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:51,278
I kept you waiting.

362
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:52,378
Huh?

363
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:55,478
What was that? There's no one here.

364
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:58,278
Mr. Yamagata.

365
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,878
Excuse the intrusion.

366
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:01,978
Good luck with your work.

367
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,278
It was interesting.

368
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,178
Sorry for the trouble.

369

00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:10,778
Goodbye, Teacher Yamagata.

371
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,078
Teacher?

372
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,678
Me?

373
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:33,578
I'm really sorry about today.

374
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:35,978
It's fine... Give my best to your father.

375
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:36,978
I will.

376
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:46,278
What was that sound?

377
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:47,478
Could it be?

00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:48,878
Tadashi?

379
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,578

00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:11,778
What are you doing?

395
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,978
