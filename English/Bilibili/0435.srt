1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.640
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.540
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.940
Somebody wants to interview the Youth Detective Squad.

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.440
They are excited at becoming the center of attention.

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.140
But a crime is committed!

6
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.309
"Teitan Elementary"

10
00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.409
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

11
00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.409
I apologize for coming at a time when you're so busy.

12
00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.609
No problem.

13
00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.609
I am...

14
00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.809
As you can see on my name card.

15
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.309
"Free Writer, Masato Sugimori"

16
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:30.909
I'm Sumiko Kobayashi, homeroom teacher for 1st grade, Class B.

17
00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.009
Please have a seat.

18
00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.409
So you're a freelance writer.

19
00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.909
Yes, I am.

20
00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.609
I thought my name is recently gaining popularity in women's magazines,

21
00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.009
but I guess, it's not as much as I thought.

22
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.109
It's not that.

23
00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.709
I don't read magazines much, that's why.

24
00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.509
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.009
Please don't get upset over it.

26
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.509
It doesn't bother me at all.

27
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.509
And, what is it that you want?

28
00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.909
If you want an interview on bullying or something like that,

29
00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.709
no such thing exists in my class.

30
00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.309
Nothing like that.

31
00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.709
What I want is to interview

32
00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.609
the members of the Youth Detective Squad in your class.

33
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
Huh? Youth Detective Squad?

34
00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.509
You mean the thing that Kojima and his friends have formed?

35
00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:19.909
Yeah...

36
00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.709
Yeah. I've heard rumours of what those children have done so far.

37
00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.909
But the group is something that the children formed on their own.

38
00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.509
In reality, they simply look for lost cats and so on.

39
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.509
Hey! Minami! Megumi! Ai!

40
00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.909
The names all sound familiar.

41
00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.709
The three cats are said to be violent.

42
00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709
But I was informed by the police

43
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.209
that they have contributed a lot to solving homicides

44
00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.009
especially a boy called Conan Edogawa.

45
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.709
Conan?

46
00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.409
I see.

47
00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.909
The title of the interview will be,

48
00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.309
"The Youth Detective Squad of the 21st Century!"

49
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.909
I'm sure it'll attract a lot of attention.

50
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.309
Well, I'm not sure...

51
00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.409
"The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 1)"

52
00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.509
"1st grade Class B" -What...

53
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.909
An interview?

54
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.609
Us, the Youth Detective Squad?

55
00:04:23.609 --> 00:04:24.709
Cool!

56
00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:27.809
That's right!

57
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.009
Yesterday after school,

58
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.609
a writer called Mr. Sugimori came here to see me.

59
00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:35.709
He said that he'd like to write an article about all of you

60
00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:37.309
and asked me to help him out.

61
00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.209
It sounds interesting!

62
00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:42.309
I'm getting excited!

63
00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:43.909
So...

64
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:50.509
Do you have a cold, Ms. Kobayashi?

65
00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.109
Not good.

66
00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:53.309
It seems so.

67
00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.109
Although I still don't have a fever,

68
00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:58.509
my nose keeps running and I can't stop sneezing.

69
00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.909
Are you all right, Ms. Kobayashi?

70
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.209
Did you take any medicine?

71
00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:05.809
Aren't your eyes itchy?

72
00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:06.909
Right, right.

73
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.709
I was correcting tests until late last night.

74
00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.409
I guess my eyes got tired.

75
00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.309
You've got hay fever.

76
00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.709
What? No way!

77
00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:16.909
No, I don't.

78
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.109
Because I've had immunity against things like that since childhood.

79
00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:21.509
You see,

80
00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.709
hay fever occurs when the antigen,

81
00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.809
in other words, the substance that causes the allergy enters the body

82
00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.609
and antibodies are created to fight off the antigens are made.

83
00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:35.009
They accumulate within the body and when they exceed a certain level,

84
00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.309
the antigens and antibodies react

85
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.309
and a substance that causes allergy is dispersed.

86
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.309
But because the antigen-carrying pollen

87
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.509
is limited to being formed only one time a year,

88
00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.609
it takes quite a long time before they accumulate.

89
00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:52.809
So even if there's no allergy when you were a child,

90
00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.209
there are many cases of people becoming allergic in their 20's and 30's.

91
00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:59.409
Oh, is that so?

92
00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.409
And? What about the interview?

93
00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:03.809
Of course we'll accept it!

94
00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:07.709
We, as the Youth Detective Squad should accept it, right?

95
00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:08.909
Yes!

96
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.809
It looks like it's going to rain.

97
00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.109
They sure are late.

98
00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:20.809
They're the ones who said we'd meet up 30 minutes beforehand.

99
00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:21.809
Listen!

100
00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.909
30 minutes beforehand. That's when we meet, okay?

101
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.409
Don't be late!

102
00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.209
Understand, Conan?

103
00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.409
Me?

104
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:32.409
Yeah, I got it.

105
00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.609
Really? I hope you keep your word, Genta.

106
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.109
Of course I will.

107
00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:40.309
Come on.

108
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.509
Dress normally tomorrow, you guys.

109
00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.909
He have to see us as we usually are as the Youth Detective Squad.

110
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.909
You sure are smart!

111
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.709
I'm giving it my best shot!

112
00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.209
Hey, Conan!

113
00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:56.009
Sorry to keep you waiting!

114
00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.809
Thanks for waiting!

115
00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.109
Sorry, Conan! Did you wait long?

116
00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:02.009
Hey! You guys are late.

117
00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.709
Just what do you think you're doing?

118
00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:07.709
Ayumi was taking her good old time getting ready, that's why.

119
00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:10.809
Well, I had a lot of things to do.

120
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.109
No big deal.

121
00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:13.709
After all, she's a girl.

122
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.009
So let's not make a fuss over it.

123
00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.409
I guess I've got no choice.

124
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.809
By the way, where's Haibara?

125
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:23.509
I'm right here.

126
00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.109
Since when was she there?

127
00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:28.209
Anyway, what's with you guys? This isn't what we talked about!

128
00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:29.709
How come you're all dressed like that?

129
00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:32.309
How do you like it?

130
00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.109
Well, it's an interview after all, isn't it?

131
00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:37.509
Right, Mitsuhiko?

132
00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:42.109
Yes. We should be properly dressed for an interview,

133
00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:45.009
because a lot of people will be watching.

134
00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:47.509
Yes, yes, exactly!

135
00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.609
Oh, boy. Why does it have to turn out this way?

136
00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:59.609
We're heading for an interview and it starts raining.

137
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:01.809
God is sure mean.

138
00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:03.309
Really.

139
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:06.009
It was so sunshiny yesterday.

140
00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:07.509
Why is this happening today?

141
00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:11.109
Mitsuhiko, this is your fault for telling us to dress normally.

142
00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:13.209
What? What are you talking about?

143
00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:14.909
Talk for yourself, Genta!

144
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:19.309
My Sunday clothes are soaking wet with rain.

145
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:22.609
My shoes are all wet, too.

146
00:08:22.609 --> 00:08:25.109
And I just bought them last night.

147
00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:28.209
I think you guys are taking things a bit too far.

148
00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.509
I guess it's no big deal.

149
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:37.009
We can ask them to lend us a dryer or something before the interview.

150
00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:40.009
We're being interviewed at the house of the writer, aren't we?

151
00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:43.609
But recent televisions are high definition,

152
00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:47.309
so if shots of us entering the house with rain stains are taken...

153
00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:49.609
What? Are television cameras coming, too?

154
00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:54.909
Hey, hey. Of course they're not coming.

155
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:58.009
Maybe we're going to be aired on a special program?

156
00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:01.609
Which means that beautiful women announcers will be there, too.

157
00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:04.709
I want to be interviewed by Reina Mizunashi!

158
00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:05.809
Me, too!

159
00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:09.309
She won't be coming, right?

160
00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:12.609
Because she's in the hospital right now.

161
00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:13.609
Yeah.

162
00:09:13.609 --> 00:09:16.409
It seems that the announcer who is a member of the Black Organization

163
00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.709
is still lying unconscious.

164
00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.109
Hey.

165
00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:24.309
Don't tell me that this interview is their plan?

166
00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:26.209
It can't be.

167
00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:28.309
No matter how you think about it,

168
00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:30.409
inviting five kids to your house will attract attention.

169
00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:33.309
It's hard to believe that they would go out of their way

170
00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:36.309
to do something like leaving clues behind.

171
00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:40.609
They do things so that no one notices what they're doing, right?

172
00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:42.409
Yes, that's true.

173
00:09:44.609 --> 00:09:47.909
Besides, if they want to do something to you or me,

174
00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:50.209
they wouldn't be calling adults over.

175
00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:51.409
Sorry, sorry!

176
00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:56.009
Did you all wait long?

177
00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:58.109
Ms. Kobayashi?

178
00:09:58.109 --> 00:10:00.009
She sure looks like Officer Sato.

179
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.309
What is it?

180
00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:03.709
Hey...

181
00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.809
You forgot your glasses.

182
00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:07.409
Oh, this?

183
00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:10.109
I decided to wear contact lens today for a change.

184
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.109
How do you like it?

185
00:10:11.109 --> 00:10:13.609
Not good? You don't like it?

186
00:10:13.609 --> 00:10:15.309
You look just great!

187
00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:18.709
Your outfit is feminine and nice, too.

188
00:10:18.709 --> 00:10:21.609
You look way prettier than usual, Ms. Kobayashi.

189
00:10:21.609 --> 00:10:24.109
Thank you! I'm glad.

190
00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:27.609
Well, it seems like the writer is good-looking.

191
00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:29.709
No, that's not it.

192
00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:31.709
Really, it's nothing like that.

193
00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:35.209
But I think you shouldn't have worn contact lens.

194
00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.009
Your eyes are itchy from your hay fever,

195
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:39.709
so being irritated by the contacts isn't good for them.

196
00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:42.309
Okay, okay.

197
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:45.409
I'll be fine if I wear my glasses, right?

198
00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:47.709
Yeah. That's way better.

199
00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:51.509
It seems that not much pollen is in the air now because it's raining.

200
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:55.909
But the house of the writer may be full of pollen.

201
00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:59.509
And you'd better dust that hairy decoration off

202
00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:01.809
before going into the house,

203
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:05.109
so that you don't scatter pollen all over the house.

204
00:11:05.109 --> 00:11:06.209
I guess so.

205
00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:07.309
Okay.

206
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:10.909
Ms. Kobayashi, was that writer handsome?

207
00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:15.809
Yes, his looks weren't all that bad.

208
00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:21.509
He's friendly and easy to talk to.

209
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:25.209
I'm sure you'll be able to get along with him pretty quickly.

210
00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:28.809
He's famous for his experience in writing for women's magazines,

211
00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:32.709
so I'm sure he's used to coping with children, too.

212
00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:34.409
He's famous.

213
00:11:34.409 --> 00:11:35.809
He's famous?

214
00:11:35.809 --> 00:11:39.309
Which means that he must live in an incredibly huge mansion!

215
00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:42.809
He must have his very own chef and patissier, too.

216
00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:45.509
I'm sure he'll serve us a fantastic dinner then.

217
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:46.809
I know he will!

218
00:11:48.109 --> 00:11:49.309
Well...

219
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:53.109
I don't think so.

220
00:11:57.609 --> 00:11:58.709
Here?

221
00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:01.609
I guess so.

222
00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:04.209
It's not a mansion.

223
00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:07.009
But an ordinary apartment.

224
00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:11.009
I guess there'll be no television cameras...

225
00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:13.109
Or beautiful women announcers.

226
00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:17.209
Well, all for the better.

227
00:12:17.209 --> 00:12:20.309
This way you can talk without getting nervous, right?

228
00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:22.509
Hey. Did the writer say

229
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:25.709
that he was really going to interview us at his house?

230
00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:29.109
It looks to be a small one room six mats house.

231
00:12:29.109 --> 00:12:31.809
No. He said he'd conduct the interview at a family restaurant close by.

232
00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:33.209
Oh, no!

233
00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:36.509
I'm supposed to call him from the bus stop near his house!

234
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:38.009
Just as I thought.

235
00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:39.809
I've got to call him right away.

236
00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:41.209
No need to.

237
00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:42.509
We've come all the way here.

238
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:46.209
We may as well be interviewed at his house and get it over with quickly.

239
00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:47.209
I guess so.

240
00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:49.109
You need to get it together.

241
00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:54.609
I wonder if he'd be surprised at seeing all of us at once like this.

242
00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:55.809
He might be.

243
00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.409
Stay quiet, okay?

244
00:13:02.809 --> 00:13:05.009
I wonder if he's out?

245
00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:08.909
No. The morning paper is stuck in the slot, maybe he's still asleep.

246
00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:12.509
The door isn't locked.

247
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:13.809
Hey, Genta!

248
00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:20.909
Mr. Sugimori?

249
00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:22.409
No, Ms. Kobayashi! Don't go inside!

250
00:13:23.409 --> 00:13:25.609
Since you're acquainted with him,

251
00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:28.209
if your hair or anything is found in this room,

252
00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:29.809
you could end up becoming a suspect, right?

253
00:13:37.209 --> 00:13:40.309
Please call an ambulance and the police immediately, Ms. Kobayashi!

254
00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:43.609
If we call, they may think it's a child's prank.

255
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:46.109
Okay.

256
00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:49.309
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

257
00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:51.909
His body is completely stiff.

258
00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:53.809
He's been dead for half a day already.

259
00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:55.709
Stiff?

260
00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.209
Dead for half a day?

261
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:03.409
This could be...

262
00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.809
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

263
00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:07.309
Okay!

264
00:14:12.656 --> 00:14:16.656
The victim is Mr. Masato Sugimori, age 32.

265
00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:18.756
A freelance writer, right?

266
00:14:18.756 --> 00:14:20.256
Yes, that's right.

267
00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:22.556
I had an appointment to see him today.

268
00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:25.256
He wanted to interview the children.

269
00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:29.456
And? When you got here, you found him like this?

270
00:14:29.456 --> 00:14:31.356
Yes.

271
00:14:31.356 --> 00:14:36.256
By the way, when did you get the request for the interview?

272
00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:38.656
At sundown the day before yesterday.

273
00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:40.956
He came to the school.

274
00:14:40.956 --> 00:14:44.656
Which means he was still alive until then.

275
00:14:44.656 --> 00:14:45.956
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi.

276
00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:49.956
You told Mr. Sugimori that we're going to be interviewed, right?

277
00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:51.156
Yes.

278
00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:55.756
I called Mr. Sugimori before noon yesterday and told him.

279
00:14:55.756 --> 00:14:58.556
Do you know at exactly what time it was?

280
00:14:58.556 --> 00:15:00.256
Hold on a second.

281
00:15:00.256 --> 00:15:02.456
I'm sure that I got the call on my cell phone

282
00:15:02.456 --> 00:15:04.756
in between 3rd and 4th period.

283
00:15:04.756 --> 00:15:07.756
So I can probably tell if I look through the list of incoming calls.

284
00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:10.556
It's 11:22.

285
00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:13.956
Which means he was killed after that time.

286
00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:16.156
-Inspector. -What?

287
00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:19.856
It seems that the murder weapon is the tripod of this camera.

288
00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:24.656
If the killer came into the room and battered him to death,

289
00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:27.156
the killer is most likely an acquaintance.

290
00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:29.556
Yes. Being that he's a writer,

291
00:15:29.556 --> 00:15:33.556
someone that he interviewed could be the suspect.

292
00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:34.856
Right.

293
00:15:34.856 --> 00:15:38.856
He may have written an article exposing someone's deeds.

294
00:15:38.856 --> 00:15:41.456
But if he wrote about people in show biz,

295
00:15:41.456 --> 00:15:43.056
the fans of the target may have gotten upset,

296
00:15:43.056 --> 00:15:44.956
then we will end up with a whole lot of suspects.

297
00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:47.656
I think there are four suspicious people.

298
00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:49.956
-What? -What?

299
00:15:49.956 --> 00:15:51.456
Conan?

300
00:15:51.456 --> 00:15:54.256
Take a look here at the button of the answer phone.

301
00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:00.356
The light's blinking.

302
00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:05.256
There seems to be four messages in it.

303
00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:09.156
But, Conan, what makes you think that these four are suspicious?

304
00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:11.156
Look more closely.

305
00:16:11.156 --> 00:16:13.056
At the edge of the button.

306
00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.256
Now, do you get it?

307
00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:17.456
The blood on it has been rubbed off.

308
00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:18.456
What?

309
00:16:20.256 --> 00:16:21.456
You're right.

310
00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:22.456
So that means...

311
00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:26.956
someone pushed the button of the answer phone after the blood splattered.

312
00:16:26.956 --> 00:16:29.556
I wonder who did this?

313
00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.356
Well...

314
00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:34.056
It's after the victim was struck so...

315
00:16:34.056 --> 00:16:35.856
If the victim who was barely conscious

316
00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:39.656
pushed it himself after the culprit fled,

317
00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:42.856
he would've called the police instead of pushing the answer phone button.

318
00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:44.256
Besides, inspector,

319
00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:47.656
there are no blood stains on the finger of the victim.

320
00:16:47.656 --> 00:16:50.656
So that means that the killer pushed the button?

321
00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:51.856
Yes.

322
00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:53.656
It's only likely to think

323
00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:56.356
that the button was pushed after the victim was struck.

324
00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:59.156
Why would the killer do something like that?

325
00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:01.256
Well, most probably because the killer

326
00:17:01.256 --> 00:17:03.556
didn't want anyone to find Mr. Sugimori.

327
00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:05.456
If the phone is set on answer phone even if someone were to call,

328
00:17:05.456 --> 00:17:08.756
no one would come thinking that he's out somewhere.

329
00:17:08.756 --> 00:17:15.156
But the key of this room is on table and the door wasn't locked.

330
00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:16.156
Key?

331
00:17:20.756 --> 00:17:24.256
If the killer didn't want Mr. Sugimori to be found,

332
00:17:24.256 --> 00:17:26.056
I think the killer would've locked the door.

333
00:17:27.156 --> 00:17:29.256
That's true.

334
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:32.256
Then the only possible thing left would be...

335
00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:33.856
The killer...

336
00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:38.056
Entered the message into the answer phone...

337
00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.856
In order to establish an alibi.

338
00:17:41.356 --> 00:17:44.956
Then it's understandable why the door wasn't locked.

339
00:17:44.956 --> 00:17:46.556
Yeah.

340
00:17:46.556 --> 00:17:47.956
If discovery of his body is too delayed

341
00:17:47.956 --> 00:17:50.856
and the estimated time of death becomes uncertain,

342
00:17:50.856 --> 00:17:53.856
the alibi that is established will go down the drain.

343
00:17:53.856 --> 00:17:55.356
What?

344
00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:58.356
Okay. Let's listen to these right now.

345
00:17:58.356 --> 00:17:59.856
What's going on?

346
00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.856
What's with this boy?

347
00:18:06.356 --> 00:18:08.856
Okay. Let's hear the voices of the four suspects.

348
00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:11.156
Wait! Inspector!

349
00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.156
What? What is it?

350
00:18:13.156 --> 00:18:15.656
Shouldn't we record it while listening to it, just in case?

351
00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.456
That way, we can listen to it repeatedly.

352
00:18:17.456 --> 00:18:21.956
We don't want to risk making a mistake and losing the tape.

353
00:18:21.956 --> 00:18:23.756
True.

354
00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:28.756
I'll go ask the forensic officers

355
00:18:28.756 --> 00:18:31.556
for a recording device and have them bring it over.

356
00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:34.256
-Do that, will you? -Excuse me.

357
00:18:34.256 --> 00:18:35.456
Hey, Conan!

358
00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:39.256
Is the killer's voice really inside the answer phone?

359
00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:40.356
Yeah.

360
00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:43.856
The blood that splattered on the "on" button was partially smeared off.

361
00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.356
After killing Mr. Sugimori,

362
00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:48.156
the killer turned on the answer phone

363
00:18:48.156 --> 00:18:51.056
and left a message in it to establish his alibi.

364
00:18:51.056 --> 00:18:57.556
But the killer could've done so just to confuse authorities, right?

365
00:18:57.556 --> 00:18:59.456
Then take a look at that.

366
00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:03.456
There's blood on the door knob of the entrance door.

367
00:19:03.456 --> 00:19:06.656
It's evidence that the killer rushed out of this room

368
00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:09.156
without realizing that it was there.

369
00:19:09.156 --> 00:19:11.356
Oh, you're right.

370
00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:12.856
There's blood on it.

371
00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:19.056
The blood smeared on the answering machine button wasn't intentional.

372
00:19:19.056 --> 00:19:20.456
It doesn't look like the killer

373
00:19:20.456 --> 00:19:23.456
suddenly tried to scheme something at the last minute either.

374
00:19:23.456 --> 00:19:26.656
If there are no fingerprints detected on the blood on the knob,

375
00:19:26.656 --> 00:19:30.056
the killer must've used a glove.

376
00:19:30.056 --> 00:19:31.756
Slow down a bit.

377
00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:36.056
Aren't you speeding off too much from the beginning?

378
00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:42.456
Officer Takagi and Inspector Megure are used to you,

379
00:19:42.456 --> 00:19:43.856
so maybe it's okay.

380
00:19:43.856 --> 00:19:47.256
But it's the first time Ms. Kobayashi hears you making a deduction.

381
00:19:47.256 --> 00:19:48.656
She looked flustered.

382
00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:52.156
Slow down a bit.

383
00:19:54.656 --> 00:19:57.056
Slow down?

384
00:19:57.056 --> 00:19:58.656
She's looking this way, too.

385
00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.156
Not good.

386
00:20:00.156 --> 00:20:02.756
I hear you do a lot of things.

387
00:20:02.756 --> 00:20:04.356
Like what?

388
00:20:04.356 --> 00:20:10.856
Saying things like "Huh" or "Funny".

389
00:20:10.856 --> 00:20:12.856
You know, those deceiving kind of stupid childish remarks you make.

390
00:20:14.456 --> 00:20:16.056
Why, you...

391
00:20:16.056 --> 00:20:17.756
I'm sure you know this,

392
00:20:17.756 --> 00:20:21.056
but if the public learns about your detective work,

393
00:20:21.056 --> 00:20:23.556
it'll eventually reach their ears, too.

394
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:26.556
Yeah, I know.

395
00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:30.356
I was planning on keeping my mouth shut during this interview, too.

396
00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:32.356
I wonder about that.

397
00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:39.556
Is it true that this victim, Mr. Sugimori, is a writer in demand?

398
00:20:39.556 --> 00:20:40.756
Yes.

399
00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.956
When he came over to the school the day before yesterday,

400
00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:45.756
he himself said so.

401
00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:49.356
He told me that his name is becoming rather popular these days.

402
00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:54.356
If so, it would seem that he would be living in a better place than this.

403
00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:59.356
Maybe Mr. Sugimori was just lying.

404
00:20:59.356 --> 00:21:00.356
No. He...

405
00:21:03.356 --> 00:21:05.356
I know.

406
00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:08.456
It's kind of embarrassing acting it out after being told to do so.

407
00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:11.156
Look at that!

408
00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:14.956
There's an interesting key on Mr. Sugimori's hip!

409
00:21:17.256 --> 00:21:20.356
Look! A silver horse is attached to it!

410
00:21:23.056 --> 00:21:25.956
That person must've loved animals.

411
00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:28.356
Hey!

412
00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:31.356
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:33.256
It's the key to a Ferrari.

414
00:21:33.256 --> 00:21:34.756
You mean that super car?

415
00:21:34.756 --> 00:21:37.356
Is that a super car?

416
00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:41.156
But if that's true,

417
00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:44.556
it could be that Mr. Sugimori was poor because of the car.

418
00:21:44.556 --> 00:21:46.356
There are people who are tight on their living expenses

419
00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:50.656
because they want to spend money on their luxury car.

420
00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:53.656
He had the key to this room separated from his car keys,

421
00:21:53.656 --> 00:21:56.056
so this shows that he was also most probably a show-off.

422
00:21:56.056 --> 00:21:58.256
Hey, Conan.

423
00:21:58.256 --> 00:22:02.456
What was that "huh" thing a while ago about?

424
00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:06.956
We're looked down upon by adults because of such attitudes of yours.

425
00:22:06.956 --> 00:22:10.556
I think it's cute, but maybe it's a bit too childish.

426
00:22:10.556 --> 00:22:12.156
That's right, Conan!

427
00:22:12.156 --> 00:22:15.056
Please don't go around doing stuff like that all on your own.

428
00:22:15.056 --> 00:22:16.956
Oh, come on.

429
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.856
But...

430
00:22:24.256 --> 00:22:26.356
No matter how I go about doing this...

431
00:22:28.756 --> 00:22:31.756
it's not gonna be easy.

432
00:23:59.756 --> 00:24:03.156
"Next Episode" -This is your voice, right, Ms. Kobayashi?

433
00:24:03.156 --> 00:24:05.256
Which means that Ms. Kobayashi is the killer!

434
00:24:05.256 --> 00:24:06.456
No.

435
00:24:06.456 --> 00:24:08.956
There's only one person who has a solid alibi.

436
00:24:09.956 --> 00:24:10.956
Wait.

437
00:24:10.956 --> 00:24:14.756
Right. Ms. Kobayashi is suspicious of me.

438
00:24:14.756 --> 00:24:16.356
Fever?

439
00:24:16.356 --> 00:24:20.356
Come to think of it, all of them had something to do with hay fever.

440
00:24:20.356 --> 00:24:22.456
Hey, kids. I'd like to ask you all something.

441
00:24:22.456 --> 00:24:23.456
Here it comes.

442
00:24:24.356 --> 00:24:29.756
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 2)"

443
00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:32.641
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:35.141
"Sound of the railroad crossing"

445
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.741
Movie time!

446
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.141
The movie, Requirement of the Detectives.

447
00:24:38.141 --> 00:24:39.641
It's Requiem.
