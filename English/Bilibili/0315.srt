1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,440
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,540
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,640
Bright and warm is the sunshine of April.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,640
Even a surprising case grows rapidly.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,267
I more or less have an idea of the situation

9
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:55,067
thanks to the telephone call last night

10
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:58,267
but is Mr. Seizan's slump that bad?

11
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:01,867
Yes, he hasn't drawn one picture these three months.

12
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:04,267
Why?

13
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:08,467
Maybe it has to do with his age since he's already 70,

14
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,367
it seems that he can't come up with anything creative,

15
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,867
and because of pressure from this,

16
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,567
"Jiro Kuroki (28)" -his fingers have begun to shake.

17
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,567
Oh, no!

18
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,067
He hasn't been eating very much lately

19
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,267
and is emotionally unstable.

20
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,867
He has sudden spurts of anger,

21
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,367
while at other times he goes completely silent.

22
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,667
In the end, he went on to attempt suicide.

23
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,967
Yes.

24
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:41,167
"A Place in the Sun"

25
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:45,367
I asked you to come today in hopes that

26
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:49,767
Mr. Seizan would feel at least a bit refreshed.

27
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:52,167
I'm sorry to have called you knowing how busy you are.

28
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,467
Oh, no. Don't be.

29
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,867
If I can be of help to Mr. Seizan who is my drinking friend,

30
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,467
I couldn't be happier.

31
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,267
He would never turn down an offer that comes with Japanese sake

32
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,767
and hot spring, would he, Ran?

33
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,867
You're right.

34
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,067
Just what was that?

35
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:10,067
But, Mr. Seizan sure is a lucky man,

36
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,967
because he has a kind hearted disciple like you.

37
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,567
I'm what I am, thanks to Mr. Seizan.

38
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,467
Oh, it's a bush warbler!

39
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,667
They reside in this bamboo forest.

40
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,867
I hear them from this side.

41
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,267
Oh, he's...

42
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,167
Mr. Seizan.

43
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,267
"Good friends who travel great distances

44
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,567
just to see you are as precious as gold."

45
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,067
Thanks for stopping by on the way.

46
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,467
When I saw the name of the station,

47
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:51,467
your face flashed through my mind, so...

48
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,267
I'm glad to see that you seem to be doing very well.

49
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,967
"Seizan Hayakawa (70)" -The older I get the more filled with energy I am.

50
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:02,467
I was just sketching the bamboo around here now too.

51
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:09,267
He doesn't look the least bit pressured.

52
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,867
Can't you tell?

53
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,867
He's putting on an act

54
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,167
because he doesn't want you to see his wretched self!

55
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,667
An act.

56
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,267
Did you just see that?

57
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,467
That's called the flight of a bush warbler

58
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,967
from valley to valley.

59
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,767
That's they're cry of warning.

60
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,167
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:33,367
Please forgive them because they'll fly away in time.

62
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,467
This bamboo forest is a sacred place for the bush warbler

63
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,267
and is not to be infiltrated.

64
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:44,867
Let's leave them so as not to intrude on them.

65
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:51,667
"Noriko Yamamoto (35)" -Welcome back, Mr. Seizan.

66
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,967
We've got guests.

67
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,767
Please make them something good to eat.

68
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,167
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:57,667
Who is she?

70
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,767
She comes here daily to take care of Mr. Seizan.

71
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,767
Her name is Noriko Yamamoto.

72
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,267
I see.

73
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,467
Mother!

74
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:10,867
Look... I'm good, aren't I?

75
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,767
Kenichi.

76
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,767
-Noriko... -I'm very sorry!

77
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,667
My mother came down with a sudden fever

78
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,167
and couldn't take care of him so, that's why.

79
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,767
No excuses!

80
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:25,167
I told you never to bring your child here!

81
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,667
Yes. But, just today.

82
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,767
No! Make him go home!

83
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,567
Don't ever bring him before me again!

84
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,967
Mother...

85
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,267
Go home, right this minute! Understand?

86
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:54,367
By the way, is that a new piece of work?

87
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,867
Fantastic mountain.

88
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,867
This is Mt. Fuji that I drew recently

89
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,867
because a certain company asked me for it.

90
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,467
Mr. Kuroki, don't you draw?

91
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:07,567
It's been a while since you've become Mr. Seizan's disciple, isn't it?

92
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,967
Sort of.

93
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:12,867
I saw it some time ago, but he's pretty good.

94
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:16,067
Unlike Mr. Seizan's, it's colorful.

95
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,767
Yes, mine are pictures in color.

96
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:21,567
Come to think of it, you know the contest

97
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,767
that Mr. Seizan serves as a judge?

98
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,867
Isn't it about time it starts?

99
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:29,367
You know very well, don't you?

100
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,667
The day after tomorrow is the deadline.

101
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,667
Why don't you make an entry, Mr. Kuroki?

102
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,467
I think you'll do pretty good.

103
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,567
Right, Mr. Seizan?

104
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,767
I don't think so.

105
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:46,267
I, his teacher, Seizan Hayakawa, will be laughed at.

106
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:50,067
Kuroki's not skilled enough to enter the contest.

107
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,567
But, Mr. Seizan...

108
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,267
Mr. Mouri, it's just as Mr. Seizan says!

109
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:01,567
I haven't gone through enough training yet.

110
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,467
Right, Ran, would you please be my model?

111
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,867
As part of training for me?

112
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:09,067
Sure.

113
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,167
Oh, Mr. Kuroki, one minute.

114
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:14,467
Mr. Seizan, could you draw us a picture?

115
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,767
Mr. Mouri!

116
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,767
When you were in Tokyo,

117
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,867
you used to draw a lot for us to enhance gaiety.

118
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,667
No, not tonight...

119
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:23,867
Please don't let him.

120
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,967
Mr. Mouri! Mr. Seizan has already drunk liquor.

121
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:30,367
He used to drink and draw for us in the past too.

122
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,567
Please, Mr. Seizan.

123
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,867
Please!

124
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,467
No good!

125
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,567
I'm sorry, I got carried away and I got kind of pushy.

126
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,967
No, don't be. It's just that I've gotten very weak lately

127
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,367
when it comes to drinking.

128
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:07,767
Mr. Seizan!

129
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,867
Why don't we go fishing out at sea tomorrow?

130
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,767
Of course with Mr. Mouri and the others.

131
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,567
That sounds great!

132
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:17,767
Do let us accompany you, Mr. Seizan!

133
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,867
I haven't gone fishing in a long time.

134
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,667
I wonder if we can fish when it's raining like this?

135
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,767
According to the weather forecast,

136
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,367
the rain is supposed to stop by sunrise,

137
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,767
and it's said that tomorrow will be a hot day.

138
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:33,267
Well, as for tonight, I guess I'll go hit the sack already.

139
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,267
Good night, Mr. Seizan.

140
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,267
Yeah, good night.

141
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,667
Dad! That's rude, you shouldn't have done it!

142
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,267
Mr. Mouri!

143
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:47,267
Please don't get me wrong, Mr. Kuroki.

144
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:48,967
I want to confirm with my own eyes

145
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:53,067
whether he cannot draw because his fingers are shaking, as you say.

146
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,167
That's why I put on that act.

147
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,667
I see.

148
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:05,367
So this is your workplace.

149
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:09,067
How cute. Is this your work?

150
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,067
It's still incomplete, though.

151
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,667
What beautiful colors.

152
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,967
It's drawn by mixing this powdered paint with hide glue.

153
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,467
This white one is called Oyster White, right?

154
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,267
You're knowledgeable, aren't you?

155
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:25,267
It's made by crushing the shell of oysters

156
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,967
and making them into powder.

157
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,467
Oysters?

158
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,267
What? That picture.

159
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,767
It's a picture of the bush warbler flying from valley to valley.

160
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,267
Good morning!

161
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,267
Oh, Mrs. Yamamoto.

162
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,967
What's wrong? You look pale.

163
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,467
I haven't had much sleep having to look after my mother.

164
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:58,667
I'm going to go call the doctor and ask him to check on her.

165
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,967
Mr. Mouri!

166
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,267
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

167
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,767
Mr. Seizan hasn't come out of his room yet,

168
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,667
so please go ahead to the harbor.

169
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,967
I see, all right.

170
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,167
What?

171
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,867
You mean Mr. Seizan isn't going to come?

172
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,267
Yes. He says he wants to stay home and relax.

173
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,767
Mr. Seizan, I'll switch over to Mr. Mouri now.

174
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,967
Yes.

175
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,167
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll go today.

176
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,367
Are you all right, Mr. Seizan?

177
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,567
Maybe we should...

178
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,267
Okay, we'll see you by sundown.

179
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:39,467
Yes.

180
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,767
You can expect a good catch!

181
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,767
Let's not stimulate him too much for now.

182
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,367
-Octopus! -Amazing!

183
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,267
-Fish! -Great!

184
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,667
-Old boot. -That's not good.

185
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,867
Yes, this is Kuroki.

186
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,467
You mean, Mr. Seizan?

187
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,167
He left a note?

188
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,167
Yes. I can't draw anymore.

189
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,267
I'm sorry for relying on you. Thanks for everything.

190
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:14,267
Hello, please come back right away.

191
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,467
It seems she found it

192
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,867
when she went to clean up at the usual time.

193
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,267
Please call the police immediately

194
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:23,067
and have them search for him!

195
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,267
You heard him, didn't you?

196
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,467
We'll head back right away!

197
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,067
Mr. Seizan!

198
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,767
Is it suicide?

199
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,467
Who are you?

200
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,667
I'm a private detective, Kogoro Mouri.

201
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,567
You mean you're the famous...

202
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,367
I'm Daimatsu from the local police station.

203
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,267
We found a death note too,

204
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:58,667
so it's probably undoubtedly suicide.

205
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,467
He tied a rope to the bamboo,

206
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:04,067
jumped off from the rock and committed suicide.

207
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,567
The estimated time of his death is

208
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,767
thought to be between 11:00 to 13:00.

209
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:15,167
He tied the rope to the bamboo just when we were fishing.

210
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,267
I wonder why the bamboo was all cut down?

211
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,067
Water wasn't accumulated

212
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:24,567
so the bamboo was cut this morning after the rain stopped.

213
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,367
So what?

214
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,167
Go away!

215
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,367
A bush warbler?

216
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:42,467
It's way too soon to conclude this as suicide!

217
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,347
So this is Mr. Seizan's atelier.

218
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,547
Mr. Seizan confined himself in here

219
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,547
and was drawing all the while after that.

220
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:13,747
Bamboo Diary.

221
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:15,147
I wonder what this is.

222
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,947
The record of the growth of bamboo.

223
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:28,147
I see.

224
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,347
If it's like this, then maybe...

225
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,747
Pops.

226
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,347
There are expensive drawings here,

227
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:37,847
stop scampering around!

228
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,447
Look at this!

229
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:42,147
This is a sketch of Ran.

230
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,647
What about this?

231
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,747
You see...

232
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:49,547
What? I see.

233
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:53,047
Oh, I was just thinking the same thing!

234
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:57,147
Mr. Mouri, I've finished most of the questioning,

235
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,547
so I'm heading back to the station now.

236
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,947
Please wait.

237
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:04,047
Isn't it too soon to decide that this is a suicide?

238
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:07,147
What do you mean?

239
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:11,247
Mr. Seizan said this yesterday.

240
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:15,047
This bamboo forest is a sacred place for the bush warbler

241
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:16,647
and is not to be infiltrated.

242
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,947
I wonder if Mr. Seizan,

243
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:22,047
would do such a thing as pollute the bamboo forest that he loved

244
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,047
with his corpse?

245
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,747
One more thing!

246
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,547
Last night Mr. Seizan confined himself

247
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:29,847
to the atelier after dinner

248
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,447
and was drawing this right through.

249
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,347
He was probably planning to give it to us as a gift

250
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:38,147
at the time we leave here.

251
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:42,447
If so, I wonder if he would commit suicide.

252
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:44,047
Which means...

253
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:47,847
A homicide under the pretense of suicide!

254
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,147
Mr. Seizan said "The bush warbler's flight from valley to valley"

255
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,947
means that the bush warbler's crying is the sound of warning.

256
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,947
Mrs. Yamamoto, just before we met you this morning,

257
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,347
we heard the cry of the bush warbler!

258
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:04,947
And, you ran off with a pale face.

259
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:09,947
I'll bet you were at the bamboo forest then?

260
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,047
No!

261
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,747
That is...

262
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,547
Conan.

263
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:23,147
But, his estimated time of death

264
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:27,347
is between 11 am to 1 pm.

265
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:30,647
She has an alibi during that time.

266
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,747
What?

267
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:35,247
I was at the city hospital.

268
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:38,747
I was told that I should take my mother to a large hospital.

269
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:40,747
So I took her there.

270
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,047
I see.

271
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:45,847
What's the matter, Conan?

272
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,847
Mr. Kuroki's painting is completed!

273
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,347
Mr. Kuroki must've stayed up last night and completed it.

274
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:57,947
Ran, Pops says to bring that painting and the sketch.

275
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,847
-When? -Right now!

276
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,047
I see.

277
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,847
She was by her mother's side all the time.

278
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,047
I understand.

279
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,147
You seem to have a definite alibi.

280
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:15,147
Which means it's most likely that Mr. Seizan committed suicide then.

281
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:17,347
I guess I'll be going then.

282
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,747
Officer Daimatsu, please wait!

283
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:31,347
Mr. Seizan did not commit suicide!

284
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:32,447
What?

285
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,347
The motive of the killer

286
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:38,647
who committed this homicide and made it look like a suicide

287
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:42,647
can be found in the pictures that Ran has brought here!

288
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:46,747
Mr. Kuroki, you were planning to enter the contest

289
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:49,947
with this painting, which deadline is tomorrow, right?

290
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:53,147
But Mr. Seizan wouldn't let you.

291
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:57,647
Therefore, you decided to kill him.

292
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:00,747
Mr. Mouri, what a thing to say out of the blue.

293
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:03,047
You invited me to come here saying that Mr. Seizan

294
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,247
was in a grave slump,

295
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,747
and wanted me to come to cheer him up,

296
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:11,147
but that was a lie!

297
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,847
Mr. Seizan was not in a slump

298
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:16,247
nor did he have any reason to commit suicide.

299
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,747
But his fingers were shaking.

300
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,447
I guess that's true.

301
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:24,447
But that painting of Mt. Fuji that was in the guest room.

302
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:27,547
How do you explain that?

303
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:32,747
Mr. Seizan said, "I just finished drawing it a few days ago".

304
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:36,547
That's probably what you completed

305
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,047
using Mr. Seizan's rough draft.

306
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,147
No, not only that.

307
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:44,547
Weren't you the one who was drawing

308
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,847
all of Mr. Seizan's paintings these past few years?

309
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:51,947
No way...

310
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,347
So, having you enter the contest

311
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:56,847
and going independent was totally absurd

312
00:17:56,847 --> 00:18:01,147
as far as Mr. Seizan was concerned.

313
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,147
Last night, you suddenly asked Ran to be your model

314
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,047
and diverted my attention.

315
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:11,947
I see! He knew that you would try to test Mr. Seizan

316
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:15,147
and ask him to draw!

317
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:19,547
Right, and after seeing Mr. Seizan's condition,

318
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:23,247
Mr. Kuroki, I believed that you said,

319
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:26,847
"It's not surprising that Mr. Seizan would commit suicide".

320
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:31,947
By the way, Mr. Kuroki, early this morning,

321
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,547
you carried Mr. Seizan's body to the bamboo forest

322
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:34,847
where he was found, didn't you?

323
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:39,847
No! You talked to Mr. Seizan on the phone, didn't you?

324
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:43,247
That's an entry level trick!

325
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,947
You recorded Mr. Seizan's voice beforehand,

326
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:51,047
and set the voice that you edited on the answer phone.

327
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,447
But like I've kept telling you time and again,

328
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,847
I have an alibi.

329
00:18:55,847 --> 00:19:00,247
You mean, you were at sea with us?

330
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:04,847
Ran, please show Officer Daimatsu the sketchbook Conan gave you.

331
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,147
Here you go.

332
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:11,347
Bamboos grow way faster than we imagine them too.

333
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,447
Very true.

334
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:17,647
Please show us how much they have grown in a period of three days.

335
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,947
About 2m.

336
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:21,247
Amazing.

337
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,247
Bamboos grow greatly at once,

338
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,347
when like this morning after the rain clears

339
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,847
and the temperature rises.

340
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:34,847
Mr. Kuroki, you took advantage of this and killed Mr. Seizan!

341
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,947
This morning you carried Mr. Seizan

342
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:40,747
who you put to sleep with sleeping pills to the bamboo forest.

343
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:46,447
You made Mr. Seizan sit in front of a bamboo you chose

344
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:49,047
and put a rope around his neck.

345
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:52,547
Then you cut the bamboo that was around Mr. Seizan.

346
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:00,447
You made sure that a lot of sun would shine

347
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:04,347
on the bamboo that you tied the rope onto.

348
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:06,947
The cry of the bush warblers we heard this morning,

349
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:11,947
was the cry of warning aimed at you, Mr. Kuroki.

350
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:16,347
The bamboo that was showered with a lot of sunshine grew rapidly

351
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:20,647
and eventually suspended Mr. Seizan in the air.

352
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,247
This is how Mr. Seizan died

353
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:27,047
while we were out fishing with you, Mr. Kuroki.

354
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:30,547
The white sawdust on your socks is the evidence!

355
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,347
This is Oyster White.

356
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,947
Just what kind of evidence is this?

357
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,947
No, that's not Oyster White.

358
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:45,147
Please take a good look.

359
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:49,447
That's sawdust that fell on you

360
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,447
when you cut the bamboo!

361
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,947
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:02,647
It's just as you say.

363
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,447
I've been drawing on behalf of Mr. Seizan

364
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,347
since a few years ago.

365
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:11,247
But I wanted to sign my name on them

366
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:15,547
instead of Mr. Seizan's at least once.

367
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:18,047
I want to give my paintings a place in the sun at least once.

368
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:22,447
I wanted somebody to look at them.

369
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,747
So I...

370
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,747
"Mouri Detective Agency"

371
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:08,247
All right. It's done.

372
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:09,647
Really?

373
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,147
Let me see...

374
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:16,947
What's that supposed to be?

375
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:21,247
You idiot! Don't you know about realism?

376
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:24,347
It's nothing more than a child's doodling!

377
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:26,447
What?

378
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,747
Even Conan can draw way better than this, right, Conan?

379
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:32,047
Don't compare me with a brat like him!

380
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:33,547
I'm just telling you the truth.

381
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,647
You have no sense for this piece of artwork!

382
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,947
I'm glad that I don't.

383
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,447
"Next Episode" -So where's the restroom...

384
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:52,847
It's Wolf Face.

385
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,947
Amazing.

386
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,847
Don't you hear a strange noise?

387
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,747
A hidden camera?

388
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,347
Nichiuri TV?

389
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,247
This is...

390
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,347
Next Conan,

391
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:13,447
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 1)"

392
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,515
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,515
"Hidden camera"

394
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,115
The stage of the next episode is a square jungle!

395
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:21,215
A tiger pro wrestler.

396
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:22,915
Striped pants?
