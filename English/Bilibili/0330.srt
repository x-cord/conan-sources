1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,840
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,840
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
The bond of friendship is shattered by sad mistrust.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,940
Money can't buy happiness.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,667
When we, the Youth Detective Squad,

9
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,067
come along to camp with Dr. Agasa,

10
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,767
we happen to run into four university students

11
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,867
who are a part of the Outdoor Club, riding a luxurious camping car.

12
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:52,367
They are Reiji Fukuura,

13
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,567
Yasumi Shirafuji

14
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,667
Haruka Tendo

15
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,967
and Takuto Meshiai.

16
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:03,467
But while we were all having barbecue and chatting away

17
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:06,667
Ms. Shirafuji disappears.

18
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,167
So while we left to look for her,

19
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,067
we headed to the scenic point to watch the fireworks

20
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:13,167
but she wasn't there either.

21
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,067
On the way back to the camping grounds,

22
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:17,667
we find Ms. Yasumi Shirafuji lying dead

23
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,467
in the middle of a winding road!

24
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,267
Which means that the killer is someone

25
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,167
who could freely take the bicycle from the camping car.

26
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,267
Yeah.

27
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:33,067
Her friends who belong to the same circle.

28
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:37,467
The probability of the killer being among the three is high!

29
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:48,067
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 2)"

30
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,567
Wait a minute, officer!

31
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,567
Why do we have to be questioned for alibi?

32
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,467
Yasumi died of an accident, didn't she?

33
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,867
Well, it's just to be sure!

34
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:03,667
So, please tell us where you all were

35
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,667
around 5 pm to 6 pm when Ms. Yasumi died.

36
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,867
"Haruka Tendo (21)" -Well, we were all doing different things

37
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,467
moving around here and there.

38
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:14,567
"Takuto Meshiai (23)" -I was fishing alone.

39
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:18,167
"Reiji Fukuura (21)" -I was keeping watch over time and camping!

40
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:21,467
Then, who drives the camping car?

41
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,467
Reiji used to be in a car club before so he's good at driving.

42
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:26,567
Hey...

43
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,467
If it's just moving the car, all three of us can do it!

44
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,167
Meshiai sometimes takes over driving for me,

45
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:36,667
and Haruka's the one who brings this car to our meeting place!

46
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,767
Why are you asking us something like this?

47
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,167
Well, I figured if you can't drive the car,

48
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,167
it would be impossible to move the corpse to where it was.

49
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,767
So, you're suspecting us after all?

50
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,267
Yeah, right!

51
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,467
If you leave Ms. Yasumi's body

52
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:55,267
in the middle of the street beforehand,

53
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:59,867
and pretend not to see her on the way uphill,

54
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,167
then act as if you saw her for the first time on your way back,

55
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,567
it's not impossible.

56
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:07,967
Moreover, there aren't many cars going through here,

57
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,567
and if the driver is the killer

58
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,767
with nobody riding in the passenger's seat

59
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,767
when going uphill...

60
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,367
It's true that when I was driving,

61
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:19,467
nobody was sitting in the passenger's seat.

62
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,067
If I drove in the oncoming lane,

63
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,767
the view outside the window would change

64
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,667
and somebody sitting in the backseat would've noticed,

65
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,567
and besides, I could never do such thing as

66
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,767
to avoid somebody lying in the middle of the road

67
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,367
without changing lanes.

68
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,967
Besides, when we passed here the sunroof was open,

69
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,267
and we were sticking our heads out of it,

70
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,867
but there was nothing on the road.

71
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,367
You stuck your heads out of the sunroof?

72
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,767
Yes. When we did so last year,

73
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:49,567
we saw fireworks from between the mountains.

74
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:52,767
So, we wanted to show those children the same thing too.

75
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,267
Well, but you can only catch a view of it for about ten seconds

76
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,367
until turning at the curve.

77
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:01,167
But if you open the sunroof

78
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,867
after you successfully avoid the corpse then...

79
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,767
That is why I said it's impossible to avoid the corpse!

80
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:09,467
Right. The car didn't weave

81
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,067
before or after the sunroof was opened.

82
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,867
What is that?

83
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,767
There are strange looking lines on the edge of the sunroof.

84
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,967
It can't be?

85
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,067
Conan?

86
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,967
Hey, Conan!

87
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,067
What are these lines?

88
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,867
This is blood.

89
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,567
Blood dried in streaks.

90
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,867
I see. So, that's the story.

91
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,167
I've figured this case out!

92
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,867
And the only one who could've worked out

93
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:56,067
this high-level trick is

94
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,667
that person!

95
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,367
My flashlight.

96
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,667
There!

97
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,467
Thank God. Thank you. Genta!

98
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,467
Are you all right?

99
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,967
Thank you, Ai...

100
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,667
Please be careful!

101
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,067
It's sort of windy today

102
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:19,067
and the car is slanted because it's a slope here.

103
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:22,467
It's not too bad up here on the roof of the car, is it?

104
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,867
Because the night view is so nice.

105
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,567
This is the place

106
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,867
where we watched the fireworks from the car!

107
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,167
It's over here?

108
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,267
Wait a second.

109
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,967
Then, the trick that I was thinking of a while ago...

110
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,467
Hey, everyone!

111
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:42,167
It's dangerous climbing up a place like that.

112
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,267
Conan?

113
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:49,467
Hey, Conan! Where do you think you're going?

114
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,867
Close call...

115
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:54,367
I was about to fall for the killer's trap.

116
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,467
The real trick is...

117
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,667
I found it! This is it!

118
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,367
Did you find something?

119
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,267
Yes, a vinyl sheet.

120
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,167
It seems to have blood on it!

121
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,567
What?

122
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,167
True.

123
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,167
We'd better report this right away to Inspector Megure.

124
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,467
But I sure am in a fix.

125
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,967
Anybody can use this trick

126
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,367
and there is no evidence to specify the killer.

127
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,167
I'll just have to show the sheet

128
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,867
and watch how he responds.

129
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,067
What? A blood smeared vinyl sheet?

130
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,367
Yes! It was stuck on a guard rail

131
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,967
about 50m downhill from here!

132
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:43,867
I see. It sure is blood.

133
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:47,167
Hey, isn't that the sheet that we always use

134
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,667
when we go camping?

135
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,867
What did you say?

136
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,467
Will you come here and confirm it?

137
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:53,667
Yeah.

138
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,167
Just as I thought!

139
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,667
Yeah.

140
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,767
We haven't been using it recently

141
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,667
because it has a hole in it.

142
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,267
But why would it be in a place like this?

143
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,667
No good.

144
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,367
None of them are reacting at all.

145
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,667
I've got to search the mountains

146
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,867
and look for some other evidence.

147
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,867
I see. I get it.

148
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,967
Blood splattered on the killer.

149
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,467
I can understand that it was done on the spur of the moment.

150
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,967
But, now the killer has no way out.

151
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,867
The killer's made a grave mistake.

152
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,167
So, like I've been telling you!

153
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,867
At around 7 pm when we passed here

154
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,867
with the camping car to look for Yasumi,

155
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,867
there was nothing on the road.

156
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,667
And two hours later, when we came back,

157
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:49,667
we found Yasumi lying in the middle of the road!

158
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:53,467
The only thing that was on the road was the wooden fence

159
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,467
that fell from right above this road!

160
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,667
And didn't you say so yourself, officer?

161
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,667
That the place where the fence was broken,

162
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,567
the place where the broken piece was

163
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,367
and the place where Yasumi's body was

164
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,467
were all in one straight line.

165
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:10,667
The traces of the wheels were found near the broken fence

166
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,667
and the bicycle was stuck in the bushes outside the guard rail

167
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,467
where the piece of broken fence was, so...

168
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:19,167
Yasumi probably accidentally crashed through the fence

169
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,967
and fell to her death.

170
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,967
You also explained that we didn't see Yasumi

171
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,367
when we first passed here

172
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,567
because she was probably stuck in the bushes with her bicycle

173
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,867
and then slid down to the road

174
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:37,267
just before we passed here on our way back, didn't you?

175
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,967
Yes, that's right.

176
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,367
Then, it was an accident after all!

177
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,367
Why do we have to be suspected?

178
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,567
There are no blood stains

179
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:51,967
on the road that Ms. Yasumi was thought to have fallen to.

180
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,667
If she crashed through the fence and fell,

181
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,367
isn't it strange that there's not even a drop of blood

182
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,067
on the road where she fell?

183
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:02,567
No. Are you saying that Yasumi was...

184
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,967
And this vinyl sheet!

185
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,667
If these blood stains are Ms. Yasumi's,

186
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,567
it has something to do with the killing...

187
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,367
It sure is connected to the killing!

188
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,367
What?

189
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,167
Dr. Agasa?

190
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,567
Dr. Agasa.

191
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,167
With the window closed,

192
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,967
it's hard to hear my deduction, isn't it?

193
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:26,167
Will you please open the sunroof for me?

194
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,667
Oh, yes!

195
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,667
Why are you on top of the car like that?

196
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,967
I just wanted to know what it feels like.

197
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,167
To be loaded on the roof of a camping car after being killed.

198
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,667
Just like how Ms. Yasumi was!

199
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,889
To be loaded on the roof of a camping car after being killed.

200
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,389
Just like how Ms. Yasumi was!

201
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,389
Which means that the killer loaded Ms. Yasumi's body

202
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,389
on the roof of this car after all.

203
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,589
Yes! The killer under the pretense of going to look for Ms. Yasumi

204
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,189
got into the car together with us

205
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,689
and dropped Ms. Yasumi's body

206
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,989
from the top of the roof on the way!

207
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:13,189
Ms. Yasumi was probably killed this way.

208
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:14,589
The killer probably asked Ms. Yasumi

209
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:19,989
to climb up and wipe the dirty sunroof or something.

210
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:23,789
And Ms. Yasumi probably agreed,

211
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:26,589
which after the killer snuck up behind her and hit her head

212
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:29,289
with a stone or something!

213
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,689
As proof of that, there is a streak of reddish black line

214
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:35,089
on the glass of the sunroof!

215
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,089
A streak of blood that remained in the corner

216
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:42,389
when the killer wiped off the blood that splattered on when he hit her!

217
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,089
But, gramps,

218
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:48,389
how was Yasumi's body dropped just right in place like that?

219
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,889
We were all in the car, you know?

220
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,489
Fukuura.

221
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,489
When you tried to avoid the fence

222
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,989
that came falling on the road right above,

223
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,689
you slammed on the brakes and drifted slightly, didn't you?

224
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,889
Yeah. So what?

225
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,189
I see. You took advantage of the impact of drifting

226
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,389
and made the body go over the guard rail,

227
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,189
throwing it onto the road below.

228
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,189
You left the debris of the fence on the road

229
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:17,489
as a marker as to where to drift the car.

230
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:21,889
That way, you would be able to find the body on the way back.

231
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,089
Hold it.

232
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:26,889
But there are many sharp curves before passing that road!

233
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,589
If the dead body's not fastened to something,

234
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,689
it would fall way before that point!

235
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:34,389
Were there masking tape or ropes on Yasumi's body?

236
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:35,889
About that...

237
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,989
Come to think of it, her belt.

238
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:44,789
That is the same one that Yoko Okino was wearing the other day!

239
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:47,489
Something was on her belt!

240
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,789
But how could that have been used?

241
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,389
Didn't you notice?

242
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,389
The decoration on the tip of her belt,

243
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,789
only one edge was tied.

244
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:01,289
Yeah, I saw that too.

245
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:03,589
I thought it was a fashion of some kind.

246
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:06,489
Oh, right! I forgot to show you something.

247
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,589
Officer Takagi!

248
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,789
Will you please close the sunroof for now?

249
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,989
Oh, all right.

250
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,489
See! There's the blood streak I mentioned a while ago!

251
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:17,689
It's a little away from the edge, isn't it?

252
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:20,289
Why do you think it's that way?

253
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,589
It's probably because the sunroof was a little open

254
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,389
when the person killed Kazumi!

255
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,889
Why was the sunroof a little open?

256
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:30,389
What do you mean why?

257
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,089
I see!

258
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,589
If one edge of the belt was tied, then...

259
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:36,989
Exactly!

260
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:40,389
The killer pinched the tied part to the sunroof

261
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,589
and fixed Ms. Yasumi's body in place on top of the car!

262
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,489
After bending her body in half!

263
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,889
The killer left the sunroof a little open

264
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,689
so that he could carry out the murder smoothly.

265
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:53,989
The killer left it open because unless they did so,

266
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:58,289
after they hit Ms. Yasumi to death on top of the car,

267
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:01,589
they would've had to go down, open the sunroof,

268
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,289
then climb up again to stick the string between the sunroof

269
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:09,389
and finally come down again to close the sunroof.

270
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:13,489
Since there is only one button to open the sunroof by the driver's seat.

271
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:16,589
You did say a while ago that when you first passed by here,

272
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,889
you opened the sunroof and watched the fireworks,

273
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,489
but who opened it?

274
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:24,089
Of course, I did since I was driving the car.

275
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,789
Haruka asked me to open it so...

276
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,289
That was because...

277
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:32,689
I just wanted to do what was good last year, this year too.

278
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:36,189
I see. If so, it's not difficult to assume that

279
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,789
someone will ask to open the sunroof this year too.

280
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:41,489
Even if it is not so, since you're at the driver's seat,

281
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,289
you could secretly open it without anybody noticing it.

282
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,989
Hey.

283
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:48,289
You opened the sunroof

284
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,789
and removed the tied part that was stuck to the window

285
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,989
and let the corpse go free then you drifted the car on the road

286
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:55,989
where the piece of broken fence was,

287
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,889
and swing her body down on the road below.

288
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,589
In other words, the one who can work out this trick

289
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:04,089
is the one with skilled driving techniques like you

290
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,189
who used to belong to a car club!

291
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:08,089
You'd think so, right?

292
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:12,289
But, the fact is not so!

293
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,189
Actually, I thought so at first too.

294
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,189
But, I had forgotten that

295
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:20,389
this car had been going uphill

296
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,589
and this was just the place where the sunroof was opened!

297
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,289
But, after seeing the blood smeared vinyl sheet it dawned on me!

298
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:31,989
If the vinyl sheet is laid under the body of the corpse

299
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:34,589
and friction is decreased,

300
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,589
it's easy.

301
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,889
The minute the the sunroof is opened

302
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,389
because of the impact of the wind and the slope,

303
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,689
the dead body would slide off the top of the car!

304
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:49,889
Which means that any of you three could've committed the murder.

305
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,689
I'm very sorry to say this,

306
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,489
but I would like you all to come to the station with me.

307
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,589
You don't have to do that!

308
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,889
Because the killer has made a mistake wearing clothes!

309
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,389
Wearing clothes?

310
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,489
Will you three stand up and go out to the corridor?

311
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:08,689
Geez. I'll tell you.

312
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:13,089
So, what can you find out doing something like this?

313
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,389
What's the matter, Ayumi?

314
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,689
See, her belt...

315
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:22,389
Her belt is not through the belt loop of her jeans!

316
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,189
Then, don't tell me that...

317
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:25,889
You're the killer?

318
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,789
No! I was in a rush when coming from home.

319
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:33,789
Ayumi, you took a picture of everyone, didn't you?

320
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:34,889
Yes.

321
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,389
If I remember it right, I think you took a rear view shot of her too,

322
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,089
Wait a second...

323
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,189
Here it is! This is the one!

324
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:49,289
But her belt is through the belt loop like it should be!

325
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,889
It was through the belt loop at first

326
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,489
and why isn't it now?

327
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:57,189
Well I took a shower in this camping car at sundown

328
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:58,689
so I may have done it then.

329
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:00,989
Is it necessary to remove your belt

330
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:04,089
when you take off your jeans?

331
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,889
It's because I changed into a different pair of jeans.

332
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,989
You've changed jeans.

333
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:11,189
Yes.

334
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,589
Could I have a look at it?

335
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,789
Yes.

336
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,189
It sure looks like the one you're wearing

337
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,889
is the same as the one in this picture

338
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:24,089
although you say you changed jeans.

339
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,889
Well, I guess so.

340
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:27,489
Then, I don't mean to be rude,

341
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,289
but can you please show it to me?

342
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,689
The jeans you wore before you changed.

343
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:32,789
Well...

344
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,889
You can't show it to him even if you wanted to, right?

345
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:40,189
It's probably the jeans that you were wearing when you hit Ms. Yasumi,

346
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,989
and you threw it away in the mountains

347
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:44,589
somewhere with the clothes you were wearing back then, right?

348
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,489
Because they were splattered with Ms. Yasumi's blood!

349
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,389
But she let us ride this car

350
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,889
when we went to go watch the fireworks!

351
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:56,989
Right!

352
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,489
Why would she want us to ride in the car

353
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:01,189
that she had the dead body on?

354
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:04,489
Rather, she had to make us ride the car!

355
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:07,489
If I followed this camping car with my car from behind,

356
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:11,389
I would see the dead body sliding off the camping car.

357
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,089
But...

358
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:17,989
you're so rich.

359
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:20,189
I'm not rich.

360
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,289
I'm an ordinary university student

361
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,489
with no special talent.

362
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,889
That's why unless I acted rich,

363
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,789
nobody would even look at me.

364
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,889
I really had a tough time.

365
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,189
I worked part-time with all my might

366
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:37,589
and even borrowed money to rent this expensive camping car

367
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,789
in order to bring everybody to the beach and the mountains.

368
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,489
But because they were the first friends I had,

369
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,989
so I did my best...

370
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:49,189
Yes. I thought they were my friends.

371
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:52,389
Until I heard what Yasumi said.

372
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:56,889
Didn't you know?

373
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,789
It's all just a bunch of lies

374
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,489
that she's from a rich family!

375
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,689
I could tell right off the bat that she wasn't.

376
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:04,689
So I followed her.

377
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:07,189
Sure enough, she was living in a rundown apartment!

378
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,489
Which means I was being deceived for four years?

379
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:15,289
Then why don't you tell her to stop lying?

380
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,489
You're her best friend, aren't you?

381
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,789
Yasumi.

382
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,289
Best friend?

383
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,289
All she means to me is money.

384
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,989
If not, do you think I could pretend that I didn't know

385
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:25,089
for four years?

386
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,889
It was really tough for me to keep from laughing though.

387
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:30,789
Besides, if I told her and she gets angry at me

388
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,789
demanding to get back all she dished out up to now,

389
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:33,989
what would I do?

390
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,589
I don't think she's that kind of girl.

391
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,689
Too bad, Reiji.

392
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:41,489
I guess you were sort of looking forward to getting rich, right?

393
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,489
Yes. It's too bad.

394
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:46,189
I guess I'll bid her farewell as soon as we graduate.

395
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:48,889
Well, I guess I'll have her devote herself and money to me till then.

396
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,389
Dear Ms. Richie-Rich, Haruka!

397
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,389
I believed.

398
00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:00,089
I believed that they were my best friends!

399
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:02,589
That's why you killed Yasumi

400
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:04,289
and tried to frame Reiji up as the killer.

401
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,789
Yes! I got angry at her just as she thought I would!

402
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,389
At that woman who had dared to step all over my feelings of friendship!

403
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,989
That's not being friends at all!

404
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,689
That's not being friends at all to begin with!

405
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,389
Yes, she's right.

406
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:23,489
It's no better than the vending machine of juice cans.

407
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,389
If you put money into the machine, it will quench your thirst,

408
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:29,889
but if you don't insert money, it won't give you anything.

409
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:33,489
You can't buy people's hearts with money.

410
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,689
Ai's final remark was splendid!

411
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,589
Yes, it made me feel good!

412
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:27,489
You sure can make good remarks when you want to, right, Haibara?

413
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,789
Not really.

414
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,589
It's some phrase I heard somebody else say.

415
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,989
I thought that's how it would normally be.

416
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:43,289
Back then, Ran refused Sonoko's invitation to go skiing with her.

417
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:44,689
When I asked her why,

418
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:46,689
she told me a bit depressed,

419
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,189
that she didn't have enough allowance that month.

420
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:52,389
I told her to have rich Sonoko pay her way too,

421
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:55,889
then she angrily looked at me and said...

422
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,989
I would never do such a thing

423
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:01,789
because I want to stay friends with Sonoko forever.

424
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,889
That's what she said.

425
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,989
That's why I felt that

426
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,189
their relationship with Haruka seemed kind of fake.

427
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,689
They seemed to be flattering her

428
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,589
only because she was rich.

429
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:17,489
But, you were really cool!

430
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:18,989
Ai...

431
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,289
It's okay. You can call me informally.

432
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:25,189
You want to call me informally, don't you?

433
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,189
Really, Ai?

434
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,389
Then can...

435
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:35,589
We call you informally too.

436
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,189
No, the rest of you can't.

437
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,289
-Okay. -Okay.

438
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:49,289
"Next Episode" -I want to see Sonoko's villa in Karuizawa too!

439
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,189
And besides, knowing Sonoko for what she is,

440
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:57,389
she'll probably think up some bad ideas like always.

441
00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:59,089
What?

442
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,789
He's not in bed.

443
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,389
Next Conan,

444
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:13,489
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 1)"

445
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:17,157
Next Conan Hint:

446
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,357
"Curry rice"

447
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,157
-Next episode... -After camping comes tennis.

448
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:21,257
After the tent comes the net.

449
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:23,503
After barbecue comes spicy curry.
