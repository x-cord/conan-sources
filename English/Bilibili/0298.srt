1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,324
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:05,724
How will Pops Kogoro's statement help the case?

4
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,824
How will it affect the Prosecution's, the Defense and Conan's case?

5
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:09,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:13,724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:48,004
Ms. Kisaki and Ms. Kujo, the "Madonna" of the prosecutor's office

9
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:50,604
are to battle it out in court again.

10
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:54,904
The case is about the defendant is accused to breaking into an office

11
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,304
and when the victim found out, they fought,

12
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,704
he accidentally kills the victim during the struggle.

13
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:04,904
But Prosecutor Kujo claims that he did intend to kill the victim

14
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:07,904
and he is charged with burglary and murder!

15
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:12,004
Pops Kogoro and I start to investigate

16
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:15,604
and we discover something at the crime scene.

17
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:16,704
It can't be...

18
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,104
I knew it!

19
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,104
I don't get it.

20
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:26,304
The partition is blocking the way, I can't see you from here!

21
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:27,704
What did you say?

22
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:30,304
Mr. Akiyama, what is the meaning of this?

23
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:34,704
Watch it! Stop wandering around!

24
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:38,304
What's this?

25
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,604
That's it, I've got it now!

26
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:42,504
I've solved the mystery behind this case.

27
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:50,004
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 2)"

28
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,004
Thank you for your help.

29
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:58,404
No problem. Was I of any help to your case?

30
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:00,304
Well, the police and the prosecutor's office

31
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:03,404
already went through the place thoroughly.

32
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:07,504
I didn't expect to find anything to overturn the case.

33
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,104
I see.

34
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,304
I know.

35
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:14,704
Why don't you come to my restaurant now and have something to eat?

36
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,004
I'll bring out a special wine.

37
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:18,604
No, that'd be too much.

38
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:20,404
He was nice enough to offer!

39
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,104
It wouldn't hurt to drop by!

40
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,904
Kogoro...

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,304
Have you forgotten, Ran's waiting for you at home?

42
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:28,804
Your daughter?

43
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,004
Yes.

44
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,404
Why don't you ask her to come too?

45
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:34,704
Geez, that's nice of you.

46
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:38,604
The more the merrier when it comes to dining, I always say.

47
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,504
Thank you, we accept then.

48
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:55,004
This is a very good wine.

49
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:57,404
I'm glad you like it.

50
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,904
I like the atmosphere of your restaurant.

51
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,204
Thank you very much.

52
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:06,304
I'll be testifying at the next trial,

53
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,804
please go easy on me.

54
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,004
You found your father-in-law's body

55
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,504
when you went to return something he'd forgotten, didn't you?

56
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:17,804
Yes. He had dinner here and left without his glasses.

57
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:18,804
His glasses?

58
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:20,204
Yes, his reading glasses.

59
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:24,504
Take your time and enjoy your meal.

60
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,804
This restaurant looks fancy

61
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,504
but the pasta isn't very good, right?

62
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:35,704
You're right.

63
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:38,304
The olive oil is a little heavy.

64
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:45,304
By the way, how are things for the next trial going?

65
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:47,504
Not too good.

66
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:51,504
You'll lose unless you change your approach.

67
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,204
And what do you mean by that?

68
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:56,504
You won't get him off on the burglary and murder charge.

69
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,204
So you've to stress the fact that he did it out of love for his daughter

70
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:04,104
and that the victim was also at fault.

71
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,504
Are you saying I should accept the prosecution's charges

72
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:09,304
and ask for leniency due to extenuating circumstances?

73
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:10,804
What choice do you have?

74
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,204
Don't be ridiculous!

75
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:14,904
The defendant insists that he had no intention of killing him!

76
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:16,704
You believe everything your client tells you,

77
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:18,504
that's why "Madonna" always gets you in court.

78
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:22,704
Don't you tell me how to do my job!

79
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:25,704
I'm not helping you because I want to, you know?

80
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:29,204
Come on you two, that's enough!

81
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,504
Why do you always fight like this?

82
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:34,704
I'm sure that on the list of things found on the crime scene.

83
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,904
I'm sure it was in here somewhere.

84
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,304
Here it is!

85
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:43,904
I've found it.

86
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:46,104
The undeniable proof!

87
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,004
Conan?

88
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:51,204
What is it? Why are you looking through the files?

89
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:53,904
Well, something in here was bothering me.

90
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,504
What do you mean?

91
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:58,604
Look, see this list of things found on the crime scene...

92
00:05:58,604 --> 00:05:59,904
Hey, you!

93
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:03,504
You keep messing around with important documents!

94
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,604
Good grief!

95
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,004
Well if you're going to be like that,

96
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:12,704
why don't you think of something that'll help mom?

97
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,004
She's so stubborn.

98
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:17,104
I hope "Madonna" beats her in court.

99
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,304
Just listen to you!

100
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:21,404
I'll bet you just don't have the confidence to beat Ms. Kujo.

101
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,704
You've got some nerve!

102
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,004
She's no match for me.

103
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:27,904
Then why don't you defend him?

104
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:31,704
He can't. Dad doesn't have a license to practice law.

105
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:34,604
Why can't he be a special counsel then?

106
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,104
What's that?

107
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,104
If someone with a license to practice law

108
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,604
or if the defendant makes a request,

109
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:45,104
the person they indicate can act as a lawyer.

110
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:51,204
Show the court how brilliant your deductive powers are.

111
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:54,404
My brilliant deductive powers?

112
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:59,304
Well, any crime can be solved by me.

113
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:03,704
If you insist, let me think about it.

114
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:09,004
What? Him as special counsel?

115
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:13,104
Yes! He wants to help you so much, mom.

116
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:15,604
Thanks but no thanks.

117
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:16,604
But why?

118
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,704
Dad really wants to help!

119
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:24,104
So you say but I just don't think he has the ability.

120
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:25,304
But...

121
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,804
I have a message from Pops Kogoro,

122
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:31,304
he wants you and the building superintendent

123
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:33,804
to come to the crime scene tonight.

124
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,904
What? To the crime scene?

125
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,504
He said you'll see something

126
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:40,304
that will change the way things are going in court.

127
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,304
Change the way things are going in court?

128
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,004
I'm sorry to have to put you through this again.

129
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:50,204
I don't mind but what do you want me to do?

130
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,704
I'm not too clear on that myself.

131
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,004
Mr. Akiyama.

132
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,504
Will you do exactly what you did that night?

133
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:04,104
Hey, Conan. Where is Kogoro?

134
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,504
He stepped outside to get things ready.

135
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:09,004
Outside?

136
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:10,604
"Takuya Akiyama (56)" -All right, I understand.

137
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,604
"Superintendent" -Just do exactly like the other night, right?

138
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:17,204
Let's see, there was no one here that night when I got here,

139
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,304
Mr. Arima looked through that little window

140
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:21,104
to see inside the office.

141
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,504
And he said somebody was inside, didn't he?

142
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,604
Yes, that's right.

143
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,504
So I took a look too and...

144
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:30,104
What is that?

145
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:32,004
I don't believe it!

146
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:33,304
Impossible!

147
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,604
Is there somebody inside?

148
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:36,104
I don't understand.

149
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:39,104
Take a look for yourself, Ms. Kisaki.

150
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,704
What is that?

151
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:46,804
I set things up exactly like Pops Kogoro told me to.

152
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,704
Set things up?

153
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,604
Are you saying he knows who the killer is?

154
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:55,504
Yes, he said he'd explain everything in court.

155
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,604
"Second Trial of Burglary and Murder Case"

156
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:09,804
With mom and dad on the same side, we can't lose.

157
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:14,304
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -Who would have thought,

158
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,304
she'd ask Kogoro Mouri be appointed special counsel,

159
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:21,604
Attorney Kisaki must be really desperate.

160
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,704
All rise!

161
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:37,704
Mr. Akiyama.

162
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,304
You stated that you looked into the victim's office

163
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:40,504
through the small window

164
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:43,904
and saw him being beaten by the defendant,

165
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,804
is that correct?

166
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:47,404
Yes.

167
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:50,904
How many times did the assailant's strike the victim?

168
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:53,704
I saw three blows being delivered.

169
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,404
Shortly after that,

170
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,904
you heard the sound of the victim falling to the floor, correct?

171
00:09:58,904 --> 00:09:59,904
Yes.

172
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,004
End of questioning!

173
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,604
Does the defense have any questions for the witness?

174
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,704
I do.

175
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:10,604
Mr. Akiyama.

176
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:14,104
You claim that you saw the victim being hit

177
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:17,204
but did you see the assailant's face?

178
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:18,904
No, I...

179
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:23,404
I didn't actually see the assailant's face.

180
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,704
What do you mean by that?

181
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:29,304
What exactly did you see then?

182
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:33,504
The light outside cast the assailant's shadow on the wall.

183
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,104
Order in the court!

184
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:42,104
So you're saying you merely saw the assailant's shadow, correct?

185
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:44,004
Yes, that's correct.

186
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,504
It's the same thing.

187
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:48,704
As long as he saw the assailant, seeing his shadow is good enough.

188
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:51,204
Let me ask you one more time.

189
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:54,704
Mr. Akiyama, is the defendant here,

190
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:58,904
the assailant you saw that evening?

191
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:03,904
No, like I said, I only saw a shadow on the wall.

192
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:07,704
So you're not sure that the defendant is the assailant then, correct?

193
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,104
Yes.

194
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:10,704
Thank you.

195
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:14,804
No more questions.

196
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:18,004
Gosh! What is dad doing?

197
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,904
He hasn't done anything except sleep.

198
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:23,204
Don't worry, his time will come.

199
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,904
Are you sure?

200
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,804
I would like to call Mr. Arima to the witness stand.

201
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,604
Mr. Arima, you and Mr. Akiyama heard

202
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,304
the sound of the victim falling, didn't you?

203
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,804
Yes, I'm certain of it.

204
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:42,004
The door was locked so you broke it down by ramming into it

205
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,804
and then ran inside.

206
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:47,204
Yes. But the assailant's had already escaped through the window

207
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,304
and my father-in-law,

208
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:51,904
I mean, Mr. Otsu was on the floor.

209
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,504
And what about the safe?

210
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:57,104
It was open.

211
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:58,504
No more questions.

212
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:00,304
Defense, your turn.

213
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,004
Here goes.

214
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:08,204
Guess it's time for me to liven up this boring trial.

215
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,604
Good luck, dad.

216
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,304
I'll see how he does first!

217
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:39,254
Special counsel, you may proceed to question the witness

218
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:41,354
Yes, sir!

219
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:43,154
Mr. Arima.

220
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:47,054
You claimed that you arrived at the victim's office a little past 9 pm

221
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,454
to deliver an item he'd forgotten, is that correct?

222
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:53,054
Yes, my father-in-law forgot his reading glasses at my restaurant.

223
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:56,954
But the office was locked and you couldn't enter.

224
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:58,754
That's right.

225
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:02,154
The door was actually unlocked, wasn't it?

226
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:05,054
And the victim was in his office

227
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:08,754
counting the money in the safe.

228
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,754
What are you getting at?

229
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:12,554
Are you implying that I...

230
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:14,454
No, I'm merely pointing out the fact that

231
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:18,054
you could have committed the crime too.

232
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,054
Ridiculous!

233
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:21,254
Why would I kill my father-in-law?

234
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,954
When it comes to money,

235
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:26,654
you can't trust your own family.

236
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:30,754
Unlike usual, Pops Kogoro is actually making some sense.

237
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,054
Objection!

238
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:35,354
Special counsel is merely voicing his own opinion!

239
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,354
Objection granted.

240
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:41,554
Special counsel shall stick to the facts at hand.

241
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,854
But based on my many years of experience,

242
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:50,254
the first person to report the crime is usually the guilty one.

243
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:53,254
All right then, based on your many years of experience,

244
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:56,554
how do you explain the things left on the crime scene

245
00:13:56,554 --> 00:14:01,454
and the defendant's fingerprints on the safe?

246
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:05,154
When the witness and the victim were fighting over money,

247
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:08,854
the defendant was looking in through the window, watching them.

248
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,854
Well, that's a new theory.

249
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:16,054
Then after the witness hit the victim over the head and left,

250
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,154
the defendant took the opportunity to enter the office

251
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:22,654
to steal the money in the safe.

252
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:27,354
Then who was the assailant Mr. Akiyama saw?

253
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:30,954
The truth is, the victim wasn't dead yet.

254
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,654
He regained consciousness and struggled with the defendant.

255
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:37,654
Hey, now you're going way off base.

256
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:38,854
What you're saying then is,

257
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:43,054
the defendant did indeed commit the murder

258
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:45,754
I guess I am.

259
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,354
What are you saying?

260
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,754
You're supposed to be here to defend the client!

261
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,754
I'm a famous private detective!

262
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:55,554
I'm here to solve this case!

263
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:58,654
I was a fool to depend on you.

264
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,354
Forget it! You just keep out of my way!

265
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:05,154
How dare you? I'm not finished, I'm getting to the best part.

266
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,354
Family fuels should be carried out elsewhere.

267
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:13,254
I hate you, dad!

268
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:16,854
I guess it's time I took Pops Kogoro out.

269
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:20,054
You just sit down and keep your mouth shut!

270
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:22,054
Am I your decoration piece?

271
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:29,354
Your honor, I'd like to retract my previous statements.

272
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,654
Just forget it.

273
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:35,454
The defendant entered that office before Mr. Arima,

274
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:38,554
not after.

275
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:42,354
The victim walked in on him while he was trying to get the safe open,

276
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:47,254
he hit the victim inadvertently and ran out of the office.

277
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,754
The question is what happened after that.

278
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:54,154
The defendant thought he had killed the victim

279
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,554
but the truth is, he had just knocked him unconscious.

280
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:02,954
Someone else arrived on the scene shortly after and killed him!

281
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:05,554
Are you saying that it was me?

282
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:08,554
You claimed that the victim forgot his reading glasses

283
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:10,354
in your restaurant, isn't that correct?

284
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:11,554
Yes.

285
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,054
Did he need his reading glasses during meals too?

286
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:18,154
Well, he needs them to read the menu.

287
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:20,354
That's strange.

288
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,454
The indictment states that the victim opened the safe

289
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:25,654
because the defendant threatened him.

290
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:27,754
The victim didn't have his glasses,

291
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:32,354
I wonder how he managed to get the safe open

292
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:35,754
and his office was dark,

293
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:37,754
the only light was from the neon sign outside?

294
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:40,854
How should I know?

295
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:43,854
The victim was still alive

296
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:47,254
when you delivered his glasses, wasn't he?

297
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:49,054
Father, are you in?

298
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:52,154
What happened?

299
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,054
Your head's bleeding!

300
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,654
Leave me alone! It's nothing.

301
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,554
That was right after he wandered in on the burglar.

302
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:01,054
I'm sure when he regained consciousness,

303
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,054
the first thing he was concerned with was the money in the safe.

304
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:04,754
I have your glasses here.

305
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:13,554
When you saw the money,

306
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,954
you thought of killing him

307
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:22,054
and you hit over the head with the ashtray.

308
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:23,054
Prosecutor!

309
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,054
I came here as a witness.

310
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,954
Why am I being treated like a suspect?

311
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:32,154
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten one very important detail.

312
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:35,354
The witness has an alibi.

313
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,354
You bet I do!

314
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:38,954
I was outside of the office when father was beaten

315
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:40,654
and fell to the floor,

316
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:43,054
Mr. Akiyama was with me.

317
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:47,054
Didn't you hear Mr. Akiyama's testimony?

318
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:50,654
He said that he never saw the assailant.

319
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,454
But he saw a shadow.

320
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:56,254
Yes, a shadow on the wall.

321
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:59,454
You committed murder blinded by the money,

322
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,754
now you had to make it look like a burglary, you were desperate.

323
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,254
Then you came up with an idea.

324
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:09,554
That is using the clock in the victim's office

325
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,854
that has a decoration attached on it.

326
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:18,054
Your honor!

327
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:22,254
This clock is exactly like the one in the victim's office.

328
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:27,754
The assailant's evidently used the movements of this figure

329
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:29,554
along with the light from the outside

330
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:32,354
and cast its shadow on the wall

331
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:36,854
then led Mr. Akiyama into mistaking the time.

332
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:39,554
What about the sound? Explain that!

333
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:43,054
Mr. Akiyama and I hear my father fall!

334
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,554
That's easy.

335
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:46,754
What?

336
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,154
You probably put a golf ball

337
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:53,054
tied with a string under the leg of the desk in the victim's office.

338
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:55,354
The other end of the string led under the door

339
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:56,854
to the outside of the office

340
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,754
and when Mr. Akiyama looked inside and got a scare,

341
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,654
you pulled the string.

342
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:07,854
See? Didn't I say it was easy?

343
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:13,054
Do you have any proof I did it?

344
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:15,954
Anyone could have done what you said!

345
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,654
If you have proof that I did it, I'd like to see it!

346
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:20,254
The witness is right.

347
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:21,754
If you're insisting he's guilty,

348
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:24,254
I'd like to see some proof too!

349
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:26,354
The proof, Prosecutor,

350
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:30,454
is on that list of things found at the crime scene that you're holding.

351
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:31,554
On this list?

352
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:37,354
It says screw for eyeglasses, doesn't it?

353
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:40,754
If it belongs to the victim's reading glasses,

354
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:44,054
when did it get where it was found?

355
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:47,254
He was supposed to have left his glasses at the restaurant.

356
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:54,854
It came loose and fell off when the assailant hit the victim,

357
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:56,554
that's the only explanation I can think of.

358
00:19:58,054 --> 00:19:59,754
Another thing, Mr. Arima.

359
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:02,354
You used your cook's apron

360
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:05,854
to wipe your fingerprints off the ashtray, didn't you?

361
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,954
The lab report stated that the ashtray was wiped

362
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:12,954
with a cloth containing oil.

363
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:16,354
Requesting permission to have a sample of the olive oil

364
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:19,854
used in Mr. Arima's restaurant to be tested

365
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,454
against the oil on the cloth used to wipe the ashtray!

366
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,954
Mr. Arima, after the crime,

367
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:31,854
you repaid a loan of 50 million yen, didn't you?

368
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:39,054
We can always have that money tested for fingerprints.

369
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:44,954
He deserved it!

370
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,054
That abusive old man.

371
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:53,954
You must be relieved, your money's safe.

372
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,954
Do you want some of this?

373
00:20:55,954 --> 00:21:00,354
But if you don't pay me back what you owe me by next week,

374
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,254
I don't care if you are my daughter's husband,

375
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,554
I'm going to have you kicked out of that restaurant!

376
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:09,054
Mr. Mouri, you were right about everything.

377
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:11,254
I killed my father-in-law!

378
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:19,654
Your honor,

379
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,654
I would like to revise charges of burglary and murder

380
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:24,554
against the defendant to attempted burglary

381
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:29,354
and I would like to press charges against Mr. Arima.

382
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,054
Does the defense have any objections?

383
00:21:32,054 --> 00:21:33,654
None.

384
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:38,054
Then the court is dismissed!

385
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,154
Ms. Kisaki.

386
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,154
A terrible injustice was about to be made,

387
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:14,554
thank you for preventing it.

388
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:17,854
I was just doing my job

389
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,554
I'll be looking forward to seeing you in court again then.

390
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:28,854
Why don't we all go get something to eat to celebrate?

391
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:31,154
That reminds me, I'm hungry.

392
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:33,354
How about some delicious wine and Italian cuisine?

393
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:36,954
I think I'd like some Japanese rice wine and raw fish instead.

394
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:41,254
No wait, cold beer and some piping hot stew sounds good too.

395
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:45,054
Or Chinese cuisine with old Chinese liquor.

396
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:47,054
Who cares?

397
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:54,254
"Next Episode" -The murdered occurred after that,

398
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:57,554
probably sometime past 11.

399
00:23:57,554 --> 00:24:00,454
I'm so happy, all four of them have alibis

400
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:01,554
Yeah.

401
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:10,654
I see.

402
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,554
The alibi can be broken then!

403
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:15,654
Next Conan,

404
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,954
"Friendship and Murder at The Kanmon Strait (Part 1)"

405
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:23,022
Next Conan Hint:

406
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:25,222
"Eyesight"

407
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,122
The next episode is the third travel mystery.

408
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:28,122
To The Kanmon Strait!

409
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,342
Come on!
