1
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:05,363
My name's Shinichi Kudo.

2
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,823
I was a famous high school detective
that solved countless difficult cases!

3
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:10,863
But one day some organization forced me
to take a pill that shrunk me...

4
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:13,893
...and turned me into Conan Edogawa!
Although small, my mind is the same!

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,113
I hide my identity,
but I'm a great detective!

6
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:18,333
For every case,
there is always only one truth!

7
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,080
The Blackmailed Pro Soccer Player.

8
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,450
Hey, Conan! Are you looking
forward to tonight's game?

9
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,840
The soccer game.

10
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,280
Oh, the Sunday Cup finals...

11
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,950
Who do you think'll win?

12
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,950
That's obvious! The Tokyo Spirits,
because they got Hideo!

13
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,190
He's scored goals in 17 games in a row!

14
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,910
Hideo's good, but I like Naoki better!

15
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,950
But Naoki hurt himself
practicing a while back,

16
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,170
so he won't be able to play today.

17
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,610
I think the offense and defense of
Ramusu's Big Osaka team are better!

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,080
Soccer, eh?

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,530
Mori Detective Agency

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,560
Why aren't you going in?

21
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,890
You need help from the
detective agency, right?

22
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,530
My name is Ryoko Akagi.

23
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,670
There's someone I'd like you to find.

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,640
He suddenly disappeared,
and I didn't know what else to do...

25
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,540
This is a picture of him.

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,710
We were seeing each other!

27
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880
You were seeing Shinichi?!

28
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,250
Yes.

29
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,590
Don't tell me that
Shinichi was actually...

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,110
I'm sure it's just
a big misunderstanding!

31
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,420
Maybe it's someone who looks like him!

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,900
There's no mistake!
I've even kissed him!

33
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,860
K-Kissed?!

34
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,570
That's a lie...

35
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,320
So he told you he was working on a case,

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,650
when he was actually fooling
around with some other girls.

37
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,170
I'm telling you, this is just a big--

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,040
You be quiet!

39
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,480
I can't live without Shinichi-san!

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,320
I can't keep on like this!

41
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,920
Sorry, but I've never
seen you before in my life.

42
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,710
What's this girl's deal?!

43
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,490
Was kissing really
as far as you two went?

44
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,610
Or did you go even farther?!

45
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,770
Yeah, did you?

46
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't answer questions like that!

47
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,990
Hello, Mori Detective Agency.

48
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,280
Oh, Shinichi! Perfect!

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,140
Professor Agasa!

50
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,740
About the new gadget I gave you
this morning, the battery--

51
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,110
Sure thing! I'll pass
the message on to her!

52
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,970
Bye, Shinichi!

53
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,110
Was that Shinichi on the phone?!

54
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,060
Yeah. He said he'd call Ryoko-san
later so don't worry about him.

55
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll get to see Shinichi-san?!

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm so glad!

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,610
Anyway, let's go to her house!

58
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,360
What for?

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,070
Shinichi might show up there.

60
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,950
We'll all go together,
and then I can teach him a lesson!

61
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,670
You don't mind, do you, Ryoko-san?

62
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,180
Not at all!

63
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,850
I'll pass. I don't care about
some kids' sordid love lives.

64
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,550
I'll pass too...

65
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,720
Maybe I will go...

66
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,000
Come on in.

67
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,970
The lock has marks on it
from being tampered with...

68
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,760
Only men's and children's shoes...

69
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,920
No girls live here.

70
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,950
This isn't right. Who exactly is she?

71
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Huh? Where was the tea again?

72
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,430
Found it!

73
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,260
Spoons...

74
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,400
Teapot...

75
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,900
Tell me, Akagi-san. How long
have you been seeing Shinichi?

76
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,070
As his childhood friend,
I just have to know.

77
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,760
Akagi-san?

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,360
Ryoko Akagi-san!

79
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,320
Yes? What did you say?

80
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,200
Who does she think she is,
ignoring me like that?!

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,790
Doesn't like talking to me, huh?!

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,020
Looks like I need to delve
a little deeper into this.

83
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,950
Mamoru

84
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
Mamoru?

85
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,410
What the heck happened in here?!

86
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,740
Mamoru Akagi

87
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,890
Mamoru?
Mamoru Akagi

88
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,450
It would seem that this
is this boy's room.

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,300
Who's the person with him?

90
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,240
I've seen him somewhere before...

91
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,470
The National Sports Stadium
is really livening up

92
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,310
as the championship match
of the Sunday Cup continues!

93
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,900
The game remains tied at 0.

94
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,570
Will the Tokyo Spirits
be the first to score?

95
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,680
Or will it be Big Osaka?!

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,150
What's with suddenly
switching the TV on?!

97
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,580
Does she hate the idea of
talking to me that much?!

98
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,550
Oh, you're watching soccer?

99
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,450
That's right! Ryoko-san
insisted on watching it!

100
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,200
Didn't you?

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,900
Yes...

102
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,280
Oh! Another bad kick by Hideo!

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,970
Is 19-year old Hideo Akagi
starting to show signs of age?!

104
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,330
Akagi?!

105
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Aha! That picture was of Hideo Akagi
from the Tokyo Spirits!

106
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,520
So then Mamoru Akagi, the boy in
the picture, is his little brother?

107
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,610
Come to think of it, the magazines
said that his parents died 2 years ago

108
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,290
and that he lives with his brother now.

109
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,570
Which means that she really
doesn't live here at all!

110
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,690
Then why is she here?
And why use a fake name?!

111
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,990
Oh no! Hideo missed another kick!

112
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,200
He's really out of form today!

113
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,360
Strange... Why did he make
such a simple mistake?

114
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,950
It seemed almost intentional...

115
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,020
Oh no! Don't tell me this is actually...!

116
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,090
I'll use the gizmo the Professor
gave me this morning...

117
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,320
This is my latest invention,
the Mobile Boxed Lunch Fax Machine!

118
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,950
Latest invention? Yeah, right.

119
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,400
All he did was shove a fax machine
inside a boxed lunch.

120
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,200
Yes?!

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Hello.

122
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,710
Shinichi-san? Shinichi-san, right?!

123
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,650
Um, I...

124
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,120
It's a kidnapping, isn't it?

125
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,360
The one kidnapped was Mamoru Akagi-kun.

126
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,110
He's the younger brother of Hideo Akagi,
who's playing on TV right now.

127
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,460
The kidnapper's demand was that
he lose the game on purpose.

128
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,860
You said that you were
going out with me

129
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,870
because you wanted to get in contact
with me as quickly as possible.

130
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,570
I assume that the kidnapper
threatened to kill Mamoru

131
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,340
if you got the police
or any detectives involved.

132
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,280
The reason you used
the false name of Ryoko Akagi

133
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,820
was because you didn't want to
raise suspicion from the others.

134
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,570
You wanted to bring me to the Akagi home

135
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,900
and then tell me what
was really going on there.

136
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,740
Isn't that right?

137
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,250
Yes!

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,280
But how did you know he was kidnapped?

139
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,740
You haven't even come here yet...

140
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,170
Oh, uh, that's because
I'm a great detective!

141
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,490
Please write down the details
about Mamoru-kun's kidnapping

142
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,110
and fax them to me.

143
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,150
The number is...

144
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,990
Got it!

145
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,910
What's the deal?!
That's Shinichi on the phone, isn't it?

146
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,150
I'm so happy! Shinichi-san
understood what I wanted...

147
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,290
What the... What's she crying about?!

148
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,790
Where are you?!

149
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,220
Come here and explain yourself, Shinichi!

150
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,770
I could swear I just--

151
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,490
Shinichi!

152
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm hearing my voice
from the other phone!

153
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,040
Oh, crap!

154
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,270
Which means Shinichi's...

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,510
...inside this apartment!

156
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,330
Perfect!

157
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,950
Here it comes!

158
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,900
Let's see...

159
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,400
"I found out Mamoru-chan was kidnapped

160
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,700
when I came to make him
breakfast this morning."

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,900
"I'm sending the kidnapper's letter
that was on the table

162
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,280
along with the letter the kidnapper
made Mamoru-chan write."

163
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,870
These?

164
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,510
"Bring Mamoru back to life."

165
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,530
A strange message for
someone asking for help.

166
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,070
What are these marks?

167
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,550
Shinichi!

168
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,700
Where are you? Show yourself!

169
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,290
Shinichi!

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,540
Ran might actually be more
difficult to handle than this case!

171
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,570
Hideo sets up the shot!

172
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,900
Oh no! He's kicked the ball too far!

173
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,010
Has he made another bad kick?!

174
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,580
No! Luckily,
Takeda is there to receive it!

175
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,650
He fakes and shoots!

176
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,580
Goal!

177
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,250
Now that's the Hideo we know!

178
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,870
A brilliant play that broke
through the opponent's defense!

179
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,700
You broke our agreement.

180
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,240
Consider your brother as good as gone.

181
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,710
Oh no!

182
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,477
It's too late! Mamoru-chan!

183
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:27,077
This is bad!

184
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:31,357
Mamoru-kun is dead if I don't
find the kidnapper soon!

185
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,287
This was a 3rd grader
that was kidnapped.

186
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:36,957
Even if he put up a real struggle,

187
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,127
it's unnatural for his room
to be this messed up!

188
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:48,787
This is the Onimaru Quest game
that came out yesterday...

189
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,117
But it's empty.

190
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,047
A kidnapped kid wouldn't
take a game with him...

191
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,847
Come to think of it, Genta and
Mitsuhiko mentioned something...

192
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,457
The hero actually dies during the game!

193
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:04,017
Yeah! And you can't beat it
without bringing him back to life!

194
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:05,577
Bringing him back to life?!

195
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,457
I wonder...

196
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:18,997
I was right!

197
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:22,967
Mamoru-kun used his own name
for the main character's name!

198
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:27,447
The Mamoru in that letter meant
the game's main character!

199
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:29,877
Naoki?

200
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:33,497
I know who Mamoru, Hideo, and Ryoko are,

201
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:36,287
but who's this Naoki?

202
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:37,857
One of Mamoru-kun's friends?

203
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,287
Wait. Hideo and Naoki...

204
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:45,757
Hideo's good, but I like Naoki better!

205
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:51,237
Aha! Naoki Uemura, the one
who joined the Spirits last year!

206
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,967
And these two marks...

207
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,277
What if they were the "ki" in Naoki?!

208
00:13:58,277 --> 00:13:59,377
That's it!

209
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,147
Yes? Hello?!

210
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:08,117
I've found out where
Mamoru-kun is, Ryoko-san.

211
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:11,577
Really, Shinichi-san?!

212
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,367
Where is he?!

213
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:18,097
But first, do you know a person
named Naoki Uemura?

214
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:21,957
Of course! He's Hideo's best friend.
He lives real close by!

215
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:27,367
Tell me, does he come by often
to play with Mamoru-kun?

216
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,657
Yes, Naoki-san knows
a lot about video games...

217
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:32,037
But why do you ask?

218
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,177
Mamoru-kun wasn't kidnapped!

219
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:41,077
The scratches on the front door lock
and the ransacked bedroom...

220
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,517
The culprit did these intentionally.

221
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:46,457
All to make it look
like a sinister kidnapping.

222
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,867
Y-You can't be serious!

223
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,117
The full message of Mamoru-kun's
letter probably went like this:

224
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:56,397
"I'm going to Naoki's house so he
can bring Mamoru back to life."

225
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,827
The kidnapper tore out and used
only that one part of the message!

226
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:03,497
T-Then you're saying
the one who took him was...

227
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:07,077
That's right. The one
responsible is Naoki Uemura.

228
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:08,827
Most likely Mamoru-kun
is at his house.

229
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:15,017
I finally, finally found you, Shinichi!

230
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,907
Shinichi! Come out!

231
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:20,527
I know you're in there!

232
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,457
I'm using the toilet right now,
I can't just come out!

233
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,927
Oh, really now?

234
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,697
I see.

235
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,637
Tell me she's not going
to use karate on the door!

236
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,767
Wait, Ran-san!

237
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:38,207
What do you want?!

238
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:42,177
Shinichi-san says he wants
to talk to you on the phone!

239
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,037
If he needs to say something
to me, he can say it right here!

240
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:48,517
It's something important
that I want only Ran to hear!

241
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:50,457
That's what he said.

242
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,717
Something important?

243
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,517
Only me?

244
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,867
If you wanna give me more
of your excuses, then fine.

245
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:05,837
So what do you wanna tell me, Shinichi?!

246
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:08,247
Tell me, already!

247
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:12,657
Shinichi!

248
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:13,777
Stop!

249
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:15,707
Conan-kun!

250
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:19,457
Shinichi just ran outside!

251
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:20,577
That loser!

252
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,657
Where did Shinichi-san go?

253
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,997
He said he was going
to rescue Mamoru-kun...

254
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,207
Does that mean he went
to Naoki-san's place?

255
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:29,927
Naoki's? Is that where
Shinichi ran off to?!

256
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:32,927
You're showing me the way!

257
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:41,997
Oh no! Another bad kick by Hideo!

258
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:44,037
What's happened to
our gifted Hideo Akagi?!

259
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,207
Mamoru!

260
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,317
Yes? Who is it?

261
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:52,907
It's Ryoko!

262
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:56,117
Ryoko-chan?! What is it? I'm kind of--

263
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:57,757
Just please open up!

264
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:03,227
What's the matter?

265
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:06,287
I'm sorry! Can you let me in?!

266
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,067
No way. My girlfriend's here right now.

267
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,457
I wouldn't want her
to get the wrong idea.

268
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:12,327
Mamoru-chan!

269
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:14,497
Mamoru-chan! If you're there,
say something!

270
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:16,107
Hey! You better knock that off.

271
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:17,477
Move.

272
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,887
Shinichi! Come out right now!

273
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,407
Mamoru-chan!

274
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:35,527
Oh, Ryoko-chan!

275
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,827
Mamoru-chan!

276
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:40,937
I told you not to leave the house
without saying a word!

277
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,247
But I wrote you a note.

278
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:47,967
Oh yeah! I finally beat the game
thanks to Naoki-chan!

279
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,537
Really, Ryoko?!

280
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,117
Is Mamoru really alright?!

281
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:53,877
He is!

282
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,157
Hey, what're you doing out there?!

283
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:57,717
You're in big trouble if you lose!

284
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,247
Mamoru...

285
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,917
Yo, Hideo! Second half's about to start!

286
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:03,537
Right!

287
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,207
Goal!

288
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,867
2 to 1! Hideo's finally in the zone!

289
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,997
He's playing like the
first half was all a ruse!

290
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,097
Hideo Akagi is truly gifted!

291
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,407
Gifted, eh?

292
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,747
It's always the same.

293
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:28,107
Hideo's got a gift,
while I'm a man of hard work.

294
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,187
Both his popularity and
salary are higher than mine!

295
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:33,047
Yet we had basically the same number
of goals back in high school!

296
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:40,867
I spent everyday rigorously training
so that I could outdo him!

297
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:43,157
And then I finally caught up to him!

298
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,207
No, I surpassed him!

299
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,767
Until he shattered my right leg
during a practice match, that is.

300
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:53,697
That's right. He intentionally
went for my leg!

301
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,437
He was afraid that
I had outclassed him!

302
00:18:57,207 --> 00:19:01,037
It's put me on the sideline for
3 full months, all thanks to him!

303
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,377
Impossible to try to surpass him now.

304
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,267
But I never had any
intentions of hurting Mamoru.

305
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,917
After the match, I was going
to return him to his house

306
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,887
and then disappear somewhere.

307
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,857
I just wanted to get back at him!

308
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,037
And the game is over!

309
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:21,997
The Tokyo Spirits have won
the Sunday Cup, 3 to 1!

310
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,297
Hurray!

311
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,267
Our game's over too.

312
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:30,537
Well, Ryoko-chan. Call the police.

313
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,207
Tell them there was a kidnapping here.

314
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:34,077
Congratulations, Hideo!

315
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,707
Who would you like to dedicate
this victory to the most?

316
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:41,117
Well, I would like to dedicate it
to my younger brother Mamoru,

317
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:43,787
but I really have to give
this one to Naoki instead.

318
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:47,057
My greatest rival, Naoki Uemura.

319
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,887
After he joined the team,
I started scoring more!

320
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:52,747
Come back soon, Naoki!

321
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:54,367
I'll be waiting for you on the field!

322
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,617
He's so stupid...

323
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,307
He hasn't even the slightest
idea of what I've done...

324
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,777
He doesn't know a thing!

325
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,157
Sorry to interrupt...

326
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,447
...but where did you hide Shinichi?!

327
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,617
Now that you mention it,
we haven't seen him at all...

328
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,957
Want me to give him a call?

329
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:19,957
A call?

330
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:22,357
Uh oh! The cell phone's in my bag!

331
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:27,617
I didn't always know it,
he gave it to me today...

332
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:45,537
Darn it! Of all times,
why won't it open now?!

333
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:49,077
It stopped...

334
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,497
I know you're there, Shinichi.

335
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:51,807
Oh, man!

336
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:54,387
You're not getting away
this time, Shinichi!

337
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:57,707
What's the deal with that Ryoko girl?!

338
00:20:57,707 --> 00:21:00,157
What were you doing at her house?!

339
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:02,367
I thought you were
working on a difficult case!

340
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:04,297
S-She was just--

341
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,767
Liar! She was crying!

342
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,707
She cried when you called her!

343
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,037
I don't know what's
going on anymore!

344
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,957
I'm the one who wants to cry!

345
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:19,807
Just come out and
explain it all, Shinichi!

346
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,127
S-Shinichi?

347
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,287
Ran. Listen to me.

348
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:32,057
I'm innocent.

349
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,207
So don't cry.

350
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:37,537
What's it matter to you? It's my own
decision to cry if I want to!

351
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:42,937
I don't like it when you cry.

352
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:44,877
Why...?

353
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,497
Well, I have to get going!

354
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:50,347
Wait! That's not an answer! Shinichi!

355
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:54,117
Professor Agasa?

356
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:55,747
Oh, Ran-kun!

357
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,587
If you're looking for Shinichi,
he ran off that way while blushing!

358
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,077
Blushing...?

359
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,557
I don't like it when you cry.

360
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,527
What's the deal?!

361
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,707
You said too much, Professor!

362
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,467
Look who's talking, you little coward!

363
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,317
Oh, shut up!

364
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,597
Truly, honestly?!

365
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:51,587
Yes! Truly, honestly!

366
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:53,587
I see.

367
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:00,747
No police were involved
in this latest incident.

368
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:04,667
But Ran made Ryoko
explain time after time...

369
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:09,867
...and it took 3 full days for her
to finally believe I was innocent.
