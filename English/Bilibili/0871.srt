"Gifu Station"

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.610
We are here!

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.810
We made it.

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.410
"Nobunaga Oda"

5
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.410
It is so shiny.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.310
It'a Lord Nogunaga!

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.210
Amazing!

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.910
This year 2017,

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.810
marks the 450th year since Military Commander Nobunaga Oda

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.610
of the Sengoku Period made his triumphant entry into the Gifu Castle.

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.210
So while city touring,

12
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.610
we decided to take a look at the various commemorative events

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.010
that were being held.

14
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.510
"Gifu Media Cosmos"

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.710
It sure was interesting, wasn't it, Conan?

16
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.510
Yeah, it sure was.

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.310
I didn't know you liked things like this, Ayumi.

18
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.910
There are many girls who like things like these recently you know.

19
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.210
History loving or Sengoku Period loving girls, right?

20
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
I don't know about that...

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810
But it was really interesting!

22
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.110
Okay, let's head on to the next place.

23
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.910
-Okay! -Okay!

24
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.810
"Nobunaga 450 Project"

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.010
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.510
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

27
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.210
A case casts a shadow over new heroes of Sengoku Gifu,

28
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.510
the Nobuna Gaizers.

29
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.210
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.810
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:30.248 --> 00:03:35.948
"Nobunaga 450 (Yongomaru) Case"

33
00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:41.348
"Juhachiro"

34
00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:43.948
This is the inn we're staying at tonight.

35
00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:46.448
-Welcome. -Welcome.

36
00:03:46.448 --> 00:03:48.648
-Hello. -Hello.

37
00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:51.348
Mr. Tobayama!

38
00:03:53.248 --> 00:03:55.248
Mr. Agasa.

39
00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:58.048
Everyone, he's an old friend of mine

40
00:03:58.048 --> 00:03:59.348
as well as the one who invited us over,

41
00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:04.448
cormorant fisherman, Mr. Tobayama.

42
00:04:04.448 --> 00:04:05.648
"Iwao Tobayama (55), Cormorant fisherman" -Hello.

43
00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:08.448
You're the Detective Squad, right?

44
00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.548
-Nice to meet you! -Nice to meet you!

45
00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.648
What an energetic bunch!

46
00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:26.148
-Fantastic! -Pretty!

47
00:04:29.748 --> 00:04:30.948
Mr. Tobayama.

48
00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:35.348
-Mr. Tobayama! -Mr. Tobayama!

49
00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:47.448
So, where shall we "ikomaika" next?

50
00:04:47.448 --> 00:04:49.848
That's the Gifu dialect.

51
00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:53.748
Correctly "ikomaika" is not to be used in the interrogative form.

52
00:04:53.748 --> 00:04:56.148
It means where shall we go, though.

53
00:04:56.148 --> 00:05:00.448
You sure know it all as expected. Don't you, Mr. Detective?

54
00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:01.548
So...

55
00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:04.448
I'm starving, famished.

56
00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:07.048
What? You ate 3 servings of Hida beef steak

57
00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:10.148
just a while ago, Genta?

58
00:05:10.148 --> 00:05:11.448
Right.

59
00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:20.248
In that case, I have some place I want to go.

60
00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:25.248
Nobunaga triumphantly entered the castle 400 and...

61
00:05:26.548 --> 00:05:27.948
50 years ago!

62
00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:30.448
The year 2017 is indeed a commemorative year.

63
00:05:30.448 --> 00:05:33.848
May justice and friendship abide on this land!

64
00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:36.948
We bring you courage and effort!

65
00:05:38.948 --> 00:05:41.448
Love and smiles too!

66
00:05:43.448 --> 00:05:44.948
-We are the Origami Squadron, -We are the Origami Squadron,

67
00:05:44.948 --> 00:05:47.248
-the Nobuna Gaizers! -the Nobuna Gaizers!

68
00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:01.748
A local hero show.

69
00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:05.948
No... Nobu? Noza? What?

70
00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.748
Since their called Nobuna Gaizer,

71
00:06:07.748 --> 00:06:11.348
I guess the heroes have some sort of lineage with Nobunaga Oda.

72
00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:12.648
Awesome!

73
00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:14.248
You think so too, right?

74
00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.248
Actually my purpose for coming...

75
00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:17.748
"Local Hero Album" -was this.

76
00:06:20.448 --> 00:06:21.848
Fantastic.

77
00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.648
Did you handmake this yourself?

78
00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:25.748
Yes.

79
00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:28.348
I'm collecting data of local heroes nationwide

80
00:06:28.348 --> 00:06:30.848
in each district when I go on trips

81
00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.848
and on the internet too.

82
00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:34.548
This sure is a huge collection.

83
00:06:34.548 --> 00:06:36.248
With this many heroes around,

84
00:06:36.248 --> 00:06:38.848
Earth is a super safe place.

85
00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:40.148
Yeah, right?

86
00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:03.548
-Nobuna Gaizer! -Nobuna Gaizer!

87
00:07:06.548 --> 00:07:08.248
Nobuna Gaizer!

88
00:07:09.848 --> 00:07:14.348
By the way, that was lethal Gaizer Triple Decker Knock Down.

89
00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:17.248
-Super awesome! -Fantastic!

90
00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:22.248
Let me help you.

91
00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:23.648
Me too.

92
00:07:23.648 --> 00:07:24.748
I'll help too.

93
00:07:26.248 --> 00:07:28.048
Thanks!

94
00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:30.848
We've got a gift to give you from Nobuna Gaizer too.

95
00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:33.448
Please get it before you go, okay!

96
00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:35.048
Stand in line, stand in line.

97
00:07:36.148 --> 00:07:38.648
-Here you go. -Thank you!

98
00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:46.948
Here you go.

99
00:07:46.948 --> 00:07:49.348
What a pretty paper!

100
00:07:49.348 --> 00:07:52.048
This is Mino Japanese paper, right?

101
00:07:52.048 --> 00:07:54.248
It's amazing that you know!

102
00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:57.648
It's because I've checked on the places that you've performed activities

103
00:07:57.648 --> 00:07:59.948
in before coming here, you see.

104
00:07:59.948 --> 00:08:02.248
That's great.

105
00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.048
Delights me a million.

106
00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:07.148
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for people like you.

107
00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:08.348
Thank you.

108
00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.848
I'm really delighted and moved!

109
00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:15.848
Thank you so very much!

110
00:08:15.848 --> 00:08:18.048
"Origami Squadron, Nobuna Gaizers" -Thank you.

111
00:08:18.048 --> 00:08:23.048
-See you all again! -See you.

112
00:08:23.048 --> 00:08:24.948
That was wonderful.

113
00:08:24.948 --> 00:08:26.948
I've never seen Mitsuhiko act like that before.

114
00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:28.948
-Good work. -Great job.

115
00:08:28.948 --> 00:08:30.148
-Good work. -Good work.

116
00:08:30.148 --> 00:08:33.248

-Okay. -Okay.

127
00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:14.148
It's against the rule, Conan...

128
00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:16.648
to peek into the faces of the heroes.

129
00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:18.148
That's true.

130
00:09:18.148 --> 00:09:20.848

What? I can still go on eating.

135
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:34.848
Dr. Agasa, please stop by at a convenience store

136
00:09:34.848 --> 00:09:37.148
on the way back will you.

137
00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:39.848
I want to go get some lunch box, meat bun,

138

But, Genta, I think you're eating too much.

141
00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:50.348
That's right.

142
00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:55.048
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

143
00:09:55.048 --> 00:09:58.448
I forgot to get to autograph my album.

144
00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:00.648
Bummers!

145
00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:02.548
Hey, hey, Mitsuhiko.

146
00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:05.648
Are you going to give up just like that?

147
00:10:05.648 --> 00:10:07.548
We'll wait for you.

148
00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:08.648
Yes.

149
00:10:08.648 --> 00:10:11.648
But, don't forget, we're going to the convenience store after that.

150

Excuse me!

I'm starving to death!

157

It sure is quiet.

158
00:10:51.548 --> 00:10:53.348
I'll try calling him.

159
00:10:57.148 --> 00:10:58.448

It's already been two hours.

165
00:11:15.748 --> 00:11:18.648
I've notified the cormorant people too,

166
00:11:18.648 --> 00:11:21.448
so if anything comes up, I'm sure they'll let us know.

167

Thank you.

168
00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:25.148
And were the police notified?

169
00:11:25.148 --> 00:11:28.848
Dr. Agasa used Pop's name and asked them to start investigation.

170
00:11:28.848 --> 00:11:30.648
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

171
00:11:38.248 --> 00:11:42.548
You're... You all look familiar.

172
00:11:42.548 --> 00:11:44.148
Now I remember.

173
00:11:44.148 --> 00:11:48.648
We saw you during the Onizawakyo Earth Heritabe Incident.

But, Dr. Agasa is here with us.

178
00:11:59.748 --> 00:12:01.648
Dr. Agasa.

179
00:12:01.648 --> 00:12:03.648
Of course, I know.

180
00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:06.648
You're the one who have solved difficult cases

181

and is as good as Mr. Mouri if not better.

182
00:12:09.148 --> 00:12:11.648
Is that so?

183
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:14.248
I've been doing all the work, though.

184
00:12:14.248 --> 00:12:16.048
They'll hear you.

185
00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:19.648
Then, I'd like to ask you for the details once again.

186
00:12:19.648 --> 00:12:23.448
But, Mitsuhiko's whereabouts were not at all known yet.

187
00:12:23.448 --> 00:12:25.148
Moreover...

188
00:12:25.148 --> 00:12:27.348
The members of Nobuna Gaizer have also disappeared?

189
00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:28.848
What's going on?

190
00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:32.248
Just in case, we've got to interrogate them.

191
00:12:32.248 --> 00:12:35.048
And yet we still can't get a hold of them.

192
00:12:36.248 --> 00:12:38.748
I'm starting to get bad vibes.

193
00:12:38.748 --> 00:12:39.948
You can say that again.

194
00:12:39.948 --> 00:12:42.948
"Gifu City Museum of History"

195
00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:51.948
"Golden Tile"

196
00:12:51.948 --> 00:12:54.848
"Miniature solid gold statue of Lord Nobunaga"

197
00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:09.815
The stolen items are...

198
00:13:09.815 --> 00:13:12.915
the miniature solid gold statue of Nobunaga

199
00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:14.815
and the golden tile

200
00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:17.815
as well as old documents that are of great historical value and such.

201
00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:21.015
They are all precious treasure of Gifu.

202
00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:22.615
We'd better hurry,

203
00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:24.315
or they may be sold off to the black market.

204
00:13:24.315 --> 00:13:26.015
And maybe even exported abroad?

205
00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:27.615
Really?

206
00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:30.015
This is really turning into something big.

207
00:13:37.115 --> 00:13:41.915
Will you show us the footage on the security camera?

208
00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:42.915
Sure!

209
00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:44.615
"Security Office"

210
00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:47.615
They're...

211
00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:50.515
Nobuna Gaizer, right?

212
00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:01.015
No way.

213
00:14:01.015 --> 00:14:02.815
It's hard to believe

214
00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:04.715
but heroes committing a robbery?

215
00:14:04.715 --> 00:14:06.915
This is absurd. It's unforgivable!

216
00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:09.315
What the...

217
00:14:10.315 --> 00:14:13.015
You found the Nobun Gaizer car?

218
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:26.815
What's that?

219
00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:30.715
It's the Nobunaga badge!

220
00:14:30.715 --> 00:14:33.215
Could it be Mitsuhiko's?

221
00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:35.615
You mean he was on this car?

222
00:14:35.615 --> 00:14:37.315
Don't tell me he was taken hostage?

223
00:14:37.315 --> 00:14:38.715
-What? -What?

224
00:14:38.715 --> 00:14:41.515
-Look. -I noticed too.

225
00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:45.715
Besides, look at the front tires.

226
00:14:50.315 --> 00:14:51.615
That's...

227
00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:53.215
No doubt about it.

228
00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:55.515
It's asphalt tar.

229
00:14:55.515 --> 00:14:58.715
"Nobuna Gaizer" -Nobuna Gaizer, the popular local heroes

230
00:14:58.715 --> 00:15:01.215
"Nobuna Gaizer Wanted" -who are known for cleaning the city

231
00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:02.915
and helping the elderly,

232
00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:07.115
are wanted as suspects in a robbery case.

233
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.115
Now, the five who are on the run,

234
00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:14.115
are thought to have an elementary school boy hostage.

235
00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:16.915
All because I said something like that to him.

236
00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:18.715
Hey, hey, Mitsuhiko.

237
00:15:18.715 --> 00:15:21.815
Are you going to give up just like that?

238
00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:23.715
We'll wait for you.

239
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:24.915
Yes.

240
00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:27.815
But, don't forget, we're going to the convenience store after that.

241
00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:29.415
Thank you.

242
00:15:29.415 --> 00:15:32.215
-Be careful. -Okay!

243
00:15:32.215 --> 00:15:34.415
If so, I'm to blame too.

244
00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:36.215
I didn't stop him either.

245
00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:38.915
-Me neither. -Neither did I.

246
00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:40.615
Some hero, my foot.

247
00:15:40.615 --> 00:15:42.415
They're just a bunch of nuisance.

248
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:53.315
I'm pretty sure that Nobuna Gaizer Red was left handed.

249
00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:01.315
Yes, but at the site of the crime,

250
00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:02.615
he was right handed.

251
00:16:02.615 --> 00:16:06.515
The signature pose of Blue and Green were also opposite.

252
00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:13.415
What's going on?

253
00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:14.615
Don't tell me they're...

254
00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:15.915
Imposters?

255
00:16:15.915 --> 00:16:18.915
Yeah. That's it.

256
00:16:25.415 --> 00:16:26.415
What?

257
00:16:28.615 --> 00:16:30.915
You're members of Nobunga Gaizer?

258
00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:40.615
Hello. Everything's okay here.

259
00:16:40.615 --> 00:16:43.115
Leave everything else to me.

260
00:16:43.115 --> 00:16:45.415
They imposters kidnapped them,

261
00:16:45.415 --> 00:16:47.015
snatched their costumes away

262
00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:49.915
and committed the robbery.

263
00:16:49.915 --> 00:16:51.915
Those punks...

264
00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:54.515
But who on earth?

265
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.215
You already have an idea who it might be, right?

266
00:16:57.215 --> 00:16:59.015
Would you like to confirm it?

267
00:16:59.015 --> 00:17:02.415
Yeah. Dr. Agasa with Detective Matsushiro.

268
00:17:07.615 --> 00:17:10.315
Got you. We succeeded.

269
00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:13.815
What did you succeed in doing?

270
00:17:15.015 --> 00:17:18.115
Could it be something bad?

271
00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:20.115
Right. You framed the members of Nobuma Gaizer

272
00:17:20.115 --> 00:17:23.115
as the one who committed the robbery. Correct?

273
00:17:23.115 --> 00:17:27.115
Host of the hero show Mr. Kimifusa Ohyabu?

274
00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.215
"3F, 2F, Ohyabu Event Planning" -Who are all of you?

275
00:17:31.215 --> 00:17:33.315
We're members of The Youth Detective Squad!

276
00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:35.015
Where's Mitsuhiko?

277
00:17:35.015 --> 00:17:37.115
What are you talking about?

278
00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:38.515
I don't know anything.

279
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:41.515
No use playing dumb. We've got proof too.

280
00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:42.815
Proof?

281
00:17:42.815 --> 00:17:45.415
Nobuna Gaizer red is left handed.

282
00:17:45.415 --> 00:17:47.715
The significant poses of Blue and Green

283
00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:49.615
are in the opposite position too.

284
00:17:49.615 --> 00:17:51.215
You've gotta do more research

285
00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:53.515
if you intend to frame them, you know, mister!

286
00:17:53.515 --> 00:17:56.715
They just happened to pose differently.

287
00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:00.315
Then, here's another one.

288
00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:02.515
We've got conclusive evidence.

289
00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:03.715
The ring!

290
00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:07.215
You should've taken it off.

291
00:18:07.215 --> 00:18:10.315
Heroes don't wear things like that.

292
00:18:10.315 --> 00:18:13.615
You punched a security guard at the site, didn't you?

293
00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:16.515
At that time, the glove tore.

294
00:18:16.515 --> 00:18:19.015
It should match the laceration of the victim.

295
00:18:21.015 --> 00:18:24.315
I've reconfirmed by the call from Mr. Agasa.

296
00:18:24.315 --> 00:18:27.615
It's true that the glove of the costume is torn.

297
00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:31.015
We've got to thoroughly investigate that ring.

298
00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:35.515
I couldn't help it.

299
00:18:35.515 --> 00:18:37.315
The company wasn't doing good

300
00:18:37.315 --> 00:18:39.615
and I was threatened by the collectors

301
00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:41.115
of the loan shark that I borrowed money from.

302
00:18:41.115 --> 00:18:44.815
So the other imposters were people from that loan shark?

303
00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:46.715
Yeah.

304
00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:49.715
I was force to help them.

305
00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:54.015
Well, just as would be expected of you, Mr. Agasa.

306
00:18:54.015 --> 00:18:55.415
Well, sort of...

307
00:18:55.415 --> 00:18:57.015
I guess.

308
00:18:58.215 --> 00:19:01.015
It's not over yet. Where's Mitsuhiko?

309
00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:03.215
Where's the real Nobuna Gaizer?

310
00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:05.115
Where are they?

311
00:19:05.115 --> 00:19:07.215
I don't know.

312
00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:09.715
I was told to leave everything else up to them.

313
00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.015
It's true!

314
00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:13.215
What? Crap!

315
00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:15.315
What's going on, Conan?

316
00:19:15.315 --> 00:19:18.215
We've got to hurry or he'll be killed

317
00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:20.715
along with the heroes, so no evidence is left!

318
00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:21.915
-What? -What?

319
00:19:21.915 --> 00:19:23.715
Emergency search!

320
00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:30.915
Fire!

321
00:19:30.915 --> 00:19:32.815
We won't make it.

322
00:19:32.815 --> 00:19:34.515
We're done for it.

323
00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:37.115
I don't want to die.

324
00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:39.115
Don't give up!

325
00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:41.615
The fans of Nobuna Gaizer are waiting!

326
00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:45.715
Conan, what now?

327
00:19:46.915 --> 00:19:48.615
No doubt about it.

328
00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:50.615
It's asphalt tar.

329
00:19:50.615 --> 00:19:51.815
Wait! Stop!

330
00:19:52.815 --> 00:19:55.015
Where were you working this morning?

331
00:19:55.015 --> 00:19:58.115
A little more. Just a little more.

332
00:19:58.115 --> 00:19:59.115
We did it.

333
00:20:02.715 --> 00:20:04.515
Somebody! Is there anyone there?

334
00:20:04.515 --> 00:20:06.015
Help us!

335
00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:07.615
What now?

336
00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:08.815
We've got to do something.

337
00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:09.915
Over there.

338
00:20:09.915 --> 00:20:11.715
And then that!

339
00:20:15.615 --> 00:20:19.315
"Gifu Castle"

340
00:20:19.315 --> 00:20:23.415
They paved the road in the morning.

341
00:20:23.415 --> 00:20:26.015
In two places. Over here and over here.

342
00:20:26.015 --> 00:20:28.215
They're in totally different directions.

343
00:20:28.215 --> 00:20:30.715
I wonder which direction Mitsuhiko's in?

344
00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:34.115
What's that?

345
00:20:40.315 --> 00:20:41.815
You'll be fine.

346
00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:43.815
We won't fall no matter what.

347
00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:45.615
Believe us.

348
00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:47.115
So, hang in there!

349
00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:48.415
Mitsuhiko!

350
00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.415
Yes!

351
00:20:53.415 --> 00:20:55.415
Hold on Mitsuhiko!

352
00:20:55.415 --> 00:20:58.815
Darn, we're out of paper.

353
00:20:58.815 --> 00:20:59.815
What now?

354
00:20:59.815 --> 00:21:02.615
Then, please use that.

355
00:21:02.615 --> 00:21:04.715
"Local Hero Album"

356
00:21:04.715 --> 00:21:07.715
But, that's very precious to you, isn't it?

357
00:21:07.715 --> 00:21:10.515
Heroes are to be used in times like this!

358
00:21:10.515 --> 00:21:12.915
Over here! He's nearby.

359
00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:16.115
This is...

360
00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:17.915
"Local Hero, Nobuna Gaizer" -Mitsuhiko's.

361
00:21:17.915 --> 00:21:18.915
Over there.

362
00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:22.415
-Mitsuhiko! -Mitsuhiko!

363
00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:25.415
Conan! The door's locked.

364
