1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.140
Ran's mother and an attorney, Eri Kisaki, was kidnapped.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.340
However, Attorney Kisaki escaped from her captors,

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.240
hid in the abandoned building

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.440
and used the phone she stole from the kidnappers

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.340
to ask Ran for help.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.340
"Eri Kisaki"

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.840
"I've been captured by some bad people."

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.940
"Could you call the police?"

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.840
What?

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.840
Is that true?

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.340
She responded.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.740
She says she doesn't know where she is.

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.540
Darn! Sounds like she was kidnapped from her office.

14
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.840
"Eri Kisaki: Just kidding! I'm joking!" -It was just a joke?

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
Geez, Mom.

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540
But wait...

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.540
Look.

18
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.940
The icons are different.

19
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.040
They're probably not the same Eri you just added.

20
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.340
Hold on.

21
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.240
If the person using Eri's usual icon is an impostor...

22
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.440
The one without an icon is the real Mom...

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.540
"What are you talking about? I'm the real Eri!"

24
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.040
Darn it.

25
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.340
Now we don't know which messages are coming from the real Eri.

26
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.440
We do.

27
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.740
-Huh? -What?

28
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.140
You can tell, Conan?

29
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.740
Attorney Kisaki is a lawyer, right?

30
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.040
Yeah...

31
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.140
Shinichi told me lawyers use Western commas

32
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.140
"Japanese Comma" -instead of Japanese commas

33
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.240
"Western Comma" -in their documents

34
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.240
when writing horizontally.

35
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.140
That habit shows up in their normal writing, too.

36
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.540
You're right.

37
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.040
The messages I received from Mom before

38
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.240
all have Western commas.

39
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.440
Using what few hints we could gather

40
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.240
from our exchanges with Attorney Kisaki,

41
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.640
we headed out to rescue her but...

42
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.540
Which means it's likely she's hiding in a closed space

43
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.940
where she can't see out any windows.

44
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.540
Focus your search on those kinds of places.

45
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.940
Got it.

46
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.740
So we need to search all the lockers and drawers in this building.

47
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.940
That's right.

48
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.140
I'll call you if we find her.

49
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.040
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

50
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

51
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.640
Her life depends on a game of hide-and-seek!

52
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.040
Hurry, Pops! Get there in time, Ran!

53
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.140
His name is Detective Conan!

56
00:05:01.182 --> 00:05:06.982
"Attorney Kisaki's SOS (Part 2)"

57
00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:31.482
Huh?

58
00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:33.282
What are you doing, you idiot?

59
00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:36.282
She can't hide in there!

60
00:05:36.282 --> 00:05:39.182
And your stomach's growling.

61
00:05:39.182 --> 00:05:40.682
She doesn't seem to be in here.

62
00:05:40.682 --> 00:05:41.882
Let's go.

63
00:05:41.882 --> 00:05:42.982
Okay.

64
00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.682
I'm lucky that I'm hungry.

65
00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:10.382
Zojo Temple?

66
00:06:10.382 --> 00:06:11.982
What are we doing here?

67
00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:14.082
Conan said to come here.

68
00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.482
Let me see your phone.

69
00:06:16.482 --> 00:06:18.782
Wait, Conan!

70
00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:20.782
Attorney Kisaki, are you listening?

71
00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:23.182
There's going to be another loud noise shortly.

72
00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:24.882
If you hear the sound,

73
00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.682
could you tap your phone with your fingernail again?

74
00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:30.082
You'll know what sound I'm talking about

75
00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:31.082
as soon as you hear it!

76
00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:38.382
About one second.

77
00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:41.282
Based on the speed of sound,

78
00:06:41.282 --> 00:06:44.082
she's about 340 m from here.

79
00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:46.882
She's somewhere one kilometer from the church next to the detective agency

80
00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:50.382
and 340 m from Zojo Temple.

81
00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:56.682
In other words, Attorney Kisaki is in either Buroku-cho or Sutan-cho.

82
00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.682
But which is it?

83
00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:03.382
Both districts have abandoned buildings a kidnapper could use.

84
00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:08.482
I told you,

85
00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:10.882
I'm not hungry!

86
00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:16.282
Liar! Your stomach was growling in that room.

87
00:07:16.282 --> 00:07:17.682
-Hey. -Huh?

88
00:07:17.682 --> 00:07:20.282
Take me to that room.

89
00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:22.482
But no one was in there.

90
00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:28.982
It seems the doe we're hunting is hungry.

91
00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:31.782
Seriously?

92
00:07:31.782 --> 00:07:33.782
She really isn't in here.

93
00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:37.082
No, these drawers are still warm.

94
00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:39.482
She was hiding here until recently,

95
00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:41.682
but moved somewhere else.

96
00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:42.882
Hey...

97
00:07:42.882 --> 00:07:44.882
If she got out of here,

98
00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:47.582
then she must have seen what's outside the window, right?

99
00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:51.382
If she and her daughter are messaging each other separately

100
00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:52.982
through the app,

101
00:07:52.982 --> 00:07:56.182
she might have told her where we are.

102
00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:57.482
Calm down.

103
00:07:57.482 --> 00:08:00.082
I've already hacked his phone.

104
00:08:00.082 --> 00:08:02.282
As long as she's using it,

105
00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:06.082
we'll know everything she and her daughter

106
00:08:06.082 --> 00:08:07.782
say to each other.

107
00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:09.482
Yeah, but...

108
00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:10.982
Besides,

109
00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:14.782
even if she tells her what she sees out the window,

110
00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:18.682
we'll know where she's hiding right now.

111
00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:19.882
You're right.

112
00:08:19.882 --> 00:08:21.582
You're always so smart.

113
00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:24.682
I see.

114
00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:27.782
If they can read all our messages...

115
00:08:29.482 --> 00:08:30.582
I'll have to risk it.

116
00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:33.382
Please.

117
00:08:33.382 --> 00:08:34.682
Please figure it out.

118
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.182
Conan, what are you doing?

119
00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:40.782
Sorry.

120
00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:45.082
You got a message from Attorney Kisaki.

121
00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:46.582
What? No way.

122
00:08:46.582 --> 00:08:48.382
She said, "The crab's only half-boiled,"

123
00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:51.882
"but as a result, the two swordfish look delicious."

124
00:08:51.882 --> 00:08:55.882
"Since it's light out tonight, why don't we eat outside?"

125
00:08:55.882 --> 00:08:57.182
What is this?

126
00:08:57.182 --> 00:09:00.782
This is no time to be talking about food.

127
00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:03.382
"The crab's only half-boiled,"

128
00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:07.082
"but as a result, the two swordfish look delicious."

129
00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:09.582
"Since it's light out tonight,"

130
00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.682
"why don't we eat outside?"

131
00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:13.982
A full moon.

132
00:09:15.082 --> 00:09:17.482
Two swordfish.

133
00:09:17.482 --> 00:09:19.582
And a half-boiled crab.

134
00:09:21.982 --> 00:09:24.282
I see.

135
00:09:24.282 --> 00:09:26.582
So that's how it is.

136
00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:28.982
Sutan-cho?

137
00:09:28.982 --> 00:09:33.482
Yeah. Attorney Kisaki is probably somewhere in Sutan-cho.

138
00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:35.282
Are you sure, Conan?

139
00:09:35.282 --> 00:09:37.982
How do you know that?

140
00:09:37.982 --> 00:09:41.282
I get that Eri's in either Buroku-cho or Sutan-cho

141
00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:43.182
since they're within the overlapping area

142
00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:46.382
of a one kilometer radius circle

143
00:09:46.382 --> 00:09:48.582
around the church next to the office

144
00:09:48.582 --> 00:09:50.482
and the 340 m radius circle around here,

145
00:09:50.482 --> 00:09:53.482
but how were you able to narrow it down to Sutan-cho?

146
00:09:53.482 --> 00:09:56.682
The message Attorney Kisaki just sent us.

147
00:09:56.682 --> 00:09:57.882
Huh?

148
00:09:57.882 --> 00:09:59.382
Let's see.

149
00:09:59.382 --> 00:10:00.882
It said, "The crab's only half-boiled,"

150
00:10:00.882 --> 00:10:03.882
"but as a result, the two swordfish look delicious."

151
00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:07.282
"Since it's light out tonight, why don't we eat outside?"

152
00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:09.382
What about this says Sutan-cho?

153
00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:12.082
Crabs are black when they're alive,

154
00:10:12.082 --> 00:10:14.182
but they turn red once they're boiled, right?

155
00:10:14.182 --> 00:10:15.982
Yeah...

156
00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:20.582
So if they're half-boiled, then they're not very red.

157
00:10:20.582 --> 00:10:22.682
In other words, something that's normally red

158
00:10:22.682 --> 00:10:25.682
that's still partially black.

159
00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:27.482
Something that's normally red...

160
00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:31.882
But still partially black right now?

161
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:34.482
"Since it's light out tonight"

162
00:10:34.482 --> 00:10:37.482
refers to the full moon out tonight.

163
00:10:37.482 --> 00:10:41.282
And there's only one building that shuts off half its lights

164
00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:43.182
when there's a full moon out.

165
00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:49.582
The Toto Tower!

166
00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.682
Now that you mention it,

167
00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:55.082
the top half of its lights are off tonight.

168
00:10:55.082 --> 00:11:00.882
I've heard the Toto Tower shuts off half its lights on full moons

169
00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:06.582
so the moon can be seen more clearly.

170
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:11.482
Then what does "the two swordfish look delicious" mean?

171
00:11:11.482 --> 00:11:14.882
The "delicious" refers to something that looks pretty,

172
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:17.482
and the English word for the animal is swordfish.

173
00:11:17.482 --> 00:11:19.982
Sword refers to a blade or katana.

174
00:11:19.982 --> 00:11:21.982
Since there are two of them,

175
00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:25.182
she's telling you to think of something with two blades.

176
00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:27.382
Something with...

177
00:11:27.382 --> 00:11:28.682
Two blades?

178
00:11:28.682 --> 00:11:33.482
Wasn't there a really strong samurai who used two swords?

179
00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:36.582
The two-sword fighter Musashi Miyamoto!

180
00:11:36.582 --> 00:11:41.582
That's right. And what building is related to Musashi?

181
00:11:41.582 --> 00:11:42.982
Speaking of Musashi,

182
00:11:42.982 --> 00:11:46.182
the Bell Tree Tower is 634 m tall,

183
00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:47.882
which spells Mu-sa-shi (Six-three-four), right?

184
00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:51.782
Yeah. If she's able to see the Bell Tree Tower clearly

185
00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:54.982
because the Toto Tower is darkened,

186
00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:58.882
then Attorney Kisaki must be someplace

187
00:11:58.882 --> 00:12:00.582
she can see the Bell Tree Tower behind the Toto Tower

188
00:12:00.582 --> 00:12:02.482
or somewhere in Sutan-cho.

189
00:12:04.282 --> 00:12:06.082
Hey, this can't be good!

190
00:12:06.082 --> 00:12:08.582
After that lawyer sent some nonsensical message

191
00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:11.982
about crabs and swordfish to her daughter,

192
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:16.682
and looks like she keeps getting closer.

193
00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:21.382
Even though I'm sending her false information as the lawyer.

194
00:12:21.382 --> 00:12:22.382
Let me see that.

195
00:12:24.282 --> 00:12:25.282
"No! I'm not in Sutan-cho!"

196
00:12:25.282 --> 00:12:26.282
"I'm not sure. When I escaped from the suitcase,"

197
00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:27.282
"I was already inside."

198
00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:29.782
It's the commas.

199
00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.482
The commas?

200
00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:35.382
She was using Western commas instead of Japanese commas

201
00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:38.782
to help her daughter differentiate between our messages and hers.

202
00:12:38.782 --> 00:12:40.082
Now that we know that,

203
00:12:40.082 --> 00:12:43.182
send her messages using Western commas.

204
00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:45.882
That should confuse her daughter again.

205
00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:47.782
Got it.

206
00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:51.282
Well, even if her daughter gets here,

207
00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:56.182
we'll just capture her and skin her along with her mother.

208
00:12:56.182 --> 00:13:00.882
Hey, what kind of building did Eri say it is?

209
00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:01.982
No way!

210
00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:03.582
The guys who kidnapped Mom

211
00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:05.982
started using Western commas in their messages.

212
00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:07.382
What?

213
00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:10.382
"I'm not sure. When I escaped from the suitcase,"

214
00:13:10.382 --> 00:13:12.882
"I was already inside."

215
00:13:12.882 --> 00:13:17.982
"Based on the walls, I think it's a reinforced concrete building."

216
00:13:17.982 --> 00:13:19.582
"Don't be fooled!"

217
00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:23.782
"The walls are wood, so it could be a wooden building."

218
00:13:23.782 --> 00:13:26.882
Reinforced concrete? Wood?

219
00:13:26.882 --> 00:13:28.182
Which is it?

220
00:13:29.882 --> 00:13:31.082
This isn't good.

221
00:13:31.082 --> 00:13:33.882
They noticed I was using Western commas.

222
00:13:33.882 --> 00:13:36.582
Then how about this?

223
00:13:40.882 --> 00:13:41.882
She responded.

224
00:13:41.882 --> 00:13:43.782
"The first floor is a garage."

225
00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:49.682
"I think it has some yellowish warm mouse-gray shutters."

226
00:13:49.682 --> 00:13:51.482
"There aren't any gray shutters!"

227
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:54.482
"It was a wooden door!"

228
00:13:54.482 --> 00:13:57.682
Darn! Now we don't know

229
00:13:57.682 --> 00:13:59.482
if there are shutters or a wooden door.

230
00:13:59.482 --> 00:14:02.882
No, it's the mouse-gray shutters.

231
00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:04.982
What? How do you know?

232
00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:07.582
Because Mom told me before

233
00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:12.082
that things with animal names seem warmer.

234
00:14:12.082 --> 00:14:15.682
Anyway, which gloves do you prefer?

235
00:14:15.682 --> 00:14:20.382
Well, I guess I'd choose the black ones.

236
00:14:20.382 --> 00:14:24.982
Oh, I prefer the gray ones.

237
00:14:24.982 --> 00:14:26.582
Really?

238
00:14:26.582 --> 00:14:28.482
Because they're mouse-gray.

239
00:14:28.482 --> 00:14:32.982
Don't things seem warmer when they have animal names?

240
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:44.282
Yellowish mouse-gray shutters...

241
00:14:47.182 --> 00:14:48.782
It's this abandoned building!

242
00:15:07.549 --> 00:15:08.649
That's...

243
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:12.249
Ran! Honey!

244
00:15:12.249 --> 00:15:14.049
I'm up here!

245
00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:15.749
-Eri! -Mom!

246
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.649
We're on our way!

247
00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:23.449
I finally caught you, you tricky little lawyer.

248
00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:28.849
We wanted to film you apologizing to us naked,

249
00:15:28.849 --> 00:15:31.049
but it looks like the police are coming.

250
00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:34.149
So we'll settle for knocking you out,

251
00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:36.049
stripping you naked,

252
00:15:36.049 --> 00:15:38.249
and uploading a dirty video of you to the web.

253
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:43.049
You idiot.

254
00:15:44.149 --> 00:15:46.649
The only person in this world

255
00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.849
who's allowed to see Eri naked is me!

256
00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:52.449
Darn it!

257
00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:57.049
Osoto!

258
00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:01.149
Into...

259
00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:03.249
triangle choke!

260
00:16:12.549 --> 00:16:14.449
Honey, are you all right?

261
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:18.449
Yeah. Anyway, who is this guy?

262
00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:22.449
An abusive husband whose wife divorced him.

263
00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:25.649
In order to get revenge for losing to me in court,

264
00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:30.149
he gathered a group of other husbands who lost to me to kidnap me,

265
00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:33.249
so they could film a video of me apologizing.

266
00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:35.249
I see.

267
00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:37.149
Anyway, where are the other two?

268
00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:38.349
Huh?

269
00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:41.549
The skinny gambler and the fat cheater.

270
00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:44.549
They should still be somewhere inside this building.

271
00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:47.249
Oh, in that case...

272
00:16:49.549 --> 00:16:52.349
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

273
00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.949
What's going on?

274
00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:00.049
Hey!

275
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:11.449
Hey, get out of the way!

276
00:17:17.249 --> 00:17:20.749
I won a kendo tournament once...

277
00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:34.349
Ran, are you okay?

278
00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:36.449
Yeah, I'm fine.

279
00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:39.649
I'm more worried about Mom.

280
00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:41.649
Actually...

281
00:17:41.649 --> 00:17:46.049
I'm more worried about these two.

282
00:17:46.049 --> 00:17:47.449
Although...

283
00:17:49.049 --> 00:17:53.749
She won the moment she kicked in the shutter.

284
00:17:58.349 --> 00:17:59.849
By the way, honey...

285
00:17:59.849 --> 00:18:00.949
Huh?

286
00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:03.149
How did you come in through the window?

287
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:04.949
We're on the fourth floor.

288
00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:07.949
Well, you know.

289
00:18:07.949 --> 00:18:09.449
"You know"?

290
00:18:09.449 --> 00:18:11.849
Was there an emergency staircase outside?

291
00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:14.549
What does it matter?

292
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:16.449
Don't worry about the details.

293
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:19.449
That's right.

294
00:18:19.449 --> 00:18:21.149
It's an abandoned building in Sutan-cho.

295
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:23.549
Please get here immediately, Officer Takagi.

296
00:18:25.749 --> 00:18:29.349
Now that we've called the police, this case is solved.

297
00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:32.549
No, there's still one thing that hasn't been solved.

298
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:33.649
Huh?

299
00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:37.449
You, Conan.

300
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.549
What? Me?

301
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:42.449
The detective skills you demonstrated to get us here.

302
00:18:42.449 --> 00:18:45.749
It's hard to think that was the work of a grade school student.

303
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:48.449
Conan, are you...

304
00:18:56.949 --> 00:18:59.249
Yeah, you're right.

305
00:18:59.249 --> 00:19:00.349
Huh?

306
00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.249
It's exactly what you think.

307
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.749
-See? -Huh?

308
00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:13.049
What?

309
00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:14.949
"Shinichi" -You heard him.

310
00:19:14.949 --> 00:19:18.249
I was so busy giving instructions to the kid,

311
00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:21.049
I didn't get to eat dinner.

312
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:23.649
Tell your mom to check who it is

313
00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:28.449
before opening the door for any clients without appointments.

314
00:19:28.449 --> 00:19:29.749
Later.

315
00:19:29.749 --> 00:19:32.649
Hey, wait. Shinichi!

316
00:19:32.649 --> 00:19:36.349
He was talking to me on the phone the whole time,

317
00:19:36.349 --> 00:19:40.449
since you and your mom were busy chatting.

318
00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:45.449
I see. You were holding your phone the whole time.

319
00:19:45.449 --> 00:19:47.849
So that's what it was.

320
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:50.649
Huh? I thought you noticed...

321
00:19:50.649 --> 00:19:53.849
You really are just Conan.

322
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:57.549
Right.

323
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:58.849
Of course.

324
00:20:02.049 --> 00:20:04.149
That was close.

325
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:06.649
So she did suspect me.

326
00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:10.149
I was right to record my own voice.

327
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:12.949
"The Metropolitan Police Department" -Good work, Takagi.

328
00:20:12.949 --> 00:20:15.149
No, thank you, Mouri.

329
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:17.849
I'd like to interview you about the case,

330
00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.249
so if you could come down to the station...

331
00:20:19.249 --> 00:20:20.449
I can't.

332
00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:23.749
Sorry, but that'll have to wait until tomorrow.

333
00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:28.249
I've got a dinner and movie date with my wife after this.

334
00:20:31.349 --> 00:20:32.949
Right?

335
00:20:34.349 --> 00:20:35.449
Yes.

336
00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:42.749
No way. They're interlocking fingers.

337
00:20:42.749 --> 00:20:45.849
Is this what you call a lucky hit?

338
00:20:54.249 --> 00:20:55.649
In that case,

339
00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:58.549
then I'll call you later to arrange a time.

340
00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:00.749
Please do.

341
00:21:00.749 --> 00:21:02.549
Thank you.

342
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:04.649
In that case, enjoy your evening.

343
00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:34.949
"Court Detective, Saki Kirie" -No, I didn't just win the case.

344
00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:38.849
I, Saki Kirie, simply saw the truth.

345
00:22:38.849 --> 00:22:39.949
That's right.

346
00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:42.349
You only ever need...

347
00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:45.649
one truth.

348
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:48.449
She's so cute.

349
00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:50.949
That was great.

350
00:22:50.949 --> 00:22:54.449
The incompetent detective character wasn't a bad guy either.

351
00:22:54.449 --> 00:22:55.549
Yeah.

352
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:57.449
What is this?

353
00:22:57.449 --> 00:22:59.449
Huh?

354
00:22:59.449 --> 00:23:02.449
She was giving out objections like candy.

355
00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:05.449
You'd just be making a terrible impression

356
00:23:05.449 --> 00:23:07.949
on the court by pestering them,

357
00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:11.949
and there's no way a lawyer could suddenly make a witness speak

358
00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:13.249
without permission from the judge.

359
00:23:13.249 --> 00:23:15.449
The scene in which she drunkenly

360
00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:18.149
complained about the case to the bartender

361
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:19.749
was presented as comical,

362
00:23:19.749 --> 00:23:23.849
but she'd be disciplined for breaking confidentiality like that.

363
00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:28.049
And how dare she speak so highhandedly in court?

364
00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:31.649
Wasn't that unduly pretentious?

365
00:23:31.649 --> 00:23:33.949
You're not that different.

366
00:23:33.949 --> 00:23:37.149
Maybe they modelled her character after you.

367
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:38.649
That can't be.

368
00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:40.649
I'm nothing like her.

369
00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:41.949
Yeah, you're right!

370
00:23:41.949 --> 00:23:46.249
-Yoko's a better lawyer than you! -Why does it always turn out this way?

371
00:23:46.249 --> 00:23:47.449
Come to think of it,

372
00:23:47.449 --> 00:23:50.549
"Eri Kisaki" -Saki Kirie is an anagram of Eri Kisaki...

373
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:52.049
"Saki Kirie" -Saki Kirie is an anagram of Eri Kisaki...

374
00:23:54.449 --> 00:23:58.449
"Next Episode" -Why do I have to apologize?

375
00:23:58.449 --> 00:24:01.849
Don't play dumb! You know exactly why!

376
00:24:01.849 --> 00:24:04.049
"Hiroshi Kagazume" -Two Nichiuri Sports reporters

377
00:24:04.049 --> 00:24:06.449
"Akira Hashizume" -famous for their articles on scandals.

378
00:24:06.449 --> 00:24:07.949
And that...

379
00:24:09.749 --> 00:24:11.949
turned out the worst way possible.

380
00:24:11.949 --> 00:24:13.649
Was it suicide?

381
00:24:13.649 --> 00:24:16.749
That's what we thought at first, but...

382
00:24:16.749 --> 00:24:18.249
Footprints?

383
00:24:18.849 --> 00:24:24.449
Next Conan, "Birds of a Feather at Loggerheads"

384
00:24:24.592 --> 00:24:27.092
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:29.392
"Tumbler"

386
00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:30.492
I'm Saki Kirie.

387
00:24:30.492 --> 00:24:32.692
-I'm Unmo Rira. -Then I'm Rikou Morogou!

388
00:24:32.692 --> 00:24:34.092
Rikou (Smart)?
