1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,370
Go, go! Break away!

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,570
This is the last one, Pops!

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,870
Ran will get mad at me if you run out of money!

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,870
Keep a close eye on him, Conan.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,870
He just got paid,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,370
and he gambled away all of it in just half a day the other day.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,470
Not only that, but that's actually my money.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,470
Got it, Conan?

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,770
Got it.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,070
Pops!

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,770
Shut up. I know.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,170
Yes, yes!

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,670
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,670
All right!

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,370
What? You must be joking.

16
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,270
Here's the problem, should I man up and...

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,670
Yeah, and go home.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,070
Should I bet the rest of my money?

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,070
Or drink my sorrows away?

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,070
Now that's the problem.

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,970
Both would be huge problems.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,270
Excuse me.

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,470
Are you the great detective, Kogoro Mouri?

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,870
-What? -What?

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,070
Indeed. I am the great detective, Mouri.

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,370
Excuse me. I'm unfortunately out of business cards.

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,770
I'm a freelance horse racing journalist.

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,570
I'd like to hire you for a job.

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,270
Yes, yes. More gambling money.

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,370
In my eyes are maximum creation.

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,170
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,870
He keeps talking about gambling money,

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,970
but there's something fishy about all these horse racing jobs.

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,670
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:46,827
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 1)"

38
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,427
"Mouri Detective Agency" -We're home.

39
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,527
We're back.

40
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:52,927
Dad, hurry.

41
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,327
What?

42
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,627
You have a client, dad.

43
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,827
Well, well.

44
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,627
Thank for you waiting.

45
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:09,027
I am the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

46
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:12,927
Excuse me. I'm unfortunately out of business cards.

47
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:17,827
I write horse racing predictions and reviews online.

48
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:20,927
I'd like to ask you to do something for me.

49
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,427
Business is booming!

50
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,127
Are you sure, Pops?

51
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,927
That job was the same as the last one.

52
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:38,227
Excuse me, but I'm a huge horse racing fan.

53
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:40,527
I'd actually like to hire you.

54
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:43,027
What? What?

55
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,927
Anyway, that's that.

56
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,127
Thank you, detective.

57
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,927
What's going on?

58
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:17,627
We did it.

59
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,827
Yeah. Now we can relax.

60
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:21,027
You're right.

61
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:24,427
With a famous detective on the case, surely...

62
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,027
I don't know what's going on,

63
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:44,627
but there's something fishy about these jobs.

64
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,327
"Tokuyoshi Stables"

65
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,927
Why are you following me?

66
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,927
Ran told me to follow you.

67
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:11,027
She's worried because of what the jobs are about.

68
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:13,627
If you're near a track when you get paid,

69
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:17,327
you might spend all of it like always.

70
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:20,427
Don't worry.

71
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:25,127
This time I'm earning triple the money.

72
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:31,727
Are you sure you should've accepted the same job three times?

73
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:34,227
He's the most popular horse right now.

74
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,927
Coincidences happen.

75
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,127
I meant as a detective.

76
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,427
That's him!

77
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:47,627
White Spirits,

78
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:50,827
"White Spirits, Racing Horse" -the horse with the pure white soul.

79
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:56,527
"Yasutaka Hase (40), Trainer"

80
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,727
It's a beautiful horse.

81
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:05,827
No wonder they say he's the horse of the decade.

82
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:08,427
Indeed, indeed.

83
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,027
I've been blessed as a horse owner.

84
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:14,027
Who are you?

85
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:15,727
Please excuse me.

86
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,627
I took your call earlier.

87
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:19,627
"Kozo Tokuyoshi (55), Horse Owner" -I'm Kozo Tokuyoshi.

88
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:24,127
You must be Kogoro Mouri, the great detective.

89
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,427
Indeed, I am the great detective, Mouri.

90
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:32,227
I see. So you're the owner of that amazing horse.

91
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:36,827
You said you were here about White Spirits?

92
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:37,927
Indeed.

93
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:42,927
Tokuyoshi, I understand you've been receiving death threats

94
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:47,227
against White Spirits since about a month ago.

95
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,427
How do you know that?

96
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:53,227
Detectives are bound to confidentiality,

97
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:54,827
so I cannot answer your question,

98
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:58,827
but I've been hired to investigate and protect White Spirits

99
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:02,827
by someone who heard about the threats.

100
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:05,227
By three different people, too.

101
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:09,027
I see. That's perfect, then.

102
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,027
What?

103
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:12,427
I'd like to hire you, too.

104
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:15,927
Please protect White Spirits, Mouri.

105
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,027
What?

106
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,827
He's been hired by four people now.

107
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:25,527
Thank you, Mouri.

108
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,627
The next day,

109
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:33,627
White Spirits was being transported to a track outside Tokyo

110
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:36,927
to participate in a commemorative race.

111
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,427
"White Spirits"

112
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:40,727
We're counting on you.

113
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:44,727
"Masao Shiomi (50), Horse Trailer Driver" -Got it.

114
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:49,927
Why are you here, too, Ran?

115
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,327
I'm watching you.

116
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,127
I wasn't sure Conan could handle it alone.

117
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,327
You're unbelievable.

118
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:02,427
Just kidding. I'm actually a White Spirits fan.

119
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,027
What? Don't tell me you...

120
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:08,527
Of course not. I'm underage.

121
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:14,227
I just like how fast and beautiful White Spirits is.

122
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:16,227
That's why I'm worried.

123
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:18,427
Yeah, but...

124
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,727
Why not, Mouri?

125
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,027
I feel safer with more people.

126
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,427
Come, miss.

127
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:27,827
You're welcome to join me in my car.

128
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,527
Thank you!

129
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:37,627
Don't do this, sir. This is reckless.

130
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,627
If something were to happen to White Spirits...

131
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,627
Don't worry.

132
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,027
The great detective Kogoro Mouri is here.

133
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:50,227
White Spirits will appear in the race as planned.

134
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:53,227
You all just need to do your jobs.

135
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,927
You all?

136
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,227
What's up with that car?

137
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,927
They shouldn't surprise people like that.

138
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:25,127
Hey, wasn't that this person?

139
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,227
"This Month's Woman Jockey White Spirits' Rider"

140
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,427
"Chizuru Kakuta (25), Jockey"

141
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:30,827
They're on schedule.

142
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,527
That's them.

143
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:39,727
But why were they wearing disguises?

144
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:59,627
"Construction 50m Ahead Detour" -What's wrong? Hey, you can't just...

145
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:01,027
What?

146
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,427
Follow that car.

147
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,427
Where'd the trailer go?

148
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,027
What's wrong?

149
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,127
There's construction up ahead.

150
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:25,327
That sign was placed incorrectly.

151
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:33,027
I'm sorry. Thank you for waiting.

152
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:36,127
What a waste of time.

153
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,527
Now, now. We have time.

154
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,427
Let's take it slowly.

155
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,927
What is it?

156
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,427
Something not right.

157
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:49,027
I have a bad feeling about this.

158
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,627
"Okuho Horse Track"

159
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:06,127
I'm glad he's all right.

160
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:11,727
Nothing's gonna happen with the great detective, Kogoro Mouri on the job.

161
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:13,127
It's not him.

162
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:16,627
-What? -This isn't White Spirits.

163
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:17,727
What?

164
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:22,727
"White Spirits"

165
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:20,394
I knew it.

166
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:21,394
You're right.

167
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,994
There's no construction happening at all.

168
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,194
This is ridiculous.

169
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:26,194
Look.

170
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:30,294
Is that...

171
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:31,494
Yeah.

172
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:38,394
They're tire marks from the real trailer the culprit drove away

173
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:43,294
after the driver Shiomi got into the other trailer.

174
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,394
What's wrong, Conan?

175
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:47,794
Nothing.

176
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:50,994
I was just thinking this is like that other case.

177
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:53,794
What? This has happened before?

178
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:58,794
It's called the "The Adventure of Silver Blaze".

179
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:02,894
What's that? I've never heard of it.

180
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:07,694
It's a Sherlock Holmes story written by Conan Doyle.

181
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:10,594
You're talking about a book?

182
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,394
What nonsense.

183
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:15,594
I hope that's all it is.

184
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,694
Hello?

185
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,394
Oh, Takagi.

186
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:25,094
That's good.

187
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,994
Any leads on the suspect?

188
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,594
I see. We'll meet you right away.

189
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:34,494
Was that Officer Takagi?

190
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:39,194
Yeah. The driver Shiomi's wife and child were released,

191
00:15:39,194 --> 00:15:42,294
and made it back home.

192
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,294
But they were blindfolded,

193
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:47,194
so they don't know anything about the culprit.

194
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,594
I see.

195
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,494
I'm glad they're all right, though.

196
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,394
"Kozo Tokuyoshi"

197
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:01,094
Leave! Leave me!

198
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,694
Can't you read this?

199
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:07,094
Let me see that.

200
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:08,394
"In one hour, come alone to the fountain at Tsubaki Park."

201
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,994
"Bring the 100 million yen with you."

202
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:12,994
"If anyone else comes, other than the president,"

203
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,594
"White Spirits will not return forever."

204
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,394
What is this?

205
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:22,994
Tokuyoshi found it in his mailbox.

206
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,894
He said he was going out alone

207
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:30,294
with White Spirits' 100 million yen ransom.

208
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:32,594
Without our protection.

209
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:36,394
He what? That's too dangerous.

210
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:39,994
We said the same thing.

211
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:43,394
Danger? Protection?

212
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:46,694
It's all just to arrest the culprit.

213
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:49,694
I can't trust the police or detectives.

214
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:53,594
If you follow me, I'll sue all of you.

215
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,394
Don't forget that!

216
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,094
Inspector.

217
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,594
Of course.

218
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,994
We can't ignore a crime happening right before our eyes.

219
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:14,694
We'll follow them carefully

220
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:17,594
so neither the culprit nor Tokuyoshi notice.

221
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:18,694
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

222
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,294
What is this?

223
00:17:56,294 --> 00:18:01,494
WS, KM North ST.

224
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,094
WS...

225
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:05,594
WS?

226
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:09,894
Maybe they're referring to White Spirits.

227
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,294
That must be it.

228
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:16,894
In other words, White Spirits is at KM North ST.

229
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,994
Where is that?

230
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:24,094
I wonder what word is normally abbreviated as ST.

231
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:26,394
Station. The train station.

232
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,394
I see.

233
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:28,894
KM North...

234
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:30,594
Katsumata North Station.

235
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:31,994
Let's go.

236
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:35,094
"Katsumata North Station"

237
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:45,894
Kozo Tokuyoshi from Yagiri-cho, you have a message.

238
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:48,294
Please come to the station office.

239
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:12,094
There was a phone call for Tokuyoshi about 30 minutes ago.

240
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:13,794
What was it?

241
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:20,194
They said to tell him, "Head to OND3BRG."

242
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:23,794
OND3? BRG?

243
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,894
Where is that?

244
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:29,794
BRG...

245
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:35,394
If it's an abbreviation like before, BRG...

246
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:37,094
Bridge.

247
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,294
Maybe it's a bridge.

248
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:44,494
So OND3 is the name of the bridge?

249
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:47,994
OND... OND...

250
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:51,394
If that's an abbreviation, too, then...

251
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,094
Hey, look.

252
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,194
Up there.

253
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:02,194
OND3. Onodera Overpass 3.

254
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:05,794
"Onodera Overpass 3"

255
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:20,494
Could it be?

256
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:38,494
Darn it. I can't see from here.

257
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,094
I still can't...

258
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,394
I still can't see it.

259
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:51,294
Here should be good enough.

260
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,394
I see it.

261
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:55,494
Stake it out.

262
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:56,494
Yes, sir.

263
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:17,294
Darn. It's been thirty minutes.

264
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:19,194
What's going on?

265
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:23,294
Could it be? Chiba, Takagi.

266
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:24,294
Yes.

267
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:32,494
What is this?

268
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:33,594
What happened?

269
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,594
It's not here!

270
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:39,494
What?

271
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,794
Darn it! They got us!

272
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,694
What's going on?

273
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:47,794
After Tokuyoshi threw down the bag,

274
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:49,194
the culprit must've come out of hiding

275
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:51,794
and switched out the contents.

276
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:57,294
Then they left before we arrived.

277
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:58,594
They what?

278
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:03,294
So the culprit was long gone.

279
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:13,294
The next day,

280
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:16,094
there was another sudden development in the case.

281
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,894
"White Spirits"

282
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:57,294
"Next Episode"

283
00:23:57,294 --> 00:24:00,294
I'm not his babysitter.

284
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:02,894
I see. So that's how it is.

285
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:05,394
But why?

286
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:06,994
Horse brothers?

287
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:13,594
You think you've used the great Kogoro Mouri,

288
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:15,594
but you haven't at all.

289
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:17,194
Go, go!

290
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:20,394
Next Conan,

291
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:24,294
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 2)"

292
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,437
Next Conan's Hint:

293
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:27,537
Just kidding.

294
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:29,337
"Mane"

295
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:30,637
White Spirits...

296
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,337
Is that the name of a liquor?

297
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,837
Please don't.
