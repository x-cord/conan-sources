1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,491
Go, go! Break away!

2
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,570
This is the last one, Pops!

3
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:16,308
Ran will get mad at me if you run out of money!

4
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,520
Keep a close eye on him, Conan.

5
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,697
He just got paid,

6
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:26,068
and he gambled away all of it in just half a day the other day.

7
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:29,680
Not only that, but that's actually my money.

8
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,988
Got it, Conan?

9
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:33,840
Got it.

10
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:35,622
Pops!

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,388
Shut up. I know.

12
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:39,268
Yes, yes!

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,508
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,400
All right!

15
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:51,074
What? You must be joking.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,994
Here's the problem, should I man up and...

17
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,497
Yeah, and go home.

18
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:03,760
Should I bet the rest of my money?

19
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,908
Or drink my sorrows away?

20
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,451
Now that's the problem.

21
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:10,697
Both would be huge problems.

22
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:13,565
Excuse me.

23
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:17,291
Are you the great detective, Kogoro Mouri?

24
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:18,297
-What? -What?

25
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,251
Indeed. I am the great detective, Mouri.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,777
Excuse me. I'm unfortunately out of business cards.

27
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm a freelance horse racing journalist.

28
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,022
I'd like to hire you for a job.

29
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,891
Yes, yes. More gambling money.

30
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,411
In my eyes are maximum creation.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,274
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

32
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,748
He keeps talking about gambling money,

33
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,977
but there's something fishy about all these horse racing jobs.

34
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,565
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,268
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,440
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,840
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 1)"

38
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,430
"Mouri Detective Agency" -We're home.

39
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,560
We're back.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,930
Dad, hurry.

41
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,350
What?

42
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,640
You have a client, dad.

43
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,860
Well, well.

44
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,650
Thank for you waiting.

45
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,030
I am the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

46
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,950
Excuse me. I'm unfortunately out of business cards.

47
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,830
I write horse racing predictions and reviews online.

48
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,960
I'd like to ask you to do something for me.

49
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,460
Business is booming!

50
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,130
Are you sure, Pops?

51
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,930
That job was the same as the last one.

52
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,230
Excuse me, but I'm a huge horse racing fan.

53
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,560
I'd actually like to hire you.

54
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,070
What? What?

55
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,950
Anyway, that's that.

56
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,160
Thank you, detective.

57
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,930
What's going on?

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,640
We did it.

59
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,850
Yeah. Now we can relax.

60
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,060
You're right.

61
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,430
With a famous detective on the case, surely...

62
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,040
I don't know what's going on,

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,660
but there's something fishy about these jobs.

64
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,340
"Tokuyoshi Stables"

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,930
Why are you following me?

66
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,940
Ran told me to follow you.

67
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,020
She's worried because of what the jobs are about.

68
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,650
If you're near a track when you get paid,

69
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,360
you might spend all of it like always.

70
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,450
Don't worry.

71
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,160
This time I'm earning triple the money.

72
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,750
Are you sure you should've accepted the same job three times?

73
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,250
He's the most popular horse right now.

74
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,920
Coincidences happen.

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,130
I meant as a detective.

76
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,430
That's him!

77
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,640
White Spirits,

78
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,850
"White Spirits, Racing Horse" -the horse with the pure white soul.

79
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,530
"Yasutaka Hase (40), Trainer"

80
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,740
It's a beautiful horse.

81
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,830
No wonder they say he's the horse of the decade.

82
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,450
Indeed, indeed.

83
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,040
I've been blessed as a horse owner.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Who are you?

85
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,750
Please excuse me.

86
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,630
I took your call earlier.

87
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,630
"Kozo Tokuyoshi (55), Horse Owner" -I'm Kozo Tokuyoshi.

88
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,140
You must be Kogoro Mouri, the great detective.

89
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,430
Indeed, I am the great detective, Mouri.

90
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,230
I see. So you're the owner of that amazing horse.

91
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,860
You said you were here about White Spirits?

92
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,940
Indeed.

93
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,950
Tokuyoshi, I understand you've been receiving death threats

94
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,240
against White Spirits since about a month ago.

95
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,450
How do you know that?

96
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,250
Detectives are bound to confidentiality,

97
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,830
so I cannot answer your question,

98
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,840
but I've been hired to investigate and protect White Spirits

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,840
by someone who heard about the threats.

100
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,260
By three different people, too.

101
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,060
I see. That's perfect, then.

102
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
What?

103
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,440
I'd like to hire you, too.

104
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,940
Please protect White Spirits, Mouri.

105
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,020
What?

106
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,860
He's been hired by four people now.

107
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,530
Thank you, Mouri.

108
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,660
The next day,

109
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,620
White Spirits was being transported to a track outside Tokyo

110
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,960
to participate in a commemorative race.

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,460
"White Spirits"

112
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,760
We're counting on you.

113
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,760
"Masao Shiomi (50), Horse Trailer Driver" -Got it.

114
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,930
Why are you here, too, Ran?

115
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,350
I'm watching you.

116
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,140
I wasn't sure Conan could handle it alone.

117
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,360
You're unbelievable.

118
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,440
Just kidding. I'm actually a White Spirits fan.

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,030
What? Don't tell me you...

120
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,530
Of course not. I'm underage.

121
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,250
I just like how fast and beautiful White Spirits is.

122
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
That's why I'm worried.

123
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,460
Yeah, but...

124
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,750
Why not, Mouri?

125
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,050
I feel safer with more people.

126
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,420
Come, miss.

127
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,840
You're welcome to join me in my car.

128
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,550
Thank you!

129
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,650
Don't do this, sir. This is reckless.

130
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,650
If something were to happen to White Spirits...

131
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,650
Don't worry.

132
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,030
The great detective Kogoro Mouri is here.

133
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,240
White Spirits will appear in the race as planned.

134
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,240
You all just need to do your jobs.

135
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,960
You all?

136
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,220
What's up with that car?

137
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,940
They shouldn't surprise people like that.

138
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,150
Hey, wasn't that this person?

139
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,240
"This Month's Woman Jockey White Spirits' Rider"

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,450
"Chizuru Kakuta (25), Jockey"

141
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,820
They're on schedule.

142
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,540
That's them.

143
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,750
But why were they wearing disguises?

144
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,640
"Construction 50m Ahead Detour" -What's wrong? Hey, you can't just...

145
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,060
What?

146
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,440
Follow that car.

147
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,450
Where'd the trailer go?

148
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,040
What's wrong?

149
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,120
There's construction up ahead.

150
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,340
That sign was placed incorrectly.

151
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,050
I'm sorry. Thank you for waiting.

152
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,140
What a waste of time.

153
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,560
Now, now. We have time.

154
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,430
Let's take it slowly.

155
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,940
What is it?

156
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,440
Something not right.

157
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,030
I have a bad feeling about this.

158
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,660
"Okuho Horse Track"

159
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,130
I'm glad he's all right.

160
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,760
Nothing's gonna happen with the great detective, Kogoro Mouri on the job.

161
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,130
It's not him.

162
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,640
-What? -This isn't White Spirits.

163
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,720
What?

164
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,730
"White Spirits"

165
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:32,463
I knew it.

166
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:33,422
You're right.

167
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,007
There's no construction happening at all.

168
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:37,218
This is ridiculous.

169
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:38,260
Look.

170
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,306
Is that...

171
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:43,557
Yeah.

172
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:50,397
They're tire marks from the real trailer the culprit drove away

173
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:55,361
after the driver Shiomi got into the other trailer.

174
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:58,447
What's wrong, Conan?

175
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,824
Nothing.

176
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:03,035
I was just thinking this is like that other case.

177
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:05,788
What? This has happened before?

178
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:10,835
It's called the "The Adventure of Silver Blaze".

179
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:14,964
What's that? I've never heard of it.

180
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:19,760
It's a Sherlock Holmes story written by Conan Doyle.

181
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,596
You're talking about a book?

182
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,431
What nonsense.

183
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,643
I hope that's all it is.

184
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:32,731
Hello?

185
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,442
Oh, Takagi.

186
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:37,153
That's good.

187
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,988
Any leads on the suspect?

188
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,617
I see. We'll meet you right away.

189
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,537
Was that Officer Takagi?

190
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:51,250
Yeah. The driver Shiomi's wife and child were released,

191
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,336
and made it back home.

192
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,297
But they were blindfolded,

193
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:59,216
so they don't know anything about the culprit.

194
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,634
I see.

195
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,553
I'm glad they're all right, though.

196
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:06,432
"Kozo Tokuyoshi"

197
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:13,147
Leave! Leave me!

198
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:15,733
Can't you read this?

199
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,111
Let me see that.

200
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:19,278
"In one hour, come alone to the fountain at Tsubaki Park."

201
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:19,320
I knew it.
"In one hour, come alone to the fountain at Tsubaki Park."

202
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,446
"In one hour, come alone to the fountain at Tsubaki Park."

203
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:21,989
"Bring the 100 million yen with you."

204
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:24,992
"If anyone else comes, other than the president,"

205
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,619
"White Spirits will not return forever."

206
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,413
What is this?

207
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:35,002
Tokuyoshi found it in his mailbox.

208
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:37,922
He said he was going out alone

209
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:42,301
with White Spirits' 100 million yen ransom.

210
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:44,637
Without our protection.

211
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:48,390
He what? That's too dangerous.

212
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,019
We said the same thing.

213
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,397
Danger? Protection?

214
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:58,692
It's all just to arrest the culprit.

215
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:01,737
I can't trust the police or detectives.

216
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:05,658
If you follow me, I'll sue all of you.

217
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,409
Don't forget that!

218
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,088
Inspector.

219
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:20,589
Of course.

220
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,010
We can't ignore a crime happening right before our eyes.

221
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,720
We'll follow them carefully

222
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,598
so neither the culprit nor Tokuyoshi notice.

223
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:30,683
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

224
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:08,304
What is this?

225
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:13,517
WS, KM North ST.

226
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:15,102
WS...

227
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:17,646
WS?

228
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:21,900
Maybe they're referring to White Spirits.

229
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,319
That must be it.

230
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:28,907
In other words, White Spirits is at KM North ST.

231
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,993
Where is that?

232
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:36,081
I wonder what word is normally abbreviated as ST.

233
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,417
Station. The train station.

234
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,418
I see.

235
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:40,919
KM North...

236
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,588
Katsumata North Station.

237
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,048
Let's go.

238
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:47,092
"Katsumata North Station"

239
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:57,936
Kozo Tokuyoshi from Yagiri-cho, you have a message.

240
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:00,314
Please come to the station office.

241
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:24,088
There was a phone call for Tokuyoshi about 30 minutes ago.

242
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,798
What was it?

243
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:32,221
They said to tell him, "Head to OND3BRG."

244
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:35,808
OND3? BRG?

245
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,893
Where is that?

246
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,814
BRG...

247
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:47,403
If it's an abbreviation like before, BRG...

248
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,113
Bridge.

249
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,281
Maybe it's a bridge.

250
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:56,537
So OND3 is the name of the bridge?

251
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:59,998
OND... OND...

252
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,419
If that's an abbreviation, too, then...

253
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:08,090
Hey, look.

254
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,216
Up there.

255
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:14,221
OND3. Onodera Overpass 3.

256
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:17,808
"Onodera Overpass 3"

257
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,489
Could it be?

258
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,507
Darn it. I can't see from here.

259
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:56,096
I still can't...

260
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,389
I still can't see it.

261
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,312
Here should be good enough.

262
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:06,398
I see it.

263
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:07,483
Stake it out.

264
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,484
Yes, sir.

265
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:29,296
Darn. It's been thirty minutes.

266
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:31,256
What's going on?

267
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,302
Could it be? Chiba, Takagi.

268
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:36,303
Yes.

269
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:44,520
What is this?

270
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,604
What happened?

271
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,608
It's not here!

272
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,527
What?

273
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,820
Darn it! They got us!

274
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,697
What's going on?

275
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:59,826
After Tokuyoshi threw down the bag,

276
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:01,203
the culprit must've come out of hiding

277
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,789
and switched out the contents.

278
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:09,336
Then they left before we arrived.

279
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:10,587
They what?

280
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:15,300
So the culprit was long gone.

281
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:25,310
The next day,

282
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,146
there was another sudden development in the case.

283
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:39,908
"White Spirits"

284
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:09,289
"Next Episode"

285
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:12,292
I'm not his babysitter.

286
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,920
I see. So that's how it is.

287
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,381
But why?

288
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,007
Horse brothers?

289
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:25,597
You think you've used the great Kogoro Mouri,

290
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:27,599
but you haven't at all.

291
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,184
Go, go!

292
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,437
Next Conan,

293
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:36,358
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 2)"

294
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,443
Next Conan's Hint:

295
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,569
Just kidding.

296
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,363
"Mane"

297
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:42,697
White Spirits...

298
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,408
Is that the name of a liquor?

299
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:45,867
Please don't.
