1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,182
Four years ago,

2
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:04,282
there is a legendary woman driver, Silver-white Witch,

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:07,482
who drives a white FD that is said to have street raced

4
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,882
all over Mt. Fuyuna.

5
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:11,782
Accident after accident have been occurring to the street racers

6
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,082
because recently the legendary driver has appeared again,

7
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:17,282
challenging the street racers to have a match with her.

8
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:20,082
According to Inspector Yamamura's grandmother

9
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:22,982
that happened to encounter Silver-white Witch,

10
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:26,782
the witch'car sped through on the fog where there is no road.

11
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:28,282
And when she got out of the car,

12
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,982
she stands on the fog and waves her hand.

13
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,782
Pops who heard about this

14
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:36,982
head off early in the morning to Mt. Fuyuna

15
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:40,182
saying that he was going to catch the witch.

16
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,182
The witch's white FD appears

17
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:44,582
on the mountain road enveloped by a thick fog.

18
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:57,982
We pursue the witch as Pops goes after her with all his might,

19
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:01,982
but the white FD leaves behind a woman's scream like skidding sound

20
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:05,082
and disappears into the fog.

21
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:06,682
It can't be!

22
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,282
This had got to be a trick of some kind!

23
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,182
"Checkpoint" -In order to confirm this,

24
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:14,482
we contacted Inspector Yamamura who was doing a checkpoint search,

25
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:17,582
and asked him to stop all the white FDs.

26
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:22,782
As a result, three FDs and three pairs of drivers were stopped.

27
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,082
Is the witch among them?

28
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:29,982
And how did the witch's FD speed along on the fog?

29
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:34,182
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

30
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,782
Saturday nights are for mystery.

31
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:38,782
Sounds of cars speeding within the fog.

32
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,782
Disclose the true identity of the witch!

33
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:42,382
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:44,282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,282
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

36
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,359
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 2)".

37
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,559
"Raito Egashira (25)" -How rude!

38
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,559
We're telling you we're not warlocks!

39
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,659
"Akira Mafune (26)" -Well, it's true that we're riding a white FD

40
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,059
thanks to her, though.

41
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:46,259
Were you guys going fishing?

42
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,959
See! The things in the backseat, aren't they fishing equipment?

43
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,159
Yeah, because we get to fish for black bass in Lake Fuyuna.

44
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,259
And? Is it really true

45
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:59,759
that you didn't overtake anyone until you came here?

46
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,359
Yeah, because he was at the wheels today.

47
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,359
He may not look it, but he's a safe driver.

48
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,659
Shut up.

49
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,259
Hey.

50
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,159
You're sure wearing some ring.

51
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,259
Yeah. Thanks to it, when I tried to fasten my seatbelt, it got stuck

52
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,559
and I'm still bleeding.

53
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,259
The reason I'm riding a white FD?

54
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,559
"Rumi Hando (23)" -Why else? Because I adore the witch!

55
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,959
"Haruka Kawai (24)" -She's charismatic, that's why!

56
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,259
And? It seems that somebody overtook you on your way here?

57
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:36,159
Yeah, I got a call while I was driving,

58
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,759
so I pulled over to the side. And that's when two to three cars overtook me.

59
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,159
Was that call by any chance from one of your golfing friends?

60
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,859
Because there are three golf bags inside.

61
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,459
That's why I thought so.

62
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,459
I'm asking you, who's he?

63
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,359
Well, this boy is...

64
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:55,159
Huh, what happened to your fake nail?

65
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,559
Your middle fingernail is gone.

66
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,259
When I shifted gears a while ago,

67
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,059
it got stuck and disappeared.

68
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:05,159
"Jinya Enda (31)" -You mean the witch that frequently appears here

69
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,559
is riding a white FD?

70
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,359
"Yasue Taira (28)" -I didn't know.

71
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:13,159
Were you overtaken by another white FD?

72
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,559
Yes, I was buying canned coffee along the way, when I was overtaken,

73
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,159
but I don't remember what model car it was.

74
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,259
While drinking coffee in the car,

75
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,459
we were all talking excitedly about Lakeside Park where we were headed.

76
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,059
That's why you brought along floats and rubber boats?

77
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:34,359
Well, we'd like to check your rubber boat and float for now then.

78
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,359
Hey, Misao.

79
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,659
Granny!

80
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,959
I told you to stay in the car!

81
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,059
Back then, the one who got off the car on top of the fog

82
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:48,359
and waved back at me

83
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,759
had a halo around her.

84
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,359
She looked more like a goddess than a witch to me.

85
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:01,259
So, the six of them went home.

86
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,159
The witch could've been among them and yet...

87
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,459
But the arms of the three

88
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,259
that were sitting in the passenger's seat of each car

89
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,359
were not anything like the witch's arm that we saw.

90
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:17,259
Dad also said that she could've really been a witch.

91
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,059
I see.

92
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:21,459
Oh, right.

93
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,059
I just called because I was a bit concerned.

94
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:25,959
Bye, then, Ran!

95
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,259
The Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna ridge...

96
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,559
Come to think of it,

97
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,459
there was a time when you used to get up early in the morning

98
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,059
to go there, wasn't there, Miwako?

99
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,359
Yes.

100
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,859
Because the hospital that the girl who lost both her parents,

101
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:43,459
and lost her ability to speak because of the incident

102
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,559
was located at the top of the mountain.

103
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:48,359
But after I went to see her several times,

104
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,759
she began to smile.

105
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,359
By the time she was discharged from the hospital,

106
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:56,559
she said, "I'm going to be a police detective like you".

107
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,859
Fantastic, don't you think?

108
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,759
And, didn't you see the witch back then?

109
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,159
Beats me, because wanted to see the girl as soon as possible

110
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,459
that I wasn't concerned about anything else.

111
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,559
Somebody! Please stop him!

112
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,159
A convenience store robbery?

113
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,259
Sorry, Yumi.

114
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,659
Let's go sing karaoke some other time!

115
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,859
That car is fast!

116
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:32,159
Yumi, I'm sorry, but I'm doing "that" in a long time!

117
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,359
Huh? Are you serious?

118
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,259
What's going on?

119
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,059
Are they having a car race or something?

120
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:47,259
Talk about taking it easy

121
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,059
when here we are looking for

122
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,459
and troubled over an unidentifiable sonic witch.

123
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,759
Well, I've more or less an idea on who the witch is.

124
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,459
It's probably the FD of that person that made a weird remark

125
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,659
but I still can't figure out at all, how the car sped on the fog

126
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,559
and the trick of standing outside and waving hands.

127
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,159
Oh, no!

128
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,359
It's 8:50 pm!

129
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,459
Yomiuri TV! Yomiuri TV!

130
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,759
The TV won't switch on!

131
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,759
I pulled the plug out when I used the vacuum cleaner a while ago.

132
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,459
What?

133
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,559
You idiot!

134
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,459
The ending song for today's drama

135
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,059
is "Midnight Mirage" by Yoko Okino!

136
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,259
Mirage?

137
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,059
How can you be vacuuming at an important time like this?

138
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,859
It's because you knocked over the ashtray, Dad!

139
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,159
A phenomenon where the light warps

140
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,559
because of difference in density in the atmosphere,

141
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,259
causing the creation of a landscape

142
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,559
that is not there to look as if it really exists.

143
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,759
The person who waved back at me

144
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,859
had a halo around her.

145
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:49,959
Halo?

146
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,359
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.

147
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:57,359
It finished because you were taking your good old time!

148
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,759
It's because you dozed off.

149
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,059
Okay, then!

150
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,559
I think we should go back to sleep again just in case.

151
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,759
Because I think we're going to have to get up early tomorrow

152
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,759
to go witch hunting!

153
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,259
Witch hunting?

154
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,659
I hope you really know now

155
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:23,559
from the people that were stopped at the road check last week.

156
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,759
Who of the three pairs of drivers is the witch?

157
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,259
But the witch can drive the car on the fog

158
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,859
and even stand on the fog, you know?

159
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:35,259
Maybe you're under the spell of the witch

160
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,159
and being made to think that way.

161
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,559
It's the arm!

162
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,659
Arm?

163
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,559
Last week when we encountered the car of the witch,

164
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,959
there was an arm sticking out of the passenger's seat, right?

165
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,959
A witch's hand that looked as if

166
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
it were wearing a bracelet of a ring.

167
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,159
That's how I figured it out!

168
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,859
But arms of the two who were sitting in the passenger's seat of the car

169
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,659
with two men inside

170
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,859
were pretty hairy.

171
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:59,259
The arm of the woman sitting in the passenger's seat

172
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,859
with the two women inside

173
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:03,159
was quite tanned.

174
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,159
The arm of the man in the passenger's seat of the car with the man

175
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,659
and woman couple inside was big and sturdy.

176
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,959
I think it was really different

177
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,359
from the thin, white arm of the witch that we saw.

178
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:18,059
Of course! Because there's a person

179
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,859
who's lying saying that he/she was in the passenger's seat,

180
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:21,859
when in fact that person was driving the car.

181
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,159
Lying?

182
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,559
I see.

183
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,159
All the three pairs of people

184
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,059
that say they were driving have thin, white arms...

185
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:34,559
They switched so that they wouldn't be suspected as being the witch.

186
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,359
If so, the one that is suspicious is...

187
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,059
that couple.

188
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,159
The slightly plump man

189
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,359
who said that he was in the passenger's seat navigating the driver,

190
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:49,359
when he was actually filling the rubber boat up with air.

191
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,459
He couldn't have filled a rubber boat of that size up

192
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,259
with air with his mouth, that was in the backseat,

193
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,559
while sitting in the passenger's seat.

194
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,459
Yes, he could've

195
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,759
if he used a pump that is used to fill the tires of bicycles up

196
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,759
or an electric air pump.

197
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,559
That... that's true.

198
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,359
Then, are you saying that it's the pair of two women?

199
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,459
The fake nail of the middle finger of the person

200
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,859
who said she was driving was peeled off, right?

201
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:17,059
So, maybe she hurriedly switched her fake nails

202
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,659
that were black to new ones.

203
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:21,559
That could be,

204
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,459
but since she said that it came off when she shifted gears,

205
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,459
so the fake nail on her left hand could've come off too.

206
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,659
Then, don't tell me that the man with the hairy arm is lying.

207
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,559
Because he said that when he fastened his seatbelt,

208
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,559
he scratched his right cheek with his ring by mistake, right?

209
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,259
The witch's FD is a Japanese model,

210
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,659
so the steering wheel is on the right-hand side.

211
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,059
If he scratched his right cheek,

212
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,359
it would be that he pulled the seatbelt from

213
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,059
on the right-hand side of the driver's seat and fastened it.

214
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,459
Then, the arm of that witch...

215
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:57,459
I guess you want to say that it was that of the man

216
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,659
who was riding with the hairy man.

217
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,459
The pale white and thin man who made his arm

218
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,059
look like that of the witch by using accessories and fake nails,

219
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,159
but how are you going to explain how they sped on top of the fog

220
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,259
and stood on top of it too?

221
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,659
Oh, that's...

222
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:13,659
That's?

223
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,459
Have you figured it out?

224
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,459
Of course not!

225
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,359
It's really strange, isn't it?

226
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,759
Give me a break.

227
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,059
I can't say any more than this.

228
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,459
But, then again,

229
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:31,559
I can't put Pops to sleep with the tranquilizer gun while he's driving.

230
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,859
Oh, right!

231
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,959
Come to think of it,

232
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,659
the new song that Yoko is singing this time, "Midnight Mirage",

233
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,459
don't you think that it's a weird title?

234
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,959
What?

235
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,759
Because you can't see mirages at night.

236
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,959
A kid could never figure out what adults are trying to imply.

237
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,459
A mirage is a kind of magic that makes visible

238
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,059
something that is actually not there looks like it's really there, right?

239
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,559
It's not magic but just natural phenomenon!

240
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,459
Maybe the car that was in front of us

241
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,959
that looked like it was speeding on the fog

242
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,759
was actually not there too.

243
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,959
You idiot.

244
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,259
I saw with my very eyes

245
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,959
as the witch's car turned left

246
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,359
where there was no road and sped on the fog.

247
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,859
But the only thing you could see

248
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:17,759
was the red tail lights, right?

249
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,759
The fog was thick like today back then too.

250
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,359
It was just the lights,

251
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,059
you heard the sound too, didn't you?

252
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:27,659
The sound of tires skidding along the road.

253
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,159
That's why I steered the wheels to the left.

254
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,559
Huh? What's so funny?

255
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,459
Because you were lured by the light right into the trap.

256
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,759
Just like a fish that is lured over by the light of a football fish

257
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,359
and eventually eaten.

258
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,959
Football...

259
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,259
Football fish, you say?

260
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,559
Right! They had fishing rods with them!

261
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,759
If they attached

262
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,959
a red light like that of a football fish's on the tip of the rod,

263
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,059
and stick the rod out of the window of the passenger's seat side

264
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,659
just before turning the right curve,

265
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,759
at the same time swaying the rod to the left side,

266
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,459
it would probably look like a left turn was made!

267
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,059
The sound of the tires

268
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,359
could've been recorded on a car stereo or something beforehand too!

269
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,559
I thought of a simple trick like that too,

270
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,359
but that doesn't explain what's going on!

271
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:19,259
Standing on top of the fog, that is!

272
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,259
Right.

273
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,159
Speeding on the fog and standing on the fog

274
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,659
are the same tricks that were used by the witch.

275
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,959
Because we kept thinking on that line,

276
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,959
we couldn't see through the simple trick.

277
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,459
They couldn't have attached a puppet

278
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:36,359
or something to the tip of the rod and moved it either.

279
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,459
Then, why don't we ask the one who's doing it to solve the mystery?

280
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,559
The... the one? Don't tell me that you...

281
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,859
There she is,

282
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:48,459
the Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna ridge!

283
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,959
It... it's the same as back then!

284
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,359
Sign of a battle!

285
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,359
Darn! You're not getting away from me today!

286
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,559
Don't get lured over by the tail lights!

287
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,959
Okay!

288
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,959
We're not the only ones today!

289
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,698
Darn, pretty good like always, huh?

290
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,898
But today, you're not getting your way!

291
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,698
Talk about fast!

292
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,198
It made a left.

293
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,998
I'm not going to be deceived! Or so it seems...

294
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,498
But it actually made a right!

295
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:53,498
There! Just as I thought!

296
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:56,698
It's speeding along on the road like it should be.

297
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:58,898
She's rushing to pull the rod inside.

298
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:03,498
But, no lights were on before that car made the turn, though.

299
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,398
Easy!

300
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,998
As for the tail lights, if you turn off the light, it'll turn off.

301
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,998
If you use side brakes and drift when making the turn,

302
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:13,498
even the brake lamps won't go on!

303
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:14,498
Darn!

304
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,698
Why aren't they falling for it?

305
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:19,698
I'll brush them away at the next hairpin curve!

306
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,298
Good! They can't keep up!

307
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:34,498
I'm going to make them lose us!

308
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,498
What the...

309
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,998
Too bad, super hairy witch!

310
00:16:57,998 --> 00:17:00,998
Phooey, what a bummer.

311
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:04,198
To think that there's a car that's spinning in a place like this.

312
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:06,998
No, it's just as calculated.

313
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:08,598
Right, Yamamura?

314
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:09,898
Oh, yes.

315
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,498
I've been waiting all this time

316
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,798
since I received contact from Mr. Mouri telling me to block the road.

317
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,098
Well, since I was driving slowly

318
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:20,998
about 200 meters ahead of your car, Mr. Mouri,

319
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,598
I almost fell asleep part way.

320
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,498
You framed us into this.

321
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,998
Okay, I'm all ears.

322
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:33,298
Tell me, why you did what you did?

323
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,698
What?

324
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:39,598
You wanted to clean this ridge of street racers?

325
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:41,898
Aren't you guys street racers too?

326
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:44,998
Yeah, originally,

327
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:48,898
but our friend died of an accident during a race battle.

328
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:50,598
That's when we quit.

329
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:54,398
We got annoyed at those guys who continued to race battle

330
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:57,398
as if nothing had happened at all.

331
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,298
That's why we thought up this trick to scare them,

332
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,998
hoping to get rid of them.

333
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:06,598
Taking advantage of the witch that outraced all the street racers

334
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:09,098
that were here four years ago.

335
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:12,798
Well, I guess you can call it bettering the world.

336
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:14,598
In fact, thanks to us,

337
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:17,398
the street racers coming to this ridge have decreased.

338
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:19,998
Hey, do you understand or what?

339
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,598
That there are people who are critically wounded because of you?

340
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:27,098
Yeah, we feel bad about it.

341
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,798
By the way, how did you manage to stand on the fog

342
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,398
as well as wave back?

343
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:35,398
Yeah, your grandmother said something like that,

344
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:37,198
but we have no recollection of it.

345
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:39,898
Maybe she was dreaming or seeing things?

346
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:42,298
Brocken spectre.

347
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:44,898
The light of the sun seeping in from behind

348
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:47,398
is dispersed by the cloud and fog.

349
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:49,298
A circle of light that looks like a rainbow

350
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:51,498
envelopes the silhouette of the person who is watching,

351
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,498
that is, a halo is created.

352
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:57,798
It's a phenomenon that is seen frequently at Mt. Brocken in Germany,

353
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,798
and from this queer spectacle,

354
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,598
it has also been called the fairy of Brocken.

355
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:06,498
I... I saw a special program about it on TV.

356
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:08,298
TV again...

357
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:12,198
Which means the grandma waved to her own shadow

358
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,498
and mistook it as someone waving back at her.

359
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:20,198
Well, at any rate, I'll have one of my men come get your car,

360
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,998
so will you two please get in my car and come with me to the station?

361
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:26,398
Let me go get my wallet then.

362
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:31,098
Yumi?

363
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:34,298
No, as for the witch, we just caught her now!

364
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,198
Huh? It's not here.

365
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:38,798
Hey, look over that side too.

366
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,698
That bastard!

367
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:48,398
No, you mean he fled?

368
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:50,298
Hey! Did you write down the license plate number?

369
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:51,698
Oh, no.

370
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:54,998
I was going to do that after reaching the station.

371
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:58,698
Darn! They know this ridge by heart.

372
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,498
I wonder if we can catch up with them!

373
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,498
Huh?

374
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:07,098
That car...

375
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,898
It can't be...

376
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:11,798
Hey, are we going to be all right, fleeing like this?

377
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,898
Yeah, I mean after all, that officer looked dense too.

378
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:17,898
Besides, I'm on parole right now.

379
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:20,898
If they find out that I'm involved in something like this...

380
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:24,098
Woman's scream?

381
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,798
Idiot. It's the sound of tires skidding!

382
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,198
Hey, speed up!

383
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,898
It's catching up with us!

384
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:38,398
No, the speed of the car coming from behind is ridiculous!

385
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:40,098
If I press on the gas more than I am now...

386
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,998
Darn! They're right behind!

387
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:48,698
Hold it! I know this sound!

388
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:51,598
I tried to copy it and listened to it repeatedly,

389
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,298
which after I worked on the mufflers and tires,

390
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:55,598
trying to come up with the same sound, but in vain.

391
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,198
It... it's the witch's scream!

392
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,598
Yes, this is the police station!

393
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:18,098
Pull over to the side and stop the car!

394
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:20,598
-Police? -Police?

395
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,998
Officer Sato!

396
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:55,398
What?

397
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,798
The witch that appeared four years ago was officer Sato?

398
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:00,198
Is that for real?

399
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:04,298
Yes, she was not at all aware though.

400
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:07,698
She didn't even know that her car was a FD either.

401
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:11,298
But Officer Sato's car's not white, is it?

402
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:12,998
She changed the color of her car

403
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:17,998
because some time in the past, a car hassled her at that ridge and it spun.

404
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:21,198
She thought that white is a difficult color to see in the fog.

405
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:25,198
But, did Officer Sato's car sound like that?

406
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:29,098
Yeah, it sounds like someone screaming.

407
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:31,098
That's Miwako's habit.

408
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:45,298
When I want to drift and make a curve without pulling the side brakes lever,

409
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,098
it seems to go well when I scream as I do so!

410
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:51,298
It's a bit embarrassing, though.

411
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,898
That's what she told me!

412
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:56,998
She really screamed.

413
00:23:56,998 --> 00:24:00,998
No wonder it sounds like a scream.

414
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:02,498
No doubt.

415
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,998
"Next Episode"

416
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:09,398
That's Kayo who was taken hostage!

417
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:11,598
Unless I find out whether he has a gun or not first,

418
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:13,798
it's too dangerous and my hands are tied.

419
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:21,498
Dad, Conan is in trouble!

420
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:25,098
There's still on suspect left, isn't there?

421
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:28,498
It's you, Mr. Kaneyama.

422
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:29,898
Next Conan,

423
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:33,514
"Two Days with the Culprit (1st Day)".

424
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:52,135
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,335
"Gun".

426
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:55,335
What's our next episode?

427
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:58,035
Conan is going to hang out with the culprit for two days!

428
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,081
What does that mean?
