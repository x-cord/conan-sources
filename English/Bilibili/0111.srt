1
00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:04.868
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:06.568
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:10.528
Great detective work is on today's menu!
Eat up and solve the case!

4
00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:11.908
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:13.658
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:15.998
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.621 --> 00:02:00.951
During a sudden blackout
at Ran's cooking class,

8
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:05.881
the teacher, Uemori Michi,
was stabbed in the back and killed!

9
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:13.801
String and ice had been used to
turn off the electrical room breaker.

10
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:20.901
And, after investigation,
the possibility of an outside killer vanished!

11
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:27.321
"The Cooking Classroom
Murder Case (Part 2)."

12
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:35.941
All four of you could have set up
the ice trick in the electrical room.

13
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.651
There's a refrigerator here,

14
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:41.571
and the ice could've
been brought from home.

15
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:44.681
Meaning the murder weapon is the issue.

16
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:45.411
Yes...

17
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:49.041
Yuko-san. Are there any
ice picks in this classroom?

18
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.251
Yes. In the bottom drawer,
next to the microwave oven.

19
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:04.121
Inspector. These iron
skewers have sharp tips.

20
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.061
Yuko-san. Do you keep
count of how many there are?

21
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.481
Yes. There should be ten.

22
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.351
There are only nine here.

23
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:16.821
That can't be! There were
ten when I counted last night!

24
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:19.451
Inspector! We have
our murder weapon!

25
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:23.491
The killer stole a skewer
from that drawer in advance

26
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:25.281
and used it to stab Uemori-san!

27
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:30.161
But could you really stab with this?
There's nowhere to grip it.

28
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.961
If it were me, I'd choose
something with a handle.

29
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:39.971
Plus, the mark on her back seemed
smaller than those skewers' tips.

30
00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:45.241
Inspector. We should
check their belongings.

31
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:46.141
Yeah.

32
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:50.991
Okay, everyone. Please place
all your belongings on the table.

33
00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:59.111
Everyone has aprons, pens,
handkerchiefs, and recipes...

34
00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:01.781
I don't see the skewer anywhere.

35
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.991
Oh? Only Kazue-san
has a notebook and a brush.

36
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.451
So what?! I don't
like that tone of yours!

37
00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:15.701
Yuko-san. After Kazue-san arrived,
did you leave the classroom?

38
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.921
Yes, I went to the bathroom.

39
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:21.381
I've figured it out.

40
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:24.261
You killed her, Kazue-san!

41
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:27.411
Kazue-san did?!

42
00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:28.141
You can't be serious!

43
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.991
You stole the skewer while
Yuko-san was in the bathroom!

44
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:39.611
You were able to accurately
find and stab Uemori-san in the dark

45
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:46.371
because your eyes were used to
the dark thanks to those dark glasses!

46
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:47.821
Isn't that right?!

47
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:54.031
Quit joking around!
I'm sensitive to light due to my age!

48
00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:56.041
That's why I wear these glasses!

49
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.251
Kazue-san, during class,

50
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:05.721
you left your bag at your
feet instead of in the dining room.

51
00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.201
Why?

52
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:11.031
Because it's more convenient that way!

53
00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:14.521
Yes, for taking out the skewer!

54
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.161
I don't have the skewer!

55
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:20.481
Besides, how could I stab
someone if it didn't have a handle?!

56
00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:23.441
But you could make one.

57
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.661
Using this brush of yours!

58
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:35.001
This will create a handle!

59
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.961
Oh! You're right!

60
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:43.921
And the skewer in question
is hidden in this notebook!

61
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:49.031
I-It's not there?! That's impossible!

62
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:52.181
The skewer is supposed
to be under the rings!

63
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:57.141
Hey. Is this the missing skewer?

64
00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:02.571
A splint?

65
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.491
Oh, yeah! My mother-in-law did that!

66
00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:09.531
She asked if there was
anything to use as a splint last night.

67
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.121
It would seem the murder
weapon wasn't a skewer.

68
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.501
Yeah...

69
00:06:15.871 --> 00:06:19.961
Honestly! Give me a break, will you?!

70
00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:26.321
Hello? This is Megure.

71
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:29.971
Got it.

72
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.741
That was the hospital.

73
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:38.991
Uemori-san's wound was 5 cm
deep and under 1 mm in diameter.

74
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.811
Under one millimeter?!
Then that means...

75
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:48.571
The murder weapon wasn't a skewer
or an ice pick. It was needle-like.

76
00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:50.911
Needle-like...

77
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.741
Oh! So it was you!

78
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:59.451
You used to be a nurse, as I recall.

79
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.831
A nurse would be
familiar with using syringes.

80
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:08.801
There must be some syringe needles less than
1 mm in diameter and over 5 cm in length!

81
00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:10.761
So what?!

82
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:12.701
Now I got it!

83
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:15.101
You killed her, Kaoru-san!

84
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:20.351
D-Don't be stupid! How am I the killer?!

85
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:24.411
That eye patch isn't for a sty!

86
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:27.571
It was meant to keep one
eye accustomed to the dark!

87
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:31.951
When the lights went out,
you removed that eye patch

88
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:35.031
and used your left eye to commit the crime!

89
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.911
In-law strife was
probably your motive!

90
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:42.161
Don't make these things up!

91
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.041
Then please remove your eye patch.

92
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:49.921
That should be no problem,
if you really have a sty.

93
00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:54.501
Fine.

94
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.271
Kaoru-san!
How'd you get that black eye?!

95
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:05.731
My husband hit me.

96
00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:10.191
Then you wore the
eye patch to hide that bruise?

97
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:13.451
Yes. That's right.

98
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.821
Everyone here knows,

99
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:20.621
but my mother-in-law dotes
over her son Tatsuhiko, my husband.

100
00:08:21.121 --> 00:08:24.411
She was always,
"Tatsuhiko this, Tatsuhiko that..."

101
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.591
He even hit me last night
because I talked bad about her.

102
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:31.301
Where is Tatsuhiko-san now?

103
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:35.071
He left for Hawaii on a
business trip this morning.

104
00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:39.031
I wonder how he'll react when
he finds out his mother's been killed.

105
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:40.271
I'd love to see it.

106
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:45.731
Y-You still aren't cleared of suspicion!
You can see out of that eye!

107
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:48.771
But the weapon
wasn't a syringe needle.

108
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:53.071
There was almost no blood
on Uemori-sensei's back.

109
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:58.121
Blood would've followed
the syringe needle up to the skin

110
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:01.371
after it broke through the capillaries!

111
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:06.951
Why do you insist on making me the killer?

112
00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:11.281
Just so you know, I'm not the
only one with a motive for killing her.

113
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.131
The other three
have plenty of reason, too.

114
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.341
What?!

115
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:19.721
Kaoru-san! Stop saying nonsense!

116
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.821
Is it nonsense?

117
00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:25.911
You've been friends
with her for over thirty years,

118
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:28.691
but you surely hated her husband.

119
00:09:29.741 --> 00:09:37.411
After all, she stole your lover
twenty-seven years ago and married him!

120
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.281
You've stayed single
ever since, and only came here

121
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:47.951
so you could see your old lover,
her husband and my father-in-law.

122
00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:52.951
He died last year of an illness, though.

123
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:59.081
I guess you must've really loved
him to keep coming to this class.

124
00:10:01.031 --> 00:10:04.701
Oh! So that's why she...

125
00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:08.191
He was such a nice, gentle man...

126
00:10:08.531 --> 00:10:14.901
Nishitani-kun, I hear she was going
to cut off your financial support.

127
00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:20.321
Because she found someone
with more talent than you.

128
00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:25.831
So you had to give up your dream
of having your own restaurant.

129
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:28.751
Is that true, Nishitani-kun?

130
00:10:28.751 --> 00:10:33.961
Yuko-san, you surely held a grudge
because she stole your recipes.

131
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.991
No! I didn't!

132
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:39.411
I saw it.

133
00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:42.681
I saw you crying while arguing with her.

134
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:49.641
She coldly responded with,
"If you don't like it, then surpass me."

135
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:58.321
In other words, all four of you
had reasons for killing Uemori-san.

136
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:00.621
Come to think of it...

137
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:05.241
Nishitani-san, you massaged
Uemori-sensei's shoulders.

138
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:07.251
Yes.

139
00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:11.171
Meaning you must know
about therapeutic points on the back.

140
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:15.901
I believe acupuncture needles
are less than 1 mm in diameter.

141
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:18.991
But, Mori-san.

142
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:23.411
Yuko-san and I couldn't find her in the dark,

143
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:26.601
and I've never touched an
acupuncture needle in my life.

144
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:30.451
Mori-kun, I've had
acupuncture on occasion.

145
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:32.741
Those needles would be too thin.

146
00:11:32.741 --> 00:11:37.191
They're so thin and weak that
stabbing 5 cm in would be impossible.

147
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:39.651
Too thin, huh?

148
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:41.701
Wait a minute.

149
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:45.701
Here's the blouse
you asked me to mend.

150
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:54.291
A sewing set. You're the
only one with one, correct?

151
00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:56.821
What difference does that make?

152
00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:03.121
5 cm in length.
Under 1 mm in width.

153
00:12:03.121 --> 00:12:05.221
Matches the murder weapon perfectly!

154
00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:09.431
Get real! How would you pull
it out if you stuck it all the way in?!

155
00:12:09.951 --> 00:12:11.121
Oh, right.

156
00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:12.571
Sheesh...

157
00:12:12.571 --> 00:12:16.901
Besides, people are
surprisingly tough-skinned,

158
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:20.321
and there's no way to grip a
sewing needle for stabbing anyway.

159
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:23.281
Oh... So that's out of the question?

160
00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:28.201
It's true that a sewing needle
fits the murder weapon perfectly.

161
00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:31.451
But a 5 cm stab
wound wouldn't be possible.

162
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.491
Wait! A sewing needle...

163
00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:37.881
Yeah! With that,
you could stab someone!

164
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:42.991
And, being able to find
Uemori-sensei in the dark...

165
00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:47.681
It would be easy with that,
and not immediately obvious!

166
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:51.601
So that's why that
person made that mistake...

167
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:08.911
This is the men's room window,

168
00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:11.911
so it should be around
here somewhere.

169
00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:18.291
Here it is!
Which means it contains...

170
00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:19.531
Kazue-san.

171
00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:22.411
It's possible that a sewing
needle was the murder weapon,

172
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:25.131
so we'll have to run
a test for blood on them.

173
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:29.051
Do as you like.
There's no point, though.

174
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:32.701
It's also possible to
hide a needle in your clothes,

175
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:35.271
so we'll need to conduct body searches.

176
00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:37.391
Eh?! Even that?!

177
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:38.981
We have our rights!

178
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:45.781
I found it! This is it!

179
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:49.661
So that person really is the killer!

180
00:13:58.315 --> 00:14:02.155
I know who did it.
Now for the murder weapon.

181
00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:09.155
If I were going to hide that weapon...

182
00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:17.235
Ah! Inside there!

183
00:14:17.235 --> 00:14:20.055
That's quite a clever hiding place!

184
00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:21.945
Inspector Megure.

185
00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:23.405
Oh, how'd it go?

186
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:28.025
No blood was detected
on anything in the sewing set.

187
00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:31.275
I see. Thank you.

188
00:14:32.115 --> 00:14:33.695
Inspector!

189
00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:36.945
Did the body search
turn up anything, Takagi-kun?

190
00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:39.445
Nishitani-san
doesn't have a needle on him.

191
00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.785
And the women?

192
00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:42.745
Nothing turned up.

193
00:14:44.025 --> 00:14:45.585
Inspector.

194
00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:49.545
Could you let Yuko-san and me go?

195
00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:56.765
As I mentioned before, neither
of us could've found her in the dark.

196
00:14:58.115 --> 00:14:59.225
That's true...

197
00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:06.275
Inspector, you must
not let those two go yet.

198
00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:10.145
Huh? Why not, Mori-kun?

199
00:15:10.525 --> 00:15:13.115
Because I know who the killer is.

200
00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:14.665
Say what?!

201
00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:16.235
You do, Dad?!

202
00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:18.245
W-Who's the killer?!

203
00:15:19.115 --> 00:15:22.985
The one who murdered Uemori Michi-san...

204
00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:25.205
...was you, Nishitani-san!

205
00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:29.415
What?!

206
00:15:32.815 --> 00:15:36.945
Mori-san, weren't you listening just now?

207
00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:38.385
Yuko-san and I couldn't have--

208
00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:42.345
There was a way to find
Uemori-san, even in the darkness.

209
00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:46.065
By wearing special
contact lenses in advance.

210
00:15:47.775 --> 00:15:49.235
Contact lenses?

211
00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:56.155
Yes. He wore black,
sunglass-like contact lenses.

212
00:15:56.615 --> 00:16:00.615
When he first entered the classroom,
he didn't have them in.

213
00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:05.115
Nor when he snuck through
the back entrance before then.

214
00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:08.335
This is because they
would've been inconvenient

215
00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:11.195
when setting up the ice
trick in the electrical room.

216
00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:16.655
He put the contacts in about
ten minutes before class began,

217
00:16:16.655 --> 00:16:18.465
in the bathroom.

218
00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:20.675
Eh?! Then that's why he--?

219
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:24.555
Yes. That's why when
he ran into you in the hallway...

220
00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:29.185
Ran-san! Sorry!
My mistake! You look alike!

221
00:16:29.775 --> 00:16:33.315
The hallway here is rather dark,

222
00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:36.365
so he couldn't differentiate
between you and Yuko-san.

223
00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:40.825
But he wasn't clumsier than usual!

224
00:16:41.155 --> 00:16:47.785
That's because he's skilled
and the classroom was quite bright.

225
00:16:47.785 --> 00:16:52.505
But do such convenient
contact lenses actually exist?

226
00:16:52.505 --> 00:16:54.615
No, not normally.

227
00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:58.115
In Japan, contact lenses
are pharmaceutical products,

228
00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:03.525
so there's a specific standard for visible light transmission,
Visible Light Transmission

229
00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:09.315
so contact lenses as dark
as sunglasses can't be sold.

230
00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:12.525
The color contacts that were
recently put on the market

231
00:17:12.525 --> 00:17:18.065
only have color around the lens;
the middle is still transparent.

232
00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:22.115
But lenses with color in any
location can be specially ordered

233
00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:25.315
for use in things like
TV dramas and commercials.

234
00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:28.915
So they're not
absolutely impossible to obtain.

235
00:17:29.525 --> 00:17:33.875
In any event, Nishitani-san let his
eyes grow accustomed to the dark,

236
00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:38.775
and the instant the lights went
out, he quickly removed the contacts,

237
00:17:38.775 --> 00:17:42.235
opened the sliding door,
approached Uemori-san,

238
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:44.695
and stabbed her in the back!

239
00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.855
Mori-kun! What was the murder weapon?!

240
00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:53.315
I believe the weapon was
indeed a sewing needle.

241
00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:54.945
A sewing needle?

242
00:17:54.945 --> 00:17:59.695
But you said yourself it wouldn't
be easy to stab 5 cm with one,

243
00:17:59.695 --> 00:18:01.735
and it might get stuck
if you're not careful!

244
00:18:02.235 --> 00:18:05.955
A thimble and some
thread solve those problems.

245
00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:08.485
A thimble and thread?

246
00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:14.875
A thimble? You mean the ring
that's used when doing needlework?

247
00:18:15.235 --> 00:18:19.835
That's right. Have a look at
Nishitani-san's right index finger.

248
00:18:24.525 --> 00:18:27.175
He used the ring as a thimble?!

249
00:18:27.445 --> 00:18:31.615
Yes. He put a thread
through the needle, and...

250
00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:42.315
But I believe he burned the thread
using his stove to be rid of it.

251
00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:44.905
Hold on! That means the evidence is--!

252
00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:47.485
Fear not, Inspector.

253
00:18:47.485 --> 00:18:48.285
Conan!

254
00:18:49.735 --> 00:18:51.995
I found this behind the bathrooms!

255
00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:55.815
A contact lens case?

256
00:18:55.815 --> 00:18:56.945
Yeah!

257
00:18:56.945 --> 00:19:01.755
Nishitani-san threw it out the
bathroom window after putting 'em in!

258
00:19:01.755 --> 00:19:08.225
And I found this
one inside his cooking bowl!

259
00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:10.655
A contact lens...

260
00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:11.665
Takagi-kun!

261
00:19:11.665 --> 00:19:12.475
Right!

262
00:19:19.445 --> 00:19:22.485
Inspector! I found the other lens!

263
00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:26.235
Nishitani-san. Think you
can you explain this for us?

264
00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:31.735
Is something wrong with
wearing sunglass-like contacts?

265
00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:36.335
You should find the weapon
before accusing someone of murder!

266
00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:40.335
But the weapon is in your belongings.

267
00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:45.425
Inside your ballpoint pen.

268
00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:54.055
Here it is!

269
00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:58.025
Nishitani-san! Are you
still going to make excuses?

270
00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:01.905
I thought it was
a great hiding place, too...

271
00:20:02.945 --> 00:20:06.485
I lose, Mori-san.
You truly are a great detective.

272
00:20:07.195 --> 00:20:12.815
I got the contacts when I went
to Europe last month for training.

273
00:20:12.815 --> 00:20:15.105
I paid someone at a
manufacturer to make them.

274
00:20:16.195 --> 00:20:18.775
I figured Japanese
contacts could've been traced.

275
00:20:18.775 --> 00:20:20.365
And your motive?

276
00:20:20.365 --> 00:20:24.425
Was it because she was cutting
off your financial support?

277
00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:30.265
There's that, but I felt bad that
Yuko-san's recipes were being stolen.

278
00:20:31.615 --> 00:20:38.855
So I wanted to enact my plan the
night before her best-seller party.

279
00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:46.365
Yuko-san. You might not have
realized it, but I've always...

280
00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:48.865
I knew how you felt.

281
00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:54.775
But I never wanted you to do this.

282
00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:57.775
My goal was to improve myself

283
00:20:57.775 --> 00:21:03.625
and create perfect recipes
that she couldn't help with...

284
00:21:05.695 --> 00:21:11.775
Nishitani-san. Your actions
weren't based on love.

285
00:21:11.775 --> 00:21:17.685
They were nothing but criminal
actions resulting from selfishness!

286
00:23:04.715 --> 00:23:07.675
A different cooking classroom?

287
00:23:07.675 --> 00:23:09.075
Yeah!

288
00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:11.745
After what happened to
Uemori-sensei,

289
00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:14.495
Sonoko decided to go to
a different cooking classroom.

290
00:23:14.495 --> 00:23:16.855
She asked if I wanted to go, too!

291
00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:18.815
French cooking again?

292
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:20.495
Yeah, that's right!

293
00:23:20.495 --> 00:23:26.275
So, can I enroll, Dad? It costs
the same as Uemori-sensei's place!

294
00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:28.995
The same? How much is that?

295
00:23:28.995 --> 00:23:30.745
10,000 yen for one class a month.

296
00:23:31.165 --> 00:23:33.205
10,000 yen for one class?!

297
00:23:39.915 --> 00:23:44.795
These sardines are great!
Japanese people love Japanese food!

298
00:23:45.165 --> 00:23:48.955
I guess you should forget
about the cooking classroom...

299
00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:50.635
It seems so.

300
00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:52.425
Yes, yes!

301
00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:55.545
A bone!

302
00:23:57.075 --> 00:24:00.705
I guess I won't be eating any
of Ran's French cooking for awhile.

303
00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:06.115
The anatomy model?

304
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:13.085
I saw it running super-fast
through the hallway four nights ago!

305
00:24:13.375 --> 00:24:16.375
Look! That white fog on the glass!

306
00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:20.845
It's proof that someone was pressed
against the window, looking out!

307
00:24:24.295 --> 00:24:25.225
Blood!

308
00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:30.005
On the next Conan--

309
00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:33.145
"The Seven Mysteries of Teitan Elementary."
