1
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,550
At around nine fifty tonight,

2
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,890
the National Tokyo Institute of Microbiology in Nishitama

3
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,150
was attacked by an armed group.

4
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,210
After the criminals killed two security guards,

5
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,880
they held a researcher captive

6
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,570
and infiltrated the high-security laboratory.

7
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,380
A few minutes later,
they set off the plastic explosives they planted in the building

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,320
and escaped.

9
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,620
The laboratory which was blown up,
contained a very dangerous bacteria.

10
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,540
Our speculation is that the bacteria
might have been stolen by the criminal group.

11
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,830
A dangerous bacteria?

12
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,550
It is a deadly bacteria which has a mortality rate of 80%.

13
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,170
To date, no cure or treatment is known.

14
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,340
Could the explosion cause the bacteria
to spread to the surrounding areas?

15
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,000
That's impossible.

16
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,560
The blast was rather powerful,

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,710
so any remaining bacteria would have been incinerated.

18
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,730
This has already been confirmed by head of the institute.

19
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,190
What's the aim of the criminals?

20
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,820
We don't know that yet.

21
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,020
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that
they might use it to to make biological weapons.

22
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,650
Therefore we would like your help.

23
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,260
In order to avoid causing unnecessary panic,

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,320
please only report this as a bombing incident

25
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,180
and keep information regarding the 'bacteria'

26
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,830
and 'biological weapon' confidential.

27
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,250
You mean you want us to suppress the information?

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,350
Hi, hello.

29
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,740
Minister!

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,200
The criminal group has posted their manifesto on the internet.

31
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,830
Also, this criminal group...

32
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,560
They call themselves the 'Akai Shamu Neko'.

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,900
"We, Akai Shamu Neko,
attacked the National Tokyo Institute of Microbiology

34
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,170
and obtained the deadly bacteria.

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,330
We'll make another move in seven days.

36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,580
Please wait and see."

37
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,710
It appears they have indeed taken the bacteria.

38
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,170
But wasn't Akai Shamu Neko disbanded ten years ago?

39
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,300
Minister! There's no need for a news blackout now, right?

40
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,800
I guess so.

41
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,550
Great.

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,150
Today we have with us Chiaki Ota who's a bacteriologist.

43
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,780
Once infected by the bacteria,
the initial symptoms would manifest as itchy rashes.

44
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,340
This is something serious.

45
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,500
A few days later, the infected individuals will die of organ failure.

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,570
This event has been broadcasting since this morning.

47
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,480
A few days later, the infected individuals will die of organ failure.

48
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,390
Transmission is primarily through droplets.
Children are especially susceptible

49
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,860
and often exhibit symptoms rapidly.

50
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,380
After hearing what she said,

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,560
what would you do, little boy Conan?

52
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,410
Shut up.

53
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,880
By the way, Hattori.

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
What I feel strange is that...

55
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,690
Why did the criminals blow up the lab?

56
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,580
If they were only going to steal the bacteria,
they didn't need to bomb the lab.

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,770
True.

58
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,760
By the way, do you know anything
about the organization 'Akai Shamu Neko'?

59
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,320
Not really.

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,450
I only know that they were a terrorist group
that used to steal money from big companies decades ago.

61
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,710
Yeah, we were both kids at that time.

62
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,360
Ah, sorry...

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
I forgot that you're still a kid now.

64
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,540
You are so annoying.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,090
Speaking of which, Kudo,

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,870
you said that you were going on an airship, right?

67
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,820
The one which flies from Tokyo to Osaka.

68
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,550
Yeah.

69
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,930
That old man hasn't learn his lesson

70
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,560
and has issued another challenge to Kaitou Kid again.

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,460
I heard that Kid had already accepted the challenge.

72
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,860
I guess that old man must be...

73
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,350
Damn those despicable Akai Shamu Neko!

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,380
Taking the front page news
and replacing the news about the world's best airship

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,060
which I poured my heart and soul into!

76
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,060
Thanks to you, my notice of challenge to my nemesis Kaito Kid

77
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,320
was also completely ignored!

78
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,410
In that case, Kudo,

79
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,470
you can live at my house.

80
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,260
I'll bring you to that Okonomiyaki place I promised.

81
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,880
Yeah, sure.

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,800
Bye.

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,570
(Detective Conan The Lost Ship in the Sky)

84
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,300
I am Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

85
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,190
When I was at an amusement park with Ran, my childhood sweetheart,

86
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,910
I witnessed a man in black in the process of doing a suspicious deal.

87
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,360
As I was paying attention only to what's happening,

88
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,420
I failed to notice that his partner had come up behind me.

89
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,570
I was forced to take poison.

90
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,580
When I woke up again,

91
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,220
my body had shrunk.

92
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,660
If the people in black knew that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

93
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,120
it would not only pose a threat to my life

94
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,150
but those around me would also be at risk.

95
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,420
Listening to Professor Asaga's advice,
I decided to hide my true identity.

96
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,050
When Ran asked for my name,

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,130
the name Conan Edogawa suddenly hit me.

98
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,200
In order to get more information about the people
in that organization, I moved into Ran's house.

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,290
He's Jirokichi Suzuki, 72 years old.

100
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,660
Sorry.

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,550
Thanks a lot.

102
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,320
He's the uncle of Ran's friend, Sonoko Suzuki,

103
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,360
and also a concultant at Suzuki Financial Group.

104
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,800
This old man obtained all the medals he wanted to have

105
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,130
and achieved all of his dreams

106
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,500
but is now obsessed with battling Kid.

107
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,040
However, my focus right now

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,960
are the terrorists who blew up the lab and stole the deadly bacteria.

109
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,400
What's their purpose?

110
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,210
Though my body has shrunk, my intelligence is above average.

111
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,540
I am the famous detective who can solve all the cases.

112
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,280
Only one truth will prevail!

113
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,450
It's the tropical park!

114
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,950
The castle looks so small!

115
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,670
This is like the theme park in Lilliput.

116
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,600
What a beautiful view.

117
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,210
Dad, the scenery is great!

118
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,090
Why not come over and take a look?

119
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,820
Leave me alone! I'm thinking about some things!

120
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,010
Seriously.

121
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,020
Come to think of it, Mr. Mouri is afraid of heights, right?

122
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,260
I am not!

123
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,790
Does Kid always enjoy views like this?

124
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm so jealous of him!

125
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,960
But, are you sure Kid will come?

126
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,260
Of course he will.

127
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,870
Uncle Jirokichi already got a reply from him.

128
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,600
Look here.

129
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,440
He no go de o kesimasu.

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,470
I say, you can only read hiragana?

131
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,540
I can't believe this.

132
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,900
Listen up.

133
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,210
I gladly accept your offer to board your airship.

134
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,310
However, I can't bear watching a 72-year-old man

135
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,200
feeling restless in the next 6 hours.

136
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,950
So, in the evening when the airship enters Osaka,

137
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,230
I'll come to steal the tressure.

138
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,220
Before that, please enjoy your flight.

139
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Kaitou Kid.

140
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,190
Will you take me away too, Kid-sama!

141
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,600
I always found her personality to be quite unique.

142
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:14,910
I know.

143
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,030
By the way, are we the only passengers on board?

144
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,980
I remember there's a reporter called Fujioka.

145
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,060
That's him!

146
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,470
He wanted to write about the battle between Uncle Jirokichi and Kid,

147
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,540
so he offered us his services.

148
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,860
As for the others...

149
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,170
Well, excuse me.

150
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,890
You must be Mr. Mouri.

151
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,680
Nice to meet you.

152
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,740
I am Masaki Mizukawa from Nichiuri TV.

153
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,060
This is Kasumi Nishitani,
our reporter and Ishimoto Junpei, the cameraman.

154
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,980
It's an honor to meet you.

155
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,520
Hi, hello.

156
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,140
This time, our station has been granted an exclusive broadcast

157
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,190
of the battle between Consultant Suzuki and Kid.

158
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,180
If I'm not mistaken, there is a special program on TV this evening.

159
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:02,920
That's right.

160
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,590
I have planned to ask everyone in the station to work on this

161
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,210
like they did when Kid performed his mid-air walk.

162
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,420
Little did I know that that accident would happen.

163
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,240
That accident?

164
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,040
You mean Akai Shamu Neko.

165
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,660
Yes, they claimed that they would make a move in seven days.

166
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,630
Now everyone in the station is on high alert.

167
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,630
That's right.

168
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,350
According to their manifesto,, today is the last day.

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,250
Thanks to them,

170
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,430
I couldn't get a permit for the helicopter
I wanted to use for my autobiography movie.

171
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,040
Those terrorists are a complete nuisance.

172
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,140
Right, Lupin?

173
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,300
Uncle Jirokichi.

174
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,250
Greetings, Consultant Suzuki.

175
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,650
I'm looking forward to working with you today.

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,190
Speaking of which, this airship is so luxurious!

177
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,230
And only the three of you are going to do the broadcasting

178
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,140
on such a luxurious airship?

179
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,750
Ah... I'm sorry.

180
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,410
Because of that incident, we are short-staffed right now.

181
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,670
Now that you've mentioned it,
what do those criminals want the bacteria for?

182
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,390
That's right. I heard you can't be saved once you're infected.

183
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,920
I also heard that it spreads through droplets.

184
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,580
That's so scary!

185
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,340
So the bacteria will spread through cold air?

186
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,380
He said through the droplets in the air.

187
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,190
It means that droplets from coughing or sneezing
will get healthy people infected.

188
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,140
Also, it was said that children are easily infected. So Be careful.

189
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,590
Don't worry.

190
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,160
There's no need to worry about the deadly bacteria.

191
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,580
I used to do interviews at a places full of bacteria.

192
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,680
Look at how healthy I am now.

193
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,780
Humans are stronger than bacteria.

194
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,870
You're right!

195
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,820
Then again, little kids like you
might just die instantly if you are infected.

196
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,090
Please don't scare the kids by saying things like that.

197
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,200
That's right. How could you say that?

198
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,420
It's fine.

199
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,700
Don't worry, even if the bacteria is everywhere in Japan

200
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,630
we are perfectly safe on this airship. Rest assured!

201
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,020
That's only when we are on this flight.

202
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,160
Hey, shouldn't we be preparing afternoon tea?

203
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,730
But before that I'd like to have a smoke. I'll be right back.

204
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,010
Are we still not able to identify those terrorists?

205
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,120
Even the key members of the Akai Shamu Neko
who are in jail said they know nothing about this.

206
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,050
The only clue we have now is this ampoule.

207
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,620
We didn't find any manufacturers abroad or at home
producing this kind of product.

208
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,550
It is very likely Akai Shamu Neko made it themselves.

209
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,150
The ampoule was left
in the parking lot outside the lab, which means...

210
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,810
they probably brought a lot of empty ampules into the lab.

211
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,130
Then they put the bacteria in the ampoule and left.

212
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,410
So, was this ampoule dropped by accident?

213
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,060
Yes.

214
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,540
It's very hard and dangerous to put the bacteria into these ampoule.

215
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,240
We think the terrorists are knowledgable in the field of science.

216
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,350
But why did they perform such a dangerous task

217
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,470
instead of keeping the bacteria in its original bottles?

218
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,810
Also, why did they resurface after ten years of silence?

219
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,220
What's their purpose?

220
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,150
There are windows here too!

221
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,700
Those kids look very happy.

222
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,070
The fact that they could get on an airship at such a young age

223
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,660
is all thanks to Sonoko.

224
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,620
They must feel like they are walking on air now.

225
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,050
Nothing, I just remembered something from my childhood.

226
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,270
The first time Ran saw an airship...

227
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,730
Shinichi, this is bad...

228
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,420
I saw an UFO. There's an UFO in the sky.

229
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,720
UFO?

230
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:45,540
There!

231
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,750
She saw a balloon-like monster flying in the sky

232
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,900
and probably thought it was an UFO because she was scared.

233
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,360
Wow, bragging about your innocent and naive princess again?

234
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,570
I'm not bragging...

235
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,170
Anyway, it did show her feminine side.

236
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,390
I also hope that this magical ship could fly me

237
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,580
to my dreamland above the cloud.

238
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,050
I'm just joking.

239
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,660
I figured.

240
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,920
Everyone!

241
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,290
Uncle Jirokichi invited everyone to the observation deck.

242
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,350
We can also see the large gem!

243
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,830
That's great!

244
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,990
The treasure...

245
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,290
All right, do you guys want to see the treasure?

246
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes!

247
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,700
Then let's go!

248
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,880
Let's go there too.

249
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,730
Let's hope that she wouldn't be taken to her dreamland
by some Peter Pan.

250
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,020
You should keep your eyes on her.

251
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,920
What are you talking about?

252
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:52,740
Professor.

253
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,810
You have to keep the UFO story

254
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,220
a secret from Ran.

255
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,380
I know.

256
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,880
Is everyone here?

257
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,930
Yeah!

258
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:16,090
In that case, allow me, Asano Mitsuhiro,
chief steward of this ship, to bring you to the observation deck.

259
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,900
Awesome!

260
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,360
There are glass window on all sides!

261
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,670
We can see the internal structure of the ship!

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
Let's go.

263
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,110
This is so exciting!

264
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,970
Don't be freaked out.

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,980
This is Bell Tree the 1st.

266
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,600
It is 246 meters in length with a maximum diameter of 42.2 meters.

267
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,190
The ship is one meter longer than the Germany Hindenburg

268
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,540
in length and diameter,

269
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,770
which makes it the largest ship in the world.

270
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,990
Shoot, why is it glass on all sides?

271
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,040
It is equipped with the latest computerized control unit.

272
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,290
Hey, there are things that look like balloons moving up there.

273
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,960
They are called airbags which has helium inside.

274
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,370
They look like a whale's lungs.

275
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,660
It's true! They look like they are alive!

276
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,770
It's like we are going up in the whale's belly.

277
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,570
It's so bright!

278
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,200
We can see the sky!

279
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,020
The jewel!

280
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,590
This is the place which Consultant Suzuki is the most proud of...

281
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,890
The observation deck.

282
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,680
Part of the roof could be opened.

283
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,880
You can have a sun bath, stargaze,

284
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,300
and do all kinds of fun activities here.

285
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,790
However, in order to catch that guy, I've set up some traps.

286
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,790
Let us see the jewel.

287
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,530
It's not for you kids to see!

288
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,900
What's the big deal?

289
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,940
The answer is no.

290
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,030
Hey, you!

291
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm talking about you.

292
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,760
Inspector Nakamori?

293
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,750
Mr. Mouri, you are here.

294
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,960
Let me introduce it for you.

295
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,200
Wait.

296
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,110
This is the thing I'm using to lure Kid today.

297
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,910
The big jewel -- Lady Sky.

298
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,140
It's so beautiful!

299
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,580
The blue color looks fantastic.

300
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,380
The gem is sparkling with golden light!

301
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,870
Just like the stars!

302
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,810
Don't you find the largest golden grain

303
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,850
looking like something?

304
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,410
The biggest one?

305
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,710
It's like a woman's face!

306
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,850
That's right! That's the reasoning behind the name "Lady Sky".

307
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,330
Plinius, the ancient Roman archeologist

308
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,630
described this gem as a fragment of the starry skies.

309
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,500
It is the perfect item to be displayed on the observation deck.

310
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,480
Why did you place such a precious gem in a normal glass case?

311
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,760
Inspector, can't you see that the glass
could deflect bullets even from a machine gun?

312
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,770
Also, It could only be opened
when the fingerprint and the password are both correct.

313
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,210
Don't you think this system is full proof?

314
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,980
That is totally useless.

315
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,800
The laboratory which was attacked had the same glass case.

316
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,340
What would happen if I press this?

317
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,540
Try it and you'll know.

318
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,060
Let's see what would happen if I do this.

319
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,210
Dad!

320
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,240
They don't have that in their system, do they?

321
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,260
They don't.

322
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,370
How dare you do this to me, you brat!

323
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,920
Dad...

324
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,710
I see, there's a sensor.

325
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,700
By the way, that's too sensitive.

326
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,960
It's true that they didn't have traps like these.

327
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,450
But what if that guy did this?

328
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,160
If there's a gun at your head, you would have no choice
but to open it with your fingerprint, right?

329
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,720
I don't think that guy would do something like that.

330
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,000
But if that really happens.

331
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,840
Inspector Nakamori!

332
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,650
In that case, I'll simply do that.

333
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,000
Did he fall into the sea?

334
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,580
That certainly won't happen.

335
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,800
Damn you! What kind of trap is this?

336
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,360
Do you still think it's just a normal glass case?

337
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,220
If I remember...

338
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,390
I see. So that's what it is.

339
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,000
Anyway, that guy won't show up until the evening.

340
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,030
You don't need to keep a close eye on this place before that, right?

341
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,750
We'll make another plan. Let's go!

342
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,460
Yes!

343
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,610
Wow, you've shown me something really interesting.

344
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,420
Thanks to you, I could probably write a great report.

345
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,850
I'm sorry. Please go to the smoking room on B floor to smoke.

346
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,900
Mr. Mouri, do you want to join me?

347
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,690
No, I'll go back to my room to take a break.

348
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,600
My head is spinning right now.

349
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,420
I guess so.

350
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,510
I feel much better now.

351
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,250
Your father has really been through a lot today.

352
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,750
By the way, that band-aid doesn't look too bad, right?

353
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,340
That band-aid.

354
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,870
You haven't checked it?

355
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,160
What did you do to the band-aid?

356
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,580
Wait, what is it?

357
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,300
Do you like it?

358
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,070
Come on, what are you doing?

359
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,080
This is bad.

360
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,570
When I got on the ship, I gave a band-aid to one of the staff!

361
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,480
Hurry up guys!

362
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,960
It's dangerous to run too fast, Little Miss.

363
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,050
Thank you.

364
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,500
Thanks a lot.

365
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,450
You are welcome.

366
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:39,620
You're bleeding.

367
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,480
Your elbow is bleeding.

368
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,910
Perhaps I grazed my elbow just now...

369
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,230
Wait a moment.

370
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,180
Please use this.

371
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,710
Thank you.

372
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,440
What should I do? If he thinks that I wrote that...

373
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,830
He wouldn't notice.

374
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,450
The words are so tiny.

375
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,360
Come on...

376
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,350
I want to see that gem again.

377
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,520
There were too many people just now. I couldn't look closely at it.

378
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,190
Well then.

379
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,660
I'll go back to my room then.

380
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,620
I promised Makoto that I would text him,
but I won't tell him that Kid's coming.

381
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,980
See you later.

382
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,870
Who's that?

383
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,750
Hello.

384
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,850
Hi, well...

385
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm the waiter of this airship.

386
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,940
I' came to have a look at this famous gem during my break.

387
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,230
Shoot.

388
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,460
I should go back to work now.

389
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,150
Enjoy your time here.

390
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,550
Okay.

391
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
Wait!

392
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,350
What's wrong?

393
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,150
The band-aid...

394
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,250
I burnt my arm just now...

395
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,050
That's a lie.

396
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,860
I'm not lying.

397
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,160
Then please look at this band-aid closely.

398
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,720
Crap...

399
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,680
Why would you have the band-aid which I gave to someone else?

400
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,880
You are Kid, right?!

401
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,270
She got me.

402
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,540
Tell me the truth!

403
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,920
Shoot, I can't continue my disguise as a waiter anymore...

404
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,030
Also, if I put up a struggle...

405
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,890
What's so funny?

406
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,320
Hurry up and confess!

407
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,070
What do you plan to do if I tell you the truth?

408
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,880
Tell Inspector Nakamori and turn me in?

409
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,230
That sounds like a good solution.

410
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,390
But, I'm afraid that'll be troublesome for you.

411
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,570
You still don't know who I am?

412
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,400
That's right. The real identity of Kaitou Kid

413
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,570
is me.

414
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,660
Are you all right, Conan?

415
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,760
Did you catch a cold?

416
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,620
No I didn't.

417
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,310
What's the matter?

418
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,800
Have you forgotten my face since it's been so long?

419
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,890
You said you are Shinichi?

420
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,260
You've gotta to be kidding me.

421
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,230
You are good at disguise after all...

422
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,290
It's not a disguise...

423
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,910
Of course not! This is my face.

424
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,960
Wait, at the time when I made the emergency landing,

425
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,090
that "Shinichi" was also pinched by the officer
and he didn't expose himself either.

426
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,680
Perhaps you two look very much alike?

427
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,770
Damn it, I'm still a bit worried.

428
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,090
That guy always investigate the surroundings before he steals.

429
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,190
- Inspector Nakamori!
- If we leave the jewel alone...

430
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,840
It's too bad you're on this airship where there's no way out.

431
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,700
Accept your fate!

432
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,950
This is not an airship.

433
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,930
It's a UFO.

434
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,850
I remember you said that when you were a child.

435
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,610
I know to you, I'm just a mysterious alien

436
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,440
that showed up on this UFO abruptly.

437
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,690
But I have to pretend to be Kid in order to solve cases.

438
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,180
The proof is that I always return the gems I stole to their owners.

439
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,300
But...

440
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,720
Because...

441
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,480
As the great detective Shinichi Kudo, how could I let Kid go.

442
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,380
And here I thought you would understand.

443
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,120
Anyway, since it's you who caught me,

444
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,750
I have to accept this.

445
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,680
Shinichi...?

446
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,560
What's wrong? What happened?

447
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,850
Nothing

448
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,700
Did you notice anything strange?

449
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,220
No nothing.

450
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
I was mistaken. Sorry!

451
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,050
See you!

452
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,960
What is happening?

453
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,350
Shinichi is Kid.

454
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,410
So when he said he was busy with cases,
he was actually stealing things?

455
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,740
Can you hand me the glass?

456
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,310
What happened to your arm?

457
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,280
I think a mosquito bit me. It's so itchy.

458
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,010
Seriously. I didn't realize there were mosquitos at a place like this.

459
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:01,780
Here.

460
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,310
Thank you.

461
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:11,940
Bye.

462
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,110
I still don't believe you.

463
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,840
Well, if you'll excuse me.

464
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,150
Time...

465
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,790
Mr. Fujioka?

466
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,010
My bad, my bad.

467
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,880
The karate champion really has strong arm muscles.

468
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,440
Guys look! It's an airship!

469
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,970
It's so big!

470
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,340
It's like a whale!

471
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,430
A whale which could fly.

472
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,340
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

473
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,930
Fantastic!

474
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,050
Sis, another glass please!

475
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,690
Looks like Uncle Mouri has totally recovered.

476
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,630
He even called the waitress 'Sis'.

477
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,200
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

478
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,180
Here is your dessert.

479
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,820
Thank you...

480
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,590
I've been waiting for this. Looks yummy.

481
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,360
What's in the cream?

482
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,700
Isn't that blackberry?

483
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,170
Ran.

484
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,500
Ran!

485
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,940
Why are you staring at him with such a serious look?

486
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,320
Is he your type?

487
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,070
It's nothing like that.

488
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,440
I'm telling your hubby.

489
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,900
I said it's nothing like that.

490
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,630
Like I said,

491
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,620
if we open this door, we could get into the central passage.

492
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,050
And after that, if we go out through the front door...

493
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,270
It'll work, right?

494
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,440
Yes.

495
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,350
Where are you guys going?

496
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:57,010
No... we are planning to play cards in our room.

497
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,230
Looks like they are planning something again.

498
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,250
I can't wait anymore.

499
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,540
I wish we could arrive at Osaka as soon as possible
and meet my dear Kid-sama.

500
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,890
Then, after that...

501
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,400
I can kiss those elusive lips of his...

502
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,980
No, definitely not!

503
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,390
Kid is a criminal. That's not the right thing to do.

504
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,650
Why are you so worked-up?

505
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,060
I'm not.

506
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:33,810
What's wrong?

507
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,030
Nothing.

508
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,560
You guys should eat quickly!

509
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,380
Yes!

510
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,020
Inspector Nakamori, slow down.

511
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,180
My guys are guarding the jewel now.

512
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,510
But, maybe Kid has already...

513
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,920
Thanks for the meal!

514
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,380
We'll be playing cards in our room!

515
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,770
We'll be going!

516
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,840
Why are they in such a hurry?

517
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,900
Thanks.

518
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,610
I'm sorry.

519
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,430
Come on, be careful.

520
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,180
You have to cover your mouth when sneezing.

521
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,930
Didn't your mom tell you that?

522
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,300
Sorry.

523
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,150
It's fine.

524
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,530
Let's go!

525
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,170
(Unknown number)

526
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,310
Who could this be?

527
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,470
Hello?

528
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,650
We've released the deadly bacteria in the smoking room.

529
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,510
What?

530
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,100
Are you kidding me?

531
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,450
Check what's under the couch on your left.

532
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,130
Wait a minute!

533
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
What's wrong, uncle?

534
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,370
Nothing. Just a prank call.

535
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,310
Inspector.

536
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,340
This is...

537
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,090
It has to be that.

538
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,600
This is the same ampoule which the people who attacked the lab used.

539
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,660
The information about the ampoule hasn't been made public yet.

540
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,980
Which means...

541
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,470
The man on the phone is probably telling the truth.

542
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:27,840
My guess is that

543
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,000
they left an empty bottle in the parking lot on purpose

544
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,440
in order to trick us into believing that
the ampoule in the smoking room has bacteria inside.

545
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,550
Shoot!

546
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,860
Anyway, I'll report this to my superiors.

547
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,840
You do that.

548
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,190
It seems that the man was telling the truth.

549
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,670
How could that happen?

550
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,110
I don't have time to catch Kid then.

551
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,690
Seal the smoking room immediately!

552
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,000
Also, keep everyone out of the bar too.

553
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,870
Yes!

554
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,820
How could this happen?

555
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,510
Are you sure?

556
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,060
So it wasn't a prank?

557
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,980
No, unfortunately it's not.

558
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,890
We just confirmed it with the head office.

559
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,190
Anyway, like what I just said,

560
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,500
the smoking room on the B floor has been sealed off.

561
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,110
Help...

562
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,700
Rashes?

563
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,190
Is he infected?

564
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,890
Come to think of it, that man has been to the smoking room just now.

565
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,710
Help me... please!

566
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,430
I feel terrible!

567
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,160
Calm down! Please calm down!

568
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,800
I don't wanna die!

569
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,820
Sorry.

570
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:01,770
It's fine.

571
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,030
Ran, you need to disinfect your hands right away.

572
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,030
This way. We have rubbing alcohol in the pantry.

573
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,650
Okay.

574
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,160
I can't believe someone on this ship was infected.

575
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,890
Has anyone else been to the smoking room?

576
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,740
Hey, are you all right?

577
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,430
She has rashes on her right hand and left arm!

578
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,410
Shoot, she's infected too?

579
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,500
Can we find a place to quarantine them?

580
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,710
There's a ward in the treatment room.

581
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,380
We don't have any doctors onboard,
but that place is separated from the main cabin.

582
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,980
Fine, take them there.

583
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,780
I'll lead the way.

584
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,350
Okay.

585
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
We better lock this restaurant too, just to be safe.

586
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,720
Everyone please go to the hall.

587
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,250
Dad, get up.

588
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,080
Speaking of which, those children are lucky not to be here.

589
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:06,880
Yeah.

590
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,490
That's right, we have to inform the kids about this too.

591
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,740
That's right.

592
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,690
Sorry.

593
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,280
Oh no.

594
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,080
This is so interesting.

595
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,030
I know.

596
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,590
Let's head to the tail of this whale.

597
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,370
Genta, whales don't have tails. It's called a tail fin.

598
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,890
I see.

599
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,670
Genta!

600
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,060
Conan.

601
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,730
Well... we know we are not allowed here.

602
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,470
Genta, how are you feeling now?

603
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,740
He doesn't have rashes. Perhaphs he didn't get infected?

604
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,140
Or is it still in the incubation period?

605
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,660
Conan?

606
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,470
What's wrong?

607
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,210
Hey, let's explore the airship together.

608
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,630
This is not the time for that. Something serious just happened.

609
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,390
What happened?

610
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,590
Anyway, lets get back to the cabin first.

611
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,490
Get down!

612
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,240
You guys stay here.

613
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,180
Who is that?

614
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,370
What is he doing there at a moment like this?

615
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,990
That sounded like a lock opening.

616
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,030
Did he put the bacteria...

617
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,980
Who is that?

618
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,910
Kid's partner?

619
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,590
Seriously.

620
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,520
No, that's not Kid's partner.

621
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,620
That person is probably a member of Akai Shamu Neko...

622
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:57,980
Oh no.

623
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,340
This is bad!

624
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,310
Shoot!

625
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,990
Is that... a bomb?

626
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,020
Get inside.

627
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,550
Climb up the ladder by the pillar.

628
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,880
Hurry up!

629
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,410
Freeze!

630
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,110
Who are you?

631
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,100
Did you find the ampoule?

632
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,670
Akai Shamu Neko.

633
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,050
We already planted bombs on this ship.

634
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,300
Behave yourself, or we'll blow this place up.

635
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,720
Lupin, quiet!

636
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,030
Didn't I tell you to behave yourselves?

637
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,130
How's everything going?

638
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,720
Cat-F The cockpit is under control.

639
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,860
Cat-D The kitchen is under control.

640
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,240
Cat-C The observation deck is under control.

641
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,660
There's no one in the guest room.

642
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,970
Good. Tell everyone to gather in the dining room with the PA system.

643
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,490
Conan, what should we do?

644
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,170
May I have your attention,
please gather in the dining room immediately.

645
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,690
I repeat!

646
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,910
Everyone on the ship, please gather in the dining room at once.

647
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,210
We, Akai Shamu Neko, have hijacked this airship.

648
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,260
Please give us your phones.

649
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,950
Dad, wake up!

650
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,520
I don't have a phone.

651
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,590
It's me.

652
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,790
The ship has been hijacked.

653
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,780
As I thought.

654
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,130
What are their demands?

655
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,590
What do you want? Money?

656
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,430
Or the release of the members of your group.

657
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,830
We have problems with Suzuki Financial Group,

658
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,120
especially this old man.

659
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,660
That's right. I did help the police

660
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,430
destroy your group ten years ago.

661
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,490
That's why you should take me as your hostage and let them go.

662
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,540
I can't do that.

663
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,470
Why?

664
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,070
This airship will still fly to Osaka.

665
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,770
Call the police now.

666
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:01,440
Tell them if they dare to make any moves,

667
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,610
I'll blow the ship up.

668
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,270
Also, this is a bottle of that deadly bacteria.

669
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,740
Don't even think that you could catch us.

670
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,690
If you do that, not only the smoking room,

671
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,910
the whole cabin will be filled with the deadly bacteria.

672
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,810
What should we do, Conan?

673
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,910
We have to save Ai and everybody else!

674
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,530
The priority now is defusing the bomb.

675
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,590
Haibara, one of the hostages might be the accomplice of the criminals.

676
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,350
You have to be careful.

677
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,050
Copy that.

678
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,230
Did anyone of you go to the smoking room?

679
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,090
You did?

680
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,230
Yes, but...

681
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,560
We only opened the door to take a peek.

682
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,380
The smell of cigarettes was too intense there,
so I closed the door right away.

683
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,730
How could this be?

684
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,180
He came into contact with the droplets from sneezing
and went to the smoking room.

685
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,000
It's all right. We didn't go inside.

686
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,130
Also, we don't have rashes.

687
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,830
Let's put it aside first. What should we do about the bomb?

688
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,220
There are four bombs.

689
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,660
Two of them might be near the fuel tank
at the back half of that passage.

690
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,690
You guys.

691
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,160
Can you find those bombs?

692
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,490
Of course.

693
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,630
But, don't touch the bombs when you find them.

694
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,420
Contact me immediately.

695
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,540
Got it.

696
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,380
Also, if you feel unwell,

697
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,430
you have to tell me right away.

698
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,220
Okay?

699
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:33,860
Okay.

700
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,820
Ayumi and Mitsuhiko should be fine.

701
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,950
But Genta...

702
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,040
Damn it.

703
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,170
I can only pray that he didn't get infected.

704
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,400
Where are those kids?

705
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,970
Don't worry. Conan's with them now.

706
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,240
I knew one of the bombs would be behind the wall of the smoking room.

707
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,120
If they detonate this,
the bacteria in the smoking room will spread to the cabin.

708
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,800
Next, they only need to open a hole in the airship
and the bacteria will spread to the outside world.

709
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,340
But, why did the criminals use both the bacteria and bombs?

710
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,930
He only needs one of them to hijack an airship.

711
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:49,860
Why?

712
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,350
Why are the criminals using both the bacteria and bombs?

713
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,720
To be safe, I guess.

714
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,840
Anyhow, before they make a specific demand,

715
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,850
we can only sit and wait.

716
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,930
Follow the airship, but be careful not to be discovered.

717
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,780
I'll contact the police in Osaka
and all the cities the airship will pass by.

718
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,360
Understood.

719
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,570
Conan, I found the bomb!

720
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,870
I found one too!

721
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,800
Okay.

722
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,720
There's only one left.

723
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,410
Get down!

724
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,560
I'll go find the last one.

725
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,140
You guys stay here.

726
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,340
Open it now.

727
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,240
Don't try anything funny,

728
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,940
unless you want the hostages dead.

729
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,650
What are you doing, Mr. Mizukawa?

730
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,980
Mr. Mizukawa, did you...

731
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,570
I'm fine.

732
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:29,370
Mr. Mizukawa.

733
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,550
I told you I'm fine.

734
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:37,400
Rash!

735
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,550
No, this is just normal hives!

736
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,410
Come to think of it, you smelled of smoke just now!

737
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,170
He has been to the smoking room!

738
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,440
You must have got infected there...

739
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,110
No!

740
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,840
I did go there, but I wasn't infected!

741
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,300
Plus, I don't have other symptoms...

742
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,150
Now's the chance to...

743
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,200
subdue them.

744
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,370
Throw him into the smoking room.

745
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:32,950
Was I infected too...

746
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,910
Found it.

747
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,470
By the way, where are those kids?

748
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,570
Kids?

749
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,000
Yes.

750
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,940
There are three boys and a girl who are at the same age as that girl.

751
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:10,830
Go find them.

752
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:13,310
Such a big mouth.

753
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,120
Edogawa, they've found out that you're not with us.

754
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,260
Edogawa...

755
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,460
Two men are heading to your direction...

756
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,100
You are very capable.

757
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:29,950
You...

758
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,200
What are you doing?!

759
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,780
Ai, are you all right?

760
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,530
Shame on you for slapping a child!

761
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,060
If try something like that again, I'll kill you.

762
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,740
Okay, that's all of them.

763
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,720
Did you kids do it?

764
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,150
I'm the one who diffused the bombs, not them.

765
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,990
You are bold.

766
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,580
Conan.

767
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:29,900
Wait.

768
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,730
Shinichi.

769
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,760
Crap!

770
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,330
Great!

771
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:01,830
Kid?

772
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,500
Nice catch.

773
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,260
Kid-sama is awesome!

774
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,830
He's qualified to be my enemy.

775
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,970
Shinichi.

776
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,290
So Kid was here all along.

777
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,580
At least now no one is going to stand in the way.

778
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,180
Go reinstall two bombs.

779
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,890
I can't believe he really threw you out of the window.

780
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,610
What are you going to do, famous detective?

781
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,300
Are you going to surrender?

782
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,470
No way!

783
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,380
Let's get back to the airship!

784
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,780
Don't be rediculous. There's no engine on my hang glider.

785
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,490
Consider yourself lucky to be alive.

786
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,530
(Aichi Sakushima)

787
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,090
It's heading west.

788
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,930
Are they really heading to Osaka?

789
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,600
The Police Headquarters in Osaka.

790
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,140
The airship currently passing over Mie-ken.

791
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,320
If it keeps up this pace, it'll arrive in Osaka in an hour.

792
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:16,360
The 'Bell Tree' tower which symbolizes
Suzuki Financial Group is in the southern suburb.

793
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,800
Is that their destination?

794
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,730
Blowing up the airship by crashing it into the tower...

795
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,910
Is that what the criminal group
which bears a grudge against the Suzuki Group wants?

796
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,910
That we don't know yet.

797
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:36,870
But if it does happen, the bacteria will spread in Osaka.

798
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:41,830
Over 7 million citizens will be in mortal danger.

799
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,050
We have to stop them by whatever means.

800
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,630
What should we do?

801
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:02,750
Heiji!

802
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,690
It took you so long.

803
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:06,910
Sorry.

804
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,030
Who's this child?

805
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:10,560
Hello.

806
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,690
His name is Satoshi Kawaguchi. He's the child of one of my relatives.

807
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,390
His family moved from Yokohama to Nara.

808
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,450
He happened to visit my home. So I brought him here.

809
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,420
Satoshi also said that he wanted to meet you.

810
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:28,180
Heiji, you are very close to Conan,
so you must like children a lot, right?

811
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,410
I guess...

812
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,040
I'd appreciate your guidance.

813
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,680
Likewise, nice to meet you.

814
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,290
Excuse me, are you two a couple?

815
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,540
- You fool.
- What are you talking about?

816
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,290
- Heiji is just a childhood friend.
- Why do you think I am her boyfriend?

817
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,570
- He's like a brother to me.
- My girlfriend will never be like this.

818
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:46,720
- No way...
- No way...

819
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,900
If so, can Sister Kazuha be my bride?

820
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,470
No problem. Marry her if you want.

821
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,830
Thanks, Uncle Heiji.

822
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,550
Why did you call me uncle?

823
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,730
Well, children say what they like. Don't mind them.

824
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,610
Satoshi, I appreciate that you like me.

825
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,420
However, this kind of decision
should be made after careful consideration.

826
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,890
Also, if you want to get married...

827
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,500
I know. Boys under eighteen can't get married, right?

828
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,310
So if you haven't changed your mind

829
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,350
when you turn eighteen, I'll think about it.

830
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,810
All right, end of discussion.

831
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,830
Why is it taking the airship so long to get here?

832
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,900
Before that, there's a battle with Kid.

833
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,160
The sky above Osaka will be the stage.

834
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,710
We should get a good view here,

835
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,250
the VIP seats of the arena.

836
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,090
I like Kid a lot. I have to take photos of him.

837
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,600
This is so exciting!

838
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,240
Kudo.

839
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,800
Where are you right now?

840
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,290
Sakushima near Mikawa Bay.

841
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,670
What? Why are you still so far?

842
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,630
Can't help it. I was thrown out of the airship.

843
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,810
You were thrown out?

844
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,600
Actually, Hattori.

845
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,840
What did you say?

846
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,580
Are you serious?

847
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,300
An airship carrying bombs and the deadly bacteria is heading your way.

848
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:22,620
The combination...

849
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,330
is like an Okonomiyaki which has pork, squid and octopus.

850
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,780
Two people have been infected.

851
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:30,430
Three.

852
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,150
The director named Mizukawa has rash on his right hand.

853
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,530
That's all. I just wanted to let you know.

854
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,260
So, are you all right?

855
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:44,790
I'm fine for now.

856
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,860
That's the police's helicopter.

857
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:53,710
Are they following the airship?

858
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:56,710
Police Department?

859
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,620
Pardon me, I'll call you again.

860
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,040
Wait!

861
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,500
Damn it, he hung up on me again.

862
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:05,540
There's nothing you can do.

863
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,200
Maybe that person is eager to go to that great restaurant.

864
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,960
Didn't you talk about Okonomiyaki just now?

865
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,240
Has there been any progress identifying them?

866
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,540
About that.

867
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,020
We looked into the relatives of the crucial members
of that organization,

868
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,760
but found no one suspicious.

869
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,810
Is there no way to solve this?

870
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,760
Hello, this is Megure.

871
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,140
Inspector Megure, I'm Kudo.

872
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,740
Kudo!

873
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,410
I'm in Aichi Sakushima now

874
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,250
and saw the police's helicopter following the airship.

875
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:42,210
That's right, Sato and Takagi are in the helicopter.

876
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,230
Actually, Kudo...

877
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,840
I know that the airship was hijacked,

878
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,430
so I have a favor to ask of you, Inspector.

879
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,130
What is it?

880
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,240
Allow me to board that helicopter.

881
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,250
How are they going to find Shinichi Kudo here?

882
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,060
You are Shinichi Kudo.

883
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,610
That's why I want you to pretend to be me.

884
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,810
Gosh, I have to pretend to be you again.

885
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,460
Nothing...

886
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,780
I can help you, but you can't interfere with my job.

887
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,010
That I can't guarantee.

888
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,690
I'll try my best not to.

889
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:25,950
Really...

890
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,560
Good.

891
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,790
Cat-E, you should start the preparation now.

892
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,750
Copy that.

893
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,510
What is that? What are you going to do?

894
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,350
Long time no see, Kudo.

895
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,190
Hello.

896
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:49,900
But this is such a big surprise.

897
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,960
I didn't expect to see Conan here.

898
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,270
What were you doing in Sakushima?

899
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:56,770
Let's talk about that later.

900
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,890
Let's focus on chasing the airship for now.

901
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,800
Fly at full speed.

902
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,150
There it is.

903
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,220
Please get closer.

904
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,800
Please go a bit higher so that we're not discovered.

905
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,380
Roger.

906
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,430
What's the wind direction and the speed of the helicopter?

907
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,890
East-southeast and the speed is 200 km per hour.

908
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,740
After you catch up with the airship,

909
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,350
please fly at the same speed as the airplane.

910
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,580
Kudo?

911
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,740
Kudo, what are you doing?

912
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,890
Well, please excuse us now.

913
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:00,510
Kid?

914
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,950
Glider, glider, glider...

915
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,110
Put the glider away now!

916
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,100
Put the glider away now!

917
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,500
I can't press the button because your body is blocking it!

918
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:23,550
Damn it.

919
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,610
Where are you touching?

920
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,010
Stop it!

921
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,970
Be quiet! I'll press the button!

922
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,000
It's easy for you to say it...

923
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,710
Just bear with it!

924
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:33,820
That is my...

925
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,220
Watch out!

926
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:51,620
Back up!

927
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,230
So, Kudo...

928
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,490
is Kid?

929
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,870
Well, good luck.

930
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:17,830
Are you not coming along?

931
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,000
I'll keep an eye on the situation first.

932
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,530
After all, the leader of the group already got the gem.

933
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,560
Ah, I almost forgot.

934
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,390
Take this.

935
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,630
What is it?

936
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,680
Jirokichi's fingerprint sticker.

937
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,340
Thank you.

938
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:48,130
I expected that he would use a glass case equipped
with fingerprint authentication system,

939
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,190
but I won't need it anymore. So you can have it.

940
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,740
By the way, you need to pay more attention to

941
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,110
that important girlfriend of yours.

942
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,710
That Fujioka guy grabbed her arms earlier.

943
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,610
He let go of her right away at that time
and she didn't cough or sneeze,

944
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,630
so I guess she hasn't been infected.

945
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,920
Just thought I'd tell you this.

946
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,140
Nothing's here.

947
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,210
I thought they would definitely put it back here.

948
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,600
Not here either.

949
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:44,250
Could it be that they had set the bombs at some other place?

950
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,250
In the end, I only found two bombs.

951
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:00,470
Also, they were at the same places
where Genta and Mitsuhiko found them.

952
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,030
Why?

953
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,510
Why didn't they put the bomb at the place
where the bacteria could spread?

954
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,000
Anyhow, I should defuse these bombs first.

955
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,070
Hey, Kudo!

956
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,800
You said you would call. What took you so long?

957
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:19,810
Kudo?

958
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,290
No... you are so annoying, Conan.

959
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,070
Sorry, I totally forgot.

960
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,540
Come on. Where are you now?

961
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,300
In the airship.

962
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,730
You already got back?

963
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,870
That's fast.

964
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:34,950
Let's not talk about that. Why did you call me?

965
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,550
I'm busy now.

966
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,360
The criminals already spread the news about the airship via internet.

967
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,670
Everyone in Osaka is in a panic.

968
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:43,650
What?

969
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:48,280
People in Osaka are rushing to the West.
The station is packed with people.

970
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,200
There's no more seats!

971
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,210
But we have few tickets to Tokyo...

972
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,150
What are you talking about? Why would I go to somewhere dangerous?

973
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,700
There's another train coming. Please don't push each other.

974
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,050
What do you mean? It's obvious there's still space!

975
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,370
Please take the next train.

976
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:16,000
The highway and streets are also filled with cars heading west.

977
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,000
Even the bank clerks and security guards have gone to seek refuge.

978
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:23,550
If someone wanted to rob the bank, this could be a great opportunity.

979
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,030
They better not do that.

980
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,660
The anti-theft system nowadays are pretty good.

981
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,350
I was joking.

982
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,660
The adults are talking. Children should not interrupt.

983
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,110
Anti-theft system?

984
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,010
What the hell? Don't scare me like that.

985
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,500
I'll show you something interesting.

986
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:43,990
Sorry, I'll call you again.

987
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:45,710
Hey!

988
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,170
Damn it, he hung up on me again.

989
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,560
What the hell?

990
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,900
Erm, Sister Kazuha.

991
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:53,320
What's the matter?

992
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,540
Who was Uncle Heiji talking to just now?

993
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,100
It's Conan.

994
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,260
Conan?

995
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,880
He's a very clever elementary school student who's about your age.

996
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,710
He and Heiji seem to hit it off well.

997
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,960
-then what did he mean by 'The adults are talking'...
- Enough!

998
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,710
You talk too much.

999
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,280
All right, I'm sorry,

1000
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,260
Uncle Heiji.

1001
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,800
What's the interesting thing you want me to see?

1002
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,570
Smoke flares. What is going on here?

1003
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,330
Nara Prefecture is behind that mountain.

1004
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,680
If the people there saw smoke rising from the airship,

1005
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:57,140
they would definitely be surprised.

1006
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:00,440
Not only surprised, they would panic.

1007
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:01,760
Panic?

1008
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:06,750
Those criminals already posted online
about the bacteria and the bombs.

1009
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,120
Everyone in the city should be evacuating as we speak.

1010
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,840
If that's the situation in Nara Perfreture,

1011
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,240
thieves would have a great opportunity to commit crime.

1012
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,860
You fool, even if there's no one in the city,

1013
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,810
the anti-theft system...

1014
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,170
Anti-theft system?

1015
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,930
Is that why... they chose Nara Prefecture?

1016
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,420
Maybe.

1017
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,340
But... even so,

1018
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:35,140
why did they... take the bacteria away for that?

1019
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,080
I see.

1020
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,370
Okay, I understand.

1021
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,040
I have it covered.

1022
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,990
Where are you going, Heiji?

1023
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,100
Nara.

1024
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,040
Nara?

1025
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:51,260
Is it because of that airship?

1026
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,750
It's very dangerous, so you guys can't come with me.

1027
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,760
Please take me with you!

1028
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,720
Are you nuts? I said you can't come with me.

1029
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,630
I'm know the way around Nara. I could be of help!

1030
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,680
I'm going too!

1031
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,690
You too?

1032
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,880
Also, I can't take you two on the motorcycle because it's illegal.

1033
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,860
Don't worry.

1034
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,000
I have a great idea!

1035
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,610
Hold on tight!

1036
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,880
I know!

1037
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,120
Satoshi, are you all right?

1038
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,280
I'm fine.

1039
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,270
We'll be there in a minute. Just hang in there.

1040
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,680
I just don't feel right doing this...

1041
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,930
How... why?

1042
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:48,650
Ran?

1043
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,190
Ran.

1044
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:00,060
Ran...

1045
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,570
Ran!

1046
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:02,410
Sit down!

1047
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:09,780
Ran.

1048
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:25,990
Rash.

1049
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,920
Help me, please!

1050
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,040
Let go!

1051
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,030
Come here, get in!

1052
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,240
Don't touch me!

1053
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:49,430
Shoot.

1054
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,790
What does this mean?

1055
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,970
Kid said that Ran was only touched, so she shouldn't get infected.

1056
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,040
Ran even pushed him away instantly.

1057
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,490
Also, Mr. Fujioka didn't cough or sneeze.

1058
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,730
Compared to that, Genta was sneezed on

1059
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,130
and even breathed in the air in the smoking room.
Yet he didn't get infected.

1060
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,460
Why?

1061
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,940
The director named Mizukawa also had a rash on his right hand.

1062
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,470
Is it possible that...

1063
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,450
The airship is going to crash!

1064
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,540
The bacteria... the bacteria is going to spread!

1065
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,550
And the bombs are going to explode!

1066
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,640
(Goufuku Temple)
Is everybody out?

1067
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,030
Hurry up and evacuate!

1068
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,600
But what about the Buddhist Statue...

1069
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,870
The statues wouldn't be infected.

1070
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:14,650
Please get in the bus!

1071
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:16,980
- What if we anger the heavens?
- We'll come back when it's safe!

1072
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,070
Just get in the bus!

1073
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,030
Ran...

1074
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,940
Sister Ran...

1075
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:35,900
Go have a look.

1076
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:36,540
Yes.

1077
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,400
You are...

1078
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:03,490
Cat-A.

1079
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,390
Cat-A, what's wrong?

1080
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:07,310
Answer me.

1081
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,500
Go check on him.

1082
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:11,970
Yes!

1083
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:27,830
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1084
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,020
He fell asleep?

1085
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:46,460
Cat-B.

1086
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:47,340
What happened?

1087
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,330
What happened, Cat-B?

1088
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,860
Cat-B is out cold on the roof.

1089
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:56,790
Which is strange, considering cats never land on their backs.

1090
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:57,820
It's Conan.

1091
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,330
He's back.

1092
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,930
Kid must be here too, right?

1093
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,770
Kid is not here.

1094
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,730
Damn it! Cat C D E.

1095
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,150
Go get that boy!

1096
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:08,340
No.

1097
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,870
Once you find him, kill him!

1098
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,030
Roger.

1099
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:13,360
Roger.

1100
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,290
You go guard the restaurant.

1101
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,300
Cat F.

1102
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,240
Copy.

1103
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,220
I'll go over after switching it to autopilot.

1104
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:14,800
Damn it!

1105
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:37,110
Damn it!

1106
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,410
The boy is on the observation deck!

1107
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:22,730
One and...

1108
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:25,370
Seven.

1109
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,920
The trap which was set up for Kid came in handy.

1110
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:35,780
And this thing too.

1111
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,610
Wait.

1112
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,850
Did that guy give this to me so that I could use it on this...

1113
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,410
Freeze!

1114
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,770
Throw it away.

1115
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:49,700
Put your hands up.

1116
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,460
I saw everything. You sure caused us a lot of trouble.

1117
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,040
Now put your hands on that!

1118
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,280
Can I refuse?

1119
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,910
Don't try to bargain with me.

1120
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,530
Fine.

1121
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,100
I'm not like the others...

1122
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:10,100
I tried to warn you.

1123
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,930
Damn you!

1124
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,670
You've got to be kidding me.

1125
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:32,780
What are these?

1126
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:37,010
The third trap which Mr. Jirokichi set up to deal with you.

1127
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:38,330
I see.

1128
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:42,740
If I tried to get away through the glass windows after I get the gem

1129
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,800
and tried to use the grappling hook...

1130
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,530
Good thing I didn't do that.

1131
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,330
That old man has done a marvelous job.

1132
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,080
By the way, you've been watching from above this whole time?

1133
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,640
Take this!

1134
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:32,650
You're good.

1135
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:40,240
This is the medal for a warrior.

1136
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,230
It hurts...

1137
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,720
Can the rest of you hear this?

1138
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,300
Your leader has been taken down,

1139
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,960
so were the other three.

1140
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,130
What?

1141
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,640
Cut the crap!

1142
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,010
Go, Lupin!

1143
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,730
We did it!

1144
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:16,440
Don't run around with such a dangerous thing.

1145
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,350
Edogawa.

1146
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:21,420
The two criminals here has been taken care of.

1147
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:22,690
Roger that.

1148
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,110
So many phone records,

1149
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:38,010
and all this within the last few hours.

1150
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:40,860
Who were you talking to?

1151
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,690
You made a lot of phone calls.

1152
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,560
If you don't answer my question...

1153
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,050
What are you planning to do with that?

1154
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,740
If you don't tell the truth, I'll spill it on your body.

1155
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,890
Whatever.

1156
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,260
All right, put it down slowly.

1157
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,060
Slowly.

1158
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:25,520
I see. What a thorough plan.

1159
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,240
The attack on the airship is just a distraction.

1160
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,300
Your real aim is getting everyone to seek refuge

1161
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:38,040
so that you could steal all the national-protected Buddha statues
in the empty temple.

1162
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,220
That's because the security system in the temple is weak.

1163
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,620
After all, no one would think that someone would steal Buddha statues.

1164
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,210
You lot will surely receive divine punishment.

1165
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:49,810
What the hell are you talking about?

1166
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,150
We are doing this to protect the Buddha statues...

1167
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:57,290
If that's the case, name one inspector from Nara Prefecture.

1168
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:58,810
Well...

1169
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,160
Come on, you can't even tell me one name?

1170
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,150
As a police officer, don't you find that strange?

1171
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,610
There's one. An inspector whose name take on Nara characteristics.

1172
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,010
They are just kids.

1173
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:10,860
Let's finish them.

1174
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,180
Sorry, what did you just say?

1175
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:16,610
He said, "They are just kids."

1176
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:17,790
Did you really say that?

1177
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,500
Are they fools?

1178
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:21,250
That's for sure.

1179
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,340
If we're here to catch thieves, why would we come here on our own?

1180
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:26,880
What?

1181
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,760
Damn it!

1182
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:34,960
I am Shikatsuno Tsuyoshi,
an inspector from Nara Prefecture Police - 3rd Division.

1183
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,590
Remember this,

1184
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,340
don't ever underestimate the Nara police force!

1185
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,350
Kudo, the guys who tried to steal the Buddha statues were arrested.

1186
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:50,940
Of course, the monks are all fine.

1187
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:51,850
I see.

1188
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,650
Thanks, Brother Heiji.

1189
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,060
What?

1190
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,670
That detective boy in Osaka also interfered with this?

1191
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,470
What do you mean by 'interfered with this'?

1192
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,410
Oh yeah.

1193
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:04,800
Here, please take this.

1194
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:08,200
Thank you, little boy.

1195
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,490
Forget about this. We should send Ran to the hospital immediately!

1196
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:14,090
Yes, about that...

1197
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,630
I don't wanna die.

1198
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,860
I don't wanna die...

1199
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,330
Sister Ran.

1200
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,710
Conan!

1201
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,660
No, don't come over, Conan!

1202
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,010
It's fine, Sister Ran.

1203
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,340
Because no one's infected by the bacteria.

1204
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:46,330
But I have rashes on my body.

1205
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:49,030
The rash is a result of an allergic reaction.

1206
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,440
You're probably allergic to lacquer.

1207
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,510
Lacquer?

1208
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,450
The person who brought you here earlier

1209
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,280
is the same one who took Mr. Mizukawa here, right?

1210
01:19:59,070 --> 01:19:59,400
Yeah...

1211
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:00,660
I knew it.

1212
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,950
He's the only one among them who's not allergic to lacquer.

1213
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,250
Since his fingernails are black,

1214
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:12,330
perhaps he used to work with lacquer in the past.

1215
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:18,400
In other words, those criminals
never stole the bacteria in the first place.

1216
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:21,060
They only blew up the lab

1217
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,740
to make their biochemical terrorist act seem real.

1218
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,230
The proof is this ampoule.

1219
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,640
I wanted to open it in front of their leader at that time,

1220
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:35,750
but he seemed pretty calm.

1221
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,810
If it's a bottle of bacteria,

1222
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:40,510
he would've tried his hardest to stop me

1223
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,500
like how you acted just now.

1224
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:45,300
Conan...

1225
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:47,480
Am I right, Uncle?

1226
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:50,770
Are you all right, Ran?

1227
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,440
Also, look.

1228
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,480
Other than the rash that initially appeared,

1229
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:01,150
there's also rash on your palms, the inside of your elbows,
and the back of your thighs, right?

1230
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,350
You are right.

1231
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:08,380
The criminals must have sprayed lacquer on every surface of this room.

1232
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,370
Be it the walls, the sofa, and the door handles.

1233
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:20,250
That's why other than the rash on your arms
which were caused by Mr. Fujioka,

1234
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:26,360
other parts of your skin that came into contact with the lacquer
in this room would also develop a rash...

1235
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,100
Wait, if that's the case then why did that person...

1236
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,460
Could it be that...

1237
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:35,800
What happened?

1238
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,280
Conan...

1239
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:53,300
This is bad!

1240
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,810
With the help from Nara prefecture police,
we already know the identities of the criminals that hijacked the airship.

1241
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,410
They appear to be mercenaries in foreign countries.

1242
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,410
Mercenaries?

1243
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,950
So, Akai Shamu Neko...

1244
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,930
They have nothing to do with that organization.

1245
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,520
They merely used the name of a terrorist group

1246
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:21,180
to cover their intentions of stealing the Buddha statues.

1247
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,920
And, the one who paid them is...

1248
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,270
Hold it right there.

1249
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,640
How could you leave your subordinates behind and flee on your own?

1250
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,670
Don't you find yourself despicable?

1251
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:57,770
The head of the criminal group,

1252
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,150
Mr. Takamichi Fujioka.

1253
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:04,560
Boy, I can't believe you figured out my identity.

1254
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:05,580
No.

1255
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:10,970
I was totally fooled by you
when you pretended to be the first one who got infected.

1256
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,950
If I'm correct, after the airship took off,

1257
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,160
your female subordinate quickly sprayed the smoking room with lacquer

1258
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,850
and placed the ampoule there.

1259
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:24,090
Of course, she was acting under your instructions.

1260
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:28,990
After that, you touched the lacquer on purpose in the smoking room

1261
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:33,560
in order to trick us into believing that you got infected.

1262
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:38,560
That's why you invited Uncle Mouri to smoke
when we were at the observation deck.

1263
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,640
Mr. Mouri, do you want to join me?

1264
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,030
You grabbed Ran's arms for the same reason.

1265
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,710
You plan was to "infect" the people who could pose a threat

1266
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,500
to restrict their freedom of movement.

1267
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,790
However, your plan didn't work well with Uncle Mouri.

1268
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,670
So you slipped some sleeping pills in his beer, right?

1269
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:59,350
Thanks to you, he had a very sound sleep.

1270
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,990
Mr. Mizukawa and the waitress
have rashes on their palms and the inside of their arms,

1271
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,910
which means they must have touched something in the smoking room.

1272
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,850
However, Genta only took a look at the smoking room
and didn't touch anything,

1273
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,590
so he didn't develop rashes.

1274
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,140
That's why you were the odd one out

1275
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:22,310
who got rashes on places which couldn't touch the lacquer.

1276
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,550
Not only that, the leader had been on the phone with somebody.

1277
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:29,990
Then I realized that

1278
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:35,660
you used lacquer in the smoking room to get rashes.

1279
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:39,870
Then you pretended to lose control to get yourself isolated.

1280
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,050
Then you could give orders to the criminal group
without being noticed.

1281
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,630
You were the one behind everything!

1282
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:51,940
Boy, what a brilliant deduction.

1283
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,100
However, you missed a very important part.

1284
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:55,850
What?

1285
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,560
First, I'm not planning to escape alone.

1286
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,670
Unfortunately, all your substitutes were already...

1287
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,700
I'm not talking about them.

1288
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,060
Not the ones I hired,

1289
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,820
but my original subordinates.

1290
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:11,930
Don't tell me there are others...

1291
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,800
Don't move!

1292
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:16,890
Sonoko!

1293
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,560
Didn't he say not to move?

1294
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,090
Edogawa, they have two more accomplices.

1295
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,020
The cameraman and the reporter both work with them.

1296
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,170
Damn it.

1297
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:32,550
Second, I didn't come here to escape.

1298
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:35,540
I wanted to draw you out.

1299
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:36,510
What?

1300
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:43,140
Do you know why the purpose of hijacking the airship
was stealing the statues and not money?

1301
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,730
In the age of information, money is easily traced.

1302
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:54,120
However, stealing the Buddha statues is safer and less conspicuous.

1303
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,980
Japanese Buddha statues are very popular among foreign customers.

1304
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,330
We were about to find a buyer already.

1305
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:04,860
Now that you've ruined my plan, allow me to return the favor!

1306
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:14,010
There's still a lot of time. Let me enjoy this.

1307
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,830
Hattori, you did a great job!

1308
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,140
That boy should take all the credit.

1309
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,010
Let's not talk about this now. Can we catch up with the airship?

1310
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,660
I haven't been able to contact him from a while ago.

1311
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:29,860
I have a bad feeling.

1312
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:30,700
I see.

1313
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:33,960
Listen, Satoshi.

1314
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,850
You should go back now.

1315
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:37,050
But...

1316
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:41,270
I know. Thanks to you the Buddha statues weren't stolen.

1317
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,740
Uncle Heiji!

1318
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,610
I think those thieves are targeting the Goufuku Temple.

1319
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,700
There are a lot of national treasure.

1320
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,250
Okay, I see!

1321
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:54,750
If so, just let me go with you...

1322
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,150
No!

1323
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,660
It's too dangerous.

1324
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,100
You have to go back with Sister Kazuha.

1325
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,700
Satoshi, let's go back, OK?

1326
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,100
Your mom's worried about you.

1327
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,320
I know.

1328
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:14,570
But you have to make it up to me by introducing Conan to me next time.

1329
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,630
Uncle Heiji, he's the one you are going to rescue, right?

1330
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,680
Okay, deal.

1331
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:22,340
Kazuha, please take care of him.

1332
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:23,420
Count on me.

1333
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,260
Heiji, you should be careful too.

1334
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,580
Okay, let's go!

1335
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:30,510
Oh...

1336
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,400
I can't believe you guys are with them.

1337
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:51,940
Everything's settled over there.

1338
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,790
Hey, untie us!

1339
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,360
Sorry... I forgot to tell you,

1340
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,770
but there's a slight change in our plan.

1341
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:04,340
Change?

1342
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,790
After all, this is the only thing we got.

1343
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:12,000
So you guys can just die with the rest of them.

1344
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,040
What?

1345
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,560
Since this shall be the end, let me tell you some good news.

1346
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:36,940
We'll take the cruiser parked near that bridge and leave.

1347
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,460
Shortly after that, this airship will explode.

1348
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,520
Starting from the cabin where the hostages are at.

1349
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:45,500
I see. That's why you...

1350
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:50,220
Since you defused the bombs which were placed at the fuel tank,

1351
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:54,460
I had no choice but to set up two bombs in the cabin.

1352
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:57,430
Damn it!

1353
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,890
But before that,

1354
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,690
I'll bury you in the bottom of the sea.

1355
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,200
Damn it, what should I do?

1356
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:15,780
Is there a way... to turn the tables?

1357
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:25,030
I see it! It's the airship!

1358
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:27,420
It's flying really low.

1359
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,420
If they continue their course...

1360
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:33,530
I know, they'll collide with the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge!

1361
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:49,940
I can see the Kobe Tower and even the anchor sign of Mount Rokko!

1362
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,230
Fantastic...

1363
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:57,310
Trying to distract me and make me bump my head
against the bottom of the bridge?

1364
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,430
How could I fall for such childish trap?

1365
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,150
What's going on?

1366
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,300
What happened?

1367
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:24,730
Damn it!

1368
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:49,490
How amazing!

1369
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:52,680
Just like a whale leaping out of the sea!

1370
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:20,950
Hello.

1371
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,600
Kudo, are you all right?

1372
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:26,200
Hattori, you phoned just in time.

1373
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,320
Call the maritime police now.

1374
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:29,940
The maritime police?

1375
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,340
The head of the organization fell into the sea.

1376
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,820
You said the criminal fell into the sea?

1377
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:39,850
Also, their cruiser should be parked near the bridge.

1378
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:41,600
Please send some people to arrest them there.

1379
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:42,870
Okay, I got it.

1380
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:44,630
See you later then.

1381
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:48,200
I'll bring you to that Okonomiyaki place tomorrow. Look forward to it.

1382
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:50,910
Hattori.

1383
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,090
Was that Kudo on the phone?

1384
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,250
Yeah...

1385
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,030
There's something I need to ask you.

1386
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,990
Is Kudo... Kaitou Kid?

1387
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,240
What?

1388
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,850
Is everyone okay?

1389
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:11,560
Yeah, we are fine.

1390
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,450
We were just startled.

1391
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,250
Where are those guys?

1392
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:18,350
The two criminals over there passed out.

1393
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:22,760
They hit the wall when the airship rotated.

1394
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,200
They can thank themselves for that.

1395
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:27,210
We are perfectly fine because we were tied up, huh?

1396
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,320
Wow, this is such a surprise.

1397
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,590
I had wanted to check the situation in the hall,

1398
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,960
but the floor suddenly tilted.

1399
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,620
Kid, screw you!

1400
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,780
Kid sama!

1401
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:39,840
Where's Conan?

1402
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,050
That boy's fine.

1403
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:45,000
He should be here soon.

1404
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,760
So please untie the rest of them.

1405
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,320
Kid sama, please untie me!

1406
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:54,960
Wait, Kid!

1407
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,780
Of course, please make sure this officer is the last one you untie.

1408
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:10,340
Well everyone, as agreed, this jewel now belongs to me.

1409
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,410
Wait, you can't get away, Kid!

1410
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,900
Damn you, you despicable thief!

1411
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:17,930
Please call me 'Kaitou'.

1412
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:33,290
So the bombs were also...

1413
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:35,770
Okay, I see.

1414
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:36,680
Thanks for your work.

1415
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:42,800
The hostages are safe and the criminals were all captured.

1416
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,980
We solved a big case.

1417
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,100
Yeah...

1418
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,280
I'm so hungry!

1419
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,600
It's finally dinner time! I've been looking forward to this!

1420
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,360
Will there be grilled eel rice?

1421
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,010
But, I feel like I've forgotten something.

1422
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:08,920
Now that you've said that...

1423
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,480
And now, it's time for your long awaited quiz!

1424
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:19,480
No one's looking forward to it.

1425
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,250
Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko are all good kids.

1426
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:28,850
Among the three of them, who's the most irrelevant to the airship?

1427
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,500
That's it?

1428
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:36,580
I can give a hint if you don't know...

1429
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:39,110
The three of them are all related to it, right?

1430
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,780
Note: Bad behavior(ひこう) sounds the same as flight in Japanese.

1431
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:44,850
They are all good kids, so they don't misbehave.

1432
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,840
And with Kansai accent, misbehaving sounds like airship.

1433
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:49,170
Hikou (Airship).

1434
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:50,740
That's what it is.

1435
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:51,530
I see it now.

1436
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:56,580
If dealing with that thief would be as easy as the riddle,

1437
01:34:56,910 --> 01:35:00,590
I would've caught him easily
and add a glorious chapter into my biography.

1438
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,770
Sister Sonoko,

1439
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,480
where's Sister Ran?

1440
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,240
Now that you've mentioned it, she's so slow.

1441
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,990
She told me to come over. I thought that she went to the restroom.

1442
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:16,460
Your girlfriend took the elevator to go up.

1443
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:19,170
Maybe she went to find Kid?

1444
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:20,200
What?

1445
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:26,960
So it's opaque.

1446
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:27,870
Shinichi.

1447
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:31,150
Shinichi.

1448
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:33,940
Crap, I forgot about that.

1449
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,080
Hi, Ran.

1450
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:38,980
What an exciting day.

1451
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:41,150
Shinichi!

1452
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:43,410
You have to turn yourself in!

1453
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,260
Stealing is not the right thing to do!

1454
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,270
Please, Shinichi!

1455
01:35:55,970 --> 01:35:56,480
I understand.

1456
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,350
So...

1457
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:05,820
If I can get the treasure I want the most from you,
I'll turn myself in.

1458
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:09,070
But, I don't have anything.

1459
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:11,920
That's of course...

1460
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:16,030
W... Wait.

1461
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,430
You are not Shinichi, right?

1462
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:44,620
Conan!

1463
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,460
Kid, you bastard!

1464
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:50,450
That's right. I'm a thief, not a detective.

1465
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:55,300
A thief makes a living stealing other people's treasure,

1466
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,040
including an innocent girl's heart.

1467
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:13,410
Kid-sama is so handsome!

1468
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:16,750
If he does that kind of thing to you,
you won't find him handsome anymore.

1469
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:19,280
What kind of thing is that?

1470
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:25,340
Lady Sky! Kid gave it back!

1471
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,850
What did Kid do to you?

1472
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,090
Something Shinichi would never do to me.

1473
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,300
Why? Why wouldn't Shinichi do that?

1474
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,650
Why do you think that?

1475
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:43,060
Because that's...

1476
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:52,850
I don't like him at all! Don't get me wrong!

1477
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:56,010
What?

1478
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,610
Wait, Sister Ran!

1479
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,710
What kind of thing... is that?
