1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,040
All here.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,440
I'll be looking forward to it next month too.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,340
Give me a break already.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,440
I can't take it anymore.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,740
God knows what I went through to get that cash.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,240
"Katsutoshi Kue" -You're in charge of accounting

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,640
at your company, aren't you?

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,340
You've got loads of ways to get cash, don't you?

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,940
Don't be ridiculous!

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,940
You know I can't do something like that.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,940
It doesn't really matter.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,440
But, I wonder what'll happen if that thing about you was revealed?

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Your daughter's wedding...

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Wait. Please not that.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,240
If it's for the happiness of your daughter,

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,740
you'll do anything, wouldn't you?

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,540
Please forgive me already.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,340
I can't keep paying that amount with my salary.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,440
I beg you.

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,040
If your salary's not enough,

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,540
why don't you part-time at night?

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,040
I already am.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,340
But I can't go on any further.

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,940
You can flee if you want.

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,240
But if you do, this will go on the internet.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
If you don't want that to happen you know what to do, don't you?

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,640
If all cases were men,

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,340
The initial "K" that strangely stands out.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,140
A suspicious dying message.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,940
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,379
"Suspicious Initial K"

35
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,379
That restaurant was pretty delicious, wasn't it?

36
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,279
Yes, the spring rolls were exquisite.

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,279
Isn't that Officer Tateno?

38
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:47,179
Yes, I wonder if something happened?

39
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,379
Officer Sumio Tateno,

40
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:53,079
of Beikacho 5-chome police box.

41
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,679
He's serious, honest, and a good fellow.

42
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,779
He is also greatly trusted by the people of the community.

43
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,379
His dream has come true, and he will soon be transferred

44
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,279
to the Beika Police Department detective section.

45
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,379
Like I'm always saying.

46
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,979
Officer Tateno.

47
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,879
Is anything wrong?

48
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,279
Mr. Mouri, it's no big deal.

49
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,079
It is a big deal.

50
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,579
There's an audacious one who always messes up the trash dump,

51
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,779
I'm asking him to stake out all night and nab the one.

52
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,979
Like I said,

53
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,279
I'm concentrating on patroling this area, aren't I?

54
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,879
Are you all right?

55
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,979
Please get a hold of yourself.

56
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,879
Isn't that blood?

57
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,879
Somebody's dead inside.

58
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,979
What?

59
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,379
Please get a hold of yourself.

60
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,379
Are you all right?

61
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,179
So, this is the murder weapon.

62
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,979
There are marks of resistance on the corpse's hand.

63
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,279
That cushion...

64
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,879
Did the culprit stab the victim

65
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,079
after pushing the cushion against him to avoid splattering blood?

66
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,079
Mr. Mouri, please take care of this.

67
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,079
I will go and check to see if there is anyone suspicious

68
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,379
in the house.

69
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,279
Headquarters, Tateno of the police box in Beikacho 5-chome here.

70
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,479
Sir, over there.

71
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,879
"K".

72
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,779
Could this be a dying message?

73
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,679
Did a post crown come off?

74
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,179
Did the culprit break it?

75
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,479
There's no one in the house.

76
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,979
The door of the kitchen

77
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,479
as well as all of the windows are locked from the inside.

78
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,279
I see.

79
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,079
The victim is Mr. Zenkichi Ooka, age 64.

80
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,779
He lives alone in this house

81
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:04,979
and seems to be working as a security guard

82
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,779
at a supermarket in Haidocho.

83
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,679
Are you the one who discovered the corpse?

84
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,479
First of all, may I have your name?

85
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,679
"Kiwako Kaitani (25)" -I am Kiwako Kaitani.

86
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,679
Her initial is "K".

87
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,579
And you?

88
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,879
I'm Hanazawa.

89
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,979
I was watching all the while.

90
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,079
All the while?

91
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,579
Yes. I was talking at the front door with my friend

92
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,679
Ms. Nakajima who lives in 4-chome.

93
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,879
Then, I think it was a little after 6:00 pm,

94
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,079
Mr. Ooka came home.

95
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,379
Soon after,

96
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,079
a man came over to Mr. Ooka's house.

97
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,479
A man?

98
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,879
Yes. He looked to be a business man of about 50 years old.

99
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,779
But he rushed off home in about 10 minutes.

100
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,379
And?

101
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,979
About 20 minutes later,

102
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,479
she came and went into Mr. Ooka's house.

103
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,479
Soon, after Ms. Nakajima went home,

104
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,079
Mr. Tateno came along,

105
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,679
and talked about 5 minutes,

106
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,879
then these people came and she came out again.

107
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,479
I'm sure that the man who came before me I'm sure.

108
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,379
We've got to find that man right away.

109
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,579
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,879
What seems to be the matter?

111
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,779
It's that man who came to Mr. Ooka's house a while ago.

112
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,779
See, he's among the spectators.

113
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,479
The man wearing that cap?

114
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,479
Yes.

115
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,479
Hold it!

116
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,079
-Why you... -Don't move!

117
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,679
Let me go!

118
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,179
What's your name?

119
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,179
Katsutoshi Kusaka.

120
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:59,079
His initial is also "K".

121
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,779
"Beika Police Station"

122
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,879
Is this knife yours?

123
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,679
It... it's mine all right.

124
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,879
But, I didn't do it.

125
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,379
Why did you go to Mr. Ooka's house in the first place?

126
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,379
That's...

127
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,179
I was in fact being blackmailed by Ooka.

128
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,579
It's been 7 years ago already.

129
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:28,579
I got hooked on mahjong gambling.

130
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,079
The mahjong parlor was raided by the police

131
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,379
and being a customer there I was also arrested.

132
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,779
Ooka was also a regular there.

133
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,079
He was lucky and wasn't arrested.

134
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,479
Since then, I've gone completely clean, quit gambling,

135
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,679
and worked as a good citizen.

136
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,179
And yet I ran into that guy coicidentally

137
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,479
at a supermarket 2 years ago in Haidocho

138
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,279
and he's been blackmailing me since.

139
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,079
He began blackmailing you?

140
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,679
Yes. Every single month.

141
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,979
Half a year ago, talks on my daughter's marriage were about to settle,

142
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:04,879
and since then, he began demanding more cash.

143
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,179
He appeared at a hotel in Shiomi the other day

144
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,579
when we were having lunch with my daughter's groom-to-be's family.

145
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:14,779
He said that he had a temporary security guard job nearby.

146
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,179
If things go on as is,

147
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:19,279
my daughter's marriage talks would go to shambles.

148
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,579
I just couldn't bear thinking about it.

149
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:29,279
Did you go to the victim's house today to give him the money?

150
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,479
I usually give it to him at the end of the month after I get paid,

151
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,879
but since he demanded that I give him cash

152
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,779
for riding the Bullet train because an old friend of his died,

153
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,879
and he had to attend the funeral.

154
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,679
Instead of money I brought a knife.

155
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,379
But while I was struggling with him,

156
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,279
I slashed his hand

157
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,979
Seeing the blood splatter...

158
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,479
I suddenly got scared,

159
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,279
I threw the knife down and fled.

160
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,479
That's really all there is to it.

161
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,079
That young lady must've come after me.

162
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,279
I'm sure she's the one who did it!

163
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,179
We found it inside your knapsack.

164
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:10,679
The contents is something that is extremely dangerous for the body.

165
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,479
You're a pharmacist, aren't you?

166
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,279
Did you steal it from the pharmacy that you work for?

167
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,079
That guy...

168
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,579
He's to blame!

169
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,479
I graduated last year,

170
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:28,179
but I couldn't find a job,

171
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,779
so I sort of had a nervous break down

172
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,979
and began shoplifting repeatedly.

173
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,979
He caught me doing so,

174
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:38,379
and told me that he'd overlook it, so to give him money.

175
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,079
Since then, I've been paying him every month.

176
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,879
After I landed myself a job,

177
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,979
he demanded that I pay him double of what I already was.

178
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,179
He used to come out of his way to my work place

179
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,379
and got his drugs prscribed there.

180
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,879
Just to think that I would be blackmailed by him all my life...

181
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:02,579
So I hoped that he would fall ill of some grave disease or something.

182
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,279
Did you stop by at the victim's house to pay him money?

183
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,479
I always pay him at the beginning of the month,

184
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,279
but he suddenly told me since a friend of his in his hometown died

185
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,479
and he had to go to the funeral,

186
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,779
he wanted me to pay for his hotel charges.

187
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,979
But, all I did was break his cell phone.

188
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,779
Because the scene of my shoplifting was inside it.

189
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,079
It's true!

190
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,779
I'm sure that the man who came before me is the culprit, I'm sure!

191
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,679
Who would've thought that the victim was a blackmailer.

192
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,479
According to Mr. Kusaka,

193
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,579
Mr. Ooka was hoooked on a casino abroad.

194
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:38,679
Casino?

195
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,979
He probably blackmailed in order to make money for that.

196
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:45,179
Going to casinos with the money he blackmailed?

197
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,279
What a guy...

198
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,579
This calendar is Mr. Ooka's, right?

199
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,979
No, Conan.

200
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,279
There are strange things written in here and there.

201
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,079
What could it be?

202
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,179
Is it some code or what?

203
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,879
It probably has something to do with his blackmailing though.

204
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,779
You're going to be a police detective from next month.

205
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,179
You'd better get used to this atmosphere from now.

206
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,079
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,179
Hey, your cap's soiled.

208
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,579
There was no one in the room

209
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,779
and all the windows were locked from the inside, were they not?

210
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,379
Yes, sir. Exactly.

211
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,579
In other words, the only ones who could've

212
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:40,279
gone in and out of of the crime site were these two?

213
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,179
Katsutoshi Kusaka

214
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,479
and Kiwako Kaitani...

215
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,379
the culprit is one of the two.

216
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,079
Which means one of the two is lying.

217
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,179
Something doesn't seem right.

218
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:03,179
In order to avoid splattered blood,

219
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,479
the culprit used a cushion.

220
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:09,479
I wonder if those two could ever commit a crime so calmly?

221
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,779
Come to think of it...

222
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,179
Did you find the post crown?

223
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,179
You keep out of this, kid!

224
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:20,079
But, it bothers me.

225
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,879
It wasn't found on the site.

226
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,979
If it came off when he struggled with the culprit,

227
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,879
there is a possibility that it's on th eclothes of the culprit.

228
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,179
There was none on the clothes of the two.

229
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,679
It's thinkable that Mr. Kusaka who left the site once,

230
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,879
could've disposed of it somewhere.

231
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,979
Officer Takagi and Sato,

232
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,379
go and continue interrogating the two.

233
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,279
Officer Chiba, go and check on the associates of the victim.

234
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,479
There may be other blackmail victims too.

235
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,479
Yes, sir.

236
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,879
"Maru" Oka?

237
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,479
So, I see.

238
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,779
If so, what on earth does that "K" mean?

239
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,079
Why is it a place like this?

240
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,379
I see, I got.

241
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,279
Mr. Mouri?

242
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,479
Inspector, it's getting late

243
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,479
so I guess it's about time to get to the bottom of things.

244
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,979
What? Did you figure out who the culprit is?

245
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,179
Yes, sir.

246
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,679
I shall tell you what really happened from now,

247
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,179
so will you please bring the two suspects here?

248
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,479
The two?

249
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,279
You're the only people who went in and out of the site of the crime

250
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,879
after Mr. Ooka returned home.

251
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,379
I didn't do it!

252
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:00,779
Me niether!

253
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,979
The letter "K" was found written at the scene.

254
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:07,379
It is highly unlikely that either one of you wrote it

255
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:09,079
to confuse the investigation.

256
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,779
Therefore, it's hightly probable that it was a dying message

257
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,479
that was written by the victim.

258
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,079
But, both their initials are "K",

259
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,179
it's hard to determine which of the two the killer is, on this alone...

260
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:26,379
Mr. Kusaka, weren't you paying Mr. Ooka on the 27th of each month?

261
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,579
Yes.

262
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,379
You, on the 5th, right, Ms. Kaitani?

263
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,479
Yes, that's right.

264
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:35,479
Wasn't it the 8th that Mr. Ooka appeared at the hotel in Shiomi?

265
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,979
Exactly.

266
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:40,679
Mr. Ooka came to the pharmacy on the 17th, didn't he?

267
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,779
How did you know?

268
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,879
It's all written in on the calendar.

269
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:48,679
Calendar? You mean that code?

270
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,579
Please look at the name tape of Mr. Ooka's notebook.

271
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,879
Zero "oka".

272
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,179
That's read "Ooka".

273
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,379
It's not zero, but rather, the alphabet "O".

274
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,379
Mr. Ooka seems to have had the habit of writing

275
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:05,879
in the names of people and places,

276
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,279
symbolizing them with letters of the alphabet and numbers.

277
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,179
Are you saying that, the code "9A" (kyu A) that is written in on the 27th,

278
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,879
"89" on the 5th,

279
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:18,479
symbolize Mr. Kusaka and Ms. Kaitani?

280
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,679
The name Kusaka if read in Chinse style,

281
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,579
is read "Kyuei" (9A).

282
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,079
Ms. Kaitani is a pharmacist.

283
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,679
The letter 89 (yaku) is used to refer to the word pharmaceutical,

284
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,279
and he added the word woman.

285
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,679
I see, so the number "403"

286
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,579
is shiomi if read in Japanese style.

287
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,879
So, the code "100" written in on the 17th

288
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,779
should be read "Jyuo" (10+O)...

289
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,679
which stands for pharmacy in Jyuo.

290
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,679
I see.

291
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,979
If so, the "K" that was found at the site...

292
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:57,179
It's neither Katsutoshi Kusaka nor Kiwako Kaitani.

293
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,679
That stands for...

294
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,879
of Keikan meaning police officer in Japanese!

295
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:06,679
The culprit is you, Officer Tateno!

296
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,079
Officer Tateno is the culprit?

297
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,379
No way.

298
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,979
Please wait.

299
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,079
If that were to really stand for the "K" of Keikan-police officer,

300
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,979
why would that make me the culprit?

301
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,779
When the corpse was found,

302
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:21,879
you went into the house

303
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,279
saying that you're going to check if there were any suspicious people

304
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,179
and headed first of all for the kitchen.

305
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,679
Isn't that strange?

306
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,679
Why didn't you check the room on the opposite side

307
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,279
which was the closest first of all?

308
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,679
Well...

309
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,579
Back then, you went to lock the kitchen door.

310
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,579
The kitchen door that you went in

311
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,479
and out of when you committed the crime.

312
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,979
That trash dump guy,

313
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:46,579
I'll bet that was you too.

314
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,579
Since you wanted to avoid being suspected of loitering around the area

315
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,779
while gathering information on Mr. Ooka,

316
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:53,879
you made it look as if you were frequently patroling that area.

317
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:57,579
That's how you found out that Mr. Kusaka

318
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,479
and Ms. Kaitani would be visiting Mr. Ooka.

319
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:04,579
Taking advantage of this, you schemed up a plan to kill Mr. Ooka.

320
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,379
Wrong.

321
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,379
After Mr. Kusaka left the site,

322
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:12,079
you snuck into the house from the kitchen door,

323
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,079
killed Mr. Ooka then left again from the same door.

324
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,679
Then, you appeared before Mrs. Hanazawa as if nothing had happened.

325
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:23,079
That's all nonsense!

326
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,979
Do you have any proof?

327
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:27,879
There was something on your cap, wasn't there?

328
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,479
Wasn't it sugar?

329
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,579
Ants were gathered where you're standing.

330
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:37,979
True.

331
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:40,779
There was sugar spilled at the site.

332
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,779
When you killed Mr. Ooka,

333
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,179
your cap came off, didn't it?

334
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,279
And fell on the sugar.

335
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,779
Nothing of that sort...

336
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:49,879
One more thing.

337
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,279
When you brushed the cap off,

338
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,479
you faced the soiled part downward and brushed it off, right?

339
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,479
I thought it was strange.

340
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:02,779
Maybe you've got a reason for not wanting to flip your cap over?

341
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:04,479
Well...

342
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,779
If my deduction is correct,

343
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,479
Mr. Ooka's post crown that disappeared from site...

344
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:11,779
is inside your cap.

345
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:16,479
Officer Tateno, take off your cap.

346
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,879
Oh, well...

347
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,379
Here it is!

348
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,479
It's highly likely

349
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,379
that Mr. Ooka's post crown that fell off

350
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:30,179
fell in to your cap that came off.

351
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,979
When I mentioned this,

352
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,579
you realized it,

353
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,779
and not wanting the post crown to fall out,

354
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:38,179
you couldn't turn your cap upside down.

355
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,779
Officer Tateno, why did you do something like that?

356
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,579
Answer me, Officer Tateno!

357
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,579
The fact is, when I was still a student,

358
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,079
I used to be a regular and gambled playing mahjong

359
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,379
at the same parlor where Mr. Kusaka used to go.

360
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:05,579
I, like Ooka, lucky was spared being arrested.

361
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,379
But, since then I changed my ways,

362
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:12,279
studied hard and became a police officer.

363
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,979
But six months ago,

364
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:17,879
I ran into Ooka who was working as a security guard at a supermarket

365
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,079
where I went to pick up a shoplifter.

366
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,979
But, wasn't Mr. Ooka's work place in Haidocho?

367
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,879
It seems he came in as a substitute

368
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,679
for a security guard who called in sick.

369
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,979
He remembered me.

370
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:33,979
And he startled blackmailing me.

371
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:37,879
You were giving him money every month on the 11th?

372
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,379
The character that was written on the calendar

373
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:43,079
is something you wrote in

374
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,679
by adding the left part on to the letter "K", isn't it?

375
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,179
That's right.

376
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:48,579
Every month since then...

377
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,279
Last month,

378
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,879
I got a notice that I would be transferred to the Detective section.

379
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:55,479
When Ooka found out about this,

380
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:58,679
he started demanding even more money.

381
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,479
Officer Tateno...

382
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:06,079
I investigated and found that there were many more victims.

383
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,079
I figured I couldn't let him go on the way he was.

384
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,979
That's right, I punished him.

385
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:18,379
To save all the people who were made to suffer because of him.

386
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,179
In the name of justice!

387
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,679
This punishment in the name of justice!

388
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,479
Don't you dare claim justice with that mouth of yours!

389
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:30,279
No matter how you put it,

390
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,479
what you did is commit homicide!

391
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,179
It's nothing more than a dirty crime.

392
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,479
And the stupid crime that you committed threw dirt

393
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,679
and hurt the pride of all the 290,000 officers

394
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,679
there are throughout the nation!

395
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,379
You don't have a tinge of a right to claim justice!

396
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,679
Sumio Tateno, you're under arrest on murder charge!

397
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,479
I am very sorry to have caused you both a great discomfort

398
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,979
because of this case.

399
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,779
Don't be...

400
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,779
However, Mr. Kusaka, you will be charged with assault,

401
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:36,179
and Ms. Kitani, you will be arrested on charges of burglary.

402
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,479
Do you understand?

403
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,679
Yes.

404
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,679
I understand.

405
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,379
One mistake

406
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:47,679
and either of you may have committed the same crime as Tateno.

407
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,779
Keep that in mind,

408
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,279
and after compensating for each of your crimes respectively,

409
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,579
go on and live a righteous life.

410
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,379
Yes.

411
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,279
I'm very sorry.

412
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,379
Mr. Mouri, please take over.

413
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:10,179
We've got to hurry or her life may be in danger.

414
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,279
Darn, the noise...

415
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,579
The guys upstairs.

416
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,579
She was killed, wasn't she?

417
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:25,479
She's not the victim?

418
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,479
She's the assaulter.

419
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,579
Next Conan,

420
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:34,379
"Rainy Night Blackmailer".

421
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,879
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,579
"Umbrella".

423
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,279
A request from Officer Chiba?

424
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,279
Like, I'm a great detective that even the police rely on?

425
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,279
No way.
