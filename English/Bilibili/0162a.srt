1
00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:03.624
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:05.124
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:06.924
Today's episode is special. It's the start of Conan

4
00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.724
and Shinichi's era, the very first mystery.

5
00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:10.324
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:12.224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.724
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52.676 --> 00:01:57.976
"Flying Coffin - Shinichi's First Case"

9
00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:02.576
"Narita Airport"

10
00:02:03.576 --> 00:02:08.576
Look, that's the one. That's the plane we're riding.

11
00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:10.176
It's so big.

12
00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:12.076
Boeing 747.

13
00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:15.676
It's a jumbo jet total length, 70.7 meters.

14
00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:16.876
Seriously.

15
00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:19.476
Why's a famous private detective like Kogoro Mouri

16
00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:22.476
have to babysit a bunch of kids on his trip to Okinawa?

17
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.176
You have your nerve.

18
00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:29.676
Last night you were saying, "Wait for me, my little beach angel".

19
00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:31.976
I didn't know these brats were coming along.

20
00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:33.076
Good grief.

21
00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:35.676
Doctor Agasa entered a contest on the internet

22
00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:39.076
and won this trip to Okinawa. That's why we're able to go.

23
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.676
Just be grateful you can go along.

24
00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:44.176
Yes.

25
00:02:44.176 --> 00:02:49.076
I don't see that lucky professor anywhere, do you?

26
00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:50.076
Now that you mention it.

27
00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:52.076
The professor's not coming.

28
00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:56.376
I just called him

29
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.476
and he said he came down with a cold and won't be able to go.

30
00:02:58.476 --> 00:02:59.676
What?

31
00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:02.876
But I don't think it's too bad.

32
00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:05.376
He asked me to buy a lot of gifts.

33
00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:07.076
What about Ai?

34
00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:10.476
She said she'll pass because she's taking care of the professor.

35
00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:12.376
Oh, I see.

36
00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:16.276
Then let's buy her a lot of souvenirs.

37
00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:33.076
The houses are getting smaller and smaller.

38
00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:35.176
Conan, look.

39
00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:37.476
Are you sleeping?

40
00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:42.376
He was up all night reading.

41
00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:51.476
What're you smiling about?

42
00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:56.376
I'm just thinking about the plane ride last year.

43
00:03:56.376 --> 00:04:00.376
Shinichi fell asleep too, right after we took off.

44
00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:04.476
Oh, I remember that's when I won a trip at the neighborhood drawing

45
00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:08.876
and while I was gone, you and that kid detective ran off to Los Angeles.

46
00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:10.776
How many times do I have to tell you?

47
00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.376
We just went to visit his parents.

48
00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:16.576
Kids just in high school don't go off on overseas trips.

49
00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:19.576
At least not normal kids.

50
00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:24.876
Well that's because his parents sent me a ticket too.

51
00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:31.176
He didn't try to do anything funny, did he?

52
00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:33.576
What do you mean by anything funny?

53
00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:35.976
Well, you know...

54
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:39.076
I mean, how do I say this?

55
00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:42.376
You kids, sit down.

56
00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:43.876
Of all the...

57
00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:05.176
Excuse me.

58
00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:07.876
What? Who, me?

59
00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:10.076
Do you mind not smoking?

60
00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:12.376
This is a no-smoking section.

61
00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:14.976
"Tsuneo Ukai (47)" -It's bothering the other passengers.

62
00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:15.976
If you want to smoke,

63
00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:18.376
please do it in the smoking section in the rear of the plane.

64
00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:20.176
"Kazuhiro Otaka (29), Photographer" -Sorry about that.

65
00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:22.176
I'll try to be careful next time.

66
00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:29.476
"Tsugumi Amano (27), Photographer"

67
00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:31.676
For goodness sake, Kazuhiro, stop that.

68
00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:33.176
Why you?

69
00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.576
That's not a way to talk to your soon to be a filthy rich boyfriend.

70
00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:37.176
Watch yourself.

71
00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:39.976
Kazuhiro...

72
00:05:39.976 --> 00:05:42.476
Come on. Be happy.

73
00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:43.976
The newspaper company over there said

74
00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.676
they'd pay a lot of money for these negatives.

75
00:05:47.676 --> 00:05:50.376
If they're real, right?

76
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.076
They're supposed...

77
00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:55.176
"Chizuru Tachikawa (29), Photographer" -to be scandal shots

78
00:05:55.176 --> 00:05:57.876
of a powerful American senator when he was in Japan

79
00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:00.876
but it'd be embarrassing if they were of somebody else.

80
00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:03.576
You've got to be kidding.

81
00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:07.376
I already faxed 2 copies of the pictures over there

82
00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:09.176
and got it confirmed.

83
00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:12.876
It doesn't matter, just remember, we're on vacation.

84
00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:15.576
Your negatives come second.

85
00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:17.176
Alright already.

86
00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:21.076
I'll show you some really great surfing moves.

87
00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:22.876
Right, Washinuma?

88
00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:25.676
"Noboru Washinuma (30), Photographer" -What's with him?

89
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:27.576
He's sleeping already.

90
00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:32.176
Oh, well, I guess I'll get some rest, too.

91
00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:33.676
Good night.

92
00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:39.476
"Edward Crow, Freelance journalist"

93
00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:51.376
Yes. May I help you?

94
00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:52.776
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:55.376
I seem to have gotten airsick,

96
00:06:55.376 --> 00:06:57.076
do you have motion sickness pills?

97
00:06:57.076 --> 00:07:00.276
Yes. I'll be right back.

98
00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:11.376
Sir, may I help you?

99
00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:17.176
I don't like flying, being box in makes me restless.

100
00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:19.576
I have an idea. Could you do me a favor?

101
00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:21.976
Yes, what is it?

102
00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:27.576
Hey, are you alright?

103
00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:29.676
I think I'm airsick..

104
00:07:29.676 --> 00:07:32.976
The stewardess is getting some medicine.

105
00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:35.576
Did you drink the motion sickness pills I gave you?

106
00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:39.376
That's strange. I gave some to Noboru, too.

107
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.576
And it seems to be working.

108
00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:44.076
How about if we switch seats?

109
00:07:44.076 --> 00:07:46.676
Maybe sitting by the window will make you feel better.

110
00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.576
What?

111
00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:57.176
Here, the medicine's for her.

112
00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.476
Here you are.

113
00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:00.476
Thank you.

114
00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:03.276
Here, your pills.

115
00:08:05.576 --> 00:08:07.776
I just noticed, where'd Kazuhiro go?

116
00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:10.576
He got up a while ago and went somewhere.

117
00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:15.676
I wonder if he didn't feel good and went to the toilet.

118
00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:26.076
Hey, you in there. Hey.

119
00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:28.476
Excuse me, is something the matter?

120
00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:30.476
I've been knocking a long time

121
00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.976
but whoever's inside doesn't answer.

122
00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:37.976
Excuse me? Hello?

123
00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.176
Excuse me.

124
00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:42.776
Are you feeling ill...

125
00:08:54.376 --> 00:08:56.176
What was that scream?

126
00:08:56.176 --> 00:08:58.376
It came from the rear.

127
00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.776
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.

128
00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:03.976
A passenger has become seriously ill.

129
00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:07.976
If there is a doctor or nurse on board,

130
00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:10.976
please contact the nearest cabin attendant.

131
00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:11.976
Excuse me.

132
00:09:11.976 --> 00:09:13.376
Yes?

133
00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:15.876
Megure of the Metropolitan Police Department.

134
00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:18.276
Is someone really ill?

135
00:09:18.276 --> 00:09:20.976
Well, the truth is...

136
00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:23.576
I went for a look. Somebody's dead.

137
00:09:23.576 --> 00:09:25.176
-Really? -Yeah.

138
00:09:25.176 --> 00:09:27.076
Inside the toilet in the back.

139
00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:29.076
Hey, come on, wake up.

140
00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:31.176
Something terrible has happened...

141
00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.276
I don't believe it.

142
00:09:33.276 --> 00:09:37.276
-Where is he? -Why? Ran, is that you?

143
00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:40.176
Taking a trip on the long weekend?

144
00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:41.676
Well...

145
00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:45.376
Never mind me. I just heard someone was dead.

146
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.376
Calm down, we're about to look into that now.

147
00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:55.076
No one has touched the body, have they?

148
00:09:55.076 --> 00:09:58.576
Well, actually a strange young boy has been hanging around.

149
00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:00.376
A strange young boy?

150
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.776
Cause of death

151
00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:05.476
is probably suffocation due to damage to the cervical pith.

152
00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:07.176
The murder weapon is probably something

153
00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:09.676
with a sharp point like an ice pick.

154
00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:13.176
Before the victim was stabbed,

155
00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:15.276
there's a possibility he was forced to inhale something

156
00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:17.676
knocking him unconscious.

157
00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:20.276
Who would do such a thing?

158
00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.676
We don't know that yet.

159
00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:27.276
But don't worry,

160
00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:29.676
the killer is still flying over the Pacific Ocean

161
00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:32.276
inside this huge metal can,

162
00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:35.076
the killer won't get away.

163
00:10:35.076 --> 00:10:37.476
Hey. Who the heck are you?

164
00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:41.476
That's right.

165
00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:44.276
This is the beginning.

166
00:10:45.876 --> 00:10:49.776
Shinichi Kudo. I'm a detective.

167
00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:53.076
This was Shinichi's first case.

168
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:00.301
Kudo?

169
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:02.701
You couldn't be Yusakuls...

170
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:05.401
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure.

171
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:08.601
You're his son, Shinichi.

172
00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.201
You're the splitting image of your father when he was a boy.

173
00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:16.001
The last time I saw you, you were in the 6th grade.

174
00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:20.001
You certainly have grown.

175
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.501
But that's beside the point.

176
00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:26.601
I'm sure you just became a high school student, didn't you?

177
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:28.801
You shouldn't be disturbing the crime scene.

178
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:32.601
Excuse me, could you borrow someone's camera and bring it here?

179
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.301
I'd like to photograph the crime scene.

180
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:39.001
Well... if it's photos, that boy already took some.

181
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:40.101
He what?

182
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.001
I took about 60 of them.

183
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:45.301
I borrowed a camera from one of the passengers.

184
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:46.501
Also...

185
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:52.201
We did as he asked and kept a close eye on what he did, but...

186
00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:54.101
We didn't notice him hide or wipe anything

187
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.101
or do anything the least bit suspicious.

188
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.701
But if an amateur handles the body,

189
00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:04.001
the stiffened muscles could be damaged

190
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.801
throwing the estimated time of death off.

191
00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:08.901
Based on the condition of the death spots

192
00:12:08.901 --> 00:12:11.601
and the fact that the jaw had started stiffening.

193
00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:14.601
He was dead about 1 or 2 hours.

194
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:17.401
Three things struck me as odd.

195
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:19.901
First, a few drops of blood

196
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:22.401
had flown onto the wall the victim was leaning on,

197
00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:26.201
but the clothing pressed against it wasn't stained.

198
00:12:27.201 --> 00:12:30.701
Second, the scratch-like marks

199
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.501
to the lower right of the fatal wound.

200
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:39.301
Third, and the inside of his left pants pocket was soaked.

201
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:43.901
But the victim's hands were dry.

202
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:45.501
Even if he stuck his wet hands into the pockets,

203
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:47.101
they wouldn't get as wet as that.

204
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:52.001
Which means, someone for some reason wet it deliberately.

205
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:56.901
Listen you! You just keep out of this.

206
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.401
Let the police handle the rest.

207
00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:02.601
Excuse me, please go and wake that fellow

208
00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:04.501
who's sleeping next to my seat.

209
00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:06.201
He's with the police, too.

210
00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:07.401
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:11.101
Come here. What do you mean, "I'm a detective"?

212
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:13.301
You're just a high school student.

213
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:15.301
I didn't have a choice, did I?

214
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:19.001
They wouldn't have let me examine the body if I didn't say that.

215
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.001
The thing is, you shouldn't go off Iike that without telling me.

216
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.201
I was worried that you were the victim.

217
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:27.501
I have no interest in waking a girl who looks like a fool

218
00:13:27.501 --> 00:13:29.901
when she's asleep.

219
00:13:29.901 --> 00:13:32.201
What do you mean looks like a fool?

220
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.901
Like this...

221
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:37.701
Inspector.

222
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:40.101
You're late, Takagi.

223
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:41.701
A murder?

224
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:43.301
Yes.

225
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:46.501
Cause of death is suffocation due to damage to the cervical pith.

226
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:47.801
The murder weapon

227
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:50.901
is something that looks like an ice pick with a pointed tip.

228
00:13:50.901 --> 00:13:53.501
Judging from rigor mortis and the death spots of the body,

229
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:56.201
he's probably been dead about 1-2 hours.

230
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:01.101
An empty bottle and handkerchief.

231
00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:03.901
It seems the killer carried this handkerchief

232
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.501
soaked in something Iike chloroform in this bottle

233
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:09.201
and used it to knock the victim out

234
00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:11.901
just before killing him.

235
00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:13.701
Yes.

236
00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:16.801
Excuse me, I'd like to save the evidence,

237
00:14:16.801 --> 00:14:18.501
may I have a plastic bag or something?

238
00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:21.201
Is something wrong?

239
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:23.701
It's just amazing,

240
00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:27.501
you're doing the same things that young boy did.

241
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.201
What boy?

242
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.101
You know, he was standing in the doorway.

243
00:14:32.101 --> 00:14:34.101
The one in the black sweater.

244
00:14:36.601 --> 00:14:38.201
Who is he?

245
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:40.701
He's the son of a friend of mine,

246
00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:43.701
whenever I got to a dead end on a case, I'd go to my friend,

247
00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:45.701
Who's a mystery writer, for advice.

248
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:48.601
When he was little, he'd come to the crime scene with his father

249
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.301
and wander around.

250
00:14:51.301 --> 00:14:54.101
But who'd have thought he'd acquire enough

251
00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:56.001
to expertly analyze a crime scene.

252
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.301
He's going to be a great help.

253
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:02.701
You fool! He's a civilian.

254
00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.101
He's just a kid in high school

255
00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:06.901
who thinks he's a great detective

256
00:15:06.901 --> 00:15:08.901
because he's read a lot of mysteries and medical books.

257
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:11.901
At any rate, find us some witnesses.

258
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.101
There are 4 suspects.

259
00:15:15.101 --> 00:15:17.201
There were 4 others, excluding the victim,

260
00:15:17.201 --> 00:15:19.701
who were in the toilet at that time.

261
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:22.501
My seat is in the rear of the cabin.

262
00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:24.101
I'd been watching

263
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:27.401
but no one came to the smoking section in the back.

264
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:29.801
That you can be sure of.

265
00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:34.101
You were watching it? Were you up all night?

266
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.901
Well, I couldn't sleep.

267
00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:38.901
Why, for heaven's sake?

268
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:42.001
I thought you fell asleep as soon as we got on the plane.

269
00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:44.701
Is that so?

270
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:48.201
Oh boy, you're like a baby, going to bed early

271
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.401
and getting up in the middle of the night.

272
00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:54.401
Nuts.

273
00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:57.701
How can I sleep with you sleeping so soundly next to me like that?

274
00:15:57.701 --> 00:16:01.201
I'm not all that mature yet.

275
00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:05.201
Alright then. How about telling us who those 4 are?

276
00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:06.901
Sure.

277
00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:11.401
Let's see. Those four people are...

278
00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:17.101
This girl, and the girl next to her.

279
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:20.701
And the man in this seat across the aisle.

280
00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:24.401
And this man in the front seat, these four.

281
00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:28.201
Yes.

282
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:30.501
Wait just a minute.

283
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:32.501
What's going on?

284
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:38.301
Kazuhiro.

285
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:42.301
Why... why...

286
00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:48.101
Tsugumi.

287
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:50.501
Why was Kazuhiro killed?

288
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:52.401
That's what we're trying to find out.

289
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:55.401
Maybe that negative is responsible?

290
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:56.901
Negatives?

291
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.801
He was bragging about it.

292
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:01.001
He said he was going to sell it to a newspaper company

293
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:03.001
and make a lot of money.

294
00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:05.001
Don't tell me they're gone?

295
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:09.001
He didn't have them on him?

296
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:10.801
That can't be...

297
00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:12.701
So that means the killer

298
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:16.601
is someone who knew about the negatives, isn't that right?

299
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:19.801
Everyone in this business knew about it.

300
00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:23.501
He offered to sell them to a lot of newspaper companies.

301
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.301
Hey, officers.

302
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:28.101
Ohtaka was stabbed once in the back of the head, wasn't he?

303
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:31.301
-That's right. -Then the killer's a pro.

304
00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:33.601
Those two are just camerawomen.

305
00:17:33.601 --> 00:17:36.501
You're barking up the wrong tree, suspecting them.

306
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:40.201
No, with a little medical knowledge

307
00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:41.901
about anesthetic and with a murder weapon,

308
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:45.901
anyone could have done it. Even a woman.

309
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:51.501
Now then. Why don't the four of you tell us

310
00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:54.901
what you saw when you went to the toilet?

311
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:58.701
I went to the toilet because I wasn't feeling well,

312
00:17:58.701 --> 00:18:00.701
but when I got back to my seat,

313
00:18:00.701 --> 00:18:03.601
Kazuhiro was still there in his seat.

314
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:09.101
I called the stewardess later to bring me some medicine.

315
00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:12.201
That's why I remember it well.

316
00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:13.301
Is that true?

317
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:17.601
Yes, he was asleep when I saw him.

318
00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:21.101
Yes, I saw her from across the aisle.

319
00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.901
It looked like she was asking for some medicine..

320
00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:26.801
I went to the toilet right after that,

321
00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:30.301
I was in there for about 5 minutes, I guess.

322
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:32.101
You said across the aisle,

323
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:36.401
but isn't your seat facing the same aisle as the victim's seat?

324
00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:38.901
I get restless having to sit still for long periods of time,

325
00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:40.701
so I was walking around.

326
00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:45.301
Then when did the victim leave his seat?

327
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:50.301
When I brought the water and pills, he was already gone.

328
00:18:50.301 --> 00:18:54.701
I don't think it took me more than a minute to bring them to her.

329
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:59.001
I went to the toilet after Tsugumi got her medicine

330
00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:02.201
and I guess it was 20 minutes later

331
00:19:02.201 --> 00:19:07.401
that I noticed Kazuhiro still hadn't come back, so I went to check.

332
00:19:07.401 --> 00:19:10.401
But he was still alive then.

333
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:15.401
Well, I knocked on this door and asked if he was alright

334
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:17.601
and he knocked back.

335
00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:19.401
Are you sure?

336
00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:21.601
But how did you know it was him?

337
00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:22.901
It had to be.

338
00:19:22.901 --> 00:19:27.901
I opened the other three doors and they were unoccupied.

339
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:31.101
So he's the only one left.

340
00:19:31.101 --> 00:19:33.201
When did you go to the toilets?

341
00:19:33.201 --> 00:19:37.101
Sorry, I don't remember, unfortunately.

342
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:41.601
He said he doesn't remember.

343
00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:43.901
I guess it's only natural...

344
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:46.201
What's wrong?

345
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.701
That man's cologne is so strong...

346
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:52.601
Oh, come on, how much longer are you going to keep asking

347
00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:54.001
those meaningless questions?

348
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:56.601
Whoever has the weapon is the killer, right?

349
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:59.601
Then, wouldn't it be quicker

350
00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:02.701
to do a search of their things and their bodies?

351
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:06.401
This has nothing to do with me though since I was asleep

352
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:08.401
and didn't go to the toilet.

353
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:11.501
You're lying. I saw you leave your seat.

354
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:12.601
What?

355
00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:16.001
Your seat is directly behind the victim's, isn't it?

356
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:17.501
What are you talking about?

357
00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:19.801
Remember? I told you when I went to the toilet,

358
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.901
the victim was still asleep in his seat.

359
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:27.201
Well, I'm positive this man's seat was empty.

360
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:30.101
Hey, old man, don't lie.

361
00:20:30.101 --> 00:20:32.701
You four were the ones who went to the toilet,

362
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.601
he just said so.

363
00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:36.001
Right, kid?

364
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.601
Yes, well...

365
00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:40.601
What's the matter? Don't be vague.

366
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:46.001
Now that I think about it. I think I was distracted for a second.

367
00:20:46.001 --> 00:20:49.401
At any rate, you five are considered suspects,

368
00:20:49.401 --> 00:20:50.701
so we will search your luggage,

369
00:20:50.701 --> 00:20:53.901
and you will undergo a body check in the toilet.

370
00:20:57.001 --> 00:20:58.401
What?

371
00:20:58.401 --> 00:21:02.801
You didn't find the weapon on them or their luggage?

372
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:07.201
No. None of them had anything Iike an icepick.

373
00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:11.101
To be on the safe side, we're searching places in the plane

374
00:21:11.101 --> 00:21:12.501
that it could be hidden in.

375
00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:15.701
Hey. You're positive these people were the only ones

376
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.601
who went to the toilet, aren't you?

377
00:21:17.601 --> 00:21:22.001
Shinichi, answer him. Shinichi!

378
00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:28.001
This is getting interesting.

379
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:32.401
If they can't find the weapon in the plane,

380
00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:36.001
that means the killer still has it somewhere.

381
00:21:36.001 --> 00:21:38.601
I'll bet that's the killer's trump card.

382
00:21:40.401 --> 00:21:42.101
I'll find it.

383
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:44.101
I'll get that trump card.

384
00:21:44.101 --> 00:21:48.101
Before this huge metal bird rests its wings.

385
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:57.431
What?

386
00:21:57.431 --> 00:21:59.931
You want us to look again?

387
00:21:59.931 --> 00:22:05.231
You want us to do another body check and go through their luggage

388
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:07.031
one more time?

389
00:22:07.031 --> 00:22:10.031
Is that what you're saying, Shinichi?

390
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:11.431
Yes.

391
00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:15.131
If you couldn't find the weapon in the cabin,

392
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:19.031
the killer could still have it in their possession.

393
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:20.131
Inspector Megure.

394
00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:25.831
First, Miss Tachikawa's bag.

395
00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:27.231
Passport, wallet,

396
00:22:27.231 --> 00:22:29.131
handkerchief and cosmetics.

397
00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:30.731
Tissue and her boarding pass.

398
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:32.331
Sunglasses, camera,

399
00:22:32.331 --> 00:22:34.031
notepad and a ballpoint pen.

400
00:22:35.331 --> 00:22:38.531
That's it. Nothing resembling a weapon is in here.

401
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.031
How about that pen?

402
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:44.031
Did you check inside the pen?

403
00:22:44.031 --> 00:22:45.831
Of course.

404
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:49.931
Alright then, next is Miss Amano.

405
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:50.931
Yes.

406
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:53.131
Passport, wallet,

407
00:22:53.131 --> 00:22:55.431
handkerchief, knit hat

408
00:22:55.431 --> 00:22:59.431
boading pass, camera, cosmetics and a sewing set,

409
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:02.031
a few motion sickness pills.

410
00:23:02.031 --> 00:23:03.431
The only sharp instrument

411
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:07.431
would be the tiny sewing scissors and needles in this.

412
00:23:07.431 --> 00:23:10.931
But you couldn't kill anyone like that with these, it's impossible.

413
00:23:12.331 --> 00:23:13.731
Next.

414
00:23:13.731 --> 00:23:15.631
Mr. Ukai.

415
00:23:15.631 --> 00:23:17.031
Yes, sir.

416
00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:18.731
Passport and boarding pass,

417
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.331
wallet, handkerchief,

418
00:23:20.331 --> 00:23:21.731
razor, towel,

419
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:24.031
and shavin cream.

420
00:23:24.031 --> 00:23:26.731
Next is Mr. Edward.

421
00:23:27.831 --> 00:23:30.531
Let us check your belongings just in case.

422
00:23:30.531 --> 00:23:33.031
Well, if you must, you must...

423
00:23:33.031 --> 00:23:35.031
He'll cooperate.

424
00:23:35.031 --> 00:23:36.231
Go ahead.

425
00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:44.031
That's strange.

426
00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:48.031
The cologne on his neck was very strong

427
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:50.231
but he doesn't have any on his hands?

428
00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:53.331
Passport, wallet,

429
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.931
handkerchief, boarding pass,

430
00:23:54.931 --> 00:23:56.531
towel, newspaper,

431
00:23:56.531 --> 00:23:59.131
two paperback books, glasses box,

432
00:23:59.131 --> 00:24:00.531
sewing set,

433
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:03.731
American National Bank chequebook.

434
00:24:03.731 --> 00:24:05.731
Excuse me, Mr. Edward,

435
00:24:05.731 --> 00:24:07.331
could you explain this chequebook...

436
00:24:09.331 --> 00:24:11.331
Mr. Edward, I would like to ask you a few questions

437
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:15.331
about the chequebook in your briefcase.

438
00:24:15.331 --> 00:24:18.731
It's for my job, I intended to buy some art objects

439
00:24:18.731 --> 00:24:22.631
at an auction in Japan, but nothing caught my eye.

440
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:26.131
He said he was going to buy some art objects

441
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.431
sold at an auction here in Japan,

442
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:30.731
but since he didn't find anything interesting, he stopped payment.

443
00:24:30.731 --> 00:24:33.031
I see.

444
00:24:33.031 --> 00:24:34.831
Alright, the last.

445
00:24:34.831 --> 00:24:35.931
Here.

446
00:24:37.531 --> 00:24:39.131
I'm the last one.

447
00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:42.131
Passport, wallet,

448
00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:44.331
handkerchief, camera and negatives.

449
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:45.931
Wristwatch, cigarettes,

450
00:24:45.931 --> 00:24:49.631
lighter and boarding pass, medicine for air sickness.

451
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:53.731
You seem to have a lot of medicine.

452
00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:56.031
I get air sick very easily.

453
00:24:56.031 --> 00:24:58.431
Both Chizuru and Tsugumi gave me some.

454
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.231
-Right? -Yes.

455
00:25:00.231 --> 00:25:03.031
May I see these negatives for a little while?

456
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:10.131
Why you...

457
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:12.431
The man in this picture.

458
00:25:12.431 --> 00:25:16.431
Isn't it Mr. Dickson, the American senator?

459
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.531
Why you're right. He's with a woman in this picture.

460
00:25:19.531 --> 00:25:21.631
-Hey. That's enough -Wait a minute,

461
00:25:21.631 --> 00:25:23.931
those are the same as Kazuhiro's.

462
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:26.131
The same, you mean...

463
00:25:26.131 --> 00:25:29.731
And if they're in your possession. That means...

464
00:25:29.731 --> 00:25:32.731
No, no. Wait.

465
00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:36.131
These are definitely mine.

466
00:25:36.131 --> 00:25:37.731
Ohtaka and I were staked out at the hotel together,

467
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:39.031
we both took those photos.

468
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:40.331
They're...

469
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.731
not as good as Ohtaka's

470
00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:46.731
but I was going to a newspaper in Los Angeles

471
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:50.631
and sell my pictures, too.

472
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:54.631
Besides, you should find the weapon before accusing me.

473
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:58.131
Now, we'll listen to all your complaints

474
00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:00.131
after the body check.

475
00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:02.131
Now, ladies and gentlemen, just like before,

476
00:26:02.131 --> 00:26:03.631
I want you to come to the toilet one by one.

477
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:04.931
The women will be examined by the stewardess

478
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:07.431
and we will examine the men.

479
00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:14.631
So this is where the victim sat.

480
00:26:15.931 --> 00:26:18.131
According to the seat numbers on the boarding pass,

481
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:22.031
Mr. Washinuma was behind him and Mr. Crow in the front.

482
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:25.631
Miss Amano to the right and Miss Tachikawa on the inside.

483
00:26:25.631 --> 00:26:28.931
And across the aisle to the left is Mr. Ukai.

484
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:36.431
Why this is.

485
00:26:36.431 --> 00:26:38.731
A piece of a negative.

486
00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:41.831
What is something like this doing beside Mr. Wshinuma's seat?

487
00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:43.831
Shinichi.

488
00:26:44.931 --> 00:26:47.731
They're done with the body checks.

489
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:51.531
It seems no one had the weapon.

490
00:26:51.531 --> 00:26:54.331
Which means that's the only answer...

491
00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:57.631
There, you see. We didn't have the weapon.

492
00:26:57.631 --> 00:26:59.831
I had to undress twice.

493
00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:01.631
I don't want to go through this again.

494
00:27:02.631 --> 00:27:05.031
What shall we do, inspector?

495
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:09.631
We've searched everywhere.

496
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:11.331
No, not quite everywhere.

497
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:12.431
What?

498
00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:15.531
There's still one place we haven't searched.

499
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:20.131
Inside the victim's bags.
