00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.770
Iori.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.820
Could we listen to that again
to confirm what he said?

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.430
Of course, Momiji-ojosama.

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.440
Do you really mean that, Heiji-kun?

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.120
Don't make me say it again!

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.460
If anything like that ever happens,
I'll do whatever you want!

7
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.610
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.140
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.250
Momiji issues a mystery solving battle!

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.480
The treasure's location is written in code!

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440
Always determining the one truth

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.210
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.840
his name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.480
Ooka Momiji's Challenge
(Part One)

15
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050

"Ooka Momiji's Challenge, Part One!"

16
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.000

18
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.710
Mori Detective Agency
I'm home.

19
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.250
I'm home.

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What should I make for dinner?

21
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.660
I already spent a lot this
month, so I need to save money.

22
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.060
Jingisukan Beika
Coupon

23
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.310
Jingisukan Beika
Coupon
A coupon for jingisukan.

24
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.430
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

25
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.120
We can build up our strength
to fight the summer heat.

26
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.540

Dear Mori Ran-sama, This is Ooka Momiji.
I apologize for the sudden message,
but I'd like Kudo Shinichi-kun,
whom I met in Kyoto, to decipher
a code for me. I've sent you a picture of the code.

The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother

39
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.970
"A housekeeper who worked for a wealthy man

40
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.600
for many years passed away at
his mansion the other day."

41
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.400
"Just before she died, she sent
this code to her four sons."

42
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.480
Apparently she wanted to
leave the incredible treasure

43
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.610
her employer gave her to her sons.

44
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.340
She loved mysteries and sent each
of her sons a different code,

45
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.620
so they'd have to work together
to find the treasure.

46
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.730
However, after the brothers shared
their codes with each other,

47
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.630
correspondence from the
eldest son suddenly stopped.

48
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.260
Believing the eldest brother may
have already solved the code,

49
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.740
and encountered some kind of trouble
at the treasure's location,

50
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.490
the three brothers reached out
to the wealthy man's family.

51
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.250
As the Ooka family has a
relationship with them,

52
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.870
the family reached out to us
to ask us to decipher the code.

53
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.870
I heard Kudo Shinichi-kun is a
famous high school detective.

54
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.930
I wanted to message him directly, but
I don't have his contact information,

55
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.910
so I messaged you instead
since we exchanged numbers.

56
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.220
I happen to have plans to go to Tokyo today.
I'll fill you
in on the details today at 4PM
on the Haido Chuo Building roof.
Best regards, Ooka Momiji

57
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.350

60
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.520
That's only three hours from now!

61
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.340
I need to call Shinichi right away.

62
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.980
But I'm still too embarrassed
to speak to him directly...

63
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.570
Mori Detective Agency

64
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.330
Mori Detective Agency
I guess I can text him.

65
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.230
Mori Detective Agency
I have to send him the code anyway.

66
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.360
Summer vacation starts tomorrow!

67
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.600
Let's play tons of games
at the professor's house!

68
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.850
Yeah!

69
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.370
Let's enjoy our vacation!

70
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.120
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother

71
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.800
Conan-kun.

72
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.540
Huh?

73
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.410
Quit scowling and play games with us.

74
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.670
Yeah, sure.

75
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.160
It's all right.

76
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.170
He's currently engrossed in another game.

77
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.760
The game of deciphering a code.

78
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.180
Yeah, I guess.

79
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.620
Where'd you get that code?

80
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.550
Ran sent it to me.

81
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.770
Sounds like there's a story behind it.

82
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.930
Have you solved it yet?

83
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.690
No, I still have no idea.

84
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.840
What's wrong, Genta-kun?

85
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.010
Are you itchy?

86
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.810
I suddenly started feeling itchy
after eating these crackers.

87
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.320
They're ordinary shrimp-flavored crackers.

88
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.200
Kojima-kun, do you ever feel itchy
after touching shrimp or crab?

89
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.490
Huh? Everyone gets itchy from peeling shrimp.

90
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.460
Right?

91
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.050
No, not at all.

92
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.380
I don't get itchy.

93
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.780
Kojima-kun, you might be
allergic to shellfish.

94
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.880
You shouldn't eat any more of those crackers.

95
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.130
What? But I love these!

96
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.640
No eating them!

97
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.850
How many did you eat?

98
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.660
First I had three, then I had two more.

99
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.110
Since one was taken from me
just now, I've only eaten four.

100
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.840
Sounds like your addition and subtraction
abilities need fixing, too.

101
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.660
Addition and subtraction...

102
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.700
What?

103
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.700
Uh, nothing.

104
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.460
Mori Detective Agency

105
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.960
Shinichi still hasn't responded yet.

106
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.220
I have to start heading to the Haido Chuo
Building soon or I won't make it in time.

107
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.010
Maybe I'll call him after all.

108
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.930
I'm home.

109
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.140
Welcome back.

110
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.600
Shinichi-niichan called me.

111
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.600
What?

112
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.420
He said he's too busy to go to the Haido Chuo
Building, so he asked me to go with you instead.

113
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.360
I'll go put my backpack away.

114
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.870
Okay...

115
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.990
Why did he call Conan-kun instead of me?

116
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.390
Maybe Shinichi's too embarrassed
to call me directly, too.

117
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.740
That tall building is the
Haido Chuo Building, right?

118
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.760
Yeah.

119
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:39.360
Excuse me. You're Kudo Shinichi-sama's
companion Ran Mori-sama, aren't you?

120
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.900
Come in.

121
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.770
Thank you.

122
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.990
Hattori-kun and Kazuha-chan?

123
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.740
What are you two doing here?

124
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.910
I could ask you the same thing.

125
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.880
Did Momiji invite you here, too?

126
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.280
Yeah, she did.

127
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.410
Does that mean Momiji asked
Kudo-kun to solve a code?

128
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.040
Yeah, she did.

129
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.690
I knew it!

130
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.460
Which means this is a contest
between me and Kudo.

131
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.300
What's going on?

132
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.320
This afternoon, at our school gate...

133
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.960
3 Hours Earlier...

134
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.390
3 Hours Earlier...
It's finally over.

135
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.500
3 Hours Earlier...
Heiji-kun.

136
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.810
3 Hours Earlier...

137
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.320
Congratulations on finishing
your first semester.

138
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.270
It's you, Momiji.

139
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.820
What's up?

140
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.030
I'd like you to do something
for me, Heiji-kun.

141
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.360
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother

142
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.080
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother
I see.

143
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.710
I bet you're worried something might've
happened to the eldest brother who solved the code,

144
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.960
so you want me to solve it
and go check things out.

145
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.160
But the eldest brother probably
ran off with the treasure

146
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.350
so he could keep it to himself,
so there's no point in solving this.

147
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.400
I see.

148
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.850
So you can't solve it either.

149
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.810
I didn't say that!

150
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.360
I could solve this thing faster than anyone!

151
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.860
Anyone?

152
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.740
If there's a high school student
who can solve this code before you,

153
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.370
will you do me a favor?

154
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.450
Sure, fine.

155
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.990
Heiji!

156
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.410
Do you really mean that, Heiji-kun?

157
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.580
Don't make me say it again!

158
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.750
If anything like that ever happens,
I'll do whatever you want!

159
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.880
Iori.

160
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.250
Yes, miss. I recorded the audio.

161
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.760
I'll do whatever you want!

162
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:46.220
I'll fill you in on the details today
at 4PM on the Haido Chuo Building roof.

163
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.080
4PM? That's just three hours from now!

164
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.720
Hey, Momiji!

165
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.690
It's all right.

166
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.490
We've already acquired
tickets to Haneda for you.

167
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.910
That's not the problem here.

168
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.200
It's up to you whether
or not you want to come.

169
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.540
But understand that if you don't,
it will mean Momiji-ojosama wins.

170
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.100
After he said that, we flew here in a hurry.

171
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.660
Isn't that a bad thing?

172
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.300
Doesn't Momiji-san have
feelings for Hattori-kun?

173
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.500
Exactly. She'll obviously
ask Heiji to marry her.

174
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.810
Heiji said she probably wants to play karuta
with him again like when they were kids, but...

175
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:35.570
I see. I was wondering why she asked
Shinichi instead of Hattori-kun.

176
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:41.070
Anyway, Ran-chan, I hate to
ask you to do this, but...

177
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.240
Could you ask Kudo-kun to
let Heiji win this time?

178
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.740
Little Miss Leaf, don't you think
that would be against the rules?

179
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.330
Th-That's Momiji's voice.

180
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.790
Where are you?

181
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.870
Kazuha-chan.

182
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.960
There's something on your
collar. It looks like a brooch.

183
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.280
A mic and speaker?

184
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.640
He must've stuck it on me then!

185
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.360
Hey, Momiji!

186
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.220
It's all right.

187
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.600
Momiji's butler must've secretly
attached it to me then!

188
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.280
Momiji, you're listening, aren't you?!

189
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.400
Quit sneaking around and show yourself!

190
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.670
In that case, perhaps I shall.

191
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.270
Come on, Momiji!

192
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.590
H-Hey, Kazuha-chan.

193
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:31.160
Isn't this circle drawn on the floor...?

194
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.070
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

195
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.070
I am Ooka Momiji.

196
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.920
Skip the formal greeting.

197
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.240
Fill us in on those details you promised us.

198
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.250
Those details are only
a few additional words.

199
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.500
The message "From your football-loving
mother" was written on the code,

200
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.790
but she apparently never
watched a football,

201
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.870
or in other words, a soccer
game once in her life.

202
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.500
Sh-She'd never seen...

203
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.150
...a soccer game?

204
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.400
Which means we should
focus our attention on...

205
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.650
...the word "football" at the end of the code.

206
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.450
In the first three codes, the characters
spelling "foot" are a little thicker.

207
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.160
In the first three codes, the characters
spelling "foot" are a little thicker.
Football
Football
Football

208
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.580
But in the final code, the "ba"
are a little thicker.

209
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.770
But in the final code, the "ba"
are a little thicker.
Football

210
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.160
Football

211
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:55.960
Why?

212
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.300
Huh? I don't see Kudo Shinichi-kun.

213
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.300
What happened to him?

214
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:09.180
I sent him the pictures of the code,
but he said he was too busy to come,

215
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.060
so Conan-kun and I came in his place.

216
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:19.690
But doesn't Kudo-kun's absence give
Heiji-kun a significant advantage?

217
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:25.270
It'll be fine. I'm on a call
with Shinichi-niichan right now.

218
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.070
Seriously, why Conan-kun?

219
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.830
Fine, then.

220
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.420
Now that you have all the information
you need to solve the code,

221
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.290
ready, go!

222
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.300
Please let me know once
you've solved the code.

223
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:49.450
Whoever tells me the answer
first will be the winner.

224
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:56.310
I'd like to remind you that a man's
safety depends on you solving this code.

225
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.490
We'd like you to solve it
as quickly as possible.

226
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.820
Additionally, in the event that
Hattori-sama loses to Kudo-sama,

227
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.130
don't forget that Hattori-sama has agreed

228
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.320
to fulfill a request from Momiji-ojosama.

229
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.340
Yeah, I know.

230
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.330
Hattori, what's this about a request?

231
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.730
I'm sure it's no big deal.
Don't worry about it.

232
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.920
Oh, really?

233
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.420
In that case, everyone, shall
we get something to eat?

234
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.440
After all, they say you can't
fight on an empty stomach.

235
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.160
But, Momiji-san, why are we starting in Tokyo?

236
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.890
Because before her death, the
housekeeper who made the code

237
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.980
was working at a wealthy man's mansion
located in Tokyo's Haido City.

238
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:49.370
I thought the treasure she received from
her master must be in Tokyo as well.

239
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.990
Wouldn't it be hidden at the mansion, then?

240
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:58.000
Since it would inconvenience her master
to have her sons search his mansion,

241
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.500
the housekeeper's letter said
the treasure wasn't there.

242
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.500
Then maybe it's at the home of
that housekeeper and her sons.

243
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.590
They sold their home when the
housekeeper's husband passed away,

244
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.730
and it's no longer there.

245
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.060
After that, she put her sons up for adoption

246
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.390
and began working as a live-in
housekeeper at the mansion.

247
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.710
After the four sons were
separated as children,

248
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.930
they apparently haven't met once in 30 years.

249
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.280
Huh.

250
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.340
I heard only their mother the housekeeper

251
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.790
and the eldest son exchanged messages
with the three younger brothers.

252
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.260
Then maybe some bad guy who
heard about the treasure

253
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.840
pretended to be one of the
brothers so he could swipe it?

254
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.300
I wouldn't worry about that.

255
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.710
Apparently the four brothers

256
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.550
have a rather obvious mark
on the palms of their hands.

257
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.430
An obvious...

258
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.770
...mark?

259
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.250
It's a burn scar from when the
four brothers were children.

260
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.390
A burn?

261
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.820
All four brothers?

262
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:12.050
Supposedly they were protecting
their mother from a serious burn.

263
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.180
Huh.

264
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.820
Sounds like an honorable injury, then.

265
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.210
Excuse me, Ran-sama.

266
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.830
Yes?

267
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:25.100
Forgive me, but we've been walking
for ten minutes and 30 seconds.

268
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.640
Have we still not arrived at our destination?

269
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.840
We should be there soon.

270
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.110
When I went with some friends the
other day, it was really good.

271
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.840
That's it right there.

272
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.850
That pancake shop.

273
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.410
That store's pancakes are really good.

274
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.540
But there's a huge line.

275
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.850
Tokyoites are so patient.

276
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.860
We sure are.

277
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.060
It's normal to wait an hour
in line at a popular shop.

278
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.310
No, Ran-chan. That's an insult
coming from a Kyoto woman.

279
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.860
Huh?

280
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.170
What she actually means is, "look at
these idle people wasting their time."

281
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.460
What?

282
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.120
It's not an insult.

283
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.000
I'm dropping a hint so she can figure
it out herself before she gets hurt.

284
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.380
That's even more hurtful.

285
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.730
If only they'd add the time spent in
line plus the fatigue from standing

286
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.390
and subtract that from the food's price.

287
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.480
Add...

288
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.030
And subtract...

289
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.520
Haido Harbor Warehouse 4!

290
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.330
What?

291
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.100
That's where the treasure
is, Shinichi-niichan?

292
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.360
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

293
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:35.110
The key to solving the code was
in the word football after all.

294
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.160
In the first three codes, the
characters spelling foot were bolded.

295
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.910
In the first three codes, the
characters spelling foot were bolded.
Football

296
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.790
Football
The character for foot can also mean add.

297
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:41.990
Football
The character for foot can also mean add.
"Foot (Ashi)"

298
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.290
The character for foot can also mean add.
"Foot (Ashi)"

299
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:43.500
The character for foot can also mean add.
"Foot (Ashi)"
"Add (Tase)"

300
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.120
The character for foot can also mean add.
"Add (Tase)"

301
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.720
When you lay the three codes over each other,

302
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.610
they form a series of odd characters.

303
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.550
But I can't read what it says.

304
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.050
That's why you need the
arrows from the fourth code.

305
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.550
In the fourth code, the characters
spelling ball are bolded.

306
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.560
In the fourth code, the characters
spelling ball are bolded.
Football

307
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:03.620
In the fourth code, the characters
spelling ball are bolded.
Ball

308
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.280
Ball
Ba sounds like bow here, so
you're meant to subtract.

309
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.180
Ba sounds like bow here, so
you're meant to subtract.
Bow

310
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.560
Ba sounds like bow here, so
you're meant to subtract.
Subtract

311
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.310
Subtract
Which means we have to erase the
arrows from the odd characters

312
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.530
Which means we have to erase the
arrows from the odd characters
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother

313
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.570
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother
made from overlaying the first three codes,

314
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:13.650
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother
which turns them into characters we can read.

315
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.820
The treasure is here!
From your football-loving mother
which turns them into characters we can read.
Haido kou no dai 4 souko (Haido Harbor Warehouse 4)

316
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.980
That's what Shinichi-niichan said.

317
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.520
Huh.

318
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.570
You're right.

319
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.580
It says, "Haido Harbor Warehouse 4."

320
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:31.280
In other words, we'll find the treasure
if we go to Warehouse 4 at Haido Harbor.

321
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.180
Since both of them solved
it at the same time,

322
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.070
doesn't that mean there's
no winner of this contest?

323
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.220
Are you sure?

324
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.950
If Kudo-sama told Conan-sama the
answer after solving the code,

325
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.480
and Conan-sama then explained it to us,

326
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.040
then doesn't that mean Kudo-sama solved
it slightly sooner than Hattori-sama

327
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.980
who explained the solution
after solving it himself?

328
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.990
You're right! Excellent observation, Iori!

329
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.140
No way. As soon as he
solved the code, Kudo—

330
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.910
Yeah. I think Shinichi-niichan
solved it a little quicker than—

331
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.130
Watch it, Kudo! I'll expose
your true identity for real!

332
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.580
I'm kidding.

333
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.130
I unintentionally spoke at the same time as
Hattori-niichan because his shouting surprised me,

334
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.210
but they solved it at
basically the same time.

335
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.260
That's a problem.

336
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.470
Then how about this?

337
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.240
We'll head to Warehouse 4 at Haido Harbor.

338
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.470
Whoever determines why correspondence from

339
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.730
the eldest brother suddenly
stopped will be the winner.

340
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.480
What's with you guys, anyway?

341
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.480
You didn't have these cars ready because
you expected this to happen, did you?

342
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.490
The car behind us the girls are
riding in is yours, too, right?

343
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.240
That will be revealed in due time.

344
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.620
Hey, Momiji.

345
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.500
It's a good thing the boys solved
the code so quickly this time,

346
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.750
but what were you going to do if they couldn't
solve it after you came all the way to Tokyo?

347
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.130
I don't know. What would I have done?

348
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.640
You hadn't thought about that?

349
00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:04.850
Haido Harbor

350
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.140
Haido Harbor
Ah, you solved the code, did you?

351
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.420
Allow me to show you to Warehouse 4.

352
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.190
I see.

353
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.150
So you were told to escort
people to the warehouse

354
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.280
if they made it here
and showed you the code.

355
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.150
Yes.

356
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.130
Did someone besides us show up?

357
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.910
A man with a beard showed
up early this morning.

358
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.980
After him, another man showed up.

359
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.410
And just now, two men showed
up one after another.

360
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.610
Four people came here?

361
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.350
Maybe it was the four brothers.

362
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.860
Yeah. They must've all solved the code.

363
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.300
We're here.

364
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.370
That's Warehouse 4.

365
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.060
Hello. Anyone here?

366
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.800
Seriously? If you're here,
you should've said...

367
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.250
What's going on here?! Explain!

368
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.920
I-I don't know.

369
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.820
I came here at my brother's instructions
and found him like this.

370
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.820
I also came here because I received
a message from my brother.

371
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.330
M-Me, too.

372
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:17.330
Then you guys must be three of four brothers
who received a code from their mother.

373
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.880
Which means the dead guy
is the eldest brother.

374
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.640
Who are you people?

375
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:31.510
We were hired to solve the code in order
to confirm the well-being of your brother.

376
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.870
Oh, right.

377
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.170
Mom worked as a housekeeper.

378
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.770
You're connected to the mansion somehow.

379
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.270
Do you have any idea why your
brother ended up like this?

380
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.540
He probably lost his footing up there.

381
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.440
And then fell to his death.

382
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.500
We don't know if it was an
accident or suicide, though.

383
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.930
Has anyone touched the body?

384
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.040
No, we haven't.

385
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.290
Then this wasn't an accident or a suicide.

386
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.040
It was a murder.

387
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.300
What?

388
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.560
And it seems like one of you
three brothers is the culprit.

389
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.740
This is hardly the time for a contest.

390
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.220
Yeah.

391
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.310
No.

392
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:22.000
Wouldn't whoever arrives at the truth
behind this case be the winner?

All three of them claim they came here
because their murdered eldest brother texted them.

Normally you'd assume whoever arrived first
pushed the eldest brother and killed him.

This is a ridiculous contest
I've gotten caught up in!

417
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.320
Don't miss the next episode.
I'm the one who should be saying that.

Don't miss the next episode.
