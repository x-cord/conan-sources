1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,840
Today's stage is set at a candy house.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,540
The trick is a sugary, sweet, simple trap.

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,640
Once you get in, there's no way out.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,840
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,825
It only costs 500 yen to get in to the museum.

8
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:10,225
And what's more surprising is you can eat Ecriture's cake at half price!

9
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,725
You going to regret it for the rest of your life

10
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,525
if you miss this opportunity!

11
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:18,325
Wait, Sonoko! The cake isn't gonna run away!

12
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:20,225
Well, I want to run away.

13
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,025
Here! It's here!

14
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:26,125
"Ecriture"

15
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,225
Now, let's go! Ran!

16
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,625
Sonoko.

17
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,325
Come on, Ran! And you too, kid!

18
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,125
Now, hurry up...

19
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:42,025
Isn't it just like the candy house in "Hansel and Gretel"?

20
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,625
It's all made of cake and candies?

21
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,725
I can't believe it!

22
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:51,425
Look how many sweets are here.

23
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:52,425
All right!

24
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,925
Now, the morning part begins!

25
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,425
What do you mean "the morning part"?

26
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,825
Ran, do you know?

27
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,725
This event is has two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

28
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,025
I guess Sonoko wants to eat now,

29
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,225
just to get her stomach ready for the afternoon.

30
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,525
No way. I really want to go home.

31
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:18,925
"The Witch in a Candy House"

32
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,925
So each patissier has his own booth?

33
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:26,225
Which one I should start off with?

34
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,925
The person in this photo...

35
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,125
Isn't he that man over there.

36
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:14,925
My god.

37
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,825
How can he make three cakes at the same time?

38
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:23,025
"Tsuyoshi Maeda (28), Patissier"

39
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,225
This is like fighting rather than cooking.

40
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:27,125
Oh, you didn't know?

41
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,825
He is actually called Fighting Patissier by people.

42
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:33,225
So he is the one in the "Iron Patissier"?

43
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:37,025
Right. The patissier in the middle with the elegant move

44
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,425
"Yasou Fujino (30)" -is the Prince of Sweets.

45
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:41,225
See the patissier in the back?

46
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:43,525
She makes candies just like magic,

47
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:45,525
"Yumi Morimoto (26)" -so people call her Candy Magician.

48
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,725
He is like an idol.

49
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,125
Would you like to make one?

50
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,725
What? Me?

51
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:16,125
Yes...

52
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,825
Come on. I will help you.

53
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,025
It sounds fun. Do it, Conan.

54
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,525
No, I'm okay.

55
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,425
Here...

56
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,225
Yes...

57
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,625
-Don't worry. It's simple. -Excuse me!

58
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,925
-No. Ran, why don't you try? -Yes...

59
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,025
Yes.

60
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,725
-Me? No, I'm okay. -Yes...

61
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:36,825
It's not like we came here everyday. You go ahead and do it.

62
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,725
It's the last part.

63
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,325
Everybody can do it.

64
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,625
I will give you this one after it's done.

65
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:50,225
All you need to do is put the chocolate cream on the roll cake.

66
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,425
Make it thick.

67
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,925
Then, make tree patterns with this fork.

68
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,025
Now, try it.

69
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,225
With a fork?

70
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,525
If you want to be popular with girls these days,

71
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,925
you gotta learn to make cake

72
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:18,325
I think that's pretty good.

73
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:19,825
Right, Sonoko?

74
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:22,625
I guess so.

75
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,825
She's still upset.

76
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:28,025
I will finish the rest so I can give this to you.

77
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:30,025
Are you going to stay here for the afternoon too?

78
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:33,025
Oh, yes! Of course! Right?

79
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,125
Yes.

80
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,525
These candies look so alive, right?

81
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,625
As expected of the Candy Magician.

82
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,025
Looks like glass art, isn't it?

83
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,725
Thank you!

84
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,525
This kind of invisible feel is the real magic behind the taste.

85
00:06:58,525 --> 00:06:59,625
Here you go!

86
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,425
Pretty candy tastes better.

87
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:10,025
It's my dream to win a contest with these candies someday.

88
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,025
Miss, this is tasty!

89
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,325
Thank you!

90
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,125
I don't know which to choose.

91
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,425
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,525
It's simple. Eat them all.

93
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,625
All of it?

94
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,325
Here! Hold this, will you?

95
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,425
We'll have this first.

96
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,125
This one too.

97
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,225
This one.

98
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:46,725
And this one...

99
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,825
You want me to get something for you too, kid?

100
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:51,625
No. I'm okay!

101
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,425
I will get it myself.

102
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:55,725
Okay.

103
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,625
Then, I'm gonna get some more.

104
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,525
Dangerous...

105
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,125
Are you ok?

106
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,325
"Sachiko Hashigaki (45)" -I'm sorry!

107
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,825
I'm so sorry.

108
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:19,625
I just ruined your cake.

109
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,725
Doesn't matter as long as it tastes good.

110
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:22,725
Well, it does matter.

111
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,525
How it looks and how it's made.

112
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,025
Looks really matter when it comes to today's sweets.

113
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,425
You can eat everything.

114
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,325
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

115
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,225
Hey, Maeda.

116
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,625
Why can't you act more sociable?

117
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,425
Why don't you learn something from Fujino?

118
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:55,125
If greeting people can make things taste better,

119
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,525
I'll do that as much as you want me to.

120
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,425
Hold on. You're still able to eat?

121
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:04,525
Of course.

122
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:07,125
Conan. What took you so long to pick your cake?

123
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,225
Ah, well...

124
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,325
All right!

125
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,525
I'm ready for the second round!

126
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,125
Well, I'm getting thirsty.

127
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,125
I'll get something to drink.

128
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,425
-I'll go with you, Conan. -Okay.

129
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,725
Then can you get me one too, please?

130
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:28,325
No sweets for a while, seriously.

131
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,825
Shinichi would say something like,

132
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:34,025
"What have you been eating while I was away?"

133
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,225
I wouldn't say anything like that.

134
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,925
Why would I?

135
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,025
I'm a chef and not a magician!

136
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:46,525
That's the way it is because that's what the customers want.

137
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,525
Please judge it based on taste!

138
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,625
You're so naive.

139
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,225
Do you know how many fantastic sweets exist in this world?

140
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,025
Cake and chocolates are dominating the sweets scene,

141
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:58,825
but your candies have got really popular because of my marketing skills,

142
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:00,325
and not because of how they taste!

143
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,125
When I came here yesterday,

144
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,225
there was no "Wood Chocolate Cake making trial".

145
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:16,225
You're so lucky!

146
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,625
What? You came here yesterday too?

147
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,625
No wonder you know so much about this place!

148
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,625
There you are.

149
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,125
I've been looking for you.

150
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,225
Here!

151
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,525
You know, it's the Wood Chocolate Cake you made.

152
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:28,725
How is it?

153
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:34,725
It's been nicely fixed.

154
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,125
Without the decorations,

155
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,625
it's just the same as the one in the store, isn't it?

156
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,925
It looks so delicious!

157
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:03,025
Oh my God.

158
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:20,288
"Ecriture" -The morning part of the event was finished past 12 pm.

159
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,388
And the dead body was found around 12:30 pm.

160
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:25,988
And where were you guys during that time?

161
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:28,088
I was in the kitchen making candies for the afternoon.

162
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,888
I was there alone since I let the cashiers out for lunch.

163
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:35,488
I went out to give them a cake after I was done with it.

164
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:39,388
Okay. So, you saw Ms. Hashigaki.

165
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,688
What was she doing?

166
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:44,188
She was doing some counting work.

167
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:47,888
She was working hard so I didn't talk to her.

168
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:50,988
Mr. Fujino left the kitchen to give a cake to Conan.

169
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:52,488
During this short period,

170
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:55,088
the suspect murdered Ms. Hashigaki.

171
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,988
Mr. Maeda, you were outside the candy house too, right?

172
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:01,188
I was in the office from 12:25 pm to 12:35 pm

173
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,988
since I was told that somebody was on the phone, waiting for me.

174
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,688
You seem to remember the time precisely.

175
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,588
Well, it's because...

176
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:13,088
I have a habit to keep my eyes on the watch when I do something.

177
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:15,188
You know, because we use stuff like the oven.

178
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:17,588
Who else was in the office?

179
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:18,688
Only myself.

180
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,988
The other staff were out to lunch, I think.

181
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:22,288
I see.

182
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,588
So, after Mr. Fujino left this place,

183
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:26,988
somebody murdered Ms. Hashigaki,

184
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:29,588
and Mr. Maeda found the dead body when he came back from the office.

185
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,588
-Am I right? -Yes.

186
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:34,688
Ms. Morimoto, you were the only one here.

187
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:38,188
Didn't you notice anybody coming in?

188
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,288
No.

189
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:42,188
The back of the victim's head was severely injured.

190
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,488
There could be a murder weapon inside the museum.

191
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,788
Search throughout the museum!

192
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:49,588
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

193
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:52,888
One of the chefs must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

194
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,188
Then, the type of the weapon

195
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:57,188
and how it was disposed would be the key to finding the suspect.

196
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:01,488
I think either Maeda or Fujino must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

197
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:02,688
-What are you talking about? -What are you talking about?

198
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:05,988
Yeah, it has to be!

199
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:08,788
Maeda owed her a lot of money

200
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,188
and Fujino wanted to go independent.

201
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,888
So you two were having trouble with her.

202
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:14,388
Everyone in the store knew about it.

203
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,388
Well, we aren't the only ones

204
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,988
who were having trouble with her, were we?

205
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:20,288
What do you mean?

206
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,488
She wanted to quit the candy-making performance,

207
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:25,688
because she was too confident in the taste of her candies.

208
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,088
You were having an argument with her

209
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,588
right before she was murdered, weren't you?

210
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,288
I heard your voice all the way across the hall.

211
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:37,388
It's true that Ms. Morimoto was having an argument with Ms. Hashigaki.

212
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:39,988
Please judge it based on the taste!

213
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:44,288
It's possible that Ms. Morimoto, who was left alone, murdered her.

214
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,688
Each kitchen is divided with partitions,

215
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,988
so nobody can see Ms. Morimoto from here.

216
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:52,688
The big tree gets in the way.

217
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:54,988
So, nobody can see what's going on here from Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

218
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:57,888
That means...

219
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:04,788
the other two chefs could've murdered Ms. Hashigaki as well.

220
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:07,488
You left here right after I left, right?

221
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:10,688
Don't you think it took too long just to find the kid?

222
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,388
The east space is huge.

223
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:14,888
It's not easy to find a person there.

224
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,488
Don't you think it was too good timing that you got a phone call?

225
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:21,188
The phone was already cut when I answered the phone.

226
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,588
This has to be be a setup!

227
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:25,988
You could've been the one who called

228
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:28,588
and told yourself to come to the office.

229
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:29,688
What?

230
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:31,388
We'll find out who killed Ms. Hashigaki

231
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:33,688
when we find the weapon!

232
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:36,588
Just to let you know, you are the one

233
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:37,988
who could kill Ms. Hashigaki the easiest.

234
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:39,988
Right!

235
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:41,888
The cakes are almost gone?

236
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,488
It's crazy.

237
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,988
A piece of wood?

238
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,988
Sir! No weapons were found.

239
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:58,388
I see. Nothing was found?

240
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:01,888
The weapon is gone because it's been eaten already.

241
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:03,488
Can we think this way?

242
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,288
What do you mean by that?

243
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:07,488
This is a candy house.

244
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,188
It's possible that the weapon was made of sweets.

245
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:13,688
Who would eat stuff that was used to kill somebody?

246
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:14,688
But if we think that way,

247
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:19,188
the types of sweets that were made into weapon would be limited.

248
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:20,588
It's not cookies.

249
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,188
They would break.

250
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,988
Not pies or tarts of course.

251
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:27,088
It can't be my chocolate.

252
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:29,588
Because is pretty soft.

253
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:31,688
Now what? You're saying I killed her with my candy

254
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:34,588
and ate the sweet bloody weapon?

255
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:37,488
A candy as a murder weapon.

256
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,488
It's too big to eat.

257
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,188
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:44,488
Or maybe she melted the candy.

259
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:48,688
She put the candy into a pot that was heated up beforehand.

260
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,688
I never done anything like that!

261
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:53,988
She could be the one who did those things

262
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,688
because nobody could hear or see what she was doing.

263
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:59,688
I didn't do it! It's the truth!

264
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:02,688
Well, we'll find out whether it's true or not,

265
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:04,788
after the identification.

266
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,688
Is she the killer?

267
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:11,688
It's my dream to win a contest with these candies someday.

268
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,488
No, it can't be.

269
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:26,288
This is...

270
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:28,688
As expected, she isn't be the murderer.

271
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:36,288
So messy.

272
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:45,888
How come pieces of wood are in the kitchen?

273
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,088
When I came here yesterday,

274
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:50,088
there was no "Wood Chocolate Cake making trial".

275
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:51,388
You're so lucky.

276
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:53,488
I got it!

277
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,788
So she was being used.

278
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:01,688
But you're not having it your way!

279
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,688
No. The murderer...

280
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,688
Ran.

281
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:13,888
Sonoko?

282
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,288
The murderer is not Ms. Morimoto.

283
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,288
Sonoko! That thing again?

284
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:23,388
What?

285
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:27,688
She was trying so hard to make candies for the afternoon

286
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:30,288
just to convince Ms. Hashigaki that she was good enough.

287
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:36,788
As a proof, there are candies in her kitchen for tasting.

288
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,988
Ran, could you show everybody the thing in my left hand?

289
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,488
Okay.

290
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,388
It seems like...

291
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:55,588
it's not something that is done half-way or a failure.

292
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,688
That piece of candy tells us

293
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,788
how much she wanted to be a patissier and not a magician.

294
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,788
I just wanted her to taste this one more time.

295
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:06,188
Then, who murdered Ms. Hashigaki?

296
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,788
The real suspect is...

297
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,788
The "Prince of Sweets", Mr. Fujino!

298
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,388
It's you.

299
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:14,488
First of all,

300
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:18,088
you called Mr. Maeda by phone just to let him out of here.

301
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:19,888
Then, after making sure Ms. Morimoto started using the blender,

302
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:22,588
you left the kitchen.

303
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,888
From this point, you can't see a thing

304
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,588
of what's going on in Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

305
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:30,488
Mr. Fujino used this blind spot!

306
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,988
Good work.

307
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,188
You, too.

308
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,988
I'll leave the rest to you.

309
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:53,288
So are you saying I killed her with candy?

310
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,888
No, it's the Wood Chocolate Cake!

311
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,288
Really! My Wood Chocolate Cake?

312
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,788
That soft chocolate became a weapon?

313
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:03,388
Okay, let me explain!

314
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,988
This house is called "The Candy House"

315
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,888
It seems that this candy house is totally made of sweets.

316
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:12,088
But the truth is that this is a wooden house that's coated with sweets.

317
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,988
This was how he came up with the plan,

318
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,688
hiding the murder weapon under the sweets.

319
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:18,688
What?

320
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,588
So he hid the weapon under the Wood Chocolate Cake, am I correct?

321
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:26,588
Right! A piece of wood was used to kill Ms. Hashigaki!

322
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,288
You are a very careless man.

323
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:30,988
You hid the piece of wood that's smaller than your Wood Chocolate Cake

324
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:32,488
in your kitchen beforehand.

325
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:39,288
Then you brought the wood chocolate to Conan,

326
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,988
with the piece of wood hidden under the tray.

327
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:45,688
You hit the back of the victim's head with it.

328
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,288
Show me the evidence if you say so!

329
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,688
The evidence lies in Mr. Fujino's corner over there.

330
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,488
Conan, would you get the wood chocolates for me, please?

331
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:56,688
Okay.

332
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:04,788
Let me help you.

333
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,688
Thank you, Miss!

334
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,288
Conan, I'll pay for them.

335
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,588
So give everyone a piece of the Wood Chocolate Cake.

336
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,688
Okay!

337
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:30,088
Sonoko, there's something in the cake. I can't cut it.

338
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:31,588
What is it?

339
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:34,288
It looks like there is a real piece of wood in the cake.

340
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:40,488
Mr. Fujino hid the real murder weapon inside the chocolate cream

341
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,288
and put the cake on the tray.

342
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:45,488
Then, as he promised Conan,

343
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:49,188
he walked out the door with the real Wood Chocolate Cake.

344
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:57,888
Chief was literally like a witch that's on the wall of this candy house.

345
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:00,388
She promised me to give me my own store, if I win a contest

346
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:03,288
and work with her for three years.

347
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,388
So I won a contest with my Wood Chocolate Cake

348
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,488
and worked for three years.

349
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:09,188
I never complained at all,

350
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,488
even if I had to work like a bee.

351
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,188
But as soon as I became popular,

352
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:15,788
Ms. Hashigaki took back what she said before.

353
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,188
She even say that she would take the Wood Chocolate Cake away from me.

354
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:21,888
Finally, she said there was no promise made between us at all!

355
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:24,888
I just...

356
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,988
Let's talk at the station, shall we?

357
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,388
The dream of becoming independent

358
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:33,788
and his Wood Chocolate Cake that was a part of his life

359
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:36,888
were both taken away by his chief.

360
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:40,688
For him, Ms. Hashigaki was a witch,

361
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:43,788
who was trying to cage and eat him,

362
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:45,288
just like the one in Hansel and Gretel.

363
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:19,388
"Ecriture"

364
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:20,888
Oh, no!

365
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:25,888
My chocolate cake!

366
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,988
No! It's ruined!

367
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:30,388
It's fine!

368
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:32,988
You still can eat it. It looks same when it gets to the stomach.

369
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:34,188
That's right!

370
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:36,488
Hey, what are you talking about?

371
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:40,688
Come on! You just need to find another good chocolate cake store, right?

372
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:42,788
Oh, yeah!

373
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,888
I think there's a delicious cake buffet restaurant

374
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,288
beside the train station!

375
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,388
-What? -What?

376
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:49,688
We have to hurry! Come on!

377
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,888
Hold up, Sonoko!

378
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:56,888
Hey... No way!

379
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:03,588
"Next Episode"

380
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:08,088
If my deduction is correct,

381
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:09,888
then something going to happen pretty soon!

382
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,188
I won't let anything happen!

383
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,288
I will not!

384
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:29,588
Next Conan, "A Lucky Man's Suspense"

385
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:32,615
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,615
"Rumor"

387
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,515
The next episode's got a weird title.

388
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:39,315
The lucky people should be Inspector Megure and uncle, right?
