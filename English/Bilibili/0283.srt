1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,224
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,224
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:05,724
Could something like this actually be done?

4
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,924
Shift ways of thinking for a quick and sharp solution.

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,324
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:11,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,024
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,411
Ran, Pops and I

9
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,411
were helped by Mr. Michiyoshi Majima, the president of Kiyama Furniture,

10
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:06,911
when we ran out of gas and got stuck on a mountain pass in Izu.

11
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,611
And the President, Mr. Majima invited us to stay at his house.

12
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,311
The house had a Rock Garden.

13
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,111
It was so constructed that water began to flow

14
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,711
and fill the garden at certain times of the day.

15
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:24,111
Meanwhile, as it happened to be the day of the

16
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,211
opening of the first store of Kiyama Furniture,

17
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:29,011
other guests also gathered there for a dinner party.

18
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:35,011
Mr. Masayuki Hashimoto, Secretary assigned to Mr. Majima,

19
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:39,211
Mr. Nobuaki Endo, the president of Kiyama Interior,

20
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,211
and Mr. Tomonori Kiyama, freelance writer

21
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,711
were the three guests there.

22
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,711
Though the party goes on,

23
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,211
Mr. Majima leaves in the middle of the party.

24
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,011
Mr. Kiyama also goes back to his room.

25
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,811
Then, a quarrel begins and the party soon takes on an ugly mood.

26
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,411
After that, Mr. Hashimoto leaves the dining hall,

27
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:03,511
saying that he is going back to his office.

28
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:09,011
Mr. Endo and Pops who stays, continues drinking.

29
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:12,711
The following morning...

30
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,611
Ma... President Majima.

31
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,311
President.

32
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,011
Keep out! This is a homicide!

33
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:41,411
Don't enter the garden! We've got to preserve the crime scene!

34
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:45,411
Don't you think there's something strange about his corpse?

35
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:48,411
Something strange? What's strange?

36
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,611
Around the body...

37
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,711
There are no footsteps at all.

38
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:57,111
True.

39
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,711
So, how did the murderer carry Mr. Majima up there?

40
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,311
"Mystery of the Japanese Water Flowing Rock Garden"

41
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:14,211
"(Part 2)"

42
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:36,611
What?

43
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,011
It looks like something was dragged.

44
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,411
Mr. Mouri.

45
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,111
There you are, Mr. Mouri.

46
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,611
Oh, you're Officer Yokomizo.

47
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,311
It's been a while.

48
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,211
But it's kind of funny

49
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:53,311
how I always run into you in a place like this.

50
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:57,611
The renowned detective should be where puzzling cases are.

51
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,811
Maybe I should just resign myself to my fate.

52
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,911
Anyway, this time again we're counting on your cooperation.

53
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:13,711
Officer Yokomizo, I've got a report from the coroner.

54
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:18,111
He died of asphyxiation from strangulation.

55
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,811
Approximate time of death,

56
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:23,311
last night, between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m.

57
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:27,411
His body was moved shortly after his death.

58
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,511
Considering that only parts of the dead body,

59
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:32,811
which were touching the ground, were wet,

60
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:36,811
his body was most likely carried here after 9 p.m. or later.

61
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,711
That is, the time of the crime

62
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,811
would've been somewhere between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.

63
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,411
I see. I thought so.

64
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:49,211
Don't tell me that you've already found the murderer.

65
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:53,611
There's no such word as unsolved in my dictionary.

66
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,711
Are you for real...

67
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,711
Have you found the murderer?

68
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:02,211
Who? Who killed the president?

69
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,011
Oh, please ease up.

70
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:08,611
So, let's hear his explanation first.

71
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,111
Could you explain, Mr. Mouri?

72
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:16,911
Well, let me get your alibis straight.

73
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,211
First, Mr. Kiyama,

74
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:23,711
you got back to your room after the dinner party at 8 p.m.

75
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:26,611
and watched the video which you borrowed from Mr. Endo.

76
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:31,311
You went for a drive with Ran and Conan at 11.15 p.m.

77
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,411
and came back here at 1 a.m. after midnight.

78
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:35,711
Yes.

79
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,611
Mr. Hashimoto, after Mr. Kiyama left,

80
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,811
you went out the hall at about 8.10 p.m.

81
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:43,111
and went directly back to your office.

82
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,111
And this morning, you picked up my car and came back here.

83
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,611
That's right.

84
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:51,911
Mr. Endo, you stayed and drank with me until 9.30 p.m.

85
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,911
and after that you stayed in your room until this morning.

86
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,611
There's no doubt about that.

87
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:02,111
What is important here is what Ayaka said.

88
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:03,911
Ayaka finished putting things away

89
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:08,011
and got back to the staff room at 8.45 p.m.

90
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,811
She was stationed in the staff room until two o'clock.

91
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,711
During this time, Mr. Kiyama was the only person

92
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,411
who went in and out of the western style house,

93
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,411
to go view the night scenery.

94
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,711
Is that right, Ayaka?

95
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,111
Yes.

96
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,911
Looking around the house,

97
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,611
there was no sign that anyone had gone in or out through windows.

98
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,211
And it's impossible for anyone to go out of the house

99
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,711
without being seen by Ayaka.

100
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:34,711
That is, the crime occurred between 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

101
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,111
those who spent their night here,

102
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:40,511
Mr. Endo, Ayaka and Mr. Kiyama who were with Ran and Conan,

103
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:43,011
have established alibis.

104
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,511
Which means...

105
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,111
That's right.

106
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:47,711
So I'll tell you straight that

107
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,711
the murderer is Mr. Hashimoto. You.

108
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,211
Me?

109
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:58,611
Mr. Majima bitterly urged you to repay your debt, right?

110
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,511
So, that doesn't...

111
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,111
You left the western style house,

112
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,211
saying that you'd be going back to your office.

113
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:06,811
You then broke into Mr. Majima's room

114
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,811
and killed him there.

115
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:13,011
Then you carried his body into this room.

116
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,911
Carried his body into this room?

117
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,411
He used the you-know-what.

118
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,411
What's this?

119
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:26,211
It's a catching pole for picking up objects

120
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:28,811
that have fallen into the garden.

121
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,611
Oh, you must be joking.

122
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,411
Mr. Hashimoto carried Mr. Majima here

123
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:39,211
tied him up atop the pole like this.

124
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,811
Mr. Mouri?

125
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,411
Just watch.

126
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:46,611
And Mr. Hashimoto carried the body like this.

127
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,211
Look at you.

128
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:55,211
Just a bit more.

129
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,211
Mr. Mouri.

130
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,611
No good, after all.

131
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:15,511
My only clue

132
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,111
is the trail that looks like something was dragged.

133
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,111
There seems to be no signs of tricks

134
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,711
built into the rocks in the garden.

135
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:27,511
Darn, how did the murderer carry Mr. Majima up there?

136
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,411
Excuse me, officer,

137
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:33,211
can we go now?

138
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,311
Mr. Kiyama and I are innocent

139
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:36,611
because we were in the western style house

140
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,811
at the time of the killing, you know.

141
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,011
That's true but...

142
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,911
I say, Mr. Mouri.

143
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:49,011
Shut up! I'm thinking now, just be quiet.

144
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:50,311
Officer Yokomizo.

145
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:53,111
I found something in the trash can in the dining hall.

146
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,111
This is... Mr. Mouri!

147
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:03,411
It says, if you want me to keep quiet about the accounting gimmick,

148
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,711
come up to the rooftop of the western style house

149
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:08,111
with this paper at eleven o'clock.

150
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,211
What?

151
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,611
Mr. Mouri.

152
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,611
Mr. Majima was killed not in the main house,

153
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,511
but maybe at the western style house.

154
00:10:16,511 --> 00:10:17,811
But...

155
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:22,411
Ayaka, did you see Mr. Majima coming up to the western style house?

156
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,111
No.

157
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:29,811
Don't tell me you killed Mr. Majima.

158
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,211
No, I didn't.

159
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:34,011
Ayaka.

160
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,211
Please tell us the truth.

161
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,611
To tell the truth, I'm...

162
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,111
Tanuma's daughter.

163
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:45,811
Tanuma. So you are the daughter of the driver

164
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,811
who died in the accident with the former president?

165
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,311
Yes, the only reason I started working here

166
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,511
was because I wanted to confirm a rumor I heard about

167
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,811
Majima having rigged the car to make it look like an accident.

168
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,911
Mr. Endo knew about it.

169
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:11,911
And it was, I think, around 10.40 p.m.

170
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,111
Mr. Endo?

171
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,311
And he said, 'Give me money if you don't want Mr. Majima

172
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,011
to know who you are'.

173
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,311
I see.

174
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:31,811
At that time, she was looking at the picture of her father.

175
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,211
Is what she said true, Mr. Endo?

176
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:43,811
So, can you tell me what time Mr. Endo left?

177
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:46,711
I think it was a little past 11.

178
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,111
So, you might not have noticed Mr. Majima

179
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,411
coming to the western style house.

180
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,711
Maybe not.

181
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,911
It all sounds too perfect to be real.

182
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:00,511
I didn't kill him, I swear.

183
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,611
It will be clear before long.

184
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:06,811
Now, let's go to the rooftop.

185
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,211
Yes.

186
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:13,811
Mr. Mouri.

187
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:17,511
Oh, I can see the garden very well from up here.

188
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:21,211
I got it. I know who the murderer is.

189
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,511
So, after all, the criminal is...

190
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:27,111
The murderer is Mr. Endo. You.

191
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,911
You went over to Ayaka and closed the curtains,

192
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:36,411
so that Mr. Majima wouldn't be noticed going up to the roof.

193
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,811
You then, went to the roof where Mr. Majima was waiting,

194
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:41,211
and strangled him.

195
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:43,311
You used what you had set up beforehand,

196
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:46,811
then moved Mr. Majima over to the stone garden.

197
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,711
I see.

198
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,811
And, just what did he set up?

199
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,011
Archery.

200
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:55,311
Huh? Hey.

201
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:59,211
You got ready an arrow with a ring on its rear.

202
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,911
You pulled a long rope through the ring.

203
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:05,011
Then, you left both ends of the rope with you.

204
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:06,711
You then shot the arrow into the big tree

205
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,511
on the other side of the stone garden.

206
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:11,011
For you, who were a contestant on the national team,

207
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,511
it must've been an easy feat.

208
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:16,711
You hung Mr. Majima to that rope

209
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:20,411
and slid him over to the stone garden that way.

210
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,111
But Mr. Mouri,

211
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:26,211
if so, wouldn't the rope be left in the garden?

212
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:28,611
Oh, that's easy.

213
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:33,911
He tied one end of the rope which he kept at hand to the arrow

214
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:37,311
and shot the arrow into the grove over the rock garden.

215
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:40,811
Then the rope would be pulled by the arrow and fly off somewhere.

216
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:44,311
I'm willing to bet my career as a private detective on it.

217
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:46,911
The bow and the arrow that is tied to the rope

218
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,411
must be somewhere!

219
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:53,911
I'm not sure if you should've said that.

220
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,011
We found them!

221
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,211
We found the bow in Mr. Endo's room

222
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:11,211
and the arrow in the grove over the rock garden.

223
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,711
I'm proud of you, Dad.

224
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:18,111
That's impossible.

225
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,261
Strange.

226
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:35,161
If Pop is right, how can the dead body be lying in that way?

227
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,961
But, if he is wrong,

228
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,861
then how can I explain the bow and the arrow with the rope?

229
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:50,761
This is...

230
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:53,661
a ticket to Mr. Kiyama's photograph exhibition.

231
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,861
Why is it in a place like this?

232
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:59,661
I see. So, that's the story.

233
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,761
If my deduction is correct,

234
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:06,461
the killer is still supposed to have the stuff hidden somewhere.

235
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:09,861
Because that stuff's not so easy to get rid of.

236
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,961
I've found it.

237
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:17,861
Just as I thought.

238
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:19,761
All that's left now is the evidence.

239
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:22,861
What's this stain?

240
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,861
I see.

241
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:29,561
I've found conclusive evidence.

242
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,261
I was just about to put on a grand show.

243
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,261
I tell you that, Conan.

244
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,261
What could be so important?

245
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,561
I'll take care of things from here, Pops.

246
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,361
I can tell you that. I didn't kill him.

247
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,261
-Okay. -I didn't kill him.

248
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,561
-I'll hear you out at the police station. -I'm not the killer.

249
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:53,461
Officer Yokomizo.

250
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,361
What's up?

251
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:58,461
Mr. Mouri said he wanted all of us to gather at the rock garden room.

252
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,361
At the rock garden room?

253
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:03,461
He seems to have figured out who the criminal is.

254
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,461
What?

255
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,661
Mr. Mouri. What's this supposed to mean?

256
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:12,261
Mr. Endo is the criminal, isn't he?

257
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,561
That pose is...

258
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:15,061
Detective,

259
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:19,861
just as you said, I was going to kill Majima.

260
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:22,561
What? There you are!

261
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:24,861
But he didn't come.

262
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,861
-Believe me. -Stop lying!

263
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,461
I know, Mr. Endo.

264
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,461
The real murderer is someone else.

265
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,561
The true criminal is the person who knew in advance

266
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,861
about your murderous feelings towards Mr. Endo

267
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:41,061
and took advantage of it.

268
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,361
Don't you think it strange?

269
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,461
If Mr. Endo were the murderer,

270
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,761
why would he throw away only the subpoena,

271
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:51,661
in a separate place from his bow?

272
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,061
True.

273
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:57,261
The murderer took the subpoena from Mr. Majima's room

274
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:00,661
and threw it away on purpose, to publicize Mr. Endo's plan.

275
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:04,061
And if the dead body were carried from the roof,

276
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,961
in the manner that I just deduced a while ago,

277
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,661
no matter how you had him hanging by the rope

278
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,161
it would be impossible for him to be found the way he was,

279
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,261
on his stomach,

280
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:16,661
with his hands and feet in place as they were.

281
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,661
That's totally impossible.

282
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:20,561
Then, in what way was he carried?

283
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,461
Officer, will you please go and get that?

284
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:24,061
Yes.

285
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:26,361
Officer Yokomizo, here is.

286
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,661
An air mattress.

287
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,761
Now, what might that mean, Mr. Mouri?

288
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:35,361
Perhaps the time of the crime was about 8.30 p.m.

289
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,061
That's the time when water begins to flow into the garden.

290
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,161
Exactly.

291
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:42,761
After water filled with the garden, the murderer

292
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,961
tied the string to the air mattress

293
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,661
and set it afloat in the water

294
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:49,461
after putting the dead body of Mr. Majima on it.

295
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:51,461
Before long, the water began to drain away,

296
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:52,861
the water level went down

297
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,461
and just before the air mattress touched the sand,

298
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:56,461
the murderer held Mr. Majima's body

299
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,161
with the top end of the caching pole

300
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,361
and pulled the air mattress out full force.

301
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,361
That was the way the murderer put the dead body

302
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:06,461
in the middle of the rock garden

303
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,661
without leaving no marks on the sand.

304
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:12,461
Incidentally, the murderer left a mark on the stone

305
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:13,961
which was placed on the edge of the rock garden

306
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:16,961
when they pulled the air mattress out of the water.

307
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:22,761
The ticket probably fell out of his pocket

308
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:27,861
into the water at that time.

309
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:30,161
According to the forensics,

310
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:36,061
this scratch was made by the decorative button of his trousers.

311
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,461
So, who is the murderer?

312
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:42,061
I'm sure the murderer panicked

313
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,461
when we decided suddenly to spend the night here.

314
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,861
If Mr. Endo cancelled his plan,

315
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,961
everything would go down the drain.

316
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:55,761
So, the murderer tried to take us outside

317
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,161
at the time Mr. Endo called Mr. Majima.

318
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,561
Don't tell me...

319
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,561
The murderer is the one who took Ran and the others out

320
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,761
and made Mr. Endo carry out the murder plan.

321
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:12,061
It's you, Mr. Kiyama.

322
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,761
After he left the dining hall,

323
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:18,661
Mr. Kiyama didn't go back to his room

324
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:22,361
but went to the main house and killed Mr. Majima.

325
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,661
As Ayaka was still in the dining hall,

326
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,661
he didn't have to worry about being observed.

327
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:31,861
After he put the dead body in the rock garden,

328
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:34,461
Mr. Kiyama patiently waited for

329
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:39,461
Mr. Endo to close the curtains in the staff room where Ayaka was.

330
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:44,361
That is, Mr. Endo tried to hide Mr. Majima from view

331
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,361
but, in fact, in doing so, he helped Mr. Kiyama

332
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,461
carry out the crime.

333
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,161
I see.

334
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,061
Then the mattress...

335
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,961
Yes. We've found in Mr. Kiyama's room.

336
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,561
Wait a minute.

337
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,161
This is a setup.

338
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,661
And the criminal put the air mattress in my room

339
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,061
in order to put the blame on me.

340
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:05,461
Are you sure it doesn't look familiar?

341
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,761
Of course not.

342
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:08,861
I've never see an air mattress like this.

343
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:12,261
It sounds odd to me.

344
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:17,661
Mr. Kiyama, could you take a closer look at the mattress again?

345
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,661
This...

346
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:32,961
Yeah. This is the ink of your father's keepsake fountain pen

347
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:36,661
that you always carry on you.

348
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:55,361
I didn't expect that the ink splattered even over the mattress.

349
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,861
I thought I wiped off all the ink.

350
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,661
But how come...

351
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:01,161
Majima would've been killed anyway by Mr. Endo

352
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,761
even if you didn't do it.

353
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,061
I just happened to overheard

354
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:11,861
the guy proudly telling his story in a very amusing way.

355
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,361
Majima rigged the brakes

356
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:17,561
and made my father fall to his death.

357
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,761
While I was away, took the seat as president

358
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,861
and took over my father's corporation.

359
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:29,061
When I found out about it, I swore.

360
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:33,461
I was gonna kill that jerk someday.

361
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:39,561
So, Mr. Endo provided a wonderful opportunity for me to kill him.

362
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:41,761
You know, it created a perfect opportunity to offer

363
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:44,161
the dead body as a sacrifice

364
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,661
to the rock garden my father loved.

365
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,761
Oh, out of gas again.

366
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:44,761
Dad, I've heard enough about your 'Oh, out of gas'.

367
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:47,461
What're we gonna to do now, on a mountain path like this?

368
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,361
Hey, easy does it!

369
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,961
Perhaps a president may happen to pass us again

370
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:55,561
and invite us to his office.

371
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:59,461
I have a feeling that I'm gonna be able to drink tonight again.

372
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,761
You never learn.

373
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,861
What? The heroine of a movie?

374
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,461
You mean, me?

375
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:11,461
You should take it, Ran.

376
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:14,361
The challenging spirit is what counts.

377
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,161
A love scene?

378
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:18,561
Don't do it after all.

379
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,361
Right, you're not cut out for that kind of stuff.

380
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,161
Next Conan,

381
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:35,182
"Chinatown Dejavu In The Rain (Part 1)"

382
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,579
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:40,079
"Chinese table"

384
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,179
A really surprising guest will appear in the next episode.

385
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,779
Private Eye?

386
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,979
Isn't he dad's business rival?
