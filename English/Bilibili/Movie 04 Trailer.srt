(The Fourth Theatrical Movie!)

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,052
The police are getting murdered one after another.

4
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:18,717
What lies behind this case?

5
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:20,770
What in the world is going on?

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,434
Sorry, I cannot tell you anything.

7
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:25,633
It means need not to know.

8
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:27,717
(Author: Gosho Aoyama)
The police refuses to share a single information.

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,998
With Tropical Land as the stage,
a brutal crime is taking place.

10
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:32,048
And...

11
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:33,484
Officer Sato!

12
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:35,580
The only person who saw the culprit was Ran.

13
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:36,181
However!

14
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,386
Could Ran's memories be...

15
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,903
Ran, do you know who I am?

16
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:43,421
You must recall the culprit who targeted you!

17
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,507
In order to erase the only evidence,

18
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,331
the culprit is targeting Ran's life!

19
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,896
Why are you trying so hard to protect me, boy?

20
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,247
That's because, Ran...

21
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:57,893
You are...

22
00:00:58,586 --> 00:00:59,661
precious to me.

23
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,649
Is this a perfect crime?

24
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:05,001
(Theme Song: Miho Komatsu  Music: Katsuo Ohno)
Who is the culprit that lurks in the darkness?

25
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:05,809
And...

26
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:07,748
Can I protect Ran's life?

27
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,609
We need to find the sniper

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,665
that is hidden in Ran's eyes!

29
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:15,792
