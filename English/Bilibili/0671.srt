1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:07.666
Tohru Amuro, who got to know since the DNA case some days ago

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:14.766
claimed Raita Nanba, Pops' friend as being the culprit,

3
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.066
but Pops on the contrary,

4
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:21.166
proves that this was not homicide, but a suicide case.

5
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.766
Amuro, who is deeply impressed by Pops' deduction

6
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.066
decides to part-time at Poirot

7
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.666
that is located below the detective agency,

8
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.766
and learn detective work under Pops.

9
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.366
The vivid colored memories of summer.

10
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.366
Solve mysteries all season round.

11
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.166
Going to and fro the detective agency.

12
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.466
An unbelievable occurrence in the wink of an eye.

13
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.166
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.166
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
His name is Detective Conan.

16
00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:42.023
"Nocturne of the Detectives (The Case)"

17
00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:45.623
This is the image of the three bank robbers

18
00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.123
that has been publicized this time.

19
00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:52.423
Now, these three are still on the run and...

20
00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:56.823
I tell you, all they've been airing since this morning is this news.

21
00:02:56.823 --> 00:02:58.423
It can't be helped.

22
00:02:58.423 --> 00:03:01.823
It's only been less than a week since the incident occurred, and moreover,

23
00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:05.223
it seems that one banker was shot to death too.

24
00:03:05.223 --> 00:03:08.123
If I remember correctly, the guy was killed because he tried to be cool

25
00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:10.323
and went up against the robbers or something.

26
00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.323
I don't think he went against the robbers.

27
00:03:13.323 --> 00:03:16.923
According to one of the customers who was at the bank at that time,

28
00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:20.723
he raised his hands like this and said, "Okay, cut it out already"

29
00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:23.223
and tried to calm the robbers down.

30
00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.923
But, it's all the same if he did what he did and got the robbers angry,

31
00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:29.323
then got shot to death.

32
00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:33.023
But, you sure can't do bad things, can you?

33
00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:35.423
After all, the 200 million yen

34
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.523
that was just brought in from the main bank were all new bills,

35
00:03:38.523 --> 00:03:41.723
so the numbers on the bills were clearly identifiable.

36
00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:45.723
Yeah, they got a bunch of money they can't use.

37
00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:49.823
So it's just a matter of time until the robbers get caught.

38
00:03:50.823 --> 00:03:53.623
I mean, how come you're here?

39
00:03:53.623 --> 00:03:55.823
I came to bring you, Mr. Mouri,

40
00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:58.323
the one who's taking care of me, sandwiches for lunch.

41
00:03:58.323 --> 00:04:01.323
Of course it's on me.

42
00:04:01.323 --> 00:04:03.723
You mean there's some for us too?

43
00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:05.023
Well, of course!

44
00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:06.723
Thank you very much.

45
00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:10.623
No problem, if for Mouri Sensei, this is nothing.

46
00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:14.023
What a carefree character.

47
00:04:14.023 --> 00:04:18.023
And, the client that's coming today, what kind of case is it?

48
00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.923
What? Why do you know about it?

49
00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:22.823
Of course I know about it.

50
00:04:22.823 --> 00:04:25.523
Well, on holiday afternoons you usually spend your time

51
00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:28.623
slacking off with a horse racing newspaper in hand.

52
00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:33.323
But today, you're clean shaven and wearing a necktie.

53
00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:36.823
It's as if you're waiting for someone to come over.

54
00:04:36.823 --> 00:04:39.323
Just as expected of you, Mr. Amuro.

55
00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:42.723
At this rate, there's no need to practice your skills under Dad.

56
00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:47.623
Oh, no. This is all thanks to teachings from Mr. Mouri.

57
00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:50.323
You're doing quite well, Amuro.

58
00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:53.123
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:53.123 --> 00:04:59.423
Moreover, Yoko Okino's supposed to be on air now.

60
00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:01.123
Despite this, you're not watching it,

61
00:05:01.123 --> 00:05:03.923
and seem to be straining your nerves,

62
00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:06.923
so it must be some great case that you've got on your hands.

63
00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:13.723
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Yoko!

64
00:05:13.723 --> 00:05:17.323
This is...

65
00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:19.223
He changed the time he was supposed to meet the client

66
00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:21.623
just so that he could watch this live.

67
00:05:21.623 --> 00:05:24.723
Go! Yoko!

68
00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:27.523
Pops is really carefree too.

69
00:05:30.323 --> 00:05:33.123
Tune in next week for the goodwill soccer match.

70
00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:41.723
So was I right about the client showing up soon?

71
00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:43.823
Yeah.

72
00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:47.523
But I don't know what kind of person's coming.

73
00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:51.823
Because after all, this is the first client

74
00:05:51.823 --> 00:05:53.923
who came through the internet requesting work to be done.

75
00:05:53.923 --> 00:05:55.623
"Mouri Detective Agency"

76
00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:58.723
So you set up your detective agency website?

77
00:05:58.723 --> 00:06:00.323
Just as expected of you, Mouri Sensei.

78
00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:02.023
You're capable of doing something like this too.

79
00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:03.923
Well, sort of.

80
00:06:03.923 --> 00:06:06.523
I thought that it was about time that we go

81
00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:09.723
in keeping with the global world and turn to digital, you know.

82
00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:13.623
Well, I'm the one who made the website, though.

83
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:18.423
All I have to do now is enter the password.

84
00:06:19.723 --> 00:06:22.823
Conan, you're really something.

85
00:06:22.823 --> 00:06:25.323
Doc taught me how to do it.

86
00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:30.623
So, now that the live broadcast is over.

87
00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:33.823
It's about time that the client gets here.

88
00:06:36.023 --> 00:06:37.823
Mail?

89
00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:39.423
Let see.

90
00:06:39.423 --> 00:06:43.623
"I'm Kei Kashizuka who was scheduled to meet you there today,

91
00:06:43.623 --> 00:06:45.923
but I would like to change the meeting place

92
00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:49.123
to Restaurant Colombo because of personal reasons.

93
00:06:49.123 --> 00:06:51.623
The restaurant is quite near from there,

94
00:06:51.623 --> 00:06:54.423
and I'm sure that I can meet you on time.

95
00:06:54.423 --> 00:06:57.723
I will be waiting to hear from you whether this is okay or not", it says.

96
00:06:57.723 --> 00:06:59.923
Humbug.

97
00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:01.223
Maybe I should just refuse.

98
00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:05.023
No, Dad! It's a client, you know.

99
00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:07.923
Besides, Conan and I haven't eaten lunch yet,

100
00:07:07.923 --> 00:07:09.923
so we could eat at Colombo.

101
00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:12.223
Okay, then. What about these sandwiches?

102
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:17.023
We'll keep this in the refrigerator and have it for dinner.

103
00:07:19.723 --> 00:07:21.923
Sandwiches for dinner?

104
00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:25.823
Dad, the ashes from your cigarette's going to fall.

105
00:07:25.823 --> 00:07:28.323
Hey, Dad! Be careful, will you!

106
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.823
What if it catches fire?

107
00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:34.223
Well, but thanks to someone slacking off in this house,

108
00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:36.023
we're into hot water even without the help of fire, I guess!

109
00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:38.323
Oh, nice play on words.

110
00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:41.323
Then, will it be alright for me

111
00:07:41.323 --> 00:07:44.923
to accompany you when you meet this client, Mouri Sensei?

112
00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.723
My shift at Poirot today is till afternoon.

113
00:07:47.723 --> 00:07:50.923
Oh, yeah, I don't mind.

114
00:07:50.923 --> 00:07:54.123
If you're coming with me, pay tuition like you should!

115
00:07:54.123 --> 00:07:56.623
Well, of course!

116
00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:02.923
Okay, Mouri Sensei.

117
00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:04.623
You go on ahead,

118
00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:07.323
I'll go get my coat and meet you there.

119
00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:16.823
"Colombo Restaurant"

120
00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:18.723
The key of a coin locker?

121
00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:20.723
Yeah. It seems that the key was found among

122
00:08:20.723 --> 00:08:22.523
the belongings of the late older brother,

123
00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:25.023
who passed away the other day.

124
00:08:25.023 --> 00:08:27.423
Since the client couldn't figure out which locker the key was for,

125
00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:29.423
he wants me to figure it out.

126
00:08:29.423 --> 00:08:30.723
If it's for something important,

127
00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:33.523
he wants to put it in the coffin of his brother, he says.

128
00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:36.023
But can you figure it out?

129
00:08:36.023 --> 00:08:39.523
Keys usually have the manufacturer's name and serial number on them,

130
00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:41.523
so it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out,

131
00:08:41.523 --> 00:08:43.323
if I can get a hold of the company

132
00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:45.523
and ask them where they delivered the locker,

133
00:08:45.523 --> 00:08:49.223
we'll get a general idea of where it is.

134
00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:51.423
It much easier than I thought.

135
00:08:51.423 --> 00:08:53.323
I guess.

136
00:08:55.423 --> 00:08:58.523
Is that all there is to it, your client's request?

137
00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:01.723
Yeah, and the client's offering me 300,000 yen for it,

138
00:09:01.723 --> 00:09:03.023
so it's a great job, don't you think?

139
00:09:03.023 --> 00:09:04.623
True.

140
00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:07.623
If so, why say it's humbug?

141
00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:21.023
The client is not here yet.

142
00:09:21.023 --> 00:09:22.123
Yeah.

143
00:09:22.123 --> 00:09:26.523
Maybe there's another restaurant by the name of Colombo near here?

144
00:09:26.523 --> 00:09:28.823
No, there isn't.

145
00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:31.423
You sent an okay mail back to the mail

146
00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:33.823
that asked if you would agree to change the meeting place, right?

147
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.123
Yeah! I answered right away.

148
00:09:37.123 --> 00:09:41.123
I'm repeatedly sending mail saying, "I'll be waiting for you there."

149
00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:43.123
But, I'm getting no response.

150
00:09:43.123 --> 00:09:44.423
I see.

151
00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:47.823
The mail address of the mail I got last night,

152
00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:51.423
and the mail I received a while ago is different.

153
00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:52.423
What?

154
00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:55.823
Maybe the client's cell phone is being charge

155
00:09:55.823 --> 00:09:57.823
and so he had to borrow his friend's cell phone

156
00:09:57.823 --> 00:10:00.423
to rush and send the text mail a while ago?

157
00:10:00.423 --> 00:10:04.523
And that friend switched off the power of the cell phone or something?

158
00:10:04.523 --> 00:10:06.923
Hey, I sent the okay mail

159
00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:09.223
to the text mail I received a while ago, you know.

160
00:10:09.223 --> 00:10:11.323
If so, then maybe he's still waiting

161
00:10:11.323 --> 00:10:14.923
at the detective agency, the first meeting place,

162
00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:17.223
unaware of the okay mail that came in.

163
00:10:17.223 --> 00:10:20.023
Well, there's no one waiting there.

164
00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:22.023
True.

165
00:10:22.023 --> 00:10:23.823
I did send a mail, "I'll be right back"

166
00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.523
to the first mail address, though.

167
00:10:26.523 --> 00:10:29.923
Then, I'm sure he'll be answering you soon.

168
00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:31.823
Why don't I get some tea and we'll wait while having tea?

169
00:10:31.823 --> 00:10:35.023
Okay. Since I drank too much coffee at Colombo.

170
00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:36.523
I've got to go to the restroom.

171
00:10:36.523 --> 00:10:39.423
Oh, Ran, I'll help you make tea.

172
00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:42.523
Thanks. Then can you get the teacups?

173
00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:44.123
With pleasure.

174
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.323
Reply from the client!

175
00:10:52.323 --> 00:10:55.623
He says he arrived at Colombo just now, so he'd like me to go there.

176
00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:57.623
If so, we'd better rush over!

177
00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:00.323
-Yeah. -I'll go with you,

178
00:11:00.323 --> 00:11:01.423
so wait for me, will you!

179
00:11:01.423 --> 00:11:04.723
I've got to go to the restroom first.

180
00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:08.623
Mail from the client again.

181
00:11:08.623 --> 00:11:11.823
He says for all of us to rush over.

182
00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:14.523
All of us? You mean us too?

183
00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:16.623
Who else is there?

184
00:11:16.623 --> 00:11:20.123
Then, let's all scoot back to Colombo together.

185
00:11:20.123 --> 00:11:21.923
Come, come, everyone, let's hurry.

186
00:11:21.923 --> 00:11:25.923
So! We'd better hurry or the client will get impatient.

187
00:11:25.923 --> 00:11:29.223
Really, I mean, I think it'll suffice for just me to go and yet!

188
00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:30.223
Well...

189
00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:33.523
But, he's saying everybody, right?

190
00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:38.423
Be quiet, everyone.

191
00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:40.923
I'm sure this is how the story goes.

192
00:11:40.923 --> 00:11:44.623
Someone who didn't want the client to see you,

193
00:11:44.623 --> 00:11:47.723
lured you out using fake mail.

194
00:11:47.723 --> 00:11:49.723
After the agency was emptied out, that certain someone set himself up

195
00:11:49.723 --> 00:11:52.023
as an imposter as one of your employees,

196
00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:54.423
and waited at the agency for the client to appear.

197
00:11:56.023 --> 00:11:57.523
As proof of that.

198
00:11:57.523 --> 00:12:01.923
There are traces of the lock being forced open on the keyhole of this door.

199
00:12:01.923 --> 00:12:04.223
And, in the dish cabinet in the kitchen,

200
00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:07.323
there was a slightly wet teacup.

201
00:12:07.323 --> 00:12:09.023
Judging from your personality, Ran,

202
00:12:09.023 --> 00:12:11.123
You would never put set dishes back into the cabinet

203
00:12:11.123 --> 00:12:12.523
without wiping them, would you?

204
00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:13.523
No.

205
00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:19.523
Besides, the ashes that Pop's dropped on the table before we left

206
00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:21.523
is wiped clean.

207
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:26.023
Isn't it because someone wiped it off while all of us were out?

208
00:12:26.023 --> 00:12:29.623
In other words, these are traces of someone

209
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:33.223
having invited the client in, cleaned the table

210
00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:35.923
and served tea.

211
00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:39.323
Since the teacup was put back without being completely wiped,

212
00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:42.023
it was still wet.

213
00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:44.123
But why would someone do something like that?

214
00:12:44.123 --> 00:12:47.523
Because all the client wanted, was to look for the coin locker.

215
00:12:47.523 --> 00:12:50.523
Maybe something unthinkable is inside the locker?

216
00:12:50.523 --> 00:12:51.623
I wonder about that.

217
00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:53.223
Why don't we...

218
00:12:54.623 --> 00:12:57.423
ask the person himself?

219
00:12:57.423 --> 00:12:58.623
The person himself?

220
00:12:58.623 --> 00:13:00.123
Don't tell me that...

221
00:13:00.123 --> 00:13:02.523
You got a reply mail just as you were about

222
00:13:02.523 --> 00:13:04.723
to go to the restroom, didn't you, Sensei?

223
00:13:04.723 --> 00:13:08.123
And, just when Conan was about to go to the restroom too.

224
00:13:08.123 --> 00:13:11.023
Moreover, on the floor of the restroom

225
00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:13.923
there was a trace of something having been dragged along!

226
00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:15.123
What?

227
00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:17.023
Right.

228
00:13:17.023 --> 00:13:18.923
Most probably that someone for some reason,

229
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.423
has the client with him

230
00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:23.823
and is still here

231
00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:26.823
hiding inside the restroom.

232
00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:31.623
Don't tell me...

233
00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.623
What?

234
00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:53.432
Then, is this what you're saying?

235
00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.332
Ms. Kei Kashizuka, you came here

236
00:13:57.332 --> 00:14:00.832
to have Mr. Mouri investigate the coin locker case,

237
00:14:00.832 --> 00:14:03.832
but were welcomed in by someone who called himself Mr. Mouri's disciple,

238
00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:05.932
and fainted after being attacked with a stun gun.

239
00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:08.832
When you came to, you were tied up with masking tape

240
00:14:08.832 --> 00:14:11.532
and shoved into the restroom.

241
00:14:11.532 --> 00:14:13.132
Yes.

242
00:14:13.132 --> 00:14:15.632
My boots including my shoelaces were removed

243
00:14:15.632 --> 00:14:18.032
so that I wouldn't be able to flee.

244
00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:22.132
After Mouri and the others came back,

245
00:14:22.132 --> 00:14:24.232
the man who thought that they found you

246
00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:26.532
confined in the restroom, panicked,

247
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:31.832
put the gun in his mouth and committed suicide?

248
00:14:31.832 --> 00:14:32.932
Yes.

249
00:14:32.932 --> 00:14:37.032
But, why did that man hide you in the restroom?

250
00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:41.532
I was being questioned right through,

251
00:14:41.532 --> 00:14:44.632
what locker this key was for?

252
00:14:44.632 --> 00:14:47.732
He said he would kill me if I didn't tell him.

253
00:14:49.132 --> 00:14:51.232
Inspector Megure.

254
00:14:51.232 --> 00:14:52.832
According to forensics,

255
00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:55.332
virtually no traces of discharge residue

256
00:14:55.332 --> 00:14:58.032
were found on her clothes or her body.

257
00:14:58.032 --> 00:15:01.032
In other words, that man committed suicide.

258
00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:04.532
Does that mean that Ms. Kashizuka's testimony is fact.

259
00:15:04.532 --> 00:15:06.532
Yes, sir, it's most likely.

260
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:07.632
Okay!

261
00:15:07.632 --> 00:15:10.532
First of all, let's find where the locker is located

262
00:15:10.532 --> 00:15:12.832
and find out what the guy who committed suicide was after.

263
00:15:12.832 --> 00:15:14.532
Yes, sir!

264
00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:24.532
However, I don't understand.

265
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:29.332
Why did this man bring Ms. Kashizuka in here?

266
00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:31.032
All he wanted to do was to ask her

267
00:15:31.032 --> 00:15:35.132
where the locker of this key was, wasn't it?

268
00:15:35.132 --> 00:15:36.732
That's right.

269
00:15:36.732 --> 00:15:38.632
He could've threatened her using a gun,

270
00:15:38.632 --> 00:15:42.432
moved somewhere else and interrogate her,

271
00:15:42.432 --> 00:15:43.532
but instead he passed her out using a stun gun,

272
00:15:43.532 --> 00:15:45.532
and tied her up with masking tape.

273
00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:50.532
This could mean that he was planning to stay confined here for a while.

274
00:15:51.532 --> 00:15:54.732
And of all things, he kills himself with his gun.

275
00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:57.032
Well, it could be that he resigned himself

276
00:15:57.032 --> 00:16:02.332
because I, Kogoro Mouri came back earlier than he expected.

277
00:16:02.332 --> 00:16:06.632
You're not the one who realized that though.

278
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.932
He seemed really freaked out.

279
00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:11.432
He was saying that he'd be in big trouble

280
00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:14.132
if he couldn't find the coin locker as soon as possible.

281
00:16:14.132 --> 00:16:16.132
But, Ms. Kashizuka,

282
00:16:16.132 --> 00:16:20.132
is it really true that you've never seen that man before?

283
00:16:20.132 --> 00:16:22.132
No, sir. Not at all.

284
00:16:22.132 --> 00:16:24.132
If that guy was after the key

285
00:16:24.132 --> 00:16:27.332
that was among your older brother's belongings,

286
00:16:27.332 --> 00:16:30.932
it's highly probable that he could've been an acquaintance of your brother.

287
00:16:30.932 --> 00:16:35.132
I haven't met any of my older brother's friends, you see.

288
00:16:36.532 --> 00:16:40.232
By the way, why did your older brother pass away?

289
00:16:41.632 --> 00:16:44.732
What was the cause of your older brother's death?

290
00:16:44.732 --> 00:16:47.032
What was the cause of your brother's death?

291
00:16:47.032 --> 00:16:51.332
Oh, yes. He died of an accident four days ago.

292
00:16:52.632 --> 00:16:54.432
This is my older brother.

293
00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:58.632
You have his picture as a standby display on your cell phone.

294
00:16:58.632 --> 00:17:02.032
This man. He looks familiar.

295
00:17:03.232 --> 00:17:05.932
Talking about cell phones.

296
00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:09.832
The cell phone of this guy that committed suicide is weird.

297
00:17:09.832 --> 00:17:10.832
Weird?

298
00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.932
The mail that he sent to Mr. Mouri,

299
00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:14.632
feigning to be Ms. Kashizuka

300
00:17:14.632 --> 00:17:18.832
asking to change the place of meeting is in the mail sent history,

301
00:17:18.832 --> 00:17:21.232
but there are no other mails at all.

302
00:17:22.932 --> 00:17:27.232
Oh, that man. As to the mails

303
00:17:27.232 --> 00:17:30.032
after that mail he was using my cell phone.

304
00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:31.232
But, even so being that,

305
00:17:31.232 --> 00:17:34.532
that is all that's left of received and sent mails is.

306
00:17:34.532 --> 00:17:36.532
The address book is also completely blank,

307
00:17:36.532 --> 00:17:39.532
despite it not looking to be such a new model.

308
00:17:39.532 --> 00:17:43.032
Maybe he bought an old model cell phone at a cheap price?

309
00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:45.132
It practically has no scratches or anything on it either.

310
00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:47.832
Besides, the loose change and wallet

311
00:17:47.832 --> 00:17:51.632
that were in his pocket along with the cell phone also bother me.

312
00:17:51.632 --> 00:17:53.332
Loose change and wallet?

313
00:17:53.332 --> 00:17:55.432
The loose change was in his inner pocket of his jacket

314
00:17:55.432 --> 00:17:57.432
top along with the key of the locker he took from Ms. Kashizuka,

315
00:17:57.432 --> 00:18:03.132
together with the stun gun, cigarette and lighter,

316
00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:06.032
but the total amount of loose change added up to almost 5,000 yen.

317
00:18:06.032 --> 00:18:07.932
5,000 yen?

318
00:18:07.932 --> 00:18:10.932
With so much, wouldn't it jingle noisily and be heavy too?

319
00:18:10.932 --> 00:18:12.132
Yeah.

320
00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:15.132
Moreover, in his wallet there were two 10,000 yen bills,

321
00:18:15.132 --> 00:18:17.532
five 5,000 yen bills.

322
00:18:17.532 --> 00:18:20.332
And of all things, there were forty-seven 1,000 yen bills.

323
00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.132
Don't you think that's weird?

324
00:18:22.132 --> 00:18:23.532
True.

325
00:18:23.532 --> 00:18:25.632
Uh, excuse me.

326
00:18:25.632 --> 00:18:27.032
If it's okay with you,

327
00:18:27.032 --> 00:18:30.932
could you please show me the things that were in his pocket?

328
00:18:30.932 --> 00:18:33.532
You want to see them too, don't you, Pops?

329
00:18:33.532 --> 00:18:35.332
Yeah, I guess so.

330
00:18:35.332 --> 00:18:37.632
Well, go ahead.

331
00:18:37.632 --> 00:18:41.032
I'm sorry to trouble you, Inspector.

332
00:18:45.432 --> 00:18:48.132
So, this is all of it.

333
00:18:49.132 --> 00:18:51.432
He had this many things inside his pocket?

334
00:18:51.432 --> 00:18:52.732
Yeah.

335
00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:54.532
Since Officer Takagi is checking

336
00:18:54.532 --> 00:18:58.432
on the key of the locker in question just yet, it isn't here.

337
00:18:59.732 --> 00:19:01.632
Come to think of it, Ms. Kashizuka.

338
00:19:01.632 --> 00:19:02.632
Yes?

339
00:19:02.632 --> 00:19:04.932
Out of the two towels that were found

340
00:19:04.932 --> 00:19:06.632
by the feet of the dead body in the toilet,

341
00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:10.232
the tip of one of them seem to have been wet.

342
00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.132
Do you know why?

343
00:19:12.132 --> 00:19:15.332
I have no idea. I was scared

344
00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:17.232
and looking down all the while, you see.

345
00:19:17.232 --> 00:19:20.832
And as to the boot that was under the towel,

346
00:19:20.832 --> 00:19:23.832
there was a knot at the tip of the shoelace of the boot,

347
00:19:23.832 --> 00:19:26.132
and it was hooked onto the boot.

348
00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:30.832
Oh, that's my habit since I was a child.

349
00:19:30.832 --> 00:19:34.232
When washing cloth sneakers, and drying them,

350
00:19:34.232 --> 00:19:35.332
if the strings are knotted that way,

351
00:19:35.332 --> 00:19:37.932
my brother used to tell me they'd be easier to hang.

352
00:19:37.932 --> 00:19:42.432
Of course I don't wash boots, but I still have that habit.

353
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:46.332
And, my brother's not here anymore either.

354
00:19:47.732 --> 00:19:52.332
Inspector. Shall we call it a day?

355
00:19:52.332 --> 00:19:54.732
After all, it hasn't been long since she's lost her older brother, besides,

356
00:19:54.732 --> 00:19:58.932
a man she doesn't even know committed suicide right before her eyes.

357
00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:03.932
Okay then, I would like you to come in for interrogation tomorrow,

358
00:20:03.932 --> 00:20:08.132
so would you please leave your contact number and address behind?

359
00:20:08.132 --> 00:20:10.832
Yes, sir. I'll write it on something.

360
00:20:10.832 --> 00:20:14.832
If possible I would like you to show me some sort of identification.

361
00:20:14.832 --> 00:20:17.732
Since I'm a new college grad and in the process of looking for a job,

362
00:20:17.732 --> 00:20:19.432
I don't have a name card.

363
00:20:19.432 --> 00:20:22.432
But if I go home, I have my health insurance card.

364
00:20:22.432 --> 00:20:24.832
Okay, will you bring it with you tomorrow, then?

365
00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:26.332
All right.

366
00:20:26.332 --> 00:20:30.732
Uh, if you're going home, shall I give you a lift?

367
00:20:30.732 --> 00:20:33.432
My car is parked at a parking lot nearby.

368
00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:36.032
Maybe that man's friends

369
00:20:36.032 --> 00:20:39.732
could be ambushing you near your house too.

370
00:20:39.732 --> 00:20:41.732
Thank you so much.

371
00:20:41.732 --> 00:20:45.132
No problem, no need to thank me.

372
00:20:45.132 --> 00:20:49.032
By the way, why is he here?

373
00:20:49.032 --> 00:20:53.432
Well, Amuro here has become my first disciple, you see!

374
00:20:53.432 --> 00:20:55.732
Disciple?

375
00:20:57.732 --> 00:20:58.732
I tell you, really.

376
00:20:58.732 --> 00:21:03.432
You mean another detective's been added around you again.

377
00:21:03.432 --> 00:21:05.132
Again?

378
00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:08.632
Yeah. There are others besides you.

379
00:21:08.632 --> 00:21:10.432
A young woman detective

380
00:21:10.432 --> 00:21:12.432
who's been going around the crime scenes together

381
00:21:12.432 --> 00:21:15.932
with Mr. Mouri recently.

382
00:21:15.932 --> 00:21:18.932
A young woman detective.

383
00:21:18.932 --> 00:21:23.832
I would really like to see her.

384
00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:49.932
Ms. Kashizuka, is this the road?

385
00:22:49.932 --> 00:22:52.332
Yes.

386
00:22:52.332 --> 00:22:53.432
Come to think of it.

387
00:22:53.432 --> 00:22:56.532
This car is the same as Officer Sato's, except a different color, isn't it?

388
00:22:56.532 --> 00:22:59.432
By the way, why are you guys riding together?

389
00:22:59.432 --> 00:23:00.832
It's cramped in here!

390
00:23:00.832 --> 00:23:02.232
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:02.232 --> 00:23:06.032
This car isn't made to seat 3 people in the backseat, you see.

392
00:23:06.032 --> 00:23:08.132
It's okay.

393
00:23:08.132 --> 00:23:10.932
Why are you riding with us, Dad?

394
00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:13.632
I was worried about Ms. Kei, that's why.

395
00:23:13.632 --> 00:23:15.932
I don't feel comfortable staying back at the agency with Conan,

396
00:23:15.932 --> 00:23:18.232
where a person just committed suicide.

397
00:23:18.232 --> 00:23:21.532
Then, why didn't you go over to Eri's?

398
00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:22.532
Come of it!

399
00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:25.632
You came along just because Ms. Kashizuka is pretty!

400
00:23:26.832 --> 00:23:28.532
That man.

401
00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:31.032
I wonder if he really committed suicide.

402
00:23:31.032 --> 00:23:34.432
But, there seems to have been no gun discharge residue

403
00:23:34.432 --> 00:23:39.132
detected from Ms. Kashizuka's body

404
00:23:39.132 --> 00:23:42.332
and what's even stranger is his cell phone.

405
00:23:42.332 --> 00:23:44.332
Why was everything, except the mail that was sent to Pops

406
00:23:44.332 --> 00:23:48.632
the received or sent history, including the address book all blank?

407
00:23:48.632 --> 00:23:50.632
Besides, the things that were left back in his pocket

408
00:23:50.632 --> 00:23:53.832
the loose change and bills that were in his wallet.

409
00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:58.932
Why did he have to carry around so many bills and change?

410
00:23:58.932 --> 00:24:02.332
One more thing.

411
00:24:02.332 --> 00:24:05.732
She's probably lying.

412
00:24:09.432 --> 00:24:12.032
"Next Episode" -Please, I can't hold it anymore!

413
00:24:14.032 --> 00:24:15.332
This smell...

414
00:24:15.332 --> 00:24:17.532
Don't tell me...

415
00:24:17.532 --> 00:24:20.932
More than that, how about it? Fruit juice that I buy.

416
00:24:20.932 --> 00:24:23.832
Yep. It's very good.

417
00:24:29.532 --> 00:24:31.032
Are you coming too, Masumi?

418
00:24:31.032 --> 00:24:32.332
Yeah.

419
00:24:34.032 --> 00:24:35.432
Next Conan,

420
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:39.532
"The Nocturne of the Detectives (Kidnap)"

421
00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:57.632
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:57.632 --> 00:24:59.832
"Wiretap"

423
00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:02.132
-A gun is fired in the restroom. -The other day it was a hole up case.

424
00:25:02.132 --> 00:25:03.932
Is the detective agency cursed?
