1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.140
At the Mouri Detective Agency,

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.140
a man who showed up after following three ladies,

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.240
intimidated everyone with his gun and bombs,

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.940
and besieged the entire place.

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.240
The man's name was Isao Sawaguri.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.740
He's the elder brother of Miku Sawaguri,

7
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.440
a mystery writer who killed herself at a hot spring inn a month ago.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.840
Sawaguri who refused to believe that his sister committed suicide,

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.940
ordered the great detective Sleeping Kogoro

10
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.940
to shed some light on the truth.

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.540
The three ladies he brought here

12
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.440
were all amateur mystery writers and friends with Miku.

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.940
Sawaguri suspected that one of them murdered his sister

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.040
and made it appear to be a suicide.

15
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440
Soon after Sawaguri found out

16
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.940
that Ran's cell phone connection was still alive,

17
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.240
I having no choice, introduced myself as Shinichi Kudo,

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.940
and formally accepted his demand to solve the case.

19
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.540
From the materials and testimonies

20
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.240
pertaining to the case sent my way,

21
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.440
I uncovered the truth behind it,

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.840
but I couldn't reveal it right away.

23
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.340
For Sawaguri had already announced

24
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.440
that he would commit murder-suicide with the culprit

25
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.740
once he found out their identity.

26
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.340
I had to somehow solve the case without risking any fatalities.

27
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.140
However, the police had been steadily waiting

28
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.540
in preparation to snipe down the gunman.

29
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.740
Thanks to Ran's quick thinking,

30
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.240
we were able to halt the sniping,

31
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.940
but we couldn't waste any more time.

32
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.540
Because if the mystery was still unsolved by the next morning,

33
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540
Sawaguri planned to blow up the agency,

34
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.040
taking everyone with him.

35
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.840
Thus, I look extreme measures.

36
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.040
It's all right.

37
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Please calm down.

38
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
Because I know the identity of the Rat.

39
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.340
Really?

40
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.740
The Rat that was the last to show up to Miku's room...

41
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.540
Ms. Mitsui,

42
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.340
it can be none other than you.

43
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.640
If all cases were men,

44
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.340
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

45
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.140
As the path to the truth twists and twists,

46
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.440
Shinichi passes down his final judgment.

47
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

50
00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:59.279
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Release)"

51
00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:21.379
Just as expected from the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

52
00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:22.679
Well done.

53
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.079
The dirty Rat, who freaking killed my sister Miku

54
00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:30.279
and made it look like a suicide, Tamami Mitsui...

55
00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.679
He's made it clear that you were the one.

56
00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:35.279
No, no...

57
00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.079
I would never kill Miku.

58
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.579
Don't play dumb with me.

59
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:43.879
The famous high school detective is saying you're the culprit.

60
00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.979
But... but it really wasn't me...

61
00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.179
Any excuses you have I'll hear you out on the other side.

62
00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:56.479
My sister's waiting in the other world.

63
00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.079
Well, don't forget, you two karate kittens.

64
00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.679
About the fact that I've got bombs strapped to my body.

65
00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:08.279
And that as long as I can kill this witch,

66
00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.679
I won't mind dying.

67
00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:13.079
Darn.

68
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.979
Shinichi Kudo.

69
00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.479
What the heck are you going to do?

70
00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.879
Shinichi.

71
00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.679
Please wait.

72
00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:22.779
Shinichi.

73
00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:30.879
I did say that the person whom Miku nicknamed "Rat" was Mitsui,

74
00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.179
but I haven't said one word

75
00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:35.979
about Mitsui having killed your sister, you know?

76
00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.679
What?

77
00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.879
But didn't you just say it?

78
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.879
That the "Rat" who went to my sister's room last was this woman.

79
00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:44.979
Yes.

80
00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.279
Then, why?

81
00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.479
If I recall, your conjecture was as follows, right?

82
00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.179
The culprit drugged your sister to sleep, slit her wrist,

83
00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:54.979
positioned her over the bathtub in the bathroom

84
00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.779
and staged a suicide.

85
00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.879
After confirming her death,

86
00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.279
the culprit sent you an email saying "goodbye"

87
00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.379
using his sister's cell phone.

88
00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.679
Thinking the email odd,

89
00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:08.979
you knocked on your sister's door

90
00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.479
but there was no answer.

91
00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.479
You had no choice

92
00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.579
but to climb over the balcony from your room next door,

93
00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:17.779
and break into your sister's room from the window.

94
00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.579
That was when you found her body in the bathroom.

95
00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:25.579
In short, the culprit had predicted in advance that you would do so,

96
00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:27.279
hid inside the room,

97
00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.579
and while you were distracted by your sister's body,

98
00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:33.679
fled through the window you broke according to you.

99
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.779
Yes, that's exactly right.

100
00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.379
Then,

101
00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.879
where did the culprit pass through to make an escape after that?

102
00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.679
Of course, the culprit went into my room next door,

103
00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.279
and just went out the door?

104
00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.879
I was in my sister's room after all.

105
00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.179
When I first went to knock on my sister's door,

106
00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:54.679
I ended up raising hell.

107
00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:57.879
A lot of bystanders were already there at that point,

108
00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.079
it would've been easy to mix in with that crowd.

109
00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.879
But didn't you say you heard about it as well?

110
00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.679
That a guest three doors down

111
00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:10.279
witnessed Mitsui coming out from your sister's room

112
00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.979
in a big hurry with a book in hand.

113
00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.679
In other words, the room that Mitsui came out of wasn't yours,

114
00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:19.779
but your sister's.

115
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.779
That doesn't seem to fit in with your theory, though.

116
00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.179
He must have mistaken it.

117
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:29.179
Since that guest's room was three doors away from my sister's, right?

118
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.279
He must have confused her coming out of my room

119
00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.979
instead of my sister's room next door.

120
00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.279
No, that wouldn't be the case.

121
00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.979
That witness's room was on the same side

122
00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.779
as your sister's and three doors away.

123
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:45.679
Plus, he said he was about to leave his room,

124
00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:47.879
but as soon as he saw Ms. Mitsui running across in a big rush,

125
00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.579
he immediately shut the door.

126
00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:52.779
If he saw her from that position,

127
00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:53.779
the angle would've been too narrow,

128
00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.779
and he only saw her for a split second.

129
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:58.179
He wouldn't have been able to distinguish at all

130
00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:00.379
which room she had come from.

131
00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.779
In that case, how come that guest knew for sure

132
00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:05.979
she came from my sister's room?

133
00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:07.379
That's because...

134
00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:09.779
the door to your sister's room Ms. Mitsui came out

135
00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.379
of had been wide open,

136
00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:15.479
and he had seen the room number affixed to the door.

137
00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:19.179
Ms. Mitsui was in such a rush

138
00:08:19.179 --> 00:08:22.279
because she wanted to use the restroom at once.

139
00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:26.279
The fact that the open door was closed later on

140
00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:29.879
proves that your sister was still alive.

141
00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.679
The doors at that inn are not auto-lock doors,

142
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.779
if your sister hadn't locked the door from inside,

143
00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:36.779
you wouldn't have gone through all the trouble

144
00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:41.279
to break the window in order to enter.

145
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.179
Then who was it?

146
00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.379
Who was the culprit that killed my sister?

147
00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:47.979
According to my sister's postings, someone should've been there, right?

148
00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:52.379
The murderer, who was still in my sister's room until she got drowsy.

149
00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:55.379
About your sister's debut work...

150
00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:56.979
have you happened to read it?

151
00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:01.579
No. I'm not much of a reader.

152
00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:03.879
I haven't read that yet.

153
00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:05.079
The title is...

154
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.179
"The Death's Funeral Procession".

155
00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:10.779
The main character was a police detective

156
00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:12.179
who was desperately pursuing

157
00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:15.479
the shadow of a serial killing fiend.

158
00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:19.179
One day, the detective was visited by Death at his side,

159
00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:23.579
who told him, "You won't ever be able to catch him in your lifetime".

160
00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:25.279
It was only natural...

161
00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.679
Since that detective had been the serial killer

162
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:29.779
who unconsciously wandered the streets night after night

163
00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:32.479
and committed the crimes.

164
00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.979
The detective, upon realizing this fact,

165
00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:37.979
became tormented by his conscience.

166
00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:42.779
And took his own life following Death's lead.

167
00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:45.279
Hey, you're not saying...

168
00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:48.679
Right. Your sister laid her hands

169
00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:50.079
upon her "Death's Funeral Procession"

170
00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:52.479
for the first time in ages in order to autograph it.

171
00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:54.779
Is she uncontrollably put herself

172
00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:56.779
in the place of the main character she created,

173
00:09:56.779 --> 00:10:01.379
and saw a hallucinated image of Death in her room.

174
00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:07.379
You can imagine what your sister might have done afterwards, right?

175
00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:08.679
Don't tell me...

176
00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:12.079
My sister kill... killed herself?

177
00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:19.879
No, no way. It can't be.

178
00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:23.479
That's going to be... a lie.

179
00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.979
Breach.

180
00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:36.979
Charge in!

181
00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:37.979
Charge!

182
00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.079
No.

183
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:53.679
Secured.

184
00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.779
All's well that ends well.

185
00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:03.179
Good for you.

186
00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:05.979
Well... that still remains to be seen?

187
00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:09.579
What do you mean?

188
00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:16.479
All right, we will be contacting you for details,

189
00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:20.279
regarding the case of yourselves, if you please.

190
00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.479
Yes.

191
00:11:21.479 --> 00:11:23.079
Understood.

192
00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:24.379
I'll be on my way.

193
00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:34.379
Good work, everyone.

194
00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:39.279
I'm worn out.

195
00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:42.679
Still, you really had me going there, Kudo.

196
00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.379
I almost thought you were really going to name the culprit

197
00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:49.079
and have that bomber man kill her.

198
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:53.179
Well, I can understand if you figured out that it was a suicide,

199
00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:56.379
but since I've never read Miku Sawagiri's debut work,

200
00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:57.879
I wouldn't have been able to solve it.

201
00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:01.679
Sorry, but I haven't read "Death's Funeral Procession" either.

202
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.679
What?

203
00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:07.979
That was just a bluff I used for the situation at hand.

204
00:12:07.979 --> 00:12:09.679
In order for that bomber man to truly believe

205
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:13.679
his sister had committed suicide.

206
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:18.279
Otherwise, for someone who had been leisurely posting on SNS

207
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.279
to suddenly see a hallucination of Death and commit suicide...

208
00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.079
is an illogical deduction

209
00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:24.979
I'd never give even with my mouth pried open.

210
00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:27.779
Hey, you don't mean to say...

211
00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:30.879
Right, now on to our main topic.

212
00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:32.479
It really exists,

213
00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:34.379
Death who killed Miku Sawaguri

214
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.479
and made it seem like a suicide

215
00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:38.779
is among those three people over there.

216
00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:52.429
It really exists,

217
00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:54.529
Death who killed Miku Sawagiri

218
00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:56.229
and made it seem like a suicide

219
00:12:56.229 --> 00:12:58.429
is among those three people over there.

220
00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:03.029
Don't tell me...

221
00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:05.629
were we wrong about the nicknames Miku assigned

222
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:07.429
to those three people?

223
00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:10.929
No, they were indeed as I said.

224
00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:13.129
Mitsui, whose family stonemasonry business deals

225
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:16.129
with rat-colored stones, was Rat.

226
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.529
Yuchi, who works at the bakery

227
00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:21.529
and sells bread that is golden brown, was Fox.

228
00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:23.229
Nihei, the wife of a seal craftsman

229
00:13:23.229 --> 00:13:26.329
who carves ivory-colored seals, was Elephant.

230
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:28.729
Those were all true.

231
00:13:28.729 --> 00:13:31.629
Then, was the order in which the three people

232
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:34.029
went to Miku's room wrong?

233
00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:40.429
No, the order was indeed Nihei, Yuchi and Mitsui.

234
00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:44.029
Given that Miku's postings on SNS

235
00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:46.829
said the order was Elephant, then Fox, and finally Rat.

236
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:52.229
In that case, since the last one to visit was Mitsui...

237
00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:54.429
Was Mitsui the culprit after all?

238
00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:56.329
No, you're wrong.

239
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:59.229
I see. She left the room

240
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:01.029
but returned afterwards and committed the crime.

241
00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:02.829
No, that wouldn't be the case.

242
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:09.529
Mitsui was seen coming out of Miku's room in a big hurry.

243
00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:12.329
Despite having been seen exhibiting such odd behavior,

244
00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:15.429
the possibility of her returning there again to commit murder

245
00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:17.529
is highly unlikely.

246
00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:21.429
Especially, so if she were a premeditated murderer

247
00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:24.329
who crafted a sealed room and set it up to look like a suicide.

248
00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:27.429
Then, who the heck was the culprit?

249
00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:31.429
Ran. Sorry, but could you read those for us again?

250
00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:34.629
The posts from Miku right before she was murdered.

251
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:35.629
Yes.

252
00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:41.029
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

253
00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:43.629
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

254
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:45.529
that pesky Elephant.

255
00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:47.529
Next to come was Fox.

256
00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:50.929
Trying to stir up an argument again, freaking annoying.

257
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:54.029
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

258
00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:56.529
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

259
00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.329
I'll make short work of the autograph

260
00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:00.429
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

261
00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:03.229
Darn, she's still here.

262
00:15:03.229 --> 00:15:06.229
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

263
00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:07.729
What should I do?

264
00:15:09.229 --> 00:15:12.629
Then Ms. Mitsui, I'll ask you.

265
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:15.129
When you went to Miku's room,

266
00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:18.629
she didn't let you use her restroom, did she?

267
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:20.029
That... that's right.

268
00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:21.929
Like I said...

269
00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:26.829
She was only being a little mean to Ms. Mitsui with an upset stomach.

270
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:29.729
Well, was it really like what you said?

271
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:31.029
What?

272
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:34.229
Could it be?

273
00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:39.129
Right, the one who was still lingering in her room wasn't Rat,

274
00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:41.329
but Fox, the second to come.

275
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:42.929
Shinobu Yuchi.

276
00:15:44.229 --> 00:15:46.229
It was actually you.

277
00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:54.429
Yuchi is...

278
00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:56.629
The culprit?

279
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:58.929
How... how come?

280
00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:02.329
See, Miku posted about it, right?

281
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:07.129
The Fox came to pick a fight and just wouldn't leave.

282
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:12.329
Unfortunately, Mitsui came by in the middle of the argument.

283
00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:15.029
So she hid Yuchi in the restroom for the time being

284
00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:17.329
and intended to make Mitsui go away quickly.

285
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:20.329
Of course she had Yuchi take the slippers with her.

286
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:21.529
Since it'd be obvious

287
00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:24.329
that someone else was still inside if there were two pairs.

288
00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:26.529
But at that time,

289
00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:29.729
instead of Yuchi's own damp slippers she had worn from the baths,

290
00:16:29.729 --> 00:16:32.029
she accidentally took Miku's slippers instead.

291
00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:35.929
And then Mitsui mistakenly wore Yuchi's slippers,

292
00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:38.529
which felt uncomfortable wearing.

293
00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.529
Was that the case, Kudo?

294
00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:45.829
Yes. What happened afterwards was just as the bomber man Isao said.

295
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:47.829
After killing Miku in the bathroom

296
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:49.629
while disguising it as a suicide.

297
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:50.729
She text mailed Isao

298
00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:54.129
and induced him to break the window glass and enter the room.

299
00:16:54.129 --> 00:16:55.529
From that broken window,

300
00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:58.229
she crossed over the adjoining balcony to Isao's room.

301
00:16:58.229 --> 00:17:01.329
And then snuck out from that room via the door

302
00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:04.529
and mixed in with the bystanders who were gathered.

303
00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:08.829
But... couldn't we also assume that Nihei, who came by first,

304
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.929
might have been hiding in the restroom the entire time?

305
00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:14.829
Miku posted about Fox who was still there

306
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.129
and called her "annoying".

307
00:17:17.129 --> 00:17:18.729
If Fox had left,

308
00:17:18.729 --> 00:17:21.629
she would've happily posted it without a doubt,

309
00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:23.229
but we saw nothing like that.

310
00:17:24.229 --> 00:17:25.729
Also, Nihei has a methodical personality and is high strung

311
00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:29.729
to the extent that she would line up people's slippers.

312
00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:31.029
It'd be hard to imagine

313
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:34.129
that she would mistake someone else's slippers for her own.

314
00:17:35.229 --> 00:17:39.829
But, isn't that merely circumstantial evidence?

315
00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:41.329
I do have concrete proof.

316
00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:45.429
As Miku was struggling to escape from the bathroom,

317
00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:48.429
She grabbed the bathmat with her bloody hands, there's the photo.

318
00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:51.629
Although the two marks near the door clearly indicated handprints,

319
00:17:51.629 --> 00:17:55.929
the blood marks farther were those from her fingertips.

320
00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:58.429
That's proof she was grasping something.

321
00:17:58.429 --> 00:18:00.229
And now I'd like to direct your attention

322
00:18:00.229 --> 00:18:03.429
to Yuchi's signed book from Miku.

323
00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:05.529
Depending on the printing method,

324
00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:07.529
the side of a book-also known as the fore edge

325
00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:12.529
would either line up neatly or appear jagged.

326
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:14.329
But the method would never change

327
00:18:14.329 --> 00:18:16.429
between copies of the same first printing.

328
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:19.229
However, for the same reason, only Yuchi's signed book

329
00:18:19.229 --> 00:18:21.929
had its fore edge neatly lined up.

330
00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:26.129
It's likely because Yuchi's filed the edge down with sandpaper.

331
00:18:27.229 --> 00:18:31.129
To conceal Miku's bloody handprints she left by grabbing onto the book

332
00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:34.329
in her last moments.

333
00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:36.729
That's the unshakable proof.

334
00:18:36.729 --> 00:18:38.029
She bought another copy

335
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:40.129
and replaced the cover with the new one

336
00:18:40.129 --> 00:18:43.229
to make it look like nothing was on it.

337
00:18:43.229 --> 00:18:45.229
But the book warped when it was grasped,

338
00:18:45.229 --> 00:18:50.329
so she couldn't hide the blood marks that adhered deeper into the pages.

339
00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:54.629
But why would the signed book be on the bathmat?

340
00:19:00.429 --> 00:19:02.329
While I was carrying her to the bathroom,

341
00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:04.829
after drugging her to sleep,

342
00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:07.829
it fell out from my bathrobe.

343
00:19:07.829 --> 00:19:10.629
Afterwards she bloodied the book,

344
00:19:10.629 --> 00:19:12.729
but I didn't care much.

345
00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:15.429
Since I was going to toss away the book anyway.

346
00:19:16.429 --> 00:19:18.629
But, I couldn't bring myself to do so.

347
00:19:18.629 --> 00:19:20.029
Because inside that book

348
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:25.029
was the most popular story out of all the ones I had written.

349
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:27.629
"I had written".

350
00:19:27.629 --> 00:19:29.429
Don't tell me...

351
00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:31.929
-Miku stole your work? -What?

352
00:19:33.229 --> 00:19:37.029
Well, since we wrote it together,

353
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:38.729
I suppose it'd be a joint work.

354
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:42.329
She asked me for a favor.

355
00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:45.529
"I got invited to publish a book,

356
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:48.729
so do you mind helping me out?" she said.

357
00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:51.629
Then, that debut work turned out to be a hit,

358
00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:55.529
and before we knew it, she had become a Naomoto awardee.

359
00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:58.329
And I wasn't jealous at that time.

360
00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:00.629
Since I only helped her with that one,

361
00:20:00.629 --> 00:20:03.329
and she had earned the award through her own hard work.

362
00:20:03.329 --> 00:20:06.429
I was even proud to be her friend.

363
00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:08.229
And I thought it was my turn to shine,

364
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:13.229
until I was told this by the publisher I brought my own work to...

365
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:20.329
This is indeed interesting, but 

366
00:20:20.329 --> 00:20:24.129
It's just too much like Miku Sawaguri's literary style.

367
00:20:24.129 --> 00:20:26.529
One Miku Sawaguri is enough.

368
00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:30.229
How about if you try becoming her ghost writer?

369
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.329
I didn't realize it until then.

370
00:20:33.329 --> 00:20:35.029
That she had imitated my writing style

371
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:40.029
and taken it as her own since her debut.

372
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:42.029
So of course I told her,

373
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:43.829
"At the very least, please announce to the public

374
00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:46.929
that your debut work was a joint work with me."

375
00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:49.929
But she retorted,

376
00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:53.029
"Are you trying to smear a Naomoto Award winning author?"

377
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:55.429
and denied my request.

378
00:20:55.429 --> 00:20:59.429
If things went on like that, I'd become a non existent ghost.

379
00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:00.829
That's why...

380
00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:04.429
I decided to make her the ghost instead.

381
00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:06.729
But in the end,

382
00:21:06.729 --> 00:21:10.429
I really should have thrown that book away.

383
00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:15.129
Even if I wanted to read "Death's Funeral Procession",

384
00:21:15.129 --> 00:21:17.729
now It'd just bring back memories of our late nights

385
00:21:17.729 --> 00:21:20.929
conjuring up ideas and racing to put them to paper,

386
00:21:20.929 --> 00:21:22.529
and I could never read it like this.

387
00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:29.029
A book I'm unable to turn a page.

388
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:32.629
There'd be no point of me keeping it.

389
00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:08.029
Shinichi just left without even saying anything?

390
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:09.829
Despite having the nerve to butt in

391
00:23:09.829 --> 00:23:12.729
and give a deduction right in front of you?

392
00:23:12.729 --> 00:23:14.529
Yes.

393
00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:16.529
I picked up the phone again

394
00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.629
after the police came to take the culprit Yuchi away,

395
00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:21.529
but he'd already hung up.

396
00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:26.129
Wearing a skirt?

397
00:23:26.129 --> 00:23:29.929
But, after that, I got an email from Shinichi.

398
00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:31.729
He said "Thanks".

399
00:23:31.729 --> 00:23:36.329
At that time, Shinichi had gone back to his house for some files,

400
00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:39.629
and just so happened to stop by at Dr. Agasa's house..

401
00:23:39.629 --> 00:23:43.529
He could've at least shown his face to his sweetheart, I say.

402
00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:47.029
Perhaps there was a reason he couldn't show his face.

403
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:52.229
Well, thanks to what just happened, I really got it.

404
00:23:52.229 --> 00:23:56.029
That Conan and Kudo are on super good terms with each other.

405
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:59.129
And that you're really tougher than I thought.

406
00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:03.029
Is this about karate?

407
00:24:07.629 --> 00:24:09.329
Hattori says, people collectively,

408
00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:13.529
dubbed them "Hattori of the West and Kudo of the East."

409
00:24:13.529 --> 00:24:15.829
Then, tell me straight up,

410
00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.729
which is the greater detective between the East and West?

411
00:24:17.729 --> 00:24:19.629
Help me, Heiji!

412
00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:22.029
People said that someone died in the restroom

413
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:24.029
of this family restaurant.

414
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:27.529
Between me and Kudo, which is the real awesome detective?

415
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:29.729
Let's make it clear once and for all.

416
00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:33.229
Next Conan Special,

417
00:24:33.229 --> 00:24:36.929
"Deduction Battle Between the Detectives of The East and West"

418
00:24:37.798 --> 00:24:40.098
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:40.098 --> 00:24:42.098
"Kansai Dialect".

420
00:24:42.098 --> 00:24:43.698
-Dad, here's a case. -What happened?

421
00:24:43.698 --> 00:24:45.698
Surprise, it's a one-hour special next week.

422
00:24:45.698 --> 00:24:46.777
You don't say!
