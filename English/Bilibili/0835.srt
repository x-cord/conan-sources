1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,170
Pops goes to visit a client because a warning note of a murder

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,770
was delivered to him.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,570
But when he got there,

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,670
his client, Mr. Yoichi Takarada,

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,370
was stabbed to death by his secretary Mr. Haruyuki Shinkai.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,070
But the fact is Mr. Takarada had been strangled to death

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,470
two hours before that!

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,470
Mr. Shinkai is accused of

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,170
"Haruyuki Shinkai (27)" -destruction of a corpse and was arrested.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,370
In the meantime, from the fingerprints on the warning note of a murder,

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,070
"Koji Takarada (42)" -Mr. Takarada's younger brother, Mr. Koji,

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,770
is suspected of committing the crime

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,570
but thanks to the testimony of Mr. Shinkai,

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,970
Mr. Koji is spared of suspicion.

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,170
On the other hand, his wife Mika, is suspected.

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,170
"Mika Takarada (36)" -Furthermore,

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,470
with the discovery of a wig that served as concrete evidence,

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,370
suspicion about her seems even more conclusive.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,470
A canvas stained black with crime.

20
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,970
Take a good look at the three suspects.

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,070
One of them is a big liar!

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,170
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:51,828
"The Man Who Died Twice (Part 2)"

27
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,828
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She still hasnt confessed?

28
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:58,328
She looked pretty sly.

29
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,528
You must have it tough, Inspector.

30
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,228
If Mrs. Takarada is framed

31
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,228
and made to look as if she had murdered her husband,

32
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:08,328
she would lose her right to inheritance

33
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:12,528
and his younger brother, Koji, would inherit everything.

34
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,328
He probably planned on doing so

35
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,328
but the problem is Mr. Shinkai's testimony of his alibi.

36
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:21,928
Was his testimony false?

37
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,728
What're you mumbling about?

38
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:27,528
What? No. Its nothing.

39
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,528
Yes.

40
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:33,328
About Mr. Haruyuki Shinkai who was arrested yesterday.

41
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:34,928
I have something I want to discuss.

42
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,528
Well, please have a seat.

43
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:42,228
I am Hisashi Teshima.

44
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:43,528
I see.

45
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:46,828
You work at a printing factory?

46
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,928
And? What did you want to say about Mr. Shinkai?

47
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,728
"Hisashi Teshima (28)" -Both Shinkai and I

48
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:56,028
were raised in the same orphanage.

49
00:03:56,028 --> 00:04:00,528
That's why I came wanting to help make his crime a little lighter.

50
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:06,028
Since you seems to have witnessed him committing the crime.

51
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,328
Thats why you came to me?

52
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:09,428
Yes.

53
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:12,728
Shinkai is not a bad guy.

54
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:16,128
He was abandoned by a super selfish mother.

55
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,928
I feel sorry for him.

56
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,628
Super selfish mother?

57
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:22,028
Kid, stay out of this!

58
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,428
Mr. Teshima, I understand how you feel,

59
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:29,828
but I think you should discuss things like this with a lawyer.

60
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:33,428
Its not within my sphere of work.

61
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,228
A lawyer.

62
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:39,128
Yes. I'm sure a lawyer can be of help to you.

63
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:42,128
All right.

64
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,728
I'm sorry to have intruded on you despite your busy schedule.

65
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,328
No problem, I'm sorry I couldn't be of help to you.

66
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,428
Goodbye.

67
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,628
Pops, I'm going out for a while too.

68
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,628
Hey, brat.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,328
What's with him?

70
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,528
Oh, boy. He doesnt know how to clean up.

71
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:08,628
What is it you want to confirm with me?

72
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:11,928
When Mr. Takarada was killed around 1 pm yesterday,

73
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:15,128
you were at a department store in Shinjuku, right?

74
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:19,728
Yeah. So what do you want confirm?

75
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:22,728
It seems that Mr. Shinkai, who testified to your alibi,

76
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:26,128
is saying that he lied about it

77
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:30,028
because he was being threatened by you.

78
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,528
That guy!

79
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,728
Why would he lie like that!

80
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,728
Is he lying?

81
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,528
Tell Detective Mouri who sent you here.

82
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:42,728
That it's no use suspecting me.

83
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,128
I've got other people to testify for me

84
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,928
besides that secretary too, you know?

85
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,328
What?

86
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:51,328
I was called out by phone yesterday

87
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,628
from a guy I dont know.

88
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:56,328
He told me that he knew of a good job to make money of.

89
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:59,228
I was stood up though.

90
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,528
But when I was waiting for that man...

91
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,028
Hey you! I found you, Koji!

92
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:05,228
Bummers!

93
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,328
Hold it!

94
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,428
Give me back my money, Koji!

95
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:13,428
He's a guy named Yaginuma who I cheated money out of before.

96
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:17,528
I was composed even when the police suspected me

97
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:21,928
because I figured Yaginuma could testify for me in the end.

98
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:25,128
Although he may beat me to a pulp.

99
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:32,928
It seems he's not lying.

100
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:36,528
Isn't that what you call fishing in troubled water?

101
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,428
What does he mean by you ran an errand for me?

102
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:43,228
Listen. The one who murdered Takarada is his wife!

103
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,728
She called a man to summon Koji out

104
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:50,428
and erased his alibi to frame him as the perpetrator!

105
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:53,128
But Pops!

106
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:56,328
If so, dont you think its too sloppy?

107
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:58,528
What do you mean?

108
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:00,328
If she wanted to erase his alibi,

109
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,428
she'd want to call him out to a secluded place

110
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,628
with no other people around, right?

111
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,728
Because she didn't do so,

112
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:08,428
a witness like Mr. Yaginuma appeared.

113
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,928
Even the wig that serves as evidence is found

114
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:14,328
because it was thrown away very sloppily.

115
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,628
Geez, what a nuisance.

116
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:21,028
In other words, shes dumb, that selfish woman.

117
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,428
What?

118
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:30,728
Is it okay to finish it off with just one word, like dumb?

119
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,328
I think its unlikely that Mrs. Mika is the perpetrator.

120
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,528
Which means...

121
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,028
I see!

122
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,628
That's why it had to be found!

123
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:48,028
If so...

124
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:51,828
They found fingerprints on the murder warning note.

125
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:55,528
Mr. Koji Takarada, your fingerprints!

126
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,128
It was supposed to be Mika's fingerprints.

127
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:01,828
Wait a second.

128
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,228
It's only natural, right?

129
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:08,028
Because we've found that he's the perpetrator and the case is closed.

130
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,728
Which means...

131
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:14,028
But, if so why did he do something like that?

132
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,028
He contrived it just for that?

133
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,728
Which means, it had all started from the beginning.

134
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,328
That brat. He's up to something again.

135
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,528
"Mouri Detective Agency"

136
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,828
Okay. I understand.

137
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,628
No, something kept bothering me.

138
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:38,728
Goodbye.

139
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,328
I thought so.

140
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:41,728
Thats why.

141
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:42,928
Hey, glasses kid!

142
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,328
What stupid idea did you come up with?

143
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:47,128
Next time you use my name,

144
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:48,428
I'll teach you a lesson, understand?

145
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,928
No matter what kind of background he may have come from...

146
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,628
He's quite famous

147
00:08:56,628 --> 00:09:00,528
for loving to wear flashy things.

148
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:03,628
What if there's a blonde wig or something?

149
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:06,228
He's sure to wear it!

150
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,728
He'd be delighted.

151
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,928
That's why he took it there.

152
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:19,828
Just as expected of a great detective like Mr. Mouri.

153
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:24,128
Like what Mr. Mouri said, I got a call from one of the residents.

154
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,428
"Kinsaku Tomii (58)" -It was an anonymous caller.

155
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:29,828
But he said that a suspicious person seems to have gone upstairs.

156
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:33,028
That's why I went to make my rounds

157
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:36,028
and encountered that blonde woman.

158
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:38,728
Just as I thought, it wasn't a coincidence.

159
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:49,128
The only thing needed now is decisive evidence.

160
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,828
Come to think of it, back then...

161
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:09,228
Just what's going on, Inspector?

162
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:11,628
What do you mean?

163
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:14,528
You're the one that told me to bring these three here, right?

164
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,628
What?

165
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:19,028
You're the one who said youve figured out the truth of the case.

166
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:27,528
So, now, people.

167
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,828
It's time for me to tell you all about this case.

168
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:48,195
We made a mistake from the very start.

169
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:50,795
We assumed that someone in the family was responsible for the murder,

170
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:54,195
and by doing so we immediately eliminated the real perpetrator.

171
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:57,595
Eliminated the real perpetrator?

172
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:58,795
Yes.

173
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:02,495
The perpetrator who killed Mr. Yoichi Takarada is...

174
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,695
Mr. Haruyuki Shinkai over there!

175
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:14,195
Mr. Shinkai is the perpetrator?

176
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,595
Mr. Mouri?

177
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:19,595
If he strangled Mr. Takarada to death,

178
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:25,195
then why did he have to stab Mr. Takarada again two hours later?

179
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:27,795
Rather to begin with

180
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:30,295
I have an alibi at the time

181
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,695
when the president was killed.

182
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:34,495
It's true that Mr. Shinkai confessed that

183
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:37,795
as long as Mr. Takarada was around,

184
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:40,795
new victims will keep being created so he had plans to kill him.

185
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:45,695
But that's not why he murdered Mr. Takarada.

186
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:49,195
Mr. Shinkai, as Mr. Takarada's secretary,

187
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:54,895
you knew that Mika remained married to Mr. Takarada for his money.

188
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:58,195
Where is all this coming from all of a sudden?

189
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,995
Mr. Takarada probably told you himself

190
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:03,695
that he had only six months to live.

191
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:06,395
In other words, in six months,

192
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,295
she'd be inheriting the entire estate

193
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,295
and insurance money that shed long waited for.

194
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,795
And you couldn't stand that.

195
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:18,895
That's when you came up with the idea

196
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:20,895
of killing Mr. Takarada

197
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:24,695
and framing Mika as the killer.

198
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:28,995
Then she would lose the right to inherit his estate

199
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:30,395
and his insurance money.

200
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:36,295
In other words, it's not that you really wanted to kill Mr. Takarada,

201
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:39,595
but you killed him only to frame Mika up

202
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,695
for killing her husband.

203
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:44,495
What?

204
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:48,295
You're not making any sense.

205
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:52,395
It seems you have your mind set on making me the real perpetrator,

206
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:55,095
but you just contradicted yourself.

207
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:57,495
If I wanted to frame her as the murderer,

208
00:12:57,495 --> 00:13:02,295
I would've had to put her fingerprints on the murder warning note!

209
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:05,395
But my fingerprints were on it.

210
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,195
True.

211
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,395
It's contradictory.

212
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:14,295
When Koji, the perfect pawn, came to the house,

213
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,895
you put your plan into action.

214
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:20,295
Why aren't you answering my counterargument?

215
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:22,595
You created a murder warning note

216
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:25,495
with Kojis fingerprints on it then sent it.

217
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:28,295
So, I'm telling you that's contradictory!

218
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,495
That arrived yesterday.

219
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,095
I'd like to see them try it!

220
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:42,595
Later, you urged Mr. Takarada to confine himself to this study alone.

221
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:43,695
While on the other hand,

222
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:47,795
you told Mika that the president wanted her

223
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:50,695
to organize the storeroom to make sure she stayed at home.

224
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,095
Ma'am, you were asked by your husband

225
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:55,895
to organize the storeroom, correct?

226
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:59,495
Yes, but I wasn't told to do so directly.

227
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,795
I relayed the message from the president to her.

228
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,095
You planned this so she would have no one

229
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,995
to back up her alibi.

230
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:10,395
But the house maid was at the house too.

231
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:13,595
You knew that she'd be going out, didnt you?

232
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:14,595
"Kyoko, Afternoon, Hospital" -Yes.

233
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:18,095
Not only Koji, but I'm sure that everyone else knew too.

234
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,195
Because as soon as I got the appointment,

235
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,195
I marked it on the calendar like this

236
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,595
because I didn't want to inconvenience anybody.

237
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:26,995
I may have heard about it, but I forgot.

238
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,195
Then, you called me,

239
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,395
pretending to be Mr. Takarada.

240
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,295
Since I never met him,

241
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,295
I had no idea what he would sound like.

242
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:39,395
You have no proof either that I made the call.

243
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,695
You also pretended to be an imaginary person

244
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:45,095
and got Koji to leave the house.

245
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:47,195
Was that you?

246
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:50,295
You dont have proof that it was me then, either.

247
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:54,795
Then, at 1 pm you came to this condominium.

248
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:58,595
I followed Koji and was in Shinjuku

249
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,395
among the crowd of parents and children there who came to watch.

250
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,295
The hero show.

251
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:04,095
If you insist you followed him there,

252
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:08,195
then perhaps you can tell us about the commotion that occurred.

253
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:10,495
Theres no way you didnt see it

254
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,995
if you were really there.

255
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,395
Hey, you! I found you, Koji!

256
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:16,795
Bummers!

257
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:18,695
Hold it!

258
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:22,295
You could've known about the hero show ahead of time,

259
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,595
and you could've assumed that

260
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,195
it would naturally be crowded with parents and children too.

261
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:30,795
Even without going there.

262
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:35,795
Of course, you're suspecting me because you have proof?

263
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,495
Yesterday around 1 pm,

264
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,695
you avoided the security cameras

265
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,995
and came into this condominium from the back door.

266
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:43,595
You gained access into his room

267
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,595
by pretending you had urgent business to attend to or something.

268
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:50,395
And strangled Mr. Takarada to death.

269
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,395
Then you left only the murder warning note that you brought

270
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,595
from the condominium room,

271
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:56,495
you wore a blonde wig,

272
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,595
disguised yourself as a woman resident

273
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:01,895
and called the condominium manager

274
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,295
to make him witness you.

275
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,295
You put several strands of Mika's hair on the wig that you used,

276
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:09,895
and to make the investigator discover this wig,

277
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,595
you shoved it into the belongings of a person,

278
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,095
who was known for his love for disguising,

279
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:16,895
then came back to this room again

280
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,795
and waited for me at 3 pm the appointed time.

281
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,595
It must be beyond on the other side.

282
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:25,295
Geez, you're always.

283
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,595
This is not play, you know?

284
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,295
Then you waited for the right time and...

285
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,695
Die!

286
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:39,695
You called me to make me witness that decisive moment.

287
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:43,295
Since I have the absolute trust of the police!

288
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:49,595
Nobody would attempt to kill a man

289
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:52,595
who is already dead.

290
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,995
You hid behind the blind spot of this stereotyped conception.

291
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:02,395
I thought the president was alive.

292
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:04,995
When I came to visit him,

293
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,495
he seemed to be taking a nap,

294
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:10,095
so I figured I should take this chance to stab him.

295
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,595
After being arrested for mutilating a body,

296
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:17,495
you fabricated plausible sounding lies,

297
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,195
while waiting for your schemes to take effect.

298
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:23,995
Those were all fabricated lies?

299
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,895
And just as you planned,

300
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:30,195
Koji was suspected due to his fingerprints are on the warning note.

301
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,995
That's what doesn't make sense!

302
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:37,895
That's precisely what made me suspect you.

303
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:39,395
Because of those fingerprints,

304
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:41,795
Koji was almost concluded as the murderer

305
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,395
and the case was about to be closed.

306
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:47,095
Therefore, Mika was ecstatic.

307
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:50,995
I've been waiting all this time for this moment to come!

308
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,895
Thank you so much, Koji.

309
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:58,995
She didn't have to wait six months ahead of time anymore.

310
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,295
However, the situation suddenly changed.

311
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:04,495
Now the situations reversed

312
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:06,995
because I've got somebody to prove my alibi

313
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:10,395
while you don't.

314
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:13,095
Mika now, had nobody to back up her alibi.

315
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,495
And furthermore, with the discovery of the material evidence.

316
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,995
It can't be...

317
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,495
I know nothing about the wig.

318
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:24,995
I was here at home at the time Takarada was killed!

319
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,495
Believe me, officers!

320
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:28,595
In other words,

321
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,295
the perpetrator deliberately

322
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:33,395
made a murder warning note with Kojis fingerprints on it.

323
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:37,895
So that Mika would feel a moment of ecstasy

324
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:41,395
before suddenly being thrown into despair!

325
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:45,095
Oh, no.

326
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:48,395
It was a reversal filled with hatred for Mika.

327
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:54,095
Of course it started when you reversed your alibi testimony.

328
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:57,895
Thats when I began suspecting you as the perpetrator,

329
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,795
Mr. Shinkai.

330
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:03,395
This is all too forced.

331
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,895
Please show me the evidence, Mr. Mouri!

332
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,195
All your deductions are nothing more than hypothesis!

333
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,895
Since you're so careful,

334
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,995
theres likely no physical evidence.

335
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,495
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

336
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,895
So, you admit that it was all your imagination.

337
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:23,295
But, you were too careful.

338
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,395
Just what do you mean?

339
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:29,795
The resident living across this room saw you yesterday.

340
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,795
What?

341
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,395
It happened around 2:30 pm.

342
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:39,195
Because it was more than an hour before what was reported in the papers,

343
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,695
they seem to have thought it was irrelevant to the case.

344
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:48,095
In other words, although you were supposed to be here by 2:30,

345
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,495
you stabbed Mr. Takarada at 3 pm.

346
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:54,795
In other words, your story of stabbing Mr. Takarada

347
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:58,195
because he seemed to be taking a nap

348
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,995
doesn't make sense!

349
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,795
But, Mr. Mouri...

350
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:07,595
It won't serve to support the killing.

351
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:11,095
True.

352
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:13,295
No, its over.

353
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:17,995
It was supposed to be perfect.

354
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:21,295
But exposing even a single flaw means I've lost.

355
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:27,295
Of course I was careful, Mr. Mouri.

356
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,595
Although our appointment was at 3 pm,

357
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,395
you could come earlier.

358
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:35,695
Thats why I rushed back over here, and was looking out the window for you,

359
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:39,595
so I would be ready no matter what time you came.

360
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,395
If the timing was wrong,

361
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:45,095
I would be able to hide behind the blind spot of stereotyped conception.

362
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,695
Which means, Mr. Shinkai...

363
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:49,095
Yes.

364
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:51,295
Everything is just as Mr. Mouri had said.

365
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:52,395
Everything.

366
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,295
Why?

367
00:20:56,295 --> 00:21:00,995
Why'd you go as far as to kill Takarada just to frame me?

368
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:03,595
It shouldnt matter to you

369
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,395
whether I inherit his estate or get insurance money!

370
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:07,695
True.

371
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,295
Why, Shinkai?

372
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:14,295
Its because he saw his mother in you.

373
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:19,595
Mr. Teshima told me.

374
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:23,795
About Mr. Shinkais selfish mother you mentioned?

375
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:28,195
I loved my father.

376
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:29,795
Although he was physically weak,

377
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,795
he was knowledgeable and kind.

378
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:36,895
But Mother shunned Father.

379
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,595
Nevertheless, she wouldnt agree to a divorce.

380
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,695
Father eventually passed away,

381
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:43,695
and as soon as she got hold of his insurance money,

382
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,895
she disappeared off somewhere with a man.

383
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:51,995
Abandoning me who had just turned 10 years old.

384
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:55,895
But that has nothing to do with me.

385
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:57,695
I know!

386
00:21:57,695 --> 00:22:01,695
I know but watching you made me...

387
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:33,695
Apparently, the perpetrator mutilated the body to camouflage the murder.

388
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:38,895
I solved another case without knowing it again!

389
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:41,395
Its a miracle, you must be God!

390
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:43,295
God? I see.

391
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:44,795
So, I'm a god?

392
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:51,795
Its a miracle you haven't realized what's going on yet.

393
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:57,895
"Next Episode" -Let's make a girls high school band, us three!

394
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,295
Who's going to be the vocalist?

395
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:01,295
-What? -What?

396
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:04,195
Sorry, I'm tone-deaf.

397
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:07,395
Hagie...

398
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:14,595
Haven't we met before?

399
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,895
No.

400
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:18,195
I think today is the first time.

401
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:24,379
Next Conan, "A Girls Band on Bad Terms (Part 1)"

402
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,538
Next Conans Hint:

403
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:29,238
"Security camera"

404
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:31,338
Ran and the others say theyre going to start a band.

405
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,338
A joke band?

406
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,738
A JK Band! (JK means high school girls)
