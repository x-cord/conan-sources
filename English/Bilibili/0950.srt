1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,770
Nichiuri TV and Radio Production Unit Producer,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,570
Teruomi Manda, is a superficial man

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,570
who's been living off his glibness alone.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,070
And Mr. Manda secretly murdered his estranged wife, Towako,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,170
because she wouldn't agree to a divorce.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,070
Furthermore, he used the radio show that he produces

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,570
to frame Towako's upstairs neighbor, Mrs. Kumi Kijima.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,370
However, he couldn't deceive the eyes of the police.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,070
Isn't this a premeditated murder?

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,070
Could Mr. Manda really have come up with this

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,570
if he's all talk?

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,670
He was just that desperate to divorce his wife.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,970
Hey, Ms. Yashiro.

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,470
Those two seem to really hate Mr. Manda.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,970
-What? -Are you saying one of them did it

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,570
and is trying to frame Mr. Manda?

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,570
I just thought it might be a possibility.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,970
"Even if the boy suspects something, it's too late"

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,970
"Everything has gone according to plan"

20
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,870
You underestimate me.

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,070
I'll definitely expose the truth.

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,770
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,770
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,870
A strange case takes place at a radio station!

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,770
The grinning culprit stands above the law!

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,170
His name is Detective Conan!

"The Radio Questions and Concerns Show (Solution Arc)"

30
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,427
"Nichiuri TV"

31
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,127
You still think they did it?

32
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:52,227
They really seemed to hate Mr. Manda.

33
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:55,027
"Ninosuke Inuyama (38)" -I know all about you, Mr. Manda.

34
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,927
You're secretly scheming to prevent me

35
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:01,627
from becoming independent.

36
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:04,027
"Mamoru Kujirai (35)" -You don't love radio!

37
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,927
You never have.

38
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:09,527
You only think of your programs as tools to make yourself rich.

39
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,127
You misappropriate them for your personal use!

40
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,627
I suppose.

41
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,527
It's clear that they found him disagreeable.

42
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:19,527
But remember what Ms. Kaede Yashiro said?

43
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:23,527
"Kaede Yashiro (32)" -It's true that they don't get along with Mr. Manda,

44
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,827
but I can't believe they'd kill his wife

45
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,327
just to get at him.

46
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:30,827
Yeah, but...

47
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:32,927
Hurry up and eat your food.

48
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,727
Then we're leaving.

49
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,227
Hey, wasn't that Yoko Okino?

50
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:43,027
What? Yoko's here?

51
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:44,727
Where?

52
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,927
This way? That way?

53
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,027
What?

54
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,327
Miss!

55
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:58,727
"Rie Abe (24)" -It's true that Mr. Manda

56
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:02,127
was trying to prevent Mr. Inuyama from becoming independent.

57
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:05,427
But I doubt he'd be able to stop Mr. Inuyama

58
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:07,527
if he really wanted to quit working for the station.

59
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:08,627
Right?

60
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:12,927
Mr. Kujirai didn't get along with Mr. Manda either, right?

61
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,727
Mr. Kujirai's such a serious person.

62
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:20,127
He'd never get along with the slick Mr. Manda.

63
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:23,427
Honestly, he was disgusted with him.

64
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:27,927
That incompetent fool shouldn't be working in radio.

65
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,427
Incompetent?

66
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,927
It's apparently about a drama Mr. Manda put on

67
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,627
while he was a director.

68
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:37,827
But it's an old story so I don't know much about it.

69
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:40,227
Oh, I remember now.

70
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:41,327
Huh?

71
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:46,127
I think that old drama was Ms. Yashiro's debut work.

72
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,427
What?

73
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:52,327
You can read it in this reception area.

74
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:54,927
-I'll be right over there. -Thank you.

"He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye"

76
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:58,527
This single drama made Ms. Yashiro think

77
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:01,527
she owed Mr. Manda everything

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,927
while also making Mr. Kujirai think he was incompetent.

79
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:08,127
How can that be?

80
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,327
She's not here either.

81
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,927
Where are you, Yoko Okino?

82
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:14,927

83
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,127
Isn't this...

86
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:23,827
What is it?

87
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:29,227
Pops said he'd like to hear a recording of this drama.

88
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:32,927
Sure. I'll submit a request to the records department.

89
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,927
Yoko!

90
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,827
So that's how it is. Anyway...

This name, Towako Adachi...

93
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,827
No, that's not possible.

94
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,727
They wouldn't have said that.

"Producer - Yoshitaka Kamio"

96
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,827
I see. So that's how it is.

97
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:08,027
No, that's all I need to know.

98
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,327
Goodbye.

99
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,927
Which means...

100
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:15,227
Oh, so that's why?

101
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,327
That's why he drank

102
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:19,427
even though he was about to go on the air.

103
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:23,427
And someone said during the post show meeting

104
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:27,027
that they wished Mr. Manda's wife's upstairs neighbor

105
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,327
could've heard the show, right?

106
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,427
Yes.

107
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:33,427
Do you know who said that?

108
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,927
I think it was...

109
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:39,627
I knew it.

110
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:43,227
They used the concern that was submitted by coincidence

111
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,627
in their plan.

112
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:45,927
Where are you?

113
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:50,527
Why can't I find you, Yoko?

114
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,427
Coincidence?

115
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:56,927
It can't be coincidence that such a convenient concern was submitted.

116
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,527
The listener, TM, isn't the victim, Towako Manda.

117
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:07,727
It's someone completely different named Tsugumi Mourikawa.

118
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,927
Could it be?

119
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,627
Hello?

120
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:15,727
Yes, I'm Tsugumi Mourikawa.

Thank you.

124
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:29,627
Once I get the results of the investigation I requested.

125
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,727
"Nichuri TV" -You darn brat!

126
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:34,027
Take a look.

127
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:38,127
Yoko couldn't possibly be here.

128
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:40,327
She's in Hawaii?

129
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:41,427
We're leaving.

130
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,627
I need to use the bathroom first.

131
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,227
Hey, wait!

132
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,127
That darn brat.

133
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:52,127
Hello?

134
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,427
Ah, Inspector.

135
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:55,827
What?

136
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,927
I see.

137
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:01,627
I'm actually still at Nichiuri TV.

138
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,527
What?

139
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,727
But why?

140
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:08,727
Hello...

141
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,027
Hello, Inspector?

142
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,527
I feel better now.

143
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:13,727
Should we go?

144
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,927
We can't leave.

145
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,127
What?

146
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,227
I don't know why but the Inspector told me

147
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:20,427
to wait because he was on his way.

148
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,527
And he told me to gather all the staff again.

149
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:25,927
I wonder why.

150
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:32,527
What do the police want now?

151
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,427
The situation's become complicated

152
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,927
since they found out the victim was Mr. Manda's wife, right?

153
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:41,327
Inspector.

154
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,727
What is it, Mouri?

155
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:47,227
I heard you asked my officers

156
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:49,527
to bring Mr. Manda here.

157
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:53,127
What? You told me to wait...

158
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,527
Told me to wait for you here...

159
00:09:57,527 --> 00:10:00,427
Is this the rumored Sleeping Kogoro?

160
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,827
Inspector,

161
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:04,127
about the case of Towako Manda's murder

162
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:09,527
by her husband and suspect Teruomi Manda.

163
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,827
The plot lurking behind it

164
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:15,027
most likely began a month ago.

165
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:20,427
When Mr. Manda was brought here as the new producer.

166
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:37,893
When Mr. Manda was assigned

167
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:39,893
to be the new producer of the show,

168
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:41,593
Mr. Inuyama,

169
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:45,693
he told you about his wife then, correct?

170
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,993
Yes, well...

171
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:49,493
At the welcoming party,

172
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:51,293
we were socially obligated to throw.

173
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:52,993
Gosh.

174
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:58,793
I wish my awful wife would just disappear.

175
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:01,093
I met her the other day about the divorce,

176
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,293
and she wouldn't stop complaining.

177
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:06,093
Something about her obnoxious upstairs neighbor

178
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:08,693
at her apartment.

179
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:12,293
That's not my problem, you know?

180
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:14,693
Right?

181
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,893
When they heard that,

182
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,493
the culprit came up with their plan.

183
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,093
They'd murder Mr. Manda's wife

184
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,793
and frame him for it.

185
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,693
Isn't that right, Ms. Kaede Yashiro?

186
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:30,793
What?

187
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,693
Why would I frame Mr. Manda

188
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:39,493
when I owe him everything?

189
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,093
Mr. Mouri!

190
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,393
You were right.

191
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:47,593
When we showed this photo you sent us

192
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:51,193
to the residents of Towako Manda's apartment building,

193
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:54,393
several of them remembered you.

194
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:57,593
They said half a month ago, you were asking around

195
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,593
about Towako Manda's upstairs neighbor, Mrs. Kumi Kijima.

196
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:01,893
They said they told you that

197
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:07,193
Mrs. Kijima goes bar-hopping every Friday night.

198
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,793
That's why you decided to do it on a Friday, isn't it?

199
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:14,493
Just because I asked about Mrs. Kijima,

200
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:18,193
that doesn't make me the culprit.

201
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:22,293
There's also the radio show submission.

202
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:25,493
You forged that, didn't you?

203
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:27,893
What?

204
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:35,793
I checked in with your friend, Tsugumi Mourikawa.

205
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:41,293
I heard from Ms. Yashiro that she asked you to do it.

206
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,993
What?

207
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,893
Oh, Kaede admitted it herself?

208
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:50,593
She made me promise not to tell anyone.

209
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:55,793
We don't get enough interesting submissions.

210
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:59,693
I can write the submission myself,

211
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:00,793
but if it's chosen,

212
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:04,193
the station calls the listener.

213
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,893
So you want me to pretend I wrote it.

214
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:09,193
Sure. You can count on me.

215
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:11,593
Thanks.

216
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:13,793
You asked Tsugumi Mourikawa

217
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,893
because her initials are TM.

218
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:19,193
The same as Towako Manda's.

219
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:24,393
It was necessary to involve Mrs. Kumi Kijima.

220
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:27,293
Using Mrs. Mourikawa's name,

221
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:28,793
you wrote a fictitious submission

222
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,893
that would make Mrs. Kumi Kijima

223
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,993
believe it was Towako Manda.

224
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,993
Nothing will happen

225
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,293
if this doesn't get picked up first.

226
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:42,393
I hope they decide to use it.

227
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:45,693
Once the submission arrived at the station,

228
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:48,993
you selected it for Friday's show.

229
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,793
As the show organizer,

230
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,993
it was your responsibility

231
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:56,093
to select submissions for the show.

232
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,193
Yesterday, on the day of your crime,

233
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:01,193
you gave a plausible excuse to make me drink.

234
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,293
They said Mr. Mouri performs better

235
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:06,493
when he's had a drink or two.

236
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:07,593
You got me drunk

237
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,493
"Mr. Mouri, you're the best!" -and worked up.

238
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:12,793
After inciting me to make rude comments during the show,

239
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,393
during the post show meeting...

240
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:20,393
I wish the woman living above Mr. Manda's wife

241
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,793
listened to todays show too.

242
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,893
That's when I realized something interesting might happen.

243
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,893
You've gotta strike when the iron's hot.

244
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:33,293
You incited Mrs. Kumi Kijima

245
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:37,093
to fight with Towako Manda.

246
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,493
They don't even know they're being manipulated.

247
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:42,193
It's all going exactly according to plan.

248
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:44,993
And after all that scheming, you...

249
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:48,093
What do you want?

250
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,593
It's the middle of the night.

251
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:02,993
But, Mouri,

252
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:06,493
even if she plotted to frame Mr. Manda

253
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,293
for his wife's murder,

254
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:12,593
why did she need to involve Mrs. Kumi Kijima?

255
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,693
Because even though he has a motive,

256
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:18,293
not having an alibi wasn't a compelling enough reason

257
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,993
to suspect him.

258
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:25,593
Inciting Mrs. Kijima to attack his wife

259
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:29,893
guaranteed suspicion would fall on Mr. Manda.

260
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:34,593
Naturally, Mrs. Kijima would be suspected for a while,

261
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:36,993
but her alibi would be verified

262
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:40,993
since she spent her Fridays bar-hopping.

263
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:44,793
But the police were struggling to verify her alibi.

264
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,693
That's when you asked me.

265
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,093
Mr. Mouri, I have a request.

266
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:54,493
Please prove Mrs. Kumi Kijima's innocence.

267
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:58,293
You wanted suspicion to be shifted

268
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:01,893
from Mrs. Kijima to Mr. Manda was quickly as possible.

269
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:06,793
You had me come on as a guest,

270
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,793
in case the police took too long

271
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:12,693
to verify Mrs. Kijima's alibi, didn't you?

272
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:15,893
So everything was calculated?

273
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,593
But I didn't need to do anything.

274
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:21,293
Mrs. Kijima's alibi was verified.

275
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,393
And we suspected Mr. Manda.

276
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:27,593
Just like Ms. Yashiro wanted.

277
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:32,893
However, Conan suspected Mr. Inuyama and Mr. Kujirai,

278
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:37,093
so you hastily denied that possibility.

279
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,093
That's not possible.

280
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:44,193
It's true that they don't get along with Mr. Manda, but...

281
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:49,193
Because you were desperate to frame Mr. Manda.

282
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:54,193
Everything you're saying is just speculation.

283
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:57,093
I doubt you've noticed,

284
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:00,193
but you keep repeating a certain action.

285
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:05,993
When suspicion fell on Mr. Manda because of the CD.

286
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,393
Inspector Megure.

287
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,193
How did it go, Takagi?

288
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,693
Yes, sir. About that...

289
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:18,493
When we learned Mrs. Kijima was innocent.

290
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:22,293
When Mr. Manda was the only suspect.

291
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:26,793
And when Mr. Manda was taken away.

292
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:29,793
You touched the band-aid on the back of your neck.

293
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,593
Every time things went according to plan.

294
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:38,093
You must've been unconsciously worried

295
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:42,193
about the mark left there by your crime.

296
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,493
That's it.

297
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:45,693
The sample sent for DNA testing.

298
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,893
Left under the victim's fingernails...

299
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,493
The blood.

300
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:52,193
In her final struggle,

301
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,293
Towako Manda scratched the back of her killer's neck.

302
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:57,393
Am I wrong, Ms. Yashiro?

303
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:05,393
I thought I'd won.

304
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:08,493
I never stood a chance against the great detective.

305
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,393
Ms. Yashiro.

306
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,993
But why?

307
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:20,493
I thought you owed me everything.

308
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:22,793
It was hate, wasn't it?

309
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:24,893
For Mr. Manda and Mrs. Towako.

310
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:28,393
Hate?

311
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:29,393
Over what?

312
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:31,693
When I asked about it...

313
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,993
She was a rising artist?

314
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:38,493
It seems that way.

315
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,093
But your answer was strange.

316
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:43,593
Conan, the script.

317
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:44,893
Okay!

318
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:51,593
Mr. Manda's wife's maiden name was Towako Adachi.

319
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:53,093
Seven years ago,

320
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:55,093
"Cast - Towako Adachi as Kiko Isaka" -she played the leading role

321
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,293
in your debut work.

322
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:01,193
But you tried to hide that,

323
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,593
which means it must have something to do with the crux of this case.

324
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,593
"He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye".

325
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,893
It's a very good script.

326
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,293
It's a masterpiece.

327
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:14,493
It's a masterful depiction of a person's feelings

328
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:16,193
for the lover they suddenly lost.

329
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:18,093
Truly a rare masterpiece.

330
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,293
But once it became a drama,

331
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,493
you couldn't stand to listen to it.

332
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:26,493
Because the director didn't understand any of it.

333
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,793
And...

334
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,793
Towako Adachi's infantile performance.

335
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:34,593
It was truly awful.

336
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:37,193
Worse than a school play.

337
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:39,293
Right?

338
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:43,193
I told the producer from the start

339
00:19:43,193 --> 00:19:45,793
that she couldn't do it.

340
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,993
You're lying.

341
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:49,693
I checked with Kamio Yoshitaka,

342
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:53,093
the producer at the time.

343
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,993
You're the one who ignored the opposition

344
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,493
and cast her in the lead role.

345
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:04,293
You were already dating Towako Adachi,

346
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,993
and intended it to be a present for her.

347
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:08,693
Am I wrong?

348
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:11,193
That's a true misappropriation of a show!

349
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:16,293
But everyone does it!

350
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:19,893
Ms. Yashiro must've been frustrated.

351
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:23,493
Not because it was her debut work,

352
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:27,893
but because this work depicting the loss of a loved one

353
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,093
is your own experience, isn't it?

354
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:37,593
You wouldn't have been able to write it otherwise.

355
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,393
Mr. Manda,

356
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:46,593
your and Towako's selfishness

357
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:50,793
ruined a work that was important to Ms. Yashiro.

358
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,693
But, Mouri,

359
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:56,493
why would she act on a seven years old grudge now?

360
00:20:56,493 --> 00:21:00,993
Ms. Yashiro probably hadn't been holding a grudge.

361
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,493
But one month ago,

362
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:06,293
Mr. Manda was assigned to be the show's producer.

363
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,693
It had been seven years,

364
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:13,793
but nothing had changed.

365
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:15,793
His superficial glibness

366
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:19,093
and misappropriation of programs had only increased!

367
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:23,593
That old frustration returned,

368
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:28,093
and she decided to seek revenge on the couple.

369
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:32,693
She used a sedative at the staff drinking party last night

370
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:36,293
to make Mr. Manda tired so he'd go home,

371
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,493
in order to ruin his alibi.

372
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:42,393
After that, she headed to Towako Manda's place.

373
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:45,293
What do you want?

374
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:46,793
It's the middle of the night.

375
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:03,993
I poured my soul into it.

376
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:08,393
It was so awful.

377
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,093
Boy, I'm beat.

378
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:41,893
I don't think I'm fit for radio.

379
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:45,193
After all, I'm too handsome.

380
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,593
This old man doesn't have a concern in the world.

381
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,293
"Next Episode"

382
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:58,893
Let me take a look.

383
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:02,393
Excuse me, but are these book yours?

384
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:05,293
No, they belong to my husband.

385
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:08,593
You stole these from Mizutani's house, didn't you?

386
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:10,093
No!

387
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:11,893
Mr. Yujiro Tamaki,

388
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:14,493
could you come down to the station with us?

389
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:15,593
No way!

390
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,193
Hand cream?

391
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:18,193
Yes.

392
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:24,293
Next Conan, "The Whistling Bookstore 2"

393
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,336
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:29,236
"Rare book"

395
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:30,336
What's a rare book?

396
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,236
A book that's extremely difficult to find.

397
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,036
Like Detective Mouri.
