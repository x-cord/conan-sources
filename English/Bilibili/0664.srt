00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.140
"Hiroshi Yagisawa (34)"

2
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.840
Good evening, Anera.

3
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.540
Hey, not that way.

4
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.340
What's the matter, Cool?

5
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
If all cases were men,

6
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

7
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.040
There are four marks on the map that was found.

8
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.940
The Youth Detective Squad wonders if it's a treasure or a case.

9
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.740
His name is Detective Conan!

12
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:09.379
"Good Work Cool 2"

13
00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.879
"The following day, Saturday"

14
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.479
Genta, you're licking candy again?

15
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.079
Today it's grape flavour.

16
00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.179
You're licking candy drops a lot

17
00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:22.779
even when we're going to school, right?

18
00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.779
If I lick it just before leaving home,

19
00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.779
I finish licking it just around when I get to school.

20
00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.179
You're going to get cavities.

21
00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.979
I mean, he probably has them already, no?

22
00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.179
Sakaeya Cleaning?

23
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.579
What, what?

24
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.179
It's a map, isn't it?

25
00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.979
Is it a treasure map?

26
00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.679
I don't think so,

27
00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.779
because the four X marks all seem to be houses.

28
00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.479
Maybe they are houses that burglars are targeting?

29
00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.779
Burglars?

30
00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.979
See. There have been a several such burglaries

31
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.479
in the Yonehara community area.

32
00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.779
Idiot.

33
00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:04.479
Why would such a map be drawn in back of a flyer...

34
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.879
I'm sure.

35
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.279
We've got to report it right away.

36
00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.179
Are you guys listening?

37
00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.679
Okay, let's go!

38
00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.079
-All right! -Hey!

39
00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.779
Aren't you going to the library...

40
00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.379
His imagination way far out does yours.

41
00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:19.679
Geez.

42
00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.979
Then, you haven't been burglarized or anything?

43
00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.579
"Ooga" -I'm glad.

44
00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.779
We made it in time didn't we, Mitsuhiko.

45
00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:29.779
Yes.

46
00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.279
"Norifumi Ooga (36)" -But, I wonder if it's really something

47
00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.979
that a burglar drew.

48
00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.979
It's very likely.

49
00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.979
Have you seen any suspicious person

50
00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.679
or encounter any strange occurrences recently?

51
00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.979
Nothing in particular, but...

52
00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.679
Do you know, the three houses?

53
00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:47.979
No.

54
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.579
"Misako (34)" -It sure is creepy.

55
00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:54.479
Why is our house marked with an X?

56
00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.479
Hey, don't go on the grass!

57
00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:00.879
You too.

58
00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.179
I told you not to smoke in front of Tomoya.

59
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.279
"Tomoya (6)" -Sorry.

60
00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.479
What do you do for a living?

61
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.979
I'm a constructor.

62
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.279
At any rate, don't bring strange things over.

63
00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:19.279
How about it?

64
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.179
Do you know anything about the three houses?

65
00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:24.179
"Eguchi" -Nothing in particular.

66
00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:26.979
"Tamae Eguchi (32)" -We haven't been burglarized,

67
00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.179
nor I have I seen anybody suspicious.

68
00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.479
There's been no strange occurrences either.

69
00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.779
Are you living here alone, ma'am?

70
00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.279
Yes.

71
00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.679
What do you do for a living?

72
00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.879
An illustrator.

73
00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.779
So, I guess that's enough already.

74
00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.179
I'm busy, you know.

75
00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.079
How is it?

76
00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.179
Does anything come to mind?

77
00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:03.979
"Shizuko Fujiki (61)" -No.

78
00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.579
Who on earth made something like this?

79
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.579
What's wrong, mother?

80
00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:27.979
Koichi.

81
00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.579
These children say that they found this map.

82
00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:33.079
Map?

83
00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:36.979
See? There's an X mark on our house.

84
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.279
We thought that it could be a map that a burglar drew.

85
00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.679
Have you seen any suspicious people lately?

86
00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:45.479
Were there any strange occurrences and stuff like that?

87
00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.079
"Koichi Fujiki (33)"

88
00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:49.579
I don't think there was any in particular.

89
00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:53.279
Do you know any of those three houses?

90
00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.579
No.

91
00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:56.879
What do you do for a living?

92
00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.479
I'm a businessman.

93
00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.779
I'm getting kind of worried.

94
00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:05.279
No, I don't think it has anything to do with a burglar.

95
00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.279
But, if it bothers you,

96
00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.879
I'll keep this map and take it to the police.

97
00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.979
No, if we find out that is what it is,

98
00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.779
we'll take it to the police.

99
00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.479
-Okay then. -Yes.

100
00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:21.879
Police cars are here?

101
00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.479
"Eitaro Kouzuki" -Kouzuki. It's over here.

102
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.379
Maybe the burglar already broke in here?

103
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.779
Darn, we were too late.

104
00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.679
Hello. Did anything happen at the Kouzuki residence?

105
00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:36.279
Mr. Kouzuki passed away.

106
00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.079
He was found at the bottom of the stairs bleeding from his head

107
00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:44.679
in the underground pass a little ways from here on Beika Boulevard,

108
00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.779
last night around 10:00 pm.

109
00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:49.779
At the bottom of the stairs?

110
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:52.479
Did he fall to his death...

111
00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.279
or is it a murder case?

112
00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.479
So, if anything comes up...

113
00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.479
"Sawako Kouzuki (35)"

114
00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:12.879
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.479
Who is she?

116
00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.779
She's his only daughter, Sawako.

117
00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.679
Maybe this map has nothing to do with a burglary,

118
00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:23.879
but rather has something to do with Mr. Kouzuki's case.

119
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.679
What do you mean?

120
00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:28.579
This map was drawn by that culprit.

121
00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:32.079
And, he is still after somebody in the remaining three houses.

122
00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:35.679
What? What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

123
00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:41.579
Officer, this map...

124
00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:42.779
I'm busy now.

125
00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:44.979
Go ask for directions at the police box.

126
00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.079
What the heck?

127
00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:52.679
I won't give them any information anymore!

128
00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.179
What do you think?

129
00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:55.879
The map, do we have a case?

130
00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:59.079
No connection. I'd like to say but...

131
00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:02.479
At any rate, let's go take a look at the site.

132
00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:05.679
Hey, you guys, wait for me at the library park.

133
00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:08.779
Where are you going?

134
00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:18.979
What is it?

135
00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:22.179
Did the dead person's hand really smell of cigarette?

136
00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:23.979
Yes, sir. No mistake about it.

137
00:09:23.979 --> 00:09:25.679
When I got there,

138
00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:28.179
I smelled it slightly from his bloody right hand.

139
00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:32.279
But, his daughter told me that he doesn't smoke.

140
00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.379
Moreover, there were no cigarette butts near the scene of the crime.

141
00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:38.479
Strange.

142
00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:39.879
Cigarette.

143
00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.979
Conan sure is late.

144
00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:44.479
While we're doing this,

145
00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:46.179
the evil hands of the culprit may be...

146
00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:48.479
Say, why don't we do our thing on our own...

147
00:09:48.479 --> 00:09:51.779
Wait until Conan comes back.

148
00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:52.979
Okay.

149
00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:55.079
It sure is hot, don't you think?

150
00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:57.379
I want ice cream, don't you?

151
00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.979
There's a vending machine in the library.

152
00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:01.979
Let's go get some.

153
00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:03.779
How about you, Ai?

154
00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:05.179
No, thanks.

155
00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:08.379
-Ice cream... -What should I get?

156
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.471
What on earth are they doing?

157
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:52.371
Mr. Yagisawa, hello.

158
00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:55.371
Hi, Conan, long time no see.

159
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:59.471
Cool! How're you doing?

160
00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:02.171
Do you know them?

161
00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:04.571
Yes. I got to solve a murder case

162
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:07.471
thanks to Cool some time ago.

163
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.771
By the way, you guys...

164
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:10.771
We lost the map.

165
00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:16.571
Maybe the culprit of Mr. Kouzuki's incident took it away?

166
00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:19.171
You mean Mr. Kouzuki who passed away last night?

167
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:21.171
Do you know him, Mr. Yagisawa?

168
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:25.471
Rather... Cool's the one who found his body.

169
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:26.971
What?

170
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:30.271
And, that map that you guys are looking for,

171
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:33.571
is it the one with the X mark on Mr. Kouzuki's house

172
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:35.571
as well as three other houses?

173
00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:37.971
How did you know?

174
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:41.371
Because I drew that map.

175
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:49.671
I drew that for my wife who takes Cool for a walk for me at times,

176
00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:50.871
to let her know which houses to be careful of,

177
00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:52.871
by marking them with X marks.

178
00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:56.671
My wife dropped that map while she was walking the dog.

179
00:11:56.671 --> 00:12:00.271
Mrs. Ooga who lives in the first house, has a bad temper.

180
00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:02.771
Back when Cool went a bit into the lawn,

181
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:04.471
she bawled him out.

182
00:12:05.671 --> 00:12:07.471
I thought it better not to let Cool near the 2nd house

183
00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:09.571
which is the Eguchi residence,

184
00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:11.671
because she sprays insecticide on the roses.

185
00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:14.271
Mrs. Eguchi uses organic fertilizer

186
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:15.971
and since dogs like the smell,

187
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:17.471
they tend to go near it, right?

188
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:20.971
Yes, and the 3rd house, the Fujiki residence.

189
00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:22.571
The mother of the house is fussy about cleanliness

190
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:23.871
to the point of being phobic

191
00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:26.771
and hates dog's urine to the extreme.

192
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.371
Right.

193
00:12:28.371 --> 00:12:30.871
How did you know, Conan?

194
00:12:30.871 --> 00:12:34.271
That lady, not only flooded the area around her house

195
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.571
but did the same to the house opposite hers

196
00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:38.871
as well as at the foot of the telephone pole.

197
00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:40.571
I see.

198
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:44.271
And, so Mr. Kouzuki also hated dog urine, right?

199
00:12:44.271 --> 00:12:45.771
Yes.

200
00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:48.671
He used to clean the outside of his house all the time.

201
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:52.071
When Cool almost urinated during his walk,

202
00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:54.171
the man shooed him away with a wooden broom.

203
00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:55.471
Come to think of it,

204
00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:58.071
there were a lot of PET bottles lined out.

205
00:12:58.071 --> 00:12:59.771
Those are to keep cats away.

206
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:02.371
I saw that, I figured it out.

207
00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:04.971
So that's what is was.

208
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:08.171
That map had nothing to do with any case then.

209
00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:12.271
But, another question's come up.

210
00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:18.271
Who could've stolen the map that was drawn for such a trivial reason?

211
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:21.171
The person who stole the map

212
00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:23.671
is probably the one who killed Mr. Kouzuki.

213
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:25.871
What?

214
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:30.671
That person may not have known who or why the map was drawn,

215
00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:31.871
but after Mitsuhiko showed the map

216
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:34.671
that indicated some kind of relationship with Mr. Kouzuki,

217
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:37.371
that person not wanting it to be taken to the police stole it.

218
00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:39.871
Which means...

219
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:42.671
The culprit who killed Mr. Kouzuki

220
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:46.071
is one of the residents of the three houses that we visited.

221
00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:47.471
Oh, no.

222
00:13:49.071 --> 00:13:51.071
They key is...

223
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:52.271
the cigarette.

224
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:53.471
Cigarette?

225
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.571
Talking about cigarettes,

226
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:57.471
that lady called Eguchi was smoking.

227
00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:58.571
Mr. Ooga too.

228
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.371
He tried to smoke one and was stopped by his wife.

229
00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:03.271
Mr. Fujiki...

230
00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:04.871
His son smokes.

231
00:14:05.871 --> 00:14:08.171
He went out of his way to hide the cigarette that he bought

232
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:09.871
in the back pocket of his pants.

233
00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:14.271
His mother probably doesn't like cigarettes.

234
00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:16.371
Talking of cigarettes...

235
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:20.071
about 10 days ago around 8 in the morning.

236
00:14:20.071 --> 00:14:21.371
Darn.

237
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:24.571
Always throwing cigarette butts down like this!

238
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.471
Who the heck can it be?

239
00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:28.671
If I remember correctly,

240
00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:31.671
there were two blue lines on the cigarette.

241
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:33.471
Two blue line?

242
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:36.571
It's the same cigarette that the three were smoking.

243
00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:39.871
Maybe Mr. Kouzuki met the person

244
00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:42.671
who was always disposing cigarettes in front of his house

245
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:45.271
at the underground crosswalk.

246
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:47.071
And, they got into a quarrel.

247
00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:49.671
Then, that person is the culprit?

248
00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:51.871
Who is it, Conan?

249
00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:54.171
I don't know yet.

250
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:55.971
I don't have enough information.

251
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:58.071
If we check Mr. Kouzuki's house,

252
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.571
maybe we'll find the cigarette butts that he gathered.

253
00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:04.571
No, it was probably thrown away yesterday as burnable trash.

254
00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:07.871
Okay. Let's go gather information!

255
00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:09.171
Okay, let's go!

256
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:11.171
Let's split up and carry out interrogation.

257
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:12.271
Hey.

258
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:15.271
All right. I'd like to give the one who stole the map

259
00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:17.171
a taste of his own medicine too.

260
00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:18.471
Not you too.

261
00:15:19.871 --> 00:15:21.771
Okay.

262
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:24.171
Only, don't push yourself too far.

263
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:26.071
If you sense danger in any way,

264
00:15:26.071 --> 00:15:27.371
pull out right away.

265
00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:29.471
-Okay! -Roger!

266
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.271
You can count on us.

267
00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:34.171
Will you draw a map for us again, Mr. Yagisawa?

268
00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:35.171
Okay.

269
00:16:08.671 --> 00:16:10.571
About the cigarette butts...

270
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:13.871
It seems that they were disposed of as burnable trash after all.

271
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:15.371
I see.

272
00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:17.071
It seems that Mr. Ooga walks everyday

273
00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:18.971
to his architecture design office

274
00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:21.571
which is located in front of Beika Station.

275
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:25.471
He leaves his home between 7:30 am and 8:30 am.

276
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:27.571
He comes home at random hours,

277
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:29.771
and last night it seems he came home after 10:00 pm.

278
00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:31.671
Mrs. Eguchi part-times at a club near

279
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:35.371
Beika Station four days a week from evening.

280
00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:37.371
Club? You mean a soccer club?

281
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.771
It seems she came home last night after 10:00 pm too.

282
00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:42.571
Mr. Fujiki also seems to going on foot to Beika Station too.

283
00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:46.871
According to the granny living in the house opposite his,

284
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:51.471
he leaves every morning at 7:00 sharp.

285
00:16:51.471 --> 00:16:54.571
She says she heard the front door close

286
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:55.871
at around after 10:00 last night.

287
00:16:55.871 --> 00:16:59.171
The three commute to Beika Station.

288
00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:01.871
And if they take this course,

289
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:03.671
they would pass in front of Mr. Kouzuki's house

290
00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:06.171
and the underground pass.

291
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:09.371
In other words, it is possible for all three of them

292
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:11.971
to dispose of cigarettes in front of Mr. Kouzuki's house

293
00:17:11.971 --> 00:17:15.471
before 8:00 in the morning or late at night.

294
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:16.871
If she's not in the soccer club,

295
00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:18.571
maybe she's in the baseball club?

296
00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:21.771
I asked the cleaning man at the underground pass

297
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:24.171
and was told that he also sees the same brand cigarette butt

298
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:26.071
on the ground all the time.

299
00:17:26.071 --> 00:17:27.871
Blue line.

300
00:17:27.871 --> 00:17:29.271
Last night at around 10:00,

301
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:33.271
one of the three disposed of a cigarette butt at the underground pass.

302
00:17:33.271 --> 00:17:35.271
Mr. Kouzuki who happened to see that,

303
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.571
got into an argument with that person.

304
00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:39.871
You're the one who's always throwing cigarette butts

305
00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:41.871
in front of my house.

306
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:02.471
That's why there was no cigarette butt near the corpse.

307
00:18:02.471 --> 00:18:06.871
The problem is, who of the three is the culprit?

308
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:09.271
Come on, what club is she in?

309
00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:12.271
Oh, no!

310
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:14.271
Genta, how filthy!

311
00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:18.171
I was almost finished licking it.

312
00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:20.171
What a waste.

313
00:18:20.171 --> 00:18:21.271
Finished licking?

314
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:22.771
Finished smoking.

315
00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.571
Maybe...

316
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:26.871
But, the proof...

317
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:31.871
Hey, I've got something I want to confirm.

318
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.571
Let's go, all of us.

319
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.071
Cool too.

320
00:18:48.071 --> 00:18:50.871
The flow of the river is fast after all.

321
00:18:53.571 --> 00:18:55.071
Somebody's there.

322
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:03.171
It's Mrs. Eguchi.

323
00:19:03.171 --> 00:19:04.771
What?

324
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:06.271
She looks different

325
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.371
because she's got make-up on.

326
00:19:15.771 --> 00:19:17.171
She laughed.

327
00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:18.571
Very suspicious.

328
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:20.671
Okay, let's follow her.

329
00:19:22.271 --> 00:19:23.771
It's floated away.

330
00:19:23.771 --> 00:19:25.871
The cigarette butt that would've served as evidence.

331
00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:27.571
It'll be hard to prove.

332
00:19:37.671 --> 00:19:40.871
Just as nasty as ever.

333
00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:43.871
She's throwing her cigarette on the ground again.

334
00:19:43.871 --> 00:19:45.471
What a lady.

335
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:51.271
-Good evening. -Good evening.

336
00:19:52.271 --> 00:19:53.871
You're a good girl,

337
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:55.371
but you still bark.

338
00:19:55.371 --> 00:19:57.371
Depending on the person.

339
00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:59.671
Especially anyone who looks suspicious.

340
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:01.771
Ai.

341
00:20:01.771 --> 00:20:04.271
We've got to hurry and go after Mrs. Eguchi.

342
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:10.171
That person is...

343
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:11.671
Mr. Ooga.

344
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:13.071
What's going on?

345
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:15.971
I see.

346
00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:18.671
Not again.

347
00:20:18.671 --> 00:20:22.071
There seems to be a woman who always litters.

348
00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:23.271
Always?

349
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:31.671
What's up, Cool?

350
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:35.771
The men forgot to take that,

351
00:20:35.771 --> 00:20:38.071
so I had no choice but to keep it.

352
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.171
Maybe...

353
00:20:54.571 --> 00:20:56.771
It... it can't be.

354
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:58.971
I threw that cigarette into the river.

355
00:20:58.971 --> 00:21:01.571
You threw a different cigarette butt into that river.

356
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:03.271
A different one?

357
00:21:03.271 --> 00:21:04.671
Mr. Fujiki,

358
00:21:04.671 --> 00:21:07.771
last night, after grabbing the cigarette butt from Mr. Kouzuki's hand,

359
00:21:07.771 --> 00:21:10.471
you ran towards your house, didn't you?

360
00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:13.871
Then, a black dog suddenly barked at you

361
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:15.571
so didn't you drop the butt?

362
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:18.571
Mr. Fujiki that was looking around

363
00:21:18.571 --> 00:21:20.771
for the cigarette butt in the dark in a rush,

364
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:23.671
found it and picked it up.

365
00:21:23.671 --> 00:21:26.971
Since it was the same brand,

366
00:21:26.971 --> 00:21:28.271
as well as had a red stain on the filter,

367
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:29.571
thought it was the one he was looking for,

368
00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:32.371
ran off again and threw it into the river.

369
00:21:32.371 --> 00:21:36.771
But the one that Mr. Fujiki picked up was that of someone else.

370
00:21:36.771 --> 00:21:39.171
What he thought was blood was lipstick.

371
00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:41.271
The butt that Mr. Fujiki dropped was found

372
00:21:41.271 --> 00:21:45.271
in between the recycle bin in front of the house.

373
00:23:17.271 --> 00:23:21.471
Mr. Ooga had an affair with Mrs. Eguchi behind his wife's back.

374
00:23:21.471 --> 00:23:26.171
Yes, that's why his facial expression changed when he saw the map.

375
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.671
When did you figure out he was the culprit?

376
00:23:28.671 --> 00:23:31.071
I wasn't that sure.

377
00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:34.071
I just assumed that the culprit started smoking the cigarette

378
00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:35.671
from in front of the station.

379
00:23:35.671 --> 00:23:38.071
It takes 400 meters to get to the underground pass,

380
00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:40.371
so I figured that was the distance it would take

381
00:23:40.371 --> 00:23:43.271
for the culprit to just finish smoking.

382
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:45.371
Then, I took a look at the house that would take

383
00:23:45.371 --> 00:23:48.571
about the same distance as from Mr. Kouzuki's house.

384
00:23:48.571 --> 00:23:50.671
I see.

385
00:23:50.671 --> 00:23:55.071
Okay, I guess I'll give the great detective a treat then.

386
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.471
I don't care for anything like that.

387
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:59.071
What the...

388
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:02.471
Great Detective, here's your beef jerky treat.

389
00:24:03.971 --> 00:24:05.971
So, she wasn't talking about me.

390
00:24:10.271 --> 00:24:11.871
Sir, over there.

391
00:24:13.471 --> 00:24:14.671
"K".

392
00:24:14.671 --> 00:24:16.771
Could this be a dying message?

393
00:24:16.771 --> 00:24:20.171
I can't let him live.

394
00:24:20.171 --> 00:24:23.071
That guy doesn't deserve to live.

395
00:24:23.071 --> 00:24:25.471
Both their initials are K.

396
00:24:25.471 --> 00:24:27.571
Katsutoshi Kusaka

397
00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:29.571
and Kiwako Kaitani...

398
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:32.471
the culprit is one of the two.

399
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:33.971
Next Conan,

400
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:37.971
"Suspicious Initial K".

401
00:24:54.071 --> 00:24:56.071
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.271
"Ant".

403
00:24:58.271 --> 00:25:00.271
Next is the suspicious initial K.

404
00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:01.271
-Me? -No.

405
00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:02.671
-Conan, then. -No.
