1
00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:12.285
He's not feeling well? You mean Uncle Jirokichi?

2
00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.085
I thought that he'd be the one to stick around

3
00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.485
even if all mankind perished,

4
00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:21.285
but it seems that he's recently lost his appetite too.

5
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.185
Does he have some kind of serious illness?

6
00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:31.985
I guess you could call it an illness of the heart.

7
00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:33.885
-Heart? -Yes.

8
00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.285
He says he has nightmares every night

9
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.985
and wakes up sweating.

10
00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.685
He says he sees "you know who" smiling at him in his sleep.

11
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:41.985
"You know who"?

12
00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:44.985
You know. Him! Who else?

13
00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:48.685
What? Who?

14
00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:50.285
I'll bet you it's none other than

15
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:52.885
that elusive, audacious, dauntless thief.

16
00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.985
That villain that puts on airs, right?

17
00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.585
The start of the age of mystery.

18
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.985
The detective show on Monday at 7.

19
00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.585
Kid is after the Big Jewel

20
00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:31.685
with teleportation that seems impossible.

21
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:33.285
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.085
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:37.585
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:24.926
"Thief Kid's Teleportation Magic"

25
00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:31.526
Darn!

26
00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:33.926
"Jirokichi Suzuki (72)" -No good, no good at all!

27
00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:36.726
A plan like this is totally useless!

28
00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:39.626
We're up against the notorious "Magician Under the Moonlight",

29
00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:41.226
the great Thief Kid.

30
00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:45.926
What makes you think that such half way measures...

31
00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:49.026
will help to capture him?

32
00:03:50.426 --> 00:03:54.426
Sir, I think you should rest a while.

33
00:03:54.426 --> 00:03:56.226
I don't think you should push yourself too far.

34
00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:57.626
It's not good for your body.

35
00:03:57.626 --> 00:04:01.026
Then, will you think up some fantastic plan

36
00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:04.726
to capture him while I'm sleeping?

37
00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:06.626
Oh, well, no.

38
00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:09.826
Are you going to bestow me with some incredible method

39
00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:13.526
of keeping Thief Kid from stealing the "bait"...

40
00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:25.426
which I got hold of, the legendary pair of mules "purple nail"?

41
00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.726
That's the illusionary gem that even Maria Teresia,

42
00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:32.126
the sovereign leader of the Roman Empire

43
00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.726
was said to have been dazzled by.

44
00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:35.726
The dazzling gem on your fingertips

45
00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:39.426
is the 100 karat amethyst!

46
00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:42.026
Who cares about its value?

47
00:04:42.026 --> 00:04:45.526
As long as it attracts his attention that's all that counts.

48
00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:50.326
It seems that he just can't resist large gems.

49
00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:53.326
Even if I were to be able to fish him with this bait,

50
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.726
I still have no skills to actually capture him.

51
00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:59.726
I have no means to surprise him out of his wits.

52
00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:03.826
About the strategy of putting the mule

53
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:06.926
into the middle of a gigantic block of ice.

54
00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:09.226
I think is a pretty good idea.

55
00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.026
But I don't think Thief Kid, no matter how good he is,

56
00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:13.026
can take something so big away that easily.

57
00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:14.726
Answer me then.

58
00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:17.826
Just where would you exhibit it?

59
00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:19.226
Well, of course I think I would put it

60
00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:21.026
inside a sealed refrigerator or something.

61
00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:26.226
Fool! If I do so, I won't be able to show the people

62
00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:29.226
when I seize him live with my hands.

63
00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:31.626
Besides, if I dunk it in ice,

64
00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:35.226
the legendary mules will go to waste, you idiot!

65
00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:39.726
Then, what about this suggestion?

66
00:05:39.726 --> 00:05:42.526
We place the mules on top of the Tokyo Tower

67
00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:46.126
and surround it with the helicopters of the Suzuki Financial Group.

68
00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:51.326
This way, the spectators get to watch what's going on.

69
00:05:51.326 --> 00:05:52.926
Have you forgotten?

70
00:05:52.926 --> 00:05:56.926
He possesses that white-winged hang glider.

71
00:05:57.126 --> 00:06:01.726
He's so at home in the sky, that we don't stand a chance.

72
00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:03.826
I'm sure that he'll take what he wants

73
00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:08.626
and fly off with the moon behind him again.

74
00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:09.826
Wait a sec.

75
00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:12.926
Why in the first place does he have the moon behind him?

76
00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:15.226
I'm sure it's because it's night time.

77
00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:18.126
I mean thieves usually work at night.

78
00:06:18.126 --> 00:06:20.326
That's not it.

79
00:06:20.326 --> 00:06:22.026
I'm asking why the moon

80
00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:26.926
is so conveniently positioned behind him all the time.

81
00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:29.626
Maybe he has it all cleverly calculated?

82
00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:31.926
After all, that's more stylish.

83
00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.526
Besides, everything he's after

84
00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.526
is usually on the top most floor of a building or a museum,

85
00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.926
so it's only natural that the moon is there.

86
00:06:38.926 --> 00:06:42.426
High places seem to go hand in hand with Thief Kid.

87
00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.626
I see!

88
00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:50.626
I see. There's something I can still do.

89
00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:17.026
I didn't think he'd exhibit the treasure

90
00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:19.226
right in the center of Ginza.

91
00:07:20.226 --> 00:07:24.726
It's just as if he's asking Thief Kid to come and get it.

92
00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:26.326
Right.

93
00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:28.026
Is it going to be all right, Sonoko?

94
00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:29.026
Yep!

95
00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:31.626
All I want is for my darling Thief Kid to appear

96
00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:36.026
and get a glimpse of him. That's good enough for me!

97
00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:37.926
Sonoko.

98
00:07:37.926 --> 00:07:42.826
Well, it seems that Uncle Jirokichi has something in mind, though.

99
00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:46.726
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?

100
00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:50.026
"Ginzou Nakamori (41)" -Any problem, Inspector Nakamori?

101
00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:52.226
Problem packed!

102
00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:54.526
How dare you place treasure that's only guarded by four security guards

103
00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:57.526
in the middle of the road like that.

104
00:07:57.526 --> 00:08:00.826
Left that way, Thief Kid will get to it in no time.

105
00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:03.926
Then, what would you do, Inspector?

106
00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:07.226
Well, I'd place it someplace like a high building,

107
00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:09.626
where it would be more difficult for him to get to.

108
00:08:09.626 --> 00:08:12.926
That's it! That's just what was so stupid of me.

109
00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:17.926
The police as well as I, without being aware,

110
00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:21.026
was playing the game the way he wanted us to.

111
00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:24.626
We were made to think that the best place to confront

112
00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:28.526
that white-wing thief is some place staged high from the ground.

113
00:08:28.526 --> 00:08:31.226
And time after time,

114
00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:35.126
he repeatedly used those wings of his to escape.

115
00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:39.726
Then, don't tell me that you deliberately placed it on the ground...

116
00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:44.326
Right, in order to tear off his wings!

117
00:08:44.326 --> 00:08:48.226
After all, he's no bird, so once he's on the ground,

118
00:08:48.226 --> 00:08:52.226
he won't be able to fly off using his hang glider.

119
00:08:52.226 --> 00:08:54.126
But...

120
00:08:54.126 --> 00:08:58.826
Kid...

121
00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:00.426
What if he mingles among the crowd

122
00:09:00.426 --> 00:09:03.126
instead of fly through the sky?

123
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.426
Then, all we need to do

124
00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:07.826
is check all of the people there carefully one by one.

125
00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.926
If you got notice from the Kid saying he'd be appearing,

126
00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:12.626
I'd have dispatched the riot task force

127
00:09:12.626 --> 00:09:15.926
and fenced in this entire area.

128
00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:18.926
I just happened to slam the challenge notice at his face

129
00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.526
in this morning's paper.

130
00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.126
I'm sure he's still contemplating

131
00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:26.026
whether he should take me on or not.

132
00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:29.226
But he'll come.

133
00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:34.226
To live up to his name, Moonlight Magician.

134
00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:38.826
I'll see you, then.

135
00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:40.026
I've got to make final adjustments

136
00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.126
on the strategy with my staff, you see.

137
00:09:42.126 --> 00:09:43.926
Hey, wait!

138
00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:48.026
Hey! What strategy?

139
00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:55.326
What's this?

140
00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:02.426
Here he comes!

141
00:10:02.426 --> 00:10:04.526
-It's Kid! -Kid!

142
00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:06.526
Thief Kid!

143
00:10:16.126 --> 00:10:18.226
How daring and bold indeed!

144
00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:20.626
Thief Kid has finally appeared over the skies of Ginza

145
00:10:20.626 --> 00:10:24.426
displaying his mysterious white-wings!

146
00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:28.426
Darling Thief Kid, I'm over here!

147
00:10:37.126 --> 00:10:41.126
There's a propeller attached behind the hang glider?

148
00:10:47.626 --> 00:10:48.826
Oh no!

149
00:10:51.626 --> 00:10:53.026
Darling Thief Kid?

150
00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:54.926
Where is he?

151
00:11:04.726 --> 00:11:05.726
Thief

152
00:11:05.726 --> 00:11:07.726
Kid!

153
00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:11.126
Wow! What a guy to jump down from a place like that.

154
00:11:11.126 --> 00:11:12.926
He's almost like superman.

155
00:11:12.926 --> 00:11:16.826
No. All he did was explode the radio controlled dummy,

156
00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:18.126
and while everyone's eyes were distracted,

157
00:11:18.126 --> 00:11:20.326
he made his way out of the crowd

158
00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:23.626
and jumped onto the exhibition stand.

159
00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:35.426
Kid...

160
00:11:37.826 --> 00:11:39.626
Thief Kid, any comments?

161
00:11:39.626 --> 00:11:41.126
Please, one word will do!

162
00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:43.426
Thief Kid!

163
00:11:43.426 --> 00:11:47.826
Oh, then please relay my message to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.

164
00:11:47.826 --> 00:11:50.826
This case is a bolt out of the blue for me.

165
00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:52.426
Therefore, I didn't have much time to prepare.

166
00:11:52.426 --> 00:11:54.626
As a result, to please forgive me

167
00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:57.626
for not being able to send out the usual letter warning.

168
00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:01.426
Okay, now!

169
00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:25.426
Oh, it's a net.

170
00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:29.426
The intersection blocked off with a gigantic square net!

171
00:12:29.526 --> 00:12:32.826
Uncle Jirokichi really goes all out.

172
00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:36.326
Height of almost 20 meters.

173
00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:37.926
Unless you do so on a hot air balloon or something,

174
00:12:37.926 --> 00:12:40.826
it's impossible to make it through this net.

175
00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:47.226
How about it?

176
00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:49.426
Even if you were to use a hot air balloon or something,

177
00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:52.826
the helicopters in the sky would get in your way.

178
00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:55.026
Of course, if you plan to escape from among the crowd,

179
00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.826
I won't stop you.

180
00:12:56.826 --> 00:12:58.426
When you try to make it over the net,

181
00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:01.326
my staff will make a thorough check.

182
00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:04.626
If you have the mule on you at that time, that's it for you.

183
00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:08.326
If you let go of it, you fail to carry out your crime.

184
00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:11.326
Either way, I win!

185
00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:17.126
Kid, disguise yourself as me and flee.

186
00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:19.126
You can disguise yourself as me if you like too, Kid!

187
00:13:19.126 --> 00:13:21.326
No need to worry,

188
00:13:21.326 --> 00:13:23.426
I had it figured out that it would turn out this way to begin with.

189
00:13:23.426 --> 00:13:25.626
Then, just what do you intend to do?

190
00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:28.826
Well, since I've done my job and all,

191
00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:30.226
I guess I'll head home.

192
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.526
I mean, how?

193
00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:37.526
Teleportation.

194
00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:40.026
What... what did he just say?

195
00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:42.126
-Teleportation? -Teleportation?

196
00:13:42.126 --> 00:13:44.726
Teleportation.

197
00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:49.626
He's going to transport himself instantaneously and flee?

198
00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:04.126
Teleportation.

199
00:14:05.126 --> 00:14:07.526
What... what did he just say?

200
00:14:07.526 --> 00:14:11.226
-Teleportation? -Teleportation?

201
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.026
Teleportation?

202
00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:14.026
Fantastic.

203
00:14:14.026 --> 00:14:15.326
Kid is great!

204
00:14:15.326 --> 00:14:19.126
He's going to do it? Thief Kid is going to teleport himself!

205
00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.726
He's going to transport himself instantaneously and flee?

206
00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:25.126
That punk. He is doing ridiculous things again!

207
00:14:25.126 --> 00:14:27.426
This is really going to be something.

208
00:14:27.426 --> 00:14:30.926
Thief Kid has suddenly declared that he wills teleport himself.

209
00:14:30.926 --> 00:14:33.026
Will Thief Kid

210
00:14:33.026 --> 00:14:35.726
really make it through the net set up to capture him?

211
00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:45.326
Kid...

212
00:14:45.326 --> 00:14:47.526
What now, sir?

213
00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:48.726
What shall we do?

214
00:14:48.726 --> 00:14:50.826
Come on, calm down.

215
00:14:50.826 --> 00:14:53.326
Take a good look at the circumstance.

216
00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:55.326
He's surrounded in all four directions by the net,

217
00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:59.326
and can't even fly off on his prized hang glider.

218
00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:01.426
He's nailed to the ground.

219
00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:05.426
Teleportation, what a laugh.

220
00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:08.426
As you can see, I've got the legendary mule, "Purple Nail"

221
00:15:08.426 --> 00:15:11.326
with me right here.

222
00:15:11.326 --> 00:15:12.726
How dare you, Thief Kid!

223
00:15:12.726 --> 00:15:14.426
Don't you move!

224
00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:17.326
Then, I'll see you again a few seconds later

225
00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:21.226
after I cross through time-space.

226
00:15:21.226 --> 00:15:24.026
Thief Kid!

227
00:15:33.326 --> 00:15:34.626
He vanished?

228
00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:38.026
He really vanished!

229
00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:41.126
Could it indeed be teleportation?

230
00:15:42.926 --> 00:15:48.126
No, all he did was mingle in the crowd along with the smoke.

231
00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:51.926
You can't call that teleportation, can you?

232
00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:53.826
The GPS.

233
00:15:53.826 --> 00:15:55.326
What's the location GPS

234
00:15:55.326 --> 00:15:56.626
that was attached to the dummy mule?

235
00:15:56.626 --> 00:16:00.026
It's moving in the direction of 3-chome from the intersection.

236
00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:02.126
Okay, dispatch security guards

237
00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:03.826
in the direction of the net towards 3-chome.

238
00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:06.926
Rather, reinforce guard of all the nets!

239
00:16:06.926 --> 00:16:08.526
Yes, sir!

240
00:16:13.926 --> 00:16:16.626
Now, he's a cornered rat.

241
00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:19.326
I'll get him even if he tries

242
00:16:19.326 --> 00:16:22.326
to use his cheap tricks to get away.

243
00:16:24.026 --> 00:16:26.026
And, where is he?

244
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:29.026
Well, he suddenly changed directions

245
00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:30.326
and is running around here and there

246
00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:34.126
and everywhere within the intersection, like a weasel!

247
00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.726
Don't be ridiculous!

248
00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:39.526
How can he do something like this among this crowd?

249
00:16:39.526 --> 00:16:42.326
Where on earth is Thief Kid?

250
00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:52.926
This is the mark of Thief Kid.

251
00:16:52.926 --> 00:16:55.126
Where did it come from?

252
00:16:55.126 --> 00:16:58.826
Stuck on the upper left is the GPS.

253
00:16:58.826 --> 00:17:01.026
On the backside...

254
00:17:01.026 --> 00:17:02.826
"Three"?

255
00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.026
I caught a Thief Kid card!

256
00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:12.426
Hey, something's written on the back.

257
00:17:12.426 --> 00:17:15.326
Really? "Two"?

258
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:18.126
"One".

259
00:17:28.126 --> 00:17:30.126
No way.

260
00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:34.226
Can't be?

261
00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:45.826
The roof?

262
00:17:48.326 --> 00:17:49.626
It's Thief Kid.

263
00:17:49.626 --> 00:17:53.526
Thief Kid's suddenly appeared on the roof of a building.

264
00:17:55.226 --> 00:17:58.226
You're great, you're incredible, darling Thief Kid.

265
00:17:58.226 --> 00:17:59.926
Indeed...

266
00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:03.426
He teleported over to a place like that.

267
00:18:03.426 --> 00:18:05.226
That's his double.

268
00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:06.926
I'm sure that it's just that his double,

269
00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:10.026
who was hiding on the roof of the building to begin with appeared.

270
00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:13.526
The real Thief Kid is still among the crowd.

271
00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:16.926
Don't undo the net blocker until you catch him.

272
00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:24.226
Please relay to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki that

273
00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:28.226
I definitely got hold of the gift he sent me,

274
00:18:28.226 --> 00:18:32.226
but unfortunately, one of them turned out to be imitation.

275
00:18:32.226 --> 00:18:34.826
I will return the imitation to you,

276
00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:36.026
so if at all possible,

277
00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:37.826
I'd appreciate it if you would please tell him

278
00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.626
to bring the other pair here again tomorrow.

279
00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:44.326
I would like to give the mules to the woman I love,

280
00:18:44.326 --> 00:18:45.726
but giving her just one of a pair of this

281
00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:48.326
would surely upset her, you see.

282
00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:49.826
So long.

283
00:19:26.626 --> 00:19:28.026
What?

284
00:19:28.026 --> 00:19:30.826
He said he's going to come to steal the treasure tomorrow night again?

285
00:19:30.826 --> 00:19:33.126
Did Kid really say that?

286
00:19:33.126 --> 00:19:37.526
Yeah, he said so right in front of the TV camera.

287
00:19:37.526 --> 00:19:39.226
He said that he'll leave the imitation behind,

288
00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:42.826
so bring the real one tomorrow night to the same place.

289
00:19:42.826 --> 00:19:44.526
That's what he said.

290
00:19:44.526 --> 00:19:45.826
But, uncle,

291
00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:49.626
why didn't you exhibit imitations of both sides to begin with?

292
00:19:49.626 --> 00:19:53.626
If I did so, all he would do is throw both sides out and flee, right?

293
00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:56.226
It wouldn't be my victory then, would it?

294
00:19:56.226 --> 00:20:00.526
Then, the least you could do was attaching a GPS.

295
00:20:00.526 --> 00:20:01.526
That way,

296
00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:06.026
we could've at least figured out how he got to the roof.

297
00:20:06.026 --> 00:20:08.726
Of course a GPS was attached.

298
00:20:08.726 --> 00:20:12.426
But, he seems to have removed it along the way.

299
00:20:12.426 --> 00:20:15.126
Isn't this the GPS you're talking about?

300
00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:18.426
Pops picked it up at that intersection.

301
00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:22.426
Something's stuck on to it with tape.

302
00:20:22.426 --> 00:20:26.426
This is indeed the GPS I attached to the dummy.

303
00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:28.226
When did you get this?

304
00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:30.926
It came falling from the sky about 5-6 seconds

305
00:20:30.926 --> 00:20:33.526
before he appeared by teleportation.

306
00:20:33.526 --> 00:20:35.526
There were two others besides that one, right?

307
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.226
Right, it came falling in the order

308
00:20:38.226 --> 00:20:41.026
three, two,

309
00:20:41.026 --> 00:20:43.526
and one as written on the back of the card.

310
00:20:43.526 --> 00:20:47.526
Right after card number 1, Thief Kid appeared on the roof!

311
00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:51.626
In other words,

312
00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:55.326
he quickly attached the GPS that he found to the cards

313
00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:58.826
that he was planning to scatter to begin with as part of his show.

314
00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:01.626
Which means that when he scattered the cards,

315
00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:04.626
Kid was on the roof.

316
00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:08.026
If he were to throw the cards from among the crowd,

317
00:21:08.026 --> 00:21:10.826
someone is bound to have noticed.

318
00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:15.626
How did he get up on the roof in an instant anyway?

319
00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:19.426
Maybe simply by using the elevator of that building.

320
00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:21.626
Impossible.

321
00:21:21.626 --> 00:21:24.126
I rented the buildings on all four corners

322
00:21:24.126 --> 00:21:26.226
of the intersection for an entire day

323
00:21:26.226 --> 00:21:29.526
and sealed off all the entrances and exits there are.

324
00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:31.526
You rented the buildings?

325
00:21:31.526 --> 00:21:34.726
Besides, even if he did get into the building,

326
00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.226
it would take him close to a minute

327
00:21:36.226 --> 00:21:38.726
to get to the roof with the elevator.

328
00:21:38.726 --> 00:21:41.126
But...

329
00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:43.026
if it's only the mules,

330
00:21:43.026 --> 00:21:45.826
wouldn't it be possible to take them to the roof?

331
00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:48.526
Kid has one accomplice, doesn't he?

332
00:21:48.526 --> 00:21:50.326
If Kid and his accomplice does it

333
00:21:50.326 --> 00:21:52.426
right on the roof and on the ground.

334
00:21:52.426 --> 00:21:53.626
I see!

335
00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:54.726
He could've suspended a fishing line

336
00:21:54.726 --> 00:21:56.626
or something beforehand from the roof

337
00:21:56.626 --> 00:22:00.026
then the guy on the ground who stole the mule ties it onto the line.

338
00:22:00.026 --> 00:22:04.026
Finally the guy who is hiding on the roof pulls it up.

339
00:22:04.026 --> 00:22:07.426
It'll look as if he indeed teleported.

340
00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.626
Yeah. If only the mules,

341
00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:11.126
all that is needed is a fishing reel

342
00:22:11.126 --> 00:22:12.726
to pull them up in seconds.

343
00:22:12.726 --> 00:22:16.126
No, not only the mules.

344
00:22:17.126 --> 00:22:20.126
Hey. Come inside and explain.

345
00:22:21.226 --> 00:22:23.826
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:28.126
I'm one of the 4 guards that was positioned around the stand

347
00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:31.426
that the mules were exhibited.

348
00:22:31.426 --> 00:22:33.626
You remember when Thief Kid first got here

349
00:22:33.626 --> 00:22:36.326
the crowd stampeded over, right?

350
00:22:36.326 --> 00:22:37.426
Yeah.

351
00:22:37.426 --> 00:22:40.526
There was a person who was holding a hamburger in the crowd

352
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.826
and when I blocked the movement of that person,

353
00:22:42.826 --> 00:22:46.826
back then, I unfortunately got ketchup on my hands.

354
00:22:46.926 --> 00:22:50.826
I happened to grab Thief Kid's cape

355
00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:54.726
with my ketchup smeared hands right before he vanished.

356
00:22:54.726 --> 00:22:57.526
And since you had ketchup smeared slippery hands,

357
00:22:57.526 --> 00:22:58.926
he got away?

358
00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:02.026
Oh, no. Well, you see...

359
00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:04.426
Take a look at this.

360
00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:07.226
One of it is imitation...

361
00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:08.926
This is the image of him saying that

362
00:23:08.926 --> 00:23:10.526
he's going to come steal again tomorrow.

363
00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:11.526
If possible I will come back here again, tomorrow.

364
00:23:11.526 --> 00:23:13.326
Watch this!

365
00:23:18.726 --> 00:23:20.126
Can't you tell?

366
00:23:20.126 --> 00:23:22.926
To the left edge of the screen.

367
00:23:22.926 --> 00:23:25.826
It's a cape fluttering in the wind.

368
00:23:26.926 --> 00:23:29.026
The red outline of a hand print.

369
00:23:30.126 --> 00:23:33.426
Is this the trace this guard left behind?

370
00:23:33.426 --> 00:23:38.226
Even he couldn't have foreseen such a happening.

371
00:23:38.226 --> 00:23:40.426
This means that the one who appeared on the roof

372
00:23:40.426 --> 00:23:42.426
is the one who first landed on the ground.

373
00:23:42.426 --> 00:23:45.926
It's Thief Kid, the one and the same person.

374
00:23:45.926 --> 00:23:48.826
He actually moved from one place to the other

375
00:23:48.826 --> 00:23:50.726
in less than 20 seconds

376
00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:54.626
to that place 30 meters above ground.
