1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,519
"Police Department"

2
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,916
But was that really true,

3
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,318
what you said before?

4
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,413
"First Investigation Division"

5
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:39,817
That's definitely what he said.

6
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,218
Maybe he's mistaken.

7
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,321
In that case...

8
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,591
She's here.

9
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:02,306
The three suspects Suwa, Yoshioka, Asai...

10
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:05,109
There's a possibility that there're other accomplices?

11
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:15,119
What?

12
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,793
Is anything on my face?

13
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,598
What is it?

14
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,602
Excuse me.

15
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:32,603
It's nothing.

16
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,605
What on earth?

17
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:37,207
What're you all doing looking at me

18
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,309
and whispering away?

19
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,612
No, it's nothing.

20
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,013
Right?

21
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,214
Yes.

22
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,916
No, it's nothing.

23
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:53,390
No. It's nothing. Right?

24
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,992
Don't worry about it.

25
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:01,398
Really?

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,902
Yes.

27
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:14,511
Questioning of the victims of the Haidocho case is done.

28
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes...

29
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,018
As to that case...

30
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,021
Give me a break.

31
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,394
I'm amazing, don't you agree?

32
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,995
Really.

33
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:35,499
I mean, talk about spitting it out!

34
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,604
It was like a scene from a drama.

35
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:44,107
He says he wants to eat pork cutlet and stuff.

36
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:45,409
What...

37
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,613
Takagi...

38
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,915
What... what's wrong?

39
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,417
What do you mean by that?

40
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:58,121
Why didn't you tell us what was going on too?

41
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,990
Right, Takagi!

42
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,092
You know,

43
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:05,596
we've got to prepare our hearts for it too, Takagi!

44
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:08,298
What? Prepare your hearts?

45
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:10,701
What is this preparing your hearts about?

46
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,103
Ta... Takagi!

47
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,605
Enough.

48
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,807
So, Takagi...

49
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,408
Yes?

50
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,911
It's you, isn't it?

51
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:25,916
You mean the case the Inspector Megure is talking about on the phone?

52
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,417
Officer Takagi.

53
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,720
You can be very funny!

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,822
About Officer Sato...

55
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,192
Yes.

56
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,193
You see,

57
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,295
the stuff that's glittering on Officer Sato's finger...

58
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,200
Ran, what's up?

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,002
That ring...

60
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,703
The ring.

61
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:50,107
Ring?

62
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:51,508
Ring.

63
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,913
You're right.

64
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,315
The ring...

65
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,717
What? Ring?

66
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,420
It's a ring I've never seen before.

67
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,123
Moreover, he's wearing it on her left ring finger?

68
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:09,192
Who... who on earth did she get it from?

69
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:12,496
Cool it, cool head!

70
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:15,499
What's needed is composure. Calm down.

71
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,301
I'll ask Officer Sato about it.

72
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:22,205
Excuse me, Officer Sato. That ring...

73
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,009
Sorry.

74
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,412
I've found somebody I like.

75
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,113
Miwa.

76
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,715
Ms. Sato.

77
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:32,716
Miwa.

78
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,120
What's going on?

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,090
Wearing it on her left ring finger means...

80
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,391
She's engaged?

81
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,994
That's what it means, isn't it? Hey!

82
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:47,097
I'd sure like to know what it means.

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,098
What?

84
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,201
You mean that ring isn't what you gave her?

85
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,202
No.

86
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:55,305
I didn't buy it, nor have I seen it ever before.

87
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,507
Then who on earth?

88
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:16,994
Tozawa of the patrol division.

89
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,695
Sonenaga of the crime prevention division.

90
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,098
Taniguchi of the traffic and transportation division.

91
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm sorry. Could you hold a moment, please?

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,501
Hey!

93
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,803
Hey!

94
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,306
Be quiet, will you?

95
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,108
Please.

96
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:32,509
Hello.

97
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,611
I'm sorry. And then?

98
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:38,115
What?

99
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,416
Someone is...

100
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,617
Someone is dead?

101
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,293
I got it, Ran.

102
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,795
I'll be right over.

103
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:55,899
Officer Takagi! Let's go!

104
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,100
What?

105
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,202
There was a murder at a villa in Okutama!

106
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,504
Officer Takagi!

107
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,505
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,207
I'm sorry, but could you take this?

109
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,109
I would rather...

110
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,514
I've got no choice, though.

111
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,116
I've got my own problems, you know.

112
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,092
It's a big problem!

113
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,498
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

114
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,801
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

115
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,603
A ring glitters on Officer Sato's left hand.

116
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,405
Did Officer Takagi finally do it?

117
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:36,807
He sees through the one and only truth.

118
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:38,608
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

119
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,710
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

120
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,852
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 8".

121
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,954
"Left Hand Ring Finger".

122
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:36,359
"Half a day earlier" -What a fantastic ring.

123
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,862
Look at the number of stones on it. Fabulous.

124
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,964
Are they all diamonds?

125
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,435
I've never seen anything like this before.

126
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,237
That's right.

127
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:49,638
It's a ring that I had custom made

128
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:52,041
in memory of my 100th piece of work.

129
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,144
It says "100th" on the back.

130
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,446
"100th" -See.

131
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,548
"Masutaka Moroguchi (52)" -I actually asked them to put

132
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,450
"Mystery Author" -100 diamonds on the ring,

133
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,752
but they told me that doing so

134
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,854
would make the ring larger than a finger shield,

135
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,756
so they were against it.

136
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,961
I guess so.

137
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,233
Excuse me.

138
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,934
I'd like to switch the tape.

139
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:22,138
But how unusual, in this day and age

140
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:25,141
-to be using a cassette tape recorder. -Yes.

141
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,842
"Kakuji Dejima (34)" -Nowadays most everything

142
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,944
"Writer" -is recorded digitally,

143
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,046
but I for some reason don't feel comfortable

144
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,749
unless I see the tape spinning.

145
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,152
In digital recording,

146
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,155
errors are a problem too.

147
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,956
I see.

148
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,858
In fact, I feel the same, too.

149
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,861
"Wataru Tarumi (33)" -All the other cameramen

150
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:48,264
"Cameraman" -use digital cameras,

151
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:52,535
but I just can't seem to let go of this old analogue camera

152
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,336
that I've been using from before.

153
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:57,640
Well, the only thing is, with this you can't see

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,341
how the pictures come out right away.

155
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,146
Hey, hey.

156
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,948
I'm sorry I have to intrude on you

157
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,349
when you're talking about analogue

158
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:08,451
"Harue Anabuki (33)" -but Mr. Moroguchi

159
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:09,752
"Magazine Editor" -needs to meet the deadline

160
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,655
which is closing in for his current serial story, you know.

161
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,557
I wish you'd stop quit idle talk

162
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,759
and finish what you got to do.

163
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,261
Come on, cool head, Ms. Anabuki.

164
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,263
After all, Detective Mouri

165
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,333
are going to be having the talk tomorrow.

166
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:29,638
I'll make dinner tonight,

167
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,340
have him rest well

168
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,043
and tomorrow morning within the morning sun.

169
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,945
Isn't that right, Mr. Writer?

170
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,346
Yes.

171
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,248
Well, you see,

172
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:42,351
this is like an introductory rehearsal.

173
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:47,056
On this month's preview page...

174
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:50,159
See! There's a big ad that goes,

175
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,861
"Writer Masutaka Moroguchi will have a talk out

176
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,864
with famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

177
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,032
on the new dawn of mystery stories!"

178
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,634
Please take a look at it.

179
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,036
Let's see.

180
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,941
What's the matter?

181
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,743
You look puzzled.

182
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:13,048
I just felt that he wasn't the kind of person I thought he was.

183
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,352
By that, do you mean Mr. Moroguchi?

184
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:21,157
Because his mystery story here

185
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,059
is particular about little details.

186
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,262
I was sure that he would be a nervous person

187
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,365
who is always annoyed.

188
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:33,936
Ms. Anabuki!

189
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,138
Yes?

190
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,841
Do you have a ruler?

191
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,942
Yes.

192
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,944
I have a tape measure with me.

193
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:48,350
Just as I thought.

194
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,453
The font of my name

195
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:54,957
is 1 mm smaller than that of the other writers!

196
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,059
Are you trying to humiliate me or something?

197
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,861
No... no way.

198
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,363
It's only that a font that size looks nicer

199
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,065
and fits in much nicer, that's why.

200
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,133
Then,

201
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,735
why not make the fonts of the other writers smaller?

202
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,838
You good-for-nothing!

203
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,544
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,447
I'll make sure that nothing like this happens again.

205
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:19,949
Phooey! You'd better!

206
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,450
I see.

207
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,553
I guess he's nervous about everything else.

208
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,854
Really.

209
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:30,559
Mr. Akiba, the editor in charge before you was great.

210
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,462
He granted my every wish.

211
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,733
He must've been a capable editor.

212
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,836
From looking for image data

213
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:44,940
to investigating specialized knowledge regarding tricks...

214
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,944
He spared no pains at serving me.

215
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,350
I mean, until his life ran out on him.

216
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:02,458
Did... did he die?

217
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,062
This spring, he found dead at home

218
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:11,033
in a room that was completely locked.

219
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,236
Locked room?

220
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,038
Did he commit suicide?

221
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,140
I would think so.

222
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,743
I mean, it's not one of the mystery stories I wrote, you know.

223
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:26,548
In fact, I thought of writing a story based on his death,

224
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,451
but Ms. Anabuki stopped me.

225
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,053
Most naturally!

226
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,554
The fact that he died suddenly

227
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:35,557
is quite widespread, in the publishing business.

228
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:38,260
Therefore, writing a novel about it

229
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,765
would just make way for gossip articles.

230
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,233
That's why I asked him not to.

231
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,235
Gossip is gossip

232
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:47,836
and not the truth.

233
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:48,837
Besides,

234
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:52,041
if it's entitled something like "A Tribute to Editor Akiba",

235
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,144
maybe it would've sold, don't you think?

236
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,146
Well...

237
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:01,850
What...

238
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,453
Oh, no.

239
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,955
I'm out of lead.

240
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,658
Would you like to use mine?

241
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:26,241
But I use regular pencils.

242
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,943
Even though it's analogue.

243
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,847
Well, then. Thank you.

244
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,250
Okay, let's just decide

245
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,253
on the course of action for tomorrow for now.

246
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:43,359
After all, we're be filming tomorrow morning.

247
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,961
Taking up time eating like this is doing us no good.

248
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,636
Besides, I don't want to waste film.

249
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,645
After that,

250
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:07,649
talking over arrangements continued over dinner

251
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,952
for two hours.

252
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:13,355
We had no idea that all this work would amount to nothing.

253
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,656
Right.

254
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:18,660
Because the main character of the interview...

255
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,564
Mr. Moroguchi?

256
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,633
It's already 5:00 a.m!

257
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,837
Mr. Moroguchi? Moroguchi!

258
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:32,040
What's the matter?

259
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,442
Mr. Mouri!

260
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,644
Is he still asleep?

261
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:36,645
Yes.

262
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:40,649
Maybe he was working till late last night.

263
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,251
Let's use a spare key to open the door

264
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,452
and wake him up then!

265
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:44,553
The thing is,

266
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:49,358
Mr. Moroguchi hated for others to go into this room

267
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,260
so there is no spare key.

268
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,162
He said that he didn't want his works to be stolen.

269
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,463
Hey, Conan.

270
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,365
What're you doing?

271
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,237
I have this bad premonition.

272
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,539
Like something is pushing down on my chest.

273
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,541
I feel like I'm having difficulty breathing.

274
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:07,843
At times like this,

275
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,745
almost without fail...

276
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:16,752
It's been about an hour since he passed on.

277
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:20,355
The odor of almond.

278
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,458
Cyanide type poison.

279
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,360
The stuff around his mouth is coffee.

280
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,763
Was the poison mixed in his drink?

281
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,236
The room was locked completely.

282
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:35,838
The only place that was open

283
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,640
was the place I used to come in here.

284
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,142
Just that ventilation window,

285
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,845
only big enough for a child to barely make it through.

286
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:47,249
The thing that he is holding in his hand

287
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:48,750
is probably the key to this room.

288
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,853
Is it suicide?

289
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:54,356
No. This is...

290
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,158
murder?

291
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,657
The victim is a mystery novelist,

292
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:06,360
Mr. Masutaka Moroguchi, age 52.

293
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,862
The cause of death is suffocation

294
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:10,364
due to cyanide poisoning.

295
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:13,367
From the coffee that is left around his mouth,

296
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,468
he most likely...

297
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,271
Mixed cyanide into his drink and drank it

298
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,375
or, somebody made him drink it.

299
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:23,844
What is it?

300
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:26,947
I don't think anyone made him drink it.

301
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,648
Because the door and windows of this room

302
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:30,751
were completely locked.

303
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,853
It was indeed a locked room.

304
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,555
Moreover, Mr. Moroguchi is holding

305
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:36,957
the key to this room in his hand,

306
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:38,458
and neither is there a spare key.

307
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,860
Taking all these things into consideration,

308
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,262
suicide is the only thinkable conclusion, isn't it?

309
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,964
Why would it be so?

310
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:46,166
If someone put cyanide

311
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,169
into his coffee cup beforehand,

312
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,571
wouldn't a locked room murder be possible?

313
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:53,573
Of course, that's if someone knew

314
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:58,345
that Mr. Moroguchi drinks coffee after getting up in the morning.

315
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,047
Idiot!

316
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,648
A person normally doesn't drink coffee

317
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,650
holding a key in his hand, does he?

318
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,053
Of course, it would be impossible to grab the key

319
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,354
even if he were to have realized

320
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,157
that he had drunk poisoned coffee.

321
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:11,358
So, it's most probable

322
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,662
that he held the key before drinking the poisoned coffee.

323
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:18,265
So, it must be some kind of message from him.

324
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:21,068
But wasn't Mr. Moroguchi scheduled to have

325
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,271
a talk show with you this morning, Mr. Mouri?

326
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:27,074
If so,

327
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,443
maybe he overslept, and in his haste, picked up the key

328
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:30,844
before leaving the room then,

329
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:35,148
sipped a cup of coffee to wake himself up, right?

330
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,951
For God's sake, take a good look!

331
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:42,055
The coffee cup was on the floor beside the bed.

332
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,957
Yes, that's true.

333
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:49,062
The coffee maker's in the kitchen over that side.

334
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,263
If he were in a rush,

335
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,466
wouldn't he have made the coffee in the kitchen

336
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,468
and drunk it then and there?

337
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,069
He would never put the cup on a saucer,

338
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,372
take it his bed and drink it!

339
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:02,242
But what if it were this way?

340
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,945
Somebody who came to wake Mr. Moroguchi up,

341
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:07,948
made coffee mixed with cyanide

342
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:10,050
and put it beside his bed.

343
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,353
Then told him to hurry, made him hold the key

344
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:15,055
and left the room?

345
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:16,857
Not possible.

346
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:19,860
If so, that someone

347
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,762
would've had to leave the room

348
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,064
before Mr. Moroguchi drank the coffee,

349
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:27,067
and make him lock the door.

350
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,869
This sounds pretty impossible.

351
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,570
Whether or not a person drinks the coffee

352
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,772
that is served right away, depends on the person.

353
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,674
But if he were rushed,

354
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:37,043
he probably would've drunk it.

355
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:40,147
It could be that Mr. Moroguchi didn't like hot stuff

356
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:43,049
and didn't drink his coffee right away.

357
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,451
No way!

358
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,955
Mr. Moroguchi liked coffee very much

359
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,657
so whether it was hot or warm,

360
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:54,561
he would drink it saying it was delicious.

361
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,563
Isn't that right?

362
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:57,564
Yes.

363
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,466
Everybody knew about it in the editing room.

364
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,770
And who are you?

365
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,771
Yes.

366
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:09,242
I'm Anabuki in charge of editing for Mr. Moroguchi.

367
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:10,544
The two behind me,

368
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,946
are to the right, cameraman, Mr. Tarumi,

369
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:15,849
and to the left, Mr. Dejima, a writer.

370
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,452
Did you three come here to make plans

371
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:23,056
on the talk show this morning?

372
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:25,358
No, all three of us

373
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,060
spent the night here from last night.

374
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,863
I mean, it's kind of tough trying to get here

375
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:32,365
before 5:00 in the morning, so...

376
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,067
But, how strange.

377
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:36,870
If the room were locked,

378
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,171
you'd most likely break the door down

379
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,574
or crack the window,

380
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,243
but there are no such traces.

381
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:45,645
How did you make it into the room?

382
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:49,649
This brat did it! Phooey!

383
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:55,055
Conan went in through that ventilation window over there,

384
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:58,258
and opened the door from the inside for us,

385
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,160
and we got in.

386
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,264
That's when we found Mr. Moroguchi dead.

387
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,766
Which means that the window was open?

388
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,868
Yes, that's right.

389
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:11,071
But it's only wide enough

390
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:12,772
for a child to get through, isn't it?

391
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:15,575
Let's assume that it was suicide.

392
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:16,943
Yet, why would Mr. Moroguchi die

393
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:19,946
holding the key in his hand?

394
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:23,250
Maybe the culprit didn't want all of us here at the villa

395
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,754
to be suspected of murder.

396
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,055
Like I just said,

397
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:31,558
if this were murder,

398
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,360
unless the culprit said something like,

399
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,263
"Drink your coffee while holding your key and lock the door..."

400
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:39,065
This situation would be hard to create.

401
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,467
And?

402
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:41,668
Would you have any idea as to why Mr. Moroguchi

403
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:42,869
would want to commit suicide?

404
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,372
No. Not that I know of.

405
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:48,475
He didn't show any such signs, did he?

406
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:51,645
No, not at all.

407
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:54,147
Well, maybe he had a lot of things on his mind

408
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:56,249
that he couldn't tell others.

409
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,751
It seems that the previous editor,

410
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,853
Mr. Akiba, who was in charge of him

411
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:02,355
committed suicide this spring too.

412
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:06,660
It could be that he felt seriously responsible for what happened.

413
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:11,364
At any rate,

414
00:23:11,364 --> 00:23:14,467
let's wait for the forensic officer to arrive.

415
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,269
If this is homicide,

416
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,971
the fingerprints of the culprit

417
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,673
has to be somewhere here.

418
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:22,842
If the culprit wore gloves when serving coffee

419
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:24,644
or when opening and closing the door,

420
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:27,147
I'm sure it would breed suspicion in Mr. Moroguchi too.

421
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:28,748
Besides, if the door was locked,

422
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:30,951
the culprit wouldn't have had time to wipe anything off.

423
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,853
That is, if none of you touched anything

424
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,256
before I got here.

425
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:39,559
No, because Detective Mouri warned us not to touch anything

426
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,462
until the police got here.

427
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,464
I'm sure this is a suicide case,

428
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,766
no need to call the forensic officers.

429
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,768
Officer Takagi.

430
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,672
Doesn't it bother you?

431
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,274
What do you mean?

432
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:56,042
The ring!

433
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,746
What? What're you talking about? Conan!

434
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:02,148
Well, of course it'd be a lie

435
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:03,450
if I said it didn't bother me,

436
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,453
but now we're in the middle of an investigation.

437
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:09,756
No!

438
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,661
Where are you looking? Over here!

439
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,863
This man's ring.

440
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:20,467
The number 100 that's carved is upside down.

441
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:23,970
Right,

442
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,973
but he could've just put it on upside down by mistake.

443
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:30,543
But this man was a very nervous person,

444
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:33,546
so I don't think he'd make such a mistake.

445
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:35,348
Besides, this ring...

446
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,654
See! There're so many diamonds on it.

447
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:45,358
Oh, I see!

448
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,260
So this is a homicide case after all!

449
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,762
What?

450
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:52,365
The reason he was killed was because of this ring!

451
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,068
The culprit switched the ring with the genuine stones on it

452
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:56,669
with a fake one

453
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,272
and when the culprit put the fake back on Mr. Moroguchi's finger,

454
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:02,475
he put it on upside down in his haste!

455
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:06,346
Did Mr. Moroguchi ever take this ring off?

456
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:09,449
No. He liked it very much,

457
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:12,752
so much so that he used to wear it

458
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:16,456
even when taking a bath and going to bed.

459
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:19,659
Then, just as Officer Takagi says,

460
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:22,362
there is a high probability that this is a case of homicide.

461
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:25,765
So, another mystery has emerged.

462
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:26,966
I see.

463
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,669
The only time the culprit could've switched the ring

464
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,272
is after Mr. Moroguchi died.

465
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:36,443
And most naturally, the culprit was in this room at that time.

466
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:37,944
If so,

467
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:42,549
how did the culprit escape from this locked room?

468
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,853
How on earth, after leaving the key in Mr. Moroguchi's hand?

469
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:50,156
Or is it that after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

470
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:53,560
the culprit left this room and locked the door,

471
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,362
and in some way returned the key

472
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:59,265
into Mr. Moroguchi's hand from outside?

473
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:03,670
Only that ventilation window was open.

474
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,071
There's nearly 4 meters from over there

475
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:07,173
to the hand of the corpse.

476
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:14,647
It's too far to do something like that.
