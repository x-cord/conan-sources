1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,395
"First Investigation Division"

2
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:04,795
That's definitely what he said.

3
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,195
Maybe he's mistaken.

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,295
In that case...

5
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:12,595
She's here.

6
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:27,295
The three suspects Suwa, Yoshioka, Asai...

7
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,095
There's a possibility that there're other accomplices?

8
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:40,095
What?

9
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,795
Is anything on my face?

10
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:52,595
What is it?

11
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:56,595
Excuse me.

12
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:57,595
It's nothing.

13
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,595
What on earth?

14
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,195
What're you all doing looking at me

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,295
and whispering away?

16
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,595
No, it's nothing.

17
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:07,995
Right?

18
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:09,195
Yes.

19
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,895
No, it's nothing.

20
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:18,395
No. It's nothing. Right?

21
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,995
Don't worry about it.

22
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:26,395
Really?

23
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:29,895
Yes.

24
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,495
Questioning of the victims of the Haidocho case is done.

25
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:43,595
Yes...

26
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,995
As to that case...

27
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:48,995
Give me a break.

28
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:55,395
I'm amazing, don't you agree?

29
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,995
Really.

30
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:00,495
I mean, talk about spitting it out!

31
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:05,595
It was like a scene from a drama.

32
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:09,095
He says he wants to eat pork cutlet and stuff.

33
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,395
What...

34
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,595
Takagi...

35
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:16,895
What... what's wrong?

36
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:18,395
What do you mean by that?

37
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:23,095
Why didn't you tell us what was going on too?

38
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,995
Right, Takagi!

39
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,095
You know,

40
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:30,595
we've got to prepare our hearts for it too, Takagi!

41
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:33,295
What? Prepare your hearts?

42
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:35,695
What is this preparing your hearts about?

43
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:38,095
Ta... Takagi!

44
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,595
Enough.

45
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,795
So, Takagi...

46
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,395
Yes?

47
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,895
It's you, isn't it?

48
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:50,895
You mean the case the Inspector Megure is talking about on the phone?

49
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,395
Officer Takagi.

50
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,695
You can be very funny!

51
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,795
About Officer Sato...

52
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,195
Yes.

53
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,195
You see,

54
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,295
the stuff that's glittering on Officer Sato's finger...

55
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,195
Ran, what's up?

56
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:09,995
That ring...

57
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,695
The ring.

58
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,095
Ring?

59
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,495
Ring.

60
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:20,895
You're right.

61
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:23,295
The ring...

62
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,695
What? Ring?

63
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:28,395
It's a ring I've never seen before.

64
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:31,095
Moreover, he's wearing it on her left ring finger?

65
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:34,195
Who... who on earth did she get it from?

66
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,495
Cool it, cool head!

67
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:40,495
What's needed is composure. Calm down.

68
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,295
I'll ask Officer Sato about it.

69
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:47,195
Excuse me, Officer Sato. That ring...

70
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,995
Sorry.

71
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:53,395
I've found somebody I like.

72
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,095
Miwa.

73
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:56,695
Ms. Sato.

74
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,695
Miwa.

75
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,095
What's going on?

76
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:05,095
Wearing it on her left ring finger means...

77
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,395
She's engaged?

78
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,995
That's what it means, isn't it? Hey!

79
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:12,095
I'd sure like to know what it means.

80
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,095
What?

81
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:16,195
You mean that ring isn't what you gave her?

82
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:17,195
No.

83
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,295
I didn't buy it, nor have I seen it ever before.

84
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,495
Then who on earth?

85
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:41,995
Tozawa of the patrol division.

86
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,695
Sonenaga of the crime prevention division.

87
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:46,095
Taniguchi of the traffic and transportation division.

88
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,395
I'm sorry. Could you hold a moment, please?

89
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,495
Hey!

90
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:51,795
Hey!

91
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:54,295
Be quiet, will you?

92
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,095
Please.

93
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,495
Hello.

94
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:59,595
I'm sorry. And then?

95
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,095
What?

96
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,395
Someone is...

97
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:05,595
Someone is dead?

98
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,295
I got it, Ran.

99
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,795
I'll be right over.

100
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:20,895
Officer Takagi! Let's go!

101
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,095
What?

102
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:24,195
There was a murder at a villa in Okutama!

103
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,495
Officer Takagi!

104
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:26,495
Yes, sir!

105
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,195
I'm sorry, but could you take this?

106
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,095
I would rather...

107
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:35,495
I've got no choice, though.

108
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:38,095
I've got my own problems, you know.

109
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:47,095
It's a big problem!

110
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,495
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

111
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,795
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

112
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,595
A ring glitters on Officer Sato's left hand.

113
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,395
Did Officer Takagi finally do it?

114
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:01,795
He sees through the one and only truth.

115
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,595
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

116
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,695
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

117
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:22,504
Well, the only thing is, with this you can't see

118
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:24,204
how the pictures come out right away.

119
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:29,004
Hey, hey.

120
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:30,804
I'm sorry I have to intrude on you

121
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,204
when you're talking about analogue

122
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,304
"Harue Anabuki (33)" -but Mr. Moroguchi

123
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,604
"Magazine Editor" -needs to meet the deadline

124
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:37,504
which is closing in for his current serial story, you know.

125
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,404
I wish you'd stop quit idle talk

126
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,604
and finish what you got to do.

127
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:44,104
Come on, cool head, Ms. Anabuki.

128
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:46,104
After all, Detective Mouri

129
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:49,204
are going to be having the talk tomorrow.

130
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:54,504
I'll make dinner tonight,

131
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,204
have him rest well

132
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,904
and tomorrow morning within the morning sun.

133
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,804
Isn't that right, Mr. Writer?

134
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:02,204
Yes.

135
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,104
Well, you see,

136
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,204
this is like an introductory rehearsal.

137
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:11,904
On this month's preview page...

138
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,004
See! There's a big ad that goes,

139
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,704
"Writer Masutaka Moroguchi will have a talk out

140
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:19,704
with famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

141
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:21,904
on the new dawn of mystery stories!"

142
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,504
Please take a look at it.

143
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:25,904
Let's see.

144
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,804
What's the matter?

145
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,604
You look puzzled.

146
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:37,904
I just felt that he wasn't the kind of person I thought he was.

147
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,204
By that, do you mean Mr. Moroguchi?

148
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:46,004
Because his mystery story here

149
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:48,904
is particular about little details.

150
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,104
I was sure that he would be a nervous person

151
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:54,204
who is always annoyed.

152
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:58,804
Ms. Anabuki!

153
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,004
Yes?

154
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:03,704
Do you have a ruler?

155
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,804
Yes.

156
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,804
I have a tape measure with me.

157
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,204
Just as I thought.

158
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:16,304
The font of my name

159
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:19,804
is 1 mm smaller than that of the other writers!

160
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,904
Are you trying to humiliate me or something?

161
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,704
No... no way.

162
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:26,204
It's only that a font that size looks nicer

163
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,904
and fits in much nicer, that's why.

164
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,004
Then,

165
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,604
why not make the fonts of the other writers smaller?

166
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,704
You good-for-nothing!

167
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:40,404
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:43,304
I'll make sure that nothing like this happens again.

169
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:44,804
Phooey! You'd better!

170
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,304
I see.

171
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,404
I guess he's nervous about everything else.

172
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,704
Really.

173
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:55,404
Mr. Akiba, the editor in charge before you was great.

174
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:58,304
He granted my every wish.

175
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:02,604
He must've been a capable editor.

176
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,704
From looking for image data

177
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:09,804
to investigating specialized knowledge regarding tricks...

178
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:13,804
He spared no pains at serving me.

179
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:19,204
I mean, until his life ran out on him.

180
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:27,304
Did... did he die?

181
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:31,904
This spring, he found dead at home

182
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:35,904
in a room that was completely locked.

183
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,104
Locked room?

184
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:40,904
Did he commit suicide?

185
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,004
I would think so.

186
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:45,604
I mean, it's not one of the mystery stories I wrote, you know.

187
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:51,404
In fact, I thought of writing a story based on his death,

188
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,304
but Ms. Anabuki stopped me.

189
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:55,904
Most naturally!

190
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,404
The fact that he died suddenly

191
00:12:57,404 --> 00:13:00,404
is quite widespread, in the publishing business.

192
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,104
Therefore, writing a novel about it

193
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:07,604
would just make way for gossip articles.

194
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:09,104
That's why I asked him not to.

195
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,104
Gossip is gossip

196
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,704
and not the truth.

197
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:13,704
Besides,

198
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:16,904
if it's entitled something like "A Tribute to Editor Akiba",

199
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:20,004
maybe it would've sold, don't you think?

200
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:22,004
Well...

201
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,704
What...

202
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,304
Oh, no.

203
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:31,804
I'm out of lead.

204
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,504
Would you like to use mine?

205
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:51,104
But I use regular pencils.

206
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:52,804
Even though it's analogue.

207
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,704
Well, then. Thank you.

208
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,104
Okay, let's just decide

209
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,104
on the course of action for tomorrow for now.

210
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:08,204
After all, we're be filming tomorrow morning.

211
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,804
Taking up time eating like this is doing us no good.

212
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,504
Besides, I don't want to waste film.

213
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:28,504
After that,

214
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:32,504
talking over arrangements continued over dinner

215
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,804
for two hours.

216
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:38,204
We had no idea that all this work would amount to nothing.

217
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,504
Right.

218
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,504
Because the main character of the interview...

219
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:47,404
Mr. Moroguchi?

220
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:49,504
It's already 5:00 a.m!

221
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:53,704
Mr. Moroguchi? Moroguchi!

222
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,904
What's the matter?

223
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:58,304
Mr. Mouri!

224
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:00,504
Is he still asleep?

225
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:01,504
Yes.

226
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:05,504
Maybe he was working till late last night.

227
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,104
Let's use a spare key to open the door

228
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:08,304
and wake him up then!

229
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:09,404
The thing is,

230
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:14,204
Mr. Moroguchi hated for others to go into this room

231
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,104
so there is no spare key.

232
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:18,004
He said that he didn't want his works to be stolen.

233
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,304
Hey, Conan.

234
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:21,204
What're you doing?

235
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,104
I have this bad premonition.

236
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,404
Like something is pushing down on my chest.

237
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,404
I feel like I'm having difficulty breathing.

238
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:32,704
At times like this,

239
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,604
almost without fail...

240
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,604
It's been about an hour since he passed on.

241
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:45,204
The odor of almond.

242
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:47,304
Cyanide type poison.

243
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:50,204
The stuff around his mouth is coffee.

244
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,604
Was the poison mixed in his drink?

245
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:59,104
The room was locked completely.

246
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,704
The only place that was open

247
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:03,504
was the place I used to come in here.

248
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,004
Just that ventilation window,

249
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,704
only big enough for a child to barely make it through.

250
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:12,104
The thing that he is holding in his hand

251
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,604
is probably the key to this room.

252
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,704
Is it suicide?

253
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:19,204
No. This is...

254
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:21,004
murder?

255
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,999
If he were in a rush,

256
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,199
wouldn't he have made the coffee in the kitchen

257
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,199
and drunk it then and there?

258
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,799
He would never put the cup on a saucer,

259
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,099
take it his bed and drink it!

260
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,999
But what if it were this way?

261
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:14,699
Somebody who came to wake Mr. Moroguchi up,

262
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:17,699
made coffee mixed with cyanide

263
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,799
and put it beside his bed.

264
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,099
Then told him to hurry, made him hold the key

265
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,799
and left the room?

266
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,599
Not possible.

267
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,599
If so, that someone

268
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,499
would've had to leave the room

269
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,799
before Mr. Moroguchi drank the coffee,

270
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,799
and make him lock the door.

271
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,599
This sounds pretty impossible.

272
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,299
Whether or not a person drinks the coffee

273
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,499
that is served right away, depends on the person.

274
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:44,399
But if he were rushed,

275
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,799
he probably would've drunk it.

276
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,899
It could be that Mr. Moroguchi didn't like hot stuff

277
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:52,799
and didn't drink his coffee right away.

278
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,199
No way!

279
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,699
Mr. Moroguchi liked coffee very much

280
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:00,399
so whether it was hot or warm,

281
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:04,299
he would drink it saying it was delicious.

282
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,299
Isn't that right?

283
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,299
Yes.

284
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,199
Everybody knew about it in the editing room.

285
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,499
And who are you?

286
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,499
Yes.

287
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:18,999
I'm Anabuki in charge of editing for Mr. Moroguchi.

288
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,299
The two behind me,

289
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,699
are to the right, cameraman, Mr. Tarumi,

290
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:25,599
and to the left, Mr. Dejima, a writer.

291
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,199
Did you three come here to make plans

292
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:32,799
on the talk show this morning?

293
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,099
No, all three of us

294
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,799
spent the night here from last night.

295
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,599
I mean, it's kind of tough trying to get here

296
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,099
before 5:00 in the morning, so...

297
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,799
But, how strange.

298
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,599
If the room were locked,

299
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,899
you'd most likely break the door down

300
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,299
or crack the window,

301
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,999
but there are no such traces.

302
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,399
How did you make it into the room?

303
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:59,399
This brat did it! Phooey!

304
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,799
Conan went in through that ventilation window over there,

305
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,999
and opened the door from the inside for us,

306
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,899
and we got in.

307
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:13,999
That's when we found Mr. Moroguchi dead.

308
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:16,499
Which means that the window was open?

309
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,599
Yes, that's right.

310
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,799
But it's only wide enough

311
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,499
for a child to get through, isn't it?

312
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:25,299
Let's assume that it was suicide.

313
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,699
Yet, why would Mr. Moroguchi die

314
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:29,699
holding the key in his hand?

315
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:32,999
Maybe the culprit didn't want all of us here at the villa

316
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,499
to be suspected of murder.

317
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,799
Like I just said,

318
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,299
if this were murder,

319
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,099
unless the culprit said something like,

320
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,999
"Drink your coffee while holding your key and lock the door..."

321
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,799
This situation would be hard to create.

322
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,199
And?

323
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,399
Would you have any idea as to why Mr. Moroguchi

324
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:52,599
would want to commit suicide?

325
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,099
No. Not that I know of.

326
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,199
He didn't show any such signs, did he?

327
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:01,399
No, not at all.

328
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,899
Well, maybe he had a lot of things on his mind

329
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:05,999
that he couldn't tell others.

330
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,499
It seems that the previous editor,

331
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,599
Mr. Akiba, who was in charge of him

332
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,099
committed suicide this spring too.

333
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:16,399
It could be that he felt seriously responsible for what happened.

334
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,099
At any rate,

335
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,199
let's wait for the forensic officer to arrive.

336
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,999
If this is homicide,

337
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,699
the fingerprints of the culprit

338
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,399
has to be somewhere here.

339
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,599
If the culprit wore gloves when serving coffee

340
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,399
or when opening and closing the door,

341
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,899
I'm sure it would breed suspicion in Mr. Moroguchi too.

342
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:38,499
Besides, if the door was locked,

343
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,699
the culprit wouldn't have had time to wipe anything off.

344
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,599
That is, if none of you touched anything

345
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,999
before I got here.

346
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,299
No, because Detective Mouri warned us not to touch anything

347
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:52,199
until the police got here.

348
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,199
I'm sure this is a suicide case,

349
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,499
no need to call the forensic officers.

350
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,499
Officer Takagi.

351
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,399
Doesn't it bother you?

352
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:03,999
What do you mean?

353
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,799
The ring!

354
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,499
What? What're you talking about? Conan!

355
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,899
Well, of course it'd be a lie

356
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,199
if I said it didn't bother me,

357
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,199
but now we're in the middle of an investigation.

358
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,499
No!

359
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:24,399
Where are you looking? Over here!

360
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,599
This man's ring.

361
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,199
The number 100 that's carved is upside down.

362
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:33,699
Right,

363
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,699
but he could've just put it on upside down by mistake.

364
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:40,299
But this man was a very nervous person,

365
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,299
so I don't think he'd make such a mistake.

366
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,099
Besides, this ring...

367
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,399
See! There're so many diamonds on it.

368
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:55,099
Oh, I see!

369
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,999
So this is a homicide case after all!

370
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,499
What?

371
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:02,099
The reason he was killed was because of this ring!

372
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:04,799
The culprit switched the ring with the genuine stones on it

373
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,399
with a fake one

374
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,999
and when the culprit put the fake back on Mr. Moroguchi's finger,

375
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:12,199
he put it on upside down in his haste!

376
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:16,099
Did Mr. Moroguchi ever take this ring off?

377
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,199
No. He liked it very much,

378
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,499
so much so that he used to wear it

379
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,199
even when taking a bath and going to bed.

380
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:29,399
Then, just as Officer Takagi says,

381
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:32,099
there is a high probability that this is a case of homicide.

382
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,499
So, another mystery has emerged.

383
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,699
I see.

384
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:39,399
The only time the culprit could've switched the ring

385
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,999
is after Mr. Moroguchi died.

386
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:46,199
And most naturally, the culprit was in this room at that time.

387
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,699
If so,

388
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:52,299
how did the culprit escape from this locked room?

389
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:56,599
How on earth, after leaving the key in Mr. Moroguchi's hand?

390
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,899
Or is it that after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

391
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,299
the culprit left this room and locked the door,

392
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,099
and in some way returned the key

393
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,999
into Mr. Moroguchi's hand from outside?

394
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:13,399
Only that ventilation window was open.

395
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:14,799
There's nearly 4 meters from over there

396
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,899
to the hand of the corpse.

397
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,399
It's too far to do something like that.
