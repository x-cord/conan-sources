From June until October,
at the police academy,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,720
trainees receive education and training

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,510
as they bond with one another

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,510
to become fully-fledged police officers.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,810
(Nonbeh)

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,440
Welcome!

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,900
First things first...

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,110
Cheers...

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,320
Nothing beats free drinks!

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,700
What do you mean, free drinks?

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,120
Didn't you hear what Hagiwara said?

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
This is a mixer
with girls from a different classroom.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,000
He said he'd pay for the drinks

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,300
if there was an equal number
of guys and girls.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,510
(Matsuda Jinbei (22 )
So that's why you came

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,850
(Matsuda Jinbei (22 )
even though you already have a girlfriend.

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,220
even though you already have a girlfriend.

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,720
Hagiwara himself isn't here yet, though.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,810
What? You have a girlfriend, Date?

21
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,600
I know!

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you really?

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,900
- What about you, Matsuda?
- Say what?

24
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,610
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

25
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,030
I know...

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,950
Hey, Hiro. This appetiser is really good!

27

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,450
( Furuya Rei (22)  Morofushi Hiromitsu (22) )
I can make this at home,

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,000
I can make this at home,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,330
so I'll teach you
how to make it next time.

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,920
You're not a good cook, after all.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,500
Sorry about that.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,300
Morofushi, teach me how to make it too!

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,010
I don't mind if it tastes bad,

35
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,130
so I want Furuya to teach me.

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,720
Back off! Zero has zero interest in anyone

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,020
other than older female doctors.

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,930
Come on, Matsuda!

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,230
If you keep saying such mean things,

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,020
I'm going to arrest you!

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
That would be fun!

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,900
That's a nice one, isn't it, Zero?

43
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,400
You're right.

44
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,790
(Hagiwara Kenji (22) )
I'm sorry for being late.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
On my way here,

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,010
I was helping
an old lady get up the stairs

47
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,930
because she got stuck,

48
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,720
but I dropped the great fortune slip
I got at a shrine just now.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,020
I couldn't find the fortune slip,

50
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
and when I went back to the shrine

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,310
to get another great fortune slip,

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,730
I lost track of the time.

53
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,610
He's got to be lying.

54
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,400
He's so kind...

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,700
What?

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,910
That was delicious.

57
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,330
You've been drinking too much!

58
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,120
How about we go
to a karaoke bar next?

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,830
Yes...

60
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,420
Thank you for coming!

61
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,220
In the end, only Hagiwara got all the girls.

62
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,810
So it seems.

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,520
Excuse me.

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,610
Are you a friend of that tall man over there?

65
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,810
Yes.

66
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,820
Please thank him
for carrying me up the stairs

67
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,610
and buying me a fortune slip on my behalf.

68
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,260
- Sure.
-Thank you.

69
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,700
So, it was true.

70
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,620
Hagi wouldn't tell a lie like that.

71
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,500
He did change the fact that

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,210
it was an old man into an old lady

73
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,340
because it would be better received, though.

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,900
Hey.

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,820
What's the matter, Hiro?

76
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,320
Hurry up, or we'll leave you behind.

77
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,620
Yes.

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,410
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration of

79
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,500
unravelling mysteries
that come before sleep!

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,330
A passionate period of youth
shared between classmates.

(Case: Kenji Hagiwara)

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,120
I sang too much
at karaoke last night,

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,830
so my throat hurts.

89
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,210
You have my sympathies.

90
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,720
You were the one who sang
the most at karaoke, after all.

91
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,730
That is so cool!

92
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,230
That's a third-generation Mazda RX-7!

93
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,740

(Onizuka Hachizo (48)

95
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,530
It's just Instructor Onizuka.

96
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,000
So this is your car, Instructor Onizuka.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,210
This isn't any old car.

98
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,330
In a way, I consider this my fighter aircraft.

99
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,420
They got the idea to make cars
as lightweight as possible

100
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,920
from the A6M Zero fighter aircraft, after all.

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,010
This is the famous car known for
having the Spirit of Zero!

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,600
Just as I expected from you,
Instructor Onizuka!

103
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
I knew you'd drive
my favourite make of car!

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,230
Well...

105
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,230
This isn't actually my car.

106
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,110
It belonged to a senior officer
of mine who died in the line of duty.

107
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,900
Four years ago, his daughter told me

108
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,830
she would become a police officer someday,

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,540
so I'm holding on to it until then.

110
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,000
Please park it in the garage for me.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,120
Don't scratch it.

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,920
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,710
I hope that the officer's daughter
is a looker.

114
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,630
She said she wanted
to become a police officer,

115
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,220
so she might be
even more stubborn than a guy.

116
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,310
What's this? Did you want to ride it, too?

117
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,230
You and that car are both "Zero", after all.

118
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,900
Not... not at all.

119
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm not into flashy cars like that.

120
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,320
So, he is into cars like that.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,420
So, your parents' home
was a car repair shop.

126
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,300
That's how you know so much about cars.

127
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,300
More or less. Jinpei
has been coming to the shop,

128
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,220
breaking down and remodelling cars
since he was a kid, too.

129
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,720
He never asked for permission,

130
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,020
so my dad scolded him about it.

131
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,230
I just wanted to install gull-wing doors

132
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,610
on a Porsche that one time.

133
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,510
Of course, you'd get scolded...

134
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,610
He wasn't satisfied with only cars,

135
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,200
so he ended up
investigating bombs as well.

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I could more or less figure out

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,120
how they were made
just by looking at them.

138
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,910
I liked tinkering with machines,

139
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,350
so I wanted to take over the shop.

140
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,000
So, why did you want
to become a police officer?

141
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,000
The shop was doing well

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,420
and my dad was about to add branches,

143
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,800
but the economy worsened all of a sudden.

144
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,720
In the end, he had to close the shop.

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,430
Compared to that, police officers...

146
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,940
never go bankrupt. Don't you think so?

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,520
Well, yes...

148
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,730
When you put it like that...

149
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,240
Half a lap to go! Run with all your might!

150
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,030
How about we dash on the final stretch?

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,700
It's on!

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,010
Hey, Hagi.

154
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,220
It sounds like the carburettor
isn't managing the fuel very well.

155
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,510
That's why I'm fixing it right now.

156
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,310
I might not be as quick as you.

157
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,230
It's fixed!

158
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,320
You're just as skilful as they say.

Jinpei Matsuda and Kenji Hagiwara.

160
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,530
Are you two interested in
joining the Riot Police Unit?

161
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,910
- Pardon?
- More specifically,

162
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,910
I would like the two of you
to join the bomb disposal squad.

163
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,330
The Riot Police Unit's bomb
disposal squad, you say?

164
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,630
Of course, we would be interested!

165
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,510
Pleased to be working with you!

166
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,220
That's not how you show your appreciation.

167
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,300
Well...

168
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,350
And you?

169
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,520
Could you give me some time
to think about it?

170
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,730
(Morofushi)

171
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,610
Hiro, I'm about to head out.

172
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,520
Is there anything
you want me to buy for you?

173
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,900
I wonder if Hiro went out somewhere.

174
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,930
What will be your reply to that man, Hagi?

175
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:27,100
It looks like he's assessing our capabilities.

176
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
I'm glad for the opportunity.

177
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,230
I get to be in the same department
as my best buddy.

178
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,020
Not only that, I get to
tinker with machines, which I love.

179
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,230
So, why not?

180
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,820
Since I've seen what happened...

181
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,750
Since I've seen what happened
to my dad's repair shop,

182
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,330
it all depends on
whether things are going well.

183
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,910
I wonder if this is like a brake

184
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,710
that stops me from
entering the path to destruction.

185
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,710
(Lounge)

186
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,000
If you're not sure, maybe
it's better that you don't join.

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,920
The bomb disposal squad...

188
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,430
does some dangerous work, after all.

189
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,100
If you're going to eat, I'll join you.

190
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,020
No, I'm going to check on
Instructor Onizuka's car.

191
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,600
I can tell what part of a car
is wrong just from its sound,

192
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,110
so I was asked to
take a look at the engine.

193
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,530
He even told me to wash the car.

194
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,700
I want to graduate from the academy

195
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,910
and join the bomb squad as soon as I can.

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,540
Matsuda.

197
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,500
Aren't you scared of
joining the bomb disposal squad?

198
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,630
If I said I wasn't scared,
I would be lying.

199
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,920
I've always been interested in
getting rid of bombs.

200
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,630
Besides, I'm the kind of guy...

201
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,720
who only has an accelerator pedal!

202
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,020
I thought as much.

203
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,120
Speaking of that bike shop,

204
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,710
I saw a man with a strange tattoo there
the other day.

205
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,500
A tattoo of a cup that has a base...

206
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,010
I think it's called a goblet?

207
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,430
Sorry, but I'm coming with you.

208
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,730
You headed out with
such an unusual expression on your face.

209
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,520
Squad Leader Date?

210
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,900
I don't know what you're investigating here

211
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,030
and you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

212
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,820
I'll stand by and watch.

213
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,910
I won't be in your way.

214
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,830
You might catch me talking to myself
once in a while, though.

215
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,120
You're really persistent.

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,000
Didn't I say that we can't disclose

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,330
personal information about our customers?

218
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,300
I just have to meet the man
with the goblet tattoo! That's all!

219
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Tattoo?

220
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,930
You're talking about Irie, aren't you?

221
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,930
You're the guy from the cleaners.

222
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,520
I can't have you say that, Mr. Tomori.

223
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,900
It's all right. These young men
are training to become policemen.

224
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,750
Thanks for saving us
at the convenience store the other day.

225
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,110
You're welcome.

226
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,900
About that Irie guy...
What kind of person is he?

227
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,410
He's the silent type
and he runs a hardware store.

228
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,530
I was with him
when the neighbourhood association

229
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,050
went on a hot springs trip one time.

230
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,200
Do you have any pictures of him?

231
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,250
Irie doesn't like having pictures taken.

232
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,210
You'd usually pose for group photos

233
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,300
if you go on a group holiday.

234
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,130
Now that you mention it... There is one!

235
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,140
Really?

236
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,020
Here it is! Irie is the one in the black tank top.

237
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,610
But why are you looking for a tattooed man?

238
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,450
It's not uncommon
to see tattooed people nowadays.

239
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,030
Even the store clerk

240
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,610
has a scorpion tattoo on the back of his neck.

241
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,530
And I have a tattoo of
the goddess Kannon on my upper arm.

242
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,830
The man I saw in the past

243
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,000
had a goblet tattoo
on the top of his shoulder.

244
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,710
What was that?

245
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm heading for the truck driver's seat!

246
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
Sure! Hey, what's going on?

247
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,810
We stepped on the accelerator
instead of the brake pedal

248
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,600
and hit the truck from behind.

249
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,020
But then the bumper got stuck.

250
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,810
And the truck didn't notice,

251
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,610
so it drove away
with the car still attached.

252
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,110
Excuse me!
There's a car stuck behind you!

253
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,620
This is bad, Squad Leader!

254
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,410
The truck driver is unconscious
from illness or something!

255
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,620
Darn it! It's picking up speed!

256
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,410
He must have been knocked out
with his foot still on the accelerator!

257
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,120
We need to contact the others.

258
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm pretty sure that Zero said
he would be out right now.

259
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,420
What? There's a runaway truck

260
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,130
with a car stuck to its rear bumper?

261
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,010
Did you say
the truck driver is unconscious?

262
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,720
Yes, and it's speeding towards
the Hachioji area!

263
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,020
Date and I borrowed
a soba noodle shop's bike

264
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
and are chasing the truck.

265
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,900
Cars in front, please make way!

266
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,610
There is a runaway truck behind you!

267
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,900
We're trying our best
by using a megaphone

268
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,530
we borrowed from an election campaign

269
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,700
to ask the cars in front to move.

270
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,330
Have you called the police
and the fire department?

271
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, just in case.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,910
But the police academy is closer.

273
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,920
- Cars in front, move!
- It might be better to use Instructor Onizuka's car.

274
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,500
What? Instructor Onizuka's car?

275
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,710
Speaking of that car, Jinpei is...

276
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,010
What? He's not here!

277
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,800
That's strange.
He should be repairing or washing the car.

278
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,730
It's still moving
while bumping against a guardrail.

279
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,820
But if this goes on, sooner or later...

280
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,910
What's up, big guy?

281
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,330
Sorry to keep you waiting!

282
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,620
Are you going to be okay?

283
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,710
I thought new students
weren't allowed to drive.

284
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,630
What did you say? I can't hear you
over the sound of the engine!

285
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,210
We have to stop the truck.

286
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,630
That would be a piece of cake!

287
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,010
If I crash into the truck,
it will physically stop!

288
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,610
It's no good!
There's too much difference in weight!

289
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,320
Hey, Hagiwara.

290
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,410
Do you think you can do "that"?

291
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,620
Sure thing!

292
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,120
What do you mean by "that"?

293
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,830
Hey! Open up your sunroof!

294
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,630
Sure.

295
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,710
What are they doing?

296
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,920
Zero.

297
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,300
Don't bite your tongue.

298
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,720
Hey. What are you trying to do?

299
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,230
A car is stuck to
the bumper of a truck after a collision,

300
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,520
and it's being pulled along.

301
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,900
Not only that, the truck driver
is unconscious from a seizure.

302
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,320
What are you doing
in this kind of situation?

303
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
You have to watch to find out!

304
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
That's awesome!

305
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Once we reach the front of the car,
open up the bonnet!

306
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,230
I'll remove the bumper.

307
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,400
Get to the truck driver's seat!

308
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,820
Got it!

309
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,200
Squad Leader, this road isn't on the GPS.

310
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,410
It might be an expressway
that's still in construction.

311
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,920
Never mind that!

312
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
The road is disconnected!

313
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,800
All right! I've removed all the clips
on the inside of the bumper!

314
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,920
Use the handbrake!

315
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,430
Pull it as hard as you can
so that the bumper comes off!

316
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,930
Hurry, Furuya!

317
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,810
We're running out of road space!

318
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,100
But even if the brake is pulled suddenly,

319
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,320
a ten-tonne truck
takes twice the distance a car does

320
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,820
to come to a standstill.

321
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,530
Even if he pulls the brake now,
the truck won't make it.

322
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,500
Besides, I'm the kind of guy...

323
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,130
who only has an accelerator pedal!

324
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,220
The accelerator!
Just use the accelerator pedal!

325
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,510
Step on it, Zero!

326
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,530
Oh, no...

327
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,820
It's not going to make it!

328
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,800
Hey! Are you all right?

329
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,700
Your advice was just the right thing.

330
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,910
Without that, I would have...

331
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,120
It's not me. I just thought...

332
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,000
it was something Matsuda would do.

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,500
I guess it's not a bad thing

334
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,130
to step on the accelerator once in a while.

335
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,800
By the way, I haven't heard the details

336
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,810
but you saved a few lives.

337
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,100
It's no big deal, sir!

338
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,020
So? Have you finished repairing
and cleaning the RX-7?

339
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,520
Of course.
The engine is in perfect condition.

340
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,610
As for the cleaning, you can see...

341
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,900
that it's sparkly clean!

342
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,030
Keep at it from now on, too.

343
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,500
Yes, sir!

344
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,120
RX-7, those are some mighty battle scars.

345
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,460
(Next Episode)
Did everyone make all of these?

346
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,680
Yes. Everyone here
who's in the circle made them.

347
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,550
This can't be...

348
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,060
No...

349
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,270
There's no doubt in it.

350
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,690
But I also understand his feelings.

351
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,270
After all, Yuri ended up like that because...

352
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,480
