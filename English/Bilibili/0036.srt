1
00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:07.493
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:11.703
It's 7:30. Something's about
to happen to Ayumi-chan!

3
00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:13.453
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

4
00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:15.713
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

5
00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:18.253
His name? Detective Conan!

6
00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:57.177
The Monday, 7:30 P.M. Murder Case.

7
00:02:01.347 --> 00:02:04.637
Can't miss this next
Masked Yaiba for the world!

8
00:02:04.637 --> 00:02:08.557
It's the big fight against
the Midorian Battler!

9
00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:10.977
I get excited
just thinking about it!

10
00:02:10.977 --> 00:02:14.027
What's wrong, Ayumi-chan?
You don't seem happy...

11
00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:18.947
I have to get a tooth
pulled today...

12
00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.407
You have a cavity?

13
00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:26.017
No, this one baby
tooth just won't fall out...

14
00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:29.867
The dentist said it's going to get
in the way of my permanent teeth...

15
00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:33.477
My teeth hurt
just hearing about it!

16
00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:35.207
Who's your dentist?

17
00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.337
The Sawaki Clinic near Beika Park.

18
00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:41.187
Oh! I used to go there!

19
00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:44.307
That dentist's mega pretty and nice!

20
00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:48.887
Yeah! Dr. Yoko's schedule
was full for a whole week,

21
00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:52.727
but she said
the sooner the better,

22
00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:56.227
so she's going to see me
after her normal office hours!

23
00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:58.007
What time?

24
00:02:58.007 --> 00:02:59.057
6:30!

25
00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:03.517
Masked Yaiba starts at 7:30,
so you should make it in time!

26
00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:07.267
Masked Yaiba and baby teeth...

27
00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:11.537
I've really fallen into
a grade-schooler's life...

28
00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:17.877
This is the place.

29
00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:19.687
Sawaki Dental Clinic

30
00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:21.837
Closed For Today

31
00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:24.727
She said to go
in through the back.

32
00:03:24.727 --> 00:03:25.747
This way!

33
00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:39.187
Sawaki Dental Clinic Side Door

34
00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:45.447
Ms. Sawaki

35
00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:49.297
Hello?

36
00:03:49.297 --> 00:03:50.407
It's me, Ayumi!

37
00:03:51.637 --> 00:03:53.377
Come on in! Oh?

38
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:56.727
This is Conan Edogawa-kun!

39
00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:58.807
He came because
he was worried about me!

40
00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:00.807
Good evening!

41
00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:05.187
Ayumi-chan has told me all about
you and the man you live with!

42
00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:09.097
I hear he solves all kinds of cases!

43
00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:10.807
Yeah, I guess...

44
00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:13.727
I hear you're a good detective too.

45
00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:15.687
I don't know about that...

46
00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:18.147
Well, be careful
on your way home!

47
00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:21.107
Oh, I was going to wait
until Ayumi-chan was done.

48
00:04:21.687 --> 00:04:24.387
Don't worry, I'll take her home.

49
00:04:24.387 --> 00:04:27.447
You should get home
before it gets dark out.

50
00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:30.597
Well, let's go inside, Ayumi-chan.

51
00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:36.057
Have her take you home, then!

52
00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:37.457
I'll be going now!

53
00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:40.417
Okay! Thanks, Conan-kun!

54
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:48.477
I'll be ready in a minute,
so wait in here.

55
00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:48.967
Okay!

56
00:05:03.277 --> 00:05:05.347
Masked Yaiba cards!

57
00:05:14.887 --> 00:05:16.307
Please, Masked Yaiba!

58
00:05:16.307 --> 00:05:18.847
Protect me and make it not hurt!

59
00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:24.387
What the hell you talkin' about?

60
00:05:24.387 --> 00:05:26.187
I don't care if the
building's crappy or not!

61
00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:30.077
Just sell it! Quit yer fussin'!

62
00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:32.937
Who could that be?

63
00:05:32.937 --> 00:05:33.787
Gotta go!

64
00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:38.807
Yeah, who is it?

65
00:05:47.307 --> 00:05:49.437
W-Why?

66
00:05:57.917 --> 00:05:59.497
Beika Elementary

67
00:05:59.497 --> 00:06:01.727
Hey, did you hear?

68
00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:04.457
There was a murder
in Haido last night!

69
00:06:04.727 --> 00:06:06.557
Yeah, I read
about it in the paper.

70
00:06:06.557 --> 00:06:09.297
The victim was the head
of a real estate agency,

71
00:06:09.297 --> 00:06:13.557
and his neighbor
and landlord found his body.

72
00:06:13.557 --> 00:06:19.097
Guess who the neighbor was?
Ayumi-chan's dentist!

73
00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:23.847
Last night a policeman
came to my house and asked

74
00:06:23.847 --> 00:06:26.067
what she was doing at 7:30...

75
00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:27.487
7:30?!

76
00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:31.847
I told them that Dr. Yoko
was pulling my tooth then,

77
00:06:31.847 --> 00:06:37.207
and that we watched Masked Yaiba
together afterwards in a room at the clinic.

78
00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:40.377
Why would the police
ask something like that?!

79
00:06:40.377 --> 00:06:45.687
They were probably checking her alibi,
since she was the first to find him!

80
00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:48.337
7:30 must've been when it happened!

81
00:06:48.597 --> 00:06:51.017
That's what the policeman said...

82
00:06:51.017 --> 00:06:54.307
So that means Dr. Yoko is innocent!

83
00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:55.847
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

84
00:06:55.847 --> 00:06:58.767
Wasn't yesterday's
Masked Yaiba so totally awesome?

85
00:06:59.057 --> 00:07:04.387
Yeah! Especially that climactic
fight against the Battler!

86
00:07:04.387 --> 00:07:06.057
Right, Ayumi-chan?

87
00:07:09.307 --> 00:07:14.727
It's not fair!
I barely saw any of it!

88
00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:16.867
I thought you saw it
with the dentist?

89
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:18.557
All I saw was the beginning;

90
00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:20.827
I was asleep during the rest.

91
00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:22.247
You were asleep?!

92
00:07:22.247 --> 00:07:24.997
What do you mean?
Give us the details!

93
00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:26.687
Yesterday...

94
00:07:27.977 --> 00:07:30.847
There we go!
That didn't hurt, now did it?

95
00:07:30.847 --> 00:07:32.187
Nope.

96
00:07:34.017 --> 00:07:36.967
I feel sleepy all of a sudden...

97
00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:40.017
You must be exhausted
from worrying so much!

98
00:07:40.017 --> 00:07:42.937
You can take a nap in the
other room if you'd like.

99
00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:46.227
But Masked Yaiba starts at 7:30...

100
00:07:47.817 --> 00:07:51.017
Don't worry! I'll wake
you up before it starts,

101
00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:53.487
so you can watch it in there!

102
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:54.677
Okay...

103
00:07:57.517 --> 00:07:59.747
Ayumi-chan. Ayumi-chan.

104
00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:03.247
Time to get up!
Masked Yaiba is about to start!

105
00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:15.727
Yaiba!

106
00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:17.887
Take this, Ayumi-chan.

107
00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:22.637
It's pain medicine-- your mouth might
hurt once the anesthetic wears off.

108
00:08:22.637 --> 00:08:23.517
Okay!

109
00:08:27.597 --> 00:08:28.637
'At a girl.

110
00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:40.837
Oh, yeah!

111
00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:44.477
Masked Yaiba!
Thanks for protecting me!

112
00:08:44.477 --> 00:08:46.667
Thanks to you,
that barely hurt at all!

113
00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:53.127
I thanked him
and put the card back.

114
00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:57.847
So you used a Masked Yaiba
card as a good luck charm?

115
00:08:57.847 --> 00:08:58.937
And then?!

116
00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:02.307
I watched the first part,

117
00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:05.557
but then I got sleepy again...

118
00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.937
Ayumi-chan. Wake up, Ayumi-chan.

119
00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.197
On the next Yaiba!

120
00:09:16.977 --> 00:09:18.617
It's over!

121
00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:22.687
I'm sorry. I tried to wake you up,
but you were sound asleep.

122
00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.577
Well, we should get you home now.

123
00:09:24.577 --> 00:09:25.877
Alright...

124
00:09:28.687 --> 00:09:31.297
So I didn't see it all...

125
00:09:31.297 --> 00:09:35.387
Don't look so down!
I'm sure someone taped it!

126
00:09:35.387 --> 00:09:37.677
Yeah! Let's ask around later!

127
00:09:42.307 --> 00:09:43.557
I'm home--

128
00:09:43.557 --> 00:09:44.387
Inspector!

129
00:09:44.387 --> 00:09:46.517
Oh, Conan-kun!
I've been waiting for you!

130
00:09:47.137 --> 00:09:50.347
I'm here to double-check
something about last night.

131
00:09:50.347 --> 00:09:51.747
Have a seat.

132
00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:52.477
Okay!

133
00:09:52.477 --> 00:09:53.687
So, Inspector.

134
00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:56.057
Why did Sawaki Yoko
take the apartment manager

135
00:09:56.057 --> 00:09:57.907
to the victim's apartment?

136
00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.937
According to the manager,

137
00:10:00.937 --> 00:10:04.947
she had complained about
Nakamoto's TV being on too loud

138
00:10:04.947 --> 00:10:09.517
when she came home
from the clinic at around 8:30.

139
00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:13.097
When he didn't hear anything,
he opened the door

140
00:10:13.097 --> 00:10:16.877
only to find the victim's
body lying there.

141
00:10:16.877 --> 00:10:21.307
If you're coming to me
to double-check something,

142
00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:23.677
then Dr. Yoko must
have a big motive!

143
00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:25.977
Is that right, Inspector?!

144
00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:29.977
Twenty-six years ago,
Nakamoto Katsuhiko

145
00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.057
was arrested on suspicion
of abducting and murdering

146
00:10:33.057 --> 00:10:35.187
a child from Yamanashi prefecture.

147
00:10:35.517 --> 00:10:36.647
Come again?!

148
00:10:38.057 --> 00:10:41.027
The murder victim
was a nine year old boy.

149
00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:46.577
But Nakamoto was
released on lack of evidence.

150
00:10:46.577 --> 00:10:50.667
The boy had a seven year
old sister at the time,

151
00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:55.507
who was none other than Sawaki Yoko.

152
00:10:56.057 --> 00:11:00.017
So basically, she had
plenty of reason to kill him...

153
00:11:00.017 --> 00:11:03.057
Right. But she says
she had no idea that Nakamoto

154
00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:07.177
was the prime suspect
in the old murder case.

155
00:11:07.177 --> 00:11:10.647
Seems too good
to be a coincidence...

156
00:11:10.647 --> 00:11:15.807
I bet you're actually here to hear
the great detective's opinion, huh?

157
00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:20.067
No, uh, it's my duty as an
officer to work with citizens...

158
00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:26.037
Is that so? In that case,
I'd be glad to assist you!

159
00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:30.267
The question is the alibi
that Ayumi-kun testified to.

160
00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:32.887
By car, it takes fifteen minutes
to go from the clinic

161
00:11:32.887 --> 00:11:35.687
to her home in Haido.

162
00:11:35.687 --> 00:11:38.687
If she let Ayumi-kun nap in the clinic,

163
00:11:38.687 --> 00:11:42.187
drove to the apartments alone,
killed Nakamoto,

164
00:11:42.187 --> 00:11:46.057
and then drove back to the clinic,
it would take approximately fifty minutes.

165
00:11:46.387 --> 00:11:49.687
In other words, without Ayumi-kun's
testimony that Sawaki Yoko

166
00:11:49.687 --> 00:11:53.347
woke her up at 7:30 and
watched Masked Yaiba with her,

167
00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:56.067
she would've had plenty
of time to commit the murder!

168
00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:03.867
Say, are you certain the murder
took place around 7:30?

169
00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:08.347
Yes. Nakamoto's employee was on
the phone with him just before it happened.

170
00:12:08.347 --> 00:12:13.877
He heard the doorbell ring at 7:29.

171
00:12:14.307 --> 00:12:18.797
The autopsy also confirms
that he died at around 7:30.

172
00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:22.757
In other words,
Sawaki's alibi is airtight.

173
00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:26.717
That's it!
I've figured it out, Inspector!

174
00:12:27.057 --> 00:12:29.597
Let's go to the Sawaki Dental
Clinic right this minute.

175
00:12:29.597 --> 00:12:32.727
I, the great detective Mori Kogoro,
shall destroy her alibi

176
00:12:32.727 --> 00:12:34.687
before her very eyes!

177
00:12:37.137 --> 00:12:39.317
Seriously, Mori-kun?!

178
00:12:42.937 --> 00:12:44.157
Please come in.

179
00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:50.137
Sorry to bother you like this.

180
00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.367
No problem. Please, have a seat.

181
00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:59.747
Are these the cards
Ayumi-chan mentioned?

182
00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:01.097
I'll get some coffee--

183
00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:02.547
Hold on, there.

184
00:13:02.877 --> 00:13:07.307
We don't need any coffee,
just listen to my theory.

185
00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:11.807
Mr. Nakamoto's murderer was you!

186
00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:12.517
Eh?

187
00:13:12.517 --> 00:13:15.647
But Mori-kun, she has an alibi...

188
00:13:15.647 --> 00:13:20.387
Inspector. The Masked Yaiba
that she woke Ayumi-kun up to see

189
00:13:20.387 --> 00:13:22.727
was actually a taped recording,

190
00:13:22.727 --> 00:13:25.657
and it wasn't 7:30
when she played it-- it was 8:00!

191
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.617
How do you figure?

192
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:34.707
Please continue.

193
00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:39.137
Basically, you killed Mr. Nakamoto,

194
00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:42.257
returned here at 7:55,

195
00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:44.717
woke Ayumi-kun up at 8:00,

196
00:13:45.387 --> 00:13:49.677
and played the Masked Yaiba
tape you had the VCR record.

197
00:13:50.387 --> 00:13:54.017
Then you tricked her
into taking a sleeping pill,

198
00:13:54.017 --> 00:13:55.727
causing her to fall asleep again,

199
00:13:55.727 --> 00:13:59.407
then woke her up ten minutes later
and showed her the next-episode preview.

200
00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:07.277
Naturally, you also changed the clock,
thereby distorting Ayumi-kun's sense of time!

201
00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:10.477
Excellent work, Mori-kun!

202
00:14:10.477 --> 00:14:12.237
But Dad...

203
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.187
There doesn't seem
to be a VCR here.

204
00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:18.267
Oh, uh, she got rid of it!

205
00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:20.917
So nobody would figure her trick out!

206
00:14:21.187 --> 00:14:24.977
I'm sorry to say this,
but your theory is wrong.

207
00:14:24.977 --> 00:14:27.637
The reason being
that it was exactly 8:00

208
00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:30.887
when I drove her home from the clinic.

209
00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:36.307
And we arrived at
her house just after 8:05.

210
00:14:36.307 --> 00:14:39.227
I'm sure you'll find
this to be true if you check.

211
00:14:39.227 --> 00:14:41.187
That can't be!

212
00:14:46.137 --> 00:14:47.277
Seriously, now.

213
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:49.737
The old guy's theory
missed the mark...

214
00:14:50.937 --> 00:14:53.437
Don't worry, I'll take her home.

215
00:14:53.437 --> 00:14:56.657
You should get home
before it gets dark out.

216
00:14:57.477 --> 00:15:00.667
...but she insisted
on having me leave!

217
00:15:01.637 --> 00:15:06.517
Was it because having me around
would prevent her from faking her alibi?

218
00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:10.187
If she purposely made herself the first person
to discover the body right after coming home

219
00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:14.807
to give the police
a precise time of death,

220
00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:18.267
then everything was
done to verify her alibi!

221
00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:20.387
If she was the killer,

222
00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:25.207
then her alibi must
have some sort of trick to it!

223
00:15:40.885 --> 00:15:45.845
Alibi tricks can only be pulled off
by using people, places, and time.

224
00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:50.255
People-wise, I doubt
Ayumi-chan's testimony is wrong.

225
00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:55.175
The death and the dentist
appointment are fixed in time.

226
00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:57.245
Which only leaves--

227
00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:00.605
--a location trick.

228
00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:18.405
An under-construction
apartment building?

229
00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:27.305
Did they stop construction
before it was done?

230
00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:34.545
These tire tracks are still new...

231
00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:37.005
If you stopped a car here...

232
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:41.595
...you could use the emergency stairs
to enter the apartment building unseen!

233
00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:46.935
That must be the doctor's room--

234
00:16:47.395 --> 00:16:50.315
the curtains in her
clinic have the same pattern...

235
00:16:57.905 --> 00:17:01.065
Aha! So that's how!

236
00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:03.905
This really was a location trick!

237
00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:08.285
If I'm right, then "it"
should be in her apartment!

238
00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:14.335
Oh?

239
00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:18.045
Conan-kun...

240
00:17:18.045 --> 00:17:20.185
Hello!

241
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.345
I'd like to discuss something...

242
00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:25.975
Discuss what?

243
00:17:30.565 --> 00:17:32.155
Make yourself at home.

244
00:17:39.395 --> 00:17:41.935
Conan-kun.
Would you like some juice?

245
00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:42.995
Sure.

246
00:17:43.175 --> 00:17:45.715
Did you throw your
refrigerator away?

247
00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:49.835
I see you changed
the clock and calendar,

248
00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:53.905
but I take it the TV and AC were
too big to change right away?

249
00:17:54.175 --> 00:17:55.365
What are you talking about?

250
00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:59.335
I guess it'd be suspicious if
you dumped your furniture so soon,

251
00:17:59.335 --> 00:18:01.045
and I understand
about the wallpaper,

252
00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:03.825
but shouldn't you have
at least changed the curtains?

253
00:18:04.295 --> 00:18:05.785
Conan-kun...

254
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:09.755
I figured out your trick.

255
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:14.295
You made this room look exactly
like the one in your clinic

256
00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:16.925
to fool Ayumi-chan's
sense of location.

257
00:18:17.425 --> 00:18:19.425
That's really interesting.

258
00:18:19.425 --> 00:18:22.015
I'd love to hear your theory,
Mr. Detective.

259
00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:26.215
First, you put her to sleep
with some anesthetic,

260
00:18:26.215 --> 00:18:29.985
put her in the car,
and left for Haido at 7:05.

261
00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:35.175
At around 7:20, you stopped
the car at the construction site,

262
00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:38.965
carried Ayumi-chan up the emergency
stairs and into the building,

263
00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:42.995
and laid her down in this
mock-up of the room at your clinic.

264
00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:45.785
Then, at 7:30,
you went next door

265
00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:47.335
and killed Nakamoto-san.

266
00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:52.755
You then turned
his TV up really loud,

267
00:18:52.755 --> 00:18:56.425
in the hopes of having
someone discover his body.

268
00:18:56.425 --> 00:19:00.545
If the time of his death couldn't
be accurately determined,

269
00:19:00.545 --> 00:19:02.765
then your alibi would
become suspect.

270
00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:06.225
You returned to your room,
woke Ayumi-chan up,

271
00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:09.185
and showed her Masked Yaiba,
which had just started.

272
00:19:09.425 --> 00:19:11.645
Ten minutes after
she took your sleeping pill,

273
00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:19.115
you drove her back to the clinic,
arriving at around 7:54.

274
00:19:19.115 --> 00:19:23.575
Then you woke her up again and
showed her the next episode preview.

275
00:19:23.875 --> 00:19:26.125
Everything should've gone smoothly,

276
00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:30.335
but when you came home, Nakamoto-san's
body still hadn't been discovered.

277
00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:36.045
You had no choice but to get the manager
and just happen to "find" him together,

278
00:19:36.045 --> 00:19:38.295
fully aware that
you would be a suspect.

279
00:19:38.675 --> 00:19:41.505
That's an interesting theory.

280
00:19:41.505 --> 00:19:44.765
But you don't have
any proof to back it up.

281
00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.875
Actually, there is proof!

282
00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.855
In this deck of cards!

283
00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:54.335
I guess you didn't know

284
00:19:54.335 --> 00:19:58.545
that Ayumi-chan put one
of these cards in her pocket

285
00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:01.275
for good luck before
having her tooth pulled:

286
00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:03.295
the Ace of Hearts.

287
00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:06.965
She put the card back
after her tooth was pulled.

288
00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:13.795
If she had done so in this room
and not at the clinic,

289
00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:17.295
then there should be two
Aces of Hearts in this deck.

290
00:20:21.175 --> 00:20:22.425
Here's one.

291
00:20:36.185 --> 00:20:40.655
One of these cards should
have Ayumi-chan's fingerprints on it.

292
00:20:40.965 --> 00:20:44.615
Conan-kun. Have you
told anyone about this?

293
00:20:44.615 --> 00:20:47.215
No. No one.

294
00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:50.835
Nobody even knows that I'm here.

295
00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:11.605
I lose, Conan-kun.
It's exactly as you said.

296
00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:16.065
You remembered
Nakamoto-san, didn't you?

297
00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:19.505
As if I could ever
forget that face!

298
00:21:19.505 --> 00:21:24.655
Twenty-six years ago, I saw
Nakamoto drive off with my brother!

299
00:21:25.085 --> 00:21:32.325
The police couldn't trust
the testimony of a seven year old,

300
00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:34.245
so they just gave up!

301
00:21:34.675 --> 00:21:42.005
If only someone like you
had been on the case back then,

302
00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:47.335
they would've found some other
evidence to prosecute Nakamoto.

303
00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:54.675
Dr. Yoko looked then

304
00:21:54.675 --> 00:21:56.145
as if she had come to her senses.

305
00:23:32.005 --> 00:23:36.165
I don't get it.
Why'd she turn herself in?

306
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:40.295
The police didn't have
any evidence at all.

307
00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:43.965
Not just that, they hadn't even
seen through her trick.

308
00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:49.385
Maybe she wanted to
be caught from the very start.

309
00:23:49.675 --> 00:23:53.965
Maybe that's why she used
Ayumi-chan to vouch for her alibi?

310
00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:56.225
She heard about
you from Ayumi-chan.

311
00:23:56.625 --> 00:24:00.935
You're saying she
wanted me to find proof?

312
00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:06.375
That, or the Sawaki Yoko-san
from twenty-six years ago

313
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:07.695
wanted me to.

314
00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:17.365
The Detective Conan '97

Sketchy memory.
