1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,440
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,240
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,540
The boy who witnessed the crime.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,140
He is hiding something and acting strange.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,140
Hints for the deduction are caterpillars and olive trees.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:10,945
"Shimura"

10
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:34,445
Hey, you?

11
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:12,545
"The Youth Detective Squad and Four Caterpillar Brothers"

12
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,545
A new friend?

13
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:18,445
Yes! We'll have to take a side trip

14
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,845
but, I'll introduce to you all,

15
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,645
so come with me!

16
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:24,345
Hey, about the new friend.

17
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,245
Could it be a boy?

18
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,145
Hey, hey.

19
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:29,945
"Matsuura Heights"

20
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,545
What's this place?

21
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,945
Let me introduce you, then.

22
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:38,945
This is Taro!

23
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:42,945
Taro?

24
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:45,545
Look closely behind the leaves.

25
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,945
Behind the leaves, did you say?

26
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:51,945
What is it?

27
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,545
It's a caterpillar.

28
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,045
And it's huge too.

29
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:01,645
This one is Jiro!

30
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:04,845
And the smallest one here is Saburo!

31
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,145
Well... Aren't they cute?

32
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,045
I'm not sure that cute is the word.

33
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:13,345
Maybe more like gross.

34
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,645
Gross?

35
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,545
-Oh, no... -It' s true. They're really cute.

36
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,345
Look.

37
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,645
It's eating the olive leaf with all its might with its little mouth.

38
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,645
True.

39
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:28,345
Taking a good look at it, you can see that it has horns on its bottoms.

40
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:30,545
Yes, they're cute!

41
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,145
I wonder what kind of butterflies

42
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:36,145
they're going to turn out to be?

43
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,945
Aren't they going to be swallowtails?

44
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,845
I can't wait to see them.

45
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,345
This caterpillar...

46
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:44,245
I'm afraid they're not going to turn into butterflies.

47
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:45,345
Why?

48
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,545
I'm sure I saw them in my picture book some time ago.

49
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:48,545
Hey, hey.

50
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:51,245
Don't tell me that you carry that insect picture book wherever you go.

51
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:52,345
Here it is!

52
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:56,145
It is the larva of a moth called Psilogramma incretum, after all.

53
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:57,745
Psilogramma incretum.

54
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:00,245
Oh, so, it's not a butterfly.

55
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,445
Oh, but whether it's a moth or a butterfly

56
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,645
it makes no difference that it's a caterpillar, does it?

57
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:10,445
Right! They are cute after all!

58
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:11,445
Right.

59
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,545
Yeah...

60
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:17,245
I found Taro when I was taking a walk three days ago.

61
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,845
Then the day before yesterday, Jiro,

62
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,845
and yesterday I found Saburo.

63
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:29,645
Then, maybe today you'll find Shiro?

64
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,145
Hey.

65
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:35,445
No joke, there's really another one.

66
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,445
It still had other siblings.

67
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,245
They might be brothers!

68
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,745
It's the four caterpillar brothers!

69
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,345
It's strange.

70
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:47,145
After I found Saburo yesterday, I looked really well and yet.

71
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:52,045
It's too big to have just hatched.

72
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:55,345
If these worms are increasing one by one everyday.

73
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:58,245
This is a bit of a mystery.

74
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,645
I wonder about that.

75
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:02,345
Maybe they were just hidden by the leaves and not in view?

76
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,045
What's up you kids?

77
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,345
"Senkichi Matsuura (52)" -Is there something about this tree?

78
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,545
Oh, good morning!

79
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:10,645
We were looking at the caterpillars!

80
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,145
Caterpillars?

81
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:15,145
See, they're over there.

82
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,745
Let's see. Ouch!

83
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,045
Ouch...

84
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,545
Is something wrong?

85
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,445
No, I have frozen shoulder syndrome.

86
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,245
This is huge.

87
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:29,545
There are others over there, here,

88
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:31,045
and here too.

89
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:35,145
Really, I've got to get rid of them.

90
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,645
What?

91
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,645
Wait! Please don't kill the caterpillars!

92
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,145
Please! They're my friends!

93
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,245
Please, don't, please!

94
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:48,845
But, I can't afford to have them eat up my precious olive tree.

95
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,945
Oh, but with leaves as much as these,

96
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,345
they couldn't possibly eat everything up, could they?

97
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:58,345
Even if they eat the leaves they'll eventually grow back.

98
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,345
A caterpillar that's been killed will never revive again!

99
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,745
Okay, okay.

100
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,445
I'll leave it as is!

101
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,945
But, I wonder when they started increasing like this.

102
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:14,645
When I watered the tree last time I didn't notice them.

103
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,345
When was the last time?

104
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,845
Sundown on Thursday, so...

105
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,445
it was probably four days ago.

106
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,045
Four days ago...

107
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:25,845
is a day before Ayumi found the caterpillars.

108
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,945
Grandfather used to love the olive tree,

109
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,045
so he even named the coffee shop that he opened

110
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,845
in front of Beika Station "Olive."

111
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:34,845
Hi, welcome back.

112
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,045
"Minoru Yoshikawa (23)" -Mr. Yoshikawa.

113
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,445
"Matsuura Heights resident" -Hi.

114
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,145
He's...

115
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,645
Do you know him?

116
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:43,645
He's an employee at the convenience store near our elementary school.

117
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:45,045
A convenience store?

118
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,545
What's the matter, Mr. Matsuura?

119
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:51,045
Bugs were found on the olive leaves.

120
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:53,245
Bugs?

121
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,345
I drop off at the convenience store sometimes

122
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,945
on my way home from school.

123
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,145
I read fashion magazines.

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,345
Does it bug you?

125
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:02,845
It doesn't bug me, but...

126
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:06,145
Is it normal for a first grader to be reading fashion magazines?

127
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:11,145
Right, it seems something happened over there.

128
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,545
Over there?

129
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,545
You mean by Mr. Shimura's home?

130
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,145
It's Officer Takagi!

131
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,745
Oh, it's you guys!

132
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,845
You're not supposed to come in here without permission.

133
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:27,545
Did something happen?

134
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:28,545
Yeah.

135
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:31,445
An old man who was living alone was murdered.

136
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,545
What?

137
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,345
Is he the one who found the victim?

138
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:36,945
Yeah, he lives in the neighborhood

139
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:38,745
and used to play shogi with the old man.

140
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:41,045
It seems that the old man had several hundred million yen

141
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:43,045
stashed in his drawer.

142
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:46,045
But, the cash is gone.

143
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,645
Hey, Officer Takagi.

144
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:48,745
What are you talking about?

145
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,345
Nothing really.

146
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:53,345
Do you kids know something about the case?

147
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:55,345
Not really.

148
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:57,845
Then, hurry on to school!

149
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:58,845
You're going to be late!

150
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,145
-Yes, ma'am! -Yes, ma'am!

151
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,145
I wonder how today's case turned out?

152
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,345
I wonder if they caught the killer?

153
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:11,245
Let's drop by on our way home!

154
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,245
No.

155
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,145
I don't think we need to do so.

156
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:18,345
What? You found a witness?

157
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,745
Yeah, a taxi driver.

158
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,145
Oh, well...

159
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,145
I can't tell you about the case.

160
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:26,645
It's okay, go ahead and tell them.

161
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,845
Okay then.

162
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:32,945
That driver happened to pass in front of the house

163
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:35,345
last night around 10 pm.

164
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:39,845
Then, the boy fell on his rear end in front of that man?

165
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:40,945
Yeah.

166
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:43,045
Did you see the man's face?

167
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:46,345
No, because I was still far away then.

168
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:48,145
Are you sure it was a man?

169
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,745
I think so.

170
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,145
How old was he?

171
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,445
I wonder.

172
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,845
Because my attention was mainly on the boy.

173
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:58,545
The time about 10 pm

174
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:01,745
matches the estimated time of death of the victim.

175
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:05,445
Although we have no conclusive evidence that the man is the killer.

176
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:08,045
I think it's well worth checking into.

177
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:11,845
Hey, if that man is the killer,

178
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,045
he probably bumped into the boy

179
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:18,245
right after he committed the murder and dashed out of the house.

180
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:21,245
Yes! My deduction is the same too.

181
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,845
If that so, that boy would indeed be the criminal witness.

182
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:27,745
You're exactly right!

183
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:31,245
But the taxi driver didn't see the boy's face,

184
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,745
and only remembers that he was wearing a white baseball cap

185
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,845
and something that looked to be pajamas.

186
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,845
Pajamas?

187
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,145
Then, it must be a boy who lives nearby.

188
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:43,745
Yes, and that's what I want to ask you about.

189
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,945
Do you have any idea of a boy who lives near

190
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,145
that house that wears a white baseball cap?

191
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:51,445
A boy who lives near that house.

192
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,345
Who wears a white baseball cap?

193
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:55,445
-It's Keiichi! -It's Keiichi!

194
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:56,945
Keiichi?

195
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:59,945
He's Keiichi Mitsui who is in the class next to ours!

196
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,745
He went to the same kindergarten we did.

197
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,145
His mother died of an illness this summer.

198
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,445
Before his mother died,

199
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,245
she bought him a white cap.

200
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,645
That's why he's always wearing that cap.

201
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:15,445
I see.

202
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:16,845
"Conference Room"

203
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:17,945
Thank you,

204
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,445
I'm sorry to have taken up your time.

205
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,845
Not at all.

206
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,645
You may go now.

207
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,245
I guess I'll be on my way too then.

208
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,045
Oh, thank you.

209
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,145
How was it?

210
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,945
Did Keiichi say he saw the killer's face?

211
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,345
Well...

212
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:40,445
I guess not.

213
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:43,445
Right, he denied everything.

214
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,145
Denied everything?

215
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,545
Keiichi says

216
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:48,345
that he didn't go out last night,

217
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:52,445
the night before or the night before last either.

218
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:02,567
"Shimura's house" -The place where the crime was committed is here.

219
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,267
"Keiichi's house" -Keiichi's house is here.

220
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,467
"Matsuura Heights"

221
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,567
The taxi came from this side.

222
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:12,467
The boy is said to have gone to the right.

223
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:16,267
It is very likely that the boy was Keiichi but...

224
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:20,067
As long as he denies everything, we can't force ourselves on him.

225
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,767
Either he's scared of getting involved or...

226
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,067
Don't you have any other clue regarding the killer?

227
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:30,067
Well, according to the driver,

228
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:33,067
that man thought to be the killer was holding the top part

229
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,567
of his left arm with his right hand.

230
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:36,667
Left arm?

231
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,167
That man...

232
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,467
His left arm was hurting too.

233
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,667
That man?

234
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,367
The four caterpillars brothers man.

235
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,467
Four caterpillars brothers?

236
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,667
His name is Mr. Matsuura.

237
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,667
And, he lives here.

238
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,267
The same block.

239
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,467
That man had a sore left arm?

240
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,567
He said he had a frozen shoulder.

241
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,367
Frozen shoulder.

242
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,367
Shall I go see him anyway?

243
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,067
Do so, will you?

244
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,167
I'll go check on the other children.

245
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,167
I wonder if that man's the killer?

246
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,167
He didn't seem like such a bad person though.

247
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:21,067
But, he tried to kill the caterpillars!

248
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,167
What do you intend to do?

249
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,867
I think I'll go to Keiichi's house

250
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:27,367
and hear what he has to say in person.

251
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,667
But, before that...

252
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,667
It's the person we saw this morning.

253
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:42,067
I wonder how he found out about the case?

254
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,467
To get from this store to his apartment,

255
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,867
he doesn't have to go pass the house where the crime occurred, right?

256
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,567
Yes, that's true.

257
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,267
Maybe I'll go ask him directly.

258
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,067
Well...

259
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,767
Just when I came to the place to turn the corner to my apartment,

260
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,167
I saw people of the neighborhood turning the corner ahead,

261
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:05,967
so I went over to take a look.

262
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,767
Then, why did you come home right away?

263
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,767
I wanted to hit the sack a soon as possible,

264
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,167
because we don't have enough part-timers,

265
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,567
and I had to go to work again from afternoon.

266
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,567
He's not the culprit,

267
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,767
because his left arm looks okay.

268
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,067
Right.

269
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,567
Let's hurry over to Keiichi's place.

270
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,367
I guess so, let's go.

271
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,167
You guys, go ahead without me.

272
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,267
I want to take a look at some magazines.

273
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,167
Keiichi!

274
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,567
Ayumi.

275
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,467
What beautiful roses!

276
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,367
Ever blooming roses.

277
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,567
There's an olive tree here too!

278
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,867
It's very small compared to Mr. Matsuura's olive tree though.

279
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,667
There seems to be no caterpillars though.

280
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,867
Do you always take care of the plants?

281
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,067
Mother used to like them.

282
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,667
I took care of them

283
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,667
after she was hospitalized and after she died too.

284
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:08,667
Around what time does your father usually come home?

285
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:12,167
About 11.00 pm. Because he's busy at work.

286
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,067
Then, you're all by yourself till then, Keiichi?

287
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,467
What about dinner?

288
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,267
Father makes it before he goes to work in the morning.

289
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,267
I heat it up and eat it.

290
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,567
You're having it tough, aren't you?

291
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:28,167
Not really, because I've gotten used to it.

292
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,467
And, about last night...

293
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,867
Sorry, I've got something to do so I got to go.

294
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,267
Keiichi, wait!

295
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,567
He left.

296
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,567
I wonder if he got angry?

297
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,467
There's no doubt that Keiichi ran into a man

298
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,067
that could be the killer.

299
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,467
But, why is he hiding it?

300
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,467
What was he doing outside around 10 am at night

301
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,367
in the first place?

302
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,667
The trace of it having been cut with nippers.

303
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,967
Maybe this is!

304
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,067
What's the matter, Conan?

305
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,167
What is it?

306
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,667
Conan?

307
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,067
Just as I thought.

308
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,867
Huh, what is?

309
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:14,867
Listen.

310
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,967
All these caterpillars were in the olive tree

311
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,267
at Keiichi's house to begin with.

312
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,667
What?

313
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:24,567
Keiichi probably noticed the caterpillars four days ago.

314
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:30,667
Keiichi who found the caterpillars was in a fix.

315
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:34,367
If he left it as is, the caterpillars would eat up all the leaves

316
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,867
of the olive tree that his mother loved.

317
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:39,667
But, Keiichi who has a kind heart

318
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,567
could not kill the caterpillars.

319
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:46,067
Just then Keiichi remembered that there was a large olive tree

320
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,567
on the east side of the same block.

321
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,667
It had dense foliage and looked to have more than enough

322
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:54,467
even if four caterpillars were to eat them.

323
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,967
So, from that night,

324
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,667
Keiichi started taking one worm at a time everyday

325
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:03,067
from his house to this house, in order of the large ones first,

326
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,067
after waiting till around 10 pm at night

327
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,867
when there weren't many people around.

328
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,867
He cut the branches with the caterpillars on them with nippers.

329
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,767
If he U-turns,

330
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,367
it would be unnatural if someone were to see him.

331
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,667
So he went to the south, then west

332
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,367
and deliberately took the long way around

333
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,867
"Shimura" -passing in front of the house where the crime occurred.

334
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:38,967
He went once around and then back to his house.

335
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,667
The caterpillars were moved from the branch

336
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,767
that Keiichi brought to this olive tree.

337
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,767
That's why the olive tree at Keiichi's house

338
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,667
had a few branches cut off,

339
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,767
while there were remains of branches cut with nippers

340
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,367
around this olive tree.

341
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,867
And on the fourth day,

342
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,367
when he finished moving the last caterpillar,

343
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,467
the crime occurred.

344
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:09,267
Keiichi felt guilty about having moved the caterpillars

345
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,367
from his house to someone else's.

346
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,867
That's why he denied everything when questioned by the police

347
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,667
and said he didn't go out last night,

348
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,467
the night before or the night before last either.

349
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,667
He went as far as to say what he didn't have to too.

350
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,067
You're fantastic, Conan!

351
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,367
I couldn't help but listen in amazement.

352
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,567
You're just like a real detective.

353
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,567
I am a detective.

354
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,267
But, I feel sorry for Keiichi.

355
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:37,067
I'm sure he's troubled about it.

356
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:40,267
Yeah, I think we should see Keiichi once more.

357
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,867
Edogawa?

358
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,267
The employee called Yoshikawa disappeared.

359
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:48,667
What?

360
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,467
According to the other employees he seems to have been

361
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:53,567
sweeping outside from after noon time right through.

362
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,767
Remember, he was wiping the glass door

363
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,867
when we went too?

364
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,167
Maybe he was looking for a boy

365
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,067
wearing a white cap come home from school.

366
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,667
You mean he was ambushing Keiichi?

367
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,667
But that man's left arm...

368
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:11,567
The culprit didn't hurt his arm when he bumped into Keiichi.

369
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,367
If he did, it should be more on the bottom.

370
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:18,267
Then he was holding his left arm because?

371
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:22,567
It's most likely that the killer was hiding the package

372
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:23,967
with the money he stole

373
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,367
on the inside of his top and was hiding it under his left arm.

374
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,767
Then, he bumped into Keiichi when he went out,

375
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,567
and he reflexively placed his right hand on his left arm

376
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,767
to keep from dropping the money.

377
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,067
If Yoshikawa is the culprit...

378
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,367
Keiichi is in danger!

379
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:48,167
Keiichi...

380
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,467
He seems to be out.

381
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:50,967
Where'd he go?

382
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,067
How would I know?

383
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,567
-Darn! -That rose...

384
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,367
I thought there were more of them.

385
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,267
They've been cut with scissors.

386
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:06,367
Why would he cut the roses?

387
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,667
Mother used to like them.

388
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,067
I see!

389
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:18,967
Mother, I saw the man's face.

390
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,767
Just what am I supposed to do?

391
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,767
So, you did remember my face after all.

392
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,267
Be grateful to me.

393
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,767
I'll let you see your mother.

394
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:46,967
-Keiichi! -Keiichi!

395
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,167
Keiichi!

396
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,967
Darn!

397
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,067
Take that!

398
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:04,567
Keiichi!

399
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,467
Keiichi!

400
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,267
I'm okay.

401
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,467
Your cap?

402
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,767
It only stabbed your cap?

403
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,967
-Yep. -I'm glad!

404
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:29,667
Your mother in heaven saved you.

405
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,267
Yeah!

406
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:08,567
The caterpillars disappeared?

407
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,167
Don't tell me that you got rid of them, mister?

408
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:11,767
No.

409
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,967
I didn't do anything.

410
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:18,367
They probably dug into the ground to to become pupa.

411
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,367
Pupa?

412
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,067
Oh, I see.

413
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,067
-But what's a pupa? -Seriously?

414
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,767
It'll be next spring

415
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:31,667
when they appear before us again as grown moths.

416
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,967
Yeah.

417
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,767
By the at time,

418
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,167
I hope that my adult form...

419
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,367
will also return.

420
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,967
"Next Episode"

421
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,567
Officer Takagi?

422
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,067
He had these on him.

423
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:56,267
Mr. Mouri's going to start his show soon, isn't he?

424
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,967
In order to delay rigor mortis...

425
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:00,167
Where is it?

426
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,167
This is...

427
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,767
I asked the the manager of this condo about it,

428
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:07,267
and was told that it's an earthquake detector to switch off the gas.

429
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,967
An earthquake detector?

430
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,367
Next Conan,

431
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,367
"Picture Mail from a Clown"

432
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,435
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,635
"Stew"

434
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,935
The next episode is about a sad clown.

435
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,535
Clowns are supposed to be funny, aren't they?

436
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:26,339
Adults have a lot to think about.
