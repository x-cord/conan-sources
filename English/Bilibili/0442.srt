1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,540
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,440
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,740
A falling object changes a person's life.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,140
Differences in thought causes an incident,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,840
the Youth Detective Squad, put a stop to it!

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,840
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,262
"Beika Station"

10
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:53,162
What a huge eel over rice.

11
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:57,662
Genta, you're not getting anywhere staring at it like that forever.

12
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:00,062
I'd sure like to taste it.

13
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,462
Look out!

14
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:08,662
Are you all right?

15
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:12,062
Did he get hit?

16
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:13,562
I'm sure he dodged it in time.

17
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:15,962
I think he just passed out.

18
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:18,562
-Mitsuhiko! -Yes, an ambulance, right?

19
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:21,262
"Watanabe Central Hospital"

20
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:25,462
How was it, Officer Takagi?

21
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,662
It seems to have simple mistake in operating the crane.

22
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:30,962
Which means that it was an accident and not a case?

23
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:34,462
Yes. Besides, I just asked the nurse station

24
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,362
and was told that although he broke a foot from the fall,

25
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:39,962
there were no abnormalities found in his head or brain.

26
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:41,662
Only, since he's still passed out,

27
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,362
they cannot identify who or where he's from.

28
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:46,462
Oh, I just remembered!

29
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:48,662
This is his belongings!

30
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:52,162
Something that may help identify him may be in his belongings.

31
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,462
What's this rope for?

32
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,962
This is...

33
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:05,662
A rope.

34
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,162
Working gloves.

35
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:10,862
A wallet.

36
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,062
An envelope?

37
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,862
"I'm tired of going on living, already."

38
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,562
-Could this be... -A will.

39
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:20,662
Then, that man...

40
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:24,062
Tried to commit suicide using a rope.

41
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:27,262
Daijirou Manaka, 27 years old.

42
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:30,762
He's only in his 20's, but he says that he's tired of living,

43
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:32,762
like he's an aged person already!

44
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,362
True.

45
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:35,362
Besides...

46
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,262
What on earth is this?

47
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:46,362
"Man Hindered by a Steel-Frame"

48
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,962
You've finally awaken, Mr. Manaka.

49
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,062
I'm from the police.

50
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,762
What on earth is this?

51
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:02,262
Please explain what's going on.

52
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:04,562
Mr. Manaka!

53
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,962
Manaka? Is that my name?

54
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,262
Yes?

55
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:16,462
No good, I don't remember anything!

56
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:24,262
Poor thing, not even knowing who he actually is.

57
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:26,862
Okay, I'll try shock treatment on him!

58
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,562
No, Genta!

59
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,062
Why're you stopping me?

60
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,662
He's forgotten everything for now, but what if his memory returns

61
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:35,562
and he decides to commit suicide again?

62
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:38,262
Oh, I see.

63
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,562
In other words, I've got to keep my eyes on him

64
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:44,262
to keep him from danger

65
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:47,562
because there's no way of knowing when his memory will return.

66
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:49,262
We want to help him get back his memory,

67
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:52,362
but how we do if he may commit suicide?

68
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:53,962
What can we do?

69
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,562
Let's solve the problem with our own hands

70
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,362
before his memory comes back!

71
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,162
What's the problem?

72
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:03,862
He must've had a problem that made him want to commit suicide.

73
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:06,062
So, all we have to do is solve that for him.

74
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:08,062
Then he won't think of committing suicide again!

75
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:11,062
Okay, off goes the Youth Detective Squad!

76
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,262
Yeah!

77
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,162
That man...

78
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,362
What's up, Conan?

79
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:18,962
I wonder if he's really got amnesia.

80
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,462
Are you saying that he's lying?

81
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:21,862
He's lying?

82
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:25,762
When a person lies, it inadvertently shows on the person's face.

83
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:28,662
They blink a lot, or their eye wander.

84
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,562
That man's eyes were wandering.

85
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:34,262
That's because of his anxiety.

86
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:36,562
I mean after all, he couldn't remember his own name.

87
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:40,962
Why would he have to fake having amnesia in the first place?

88
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,662
Beats me.

89
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:45,162
I don't think it's good to suspect him for something you have no idea of.

90
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:48,662
But, something bothers me about him.

91
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:51,362
Come to think of it, even about that matter.

92
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,562
What matter?

93
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:56,262
Back then, he was heading South on Beika-cho, right?

94
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,562
The only thing that's there is a residential district.

95
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,862
If he were contemplating suicide, wouldn't he go the other way,

96
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:04,262
towards the mountains or some place where there are not too many people?

97
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:07,262
There are places with no people in residential areas too.

98
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,262
Could be but...

99
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,262
That's fine!

100
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,662
It seems like Conan doesn't want to cooperate,

101
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:13,762
so let's do it on our own.

102
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:17,362
First, let's find out what kind of problem Mr. Manaka had.

103
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:18,362
-Okay! -Yeah!

104
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,762
We've got to stop him committing suicide, no matter what.

105
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,862
Yeah, prevent his suicide! Prevent his suicide!

106
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,562
Hey, I'm going too!

107
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,462
Is Mr. Manaka an artist?

108
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:31,962
He's not famous at all though.

109
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,362
But, it's a pretty drawing.

110
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:37,262
They're all simple and nice drawings.

111
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,862
He's a very serious person,

112
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:41,762
who takes about six months to finish one drawing.

113
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:44,862
That's why he ends up not being able to pay his rent.

114
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,762
Did he have problems with money?

115
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:49,262
Mr. Daijirou Manaka.

116
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,362
Give us back what you owe us today!

117
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,862
Interest and all, the total is 2 million yen!

118
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,762
Mr. Manaka's not in.

119
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:59,162
Shoots! We're coming back again later.

120
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,262
If Mr. Manaka were to have any problems,

121
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,162
debts are all I can think of.

122
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:06,562
After all, those two come everyday and bug him to pay them back.

123
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:08,862
If money is what his problem is,

124
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,062
the Youth Detective Squad can't do anything about it.

125
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:14,562
But, we can't give up just like that!

126
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:18,862
Isn't there anyone who'll lend Mr. Manaka money?

127
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:22,462
He has no family, he does have an uncle.

128
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:23,762
But no matter how many times he went and asked for help,

129
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,262
it seems his uncle didn't lend him even a cent.

130
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,662
Is his uncle also poor?

131
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,462
His uncle is filthy rich!

132
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:34,362
He's called Mr. Ginbayashi, and owns a big mansion in Beika South.

133
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:36,362
Beika South?

134
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:37,862
Oh yeah, there's a really big mansion

135
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:40,462
with the name plate Ginbayashi on it!

136
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:43,262
He's a lone man with no family too,

137
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:49,162
so I don't see why he isn't a bit nicer to his only blood-related nephew?

138
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:52,162
Only blood related nephew.

139
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,962
I see, so that's the story!

140
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:56,262
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

141
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:05,262
I got it!

142
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:07,562
Have you figured out a way to solve Mr. Manaka's money problem?

143
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:10,962
-Not yet. -Then what did you figure out?

144
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:14,862
The reason Mr. Manaka was walking where he was.

145
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,562
You figured it out, Mitsuhiko?

146
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:21,962
Mr. Manaka was on his way to his uncle's house in Beika South!

147
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:23,562
That's most likely.

148
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:27,562
His purpose was to commit suicide at his uncle's house

149
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:29,262
to get back at him...

150
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:30,762
"Ginbayashi"

151
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:38,862
for not lending him money no matter how many times he asked.

152
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,362
I see!

153
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:45,662
Unfortunately, Mitsuhiko, that doesn't explain anything.

154
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,162
The truth is probably...

155
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,462
What's up, Conan?

156
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:52,162
Not again! Hey!

157
00:08:58,062 --> 00:08:59,762
I thought you all went home.

158
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,862
No, this bugged me after all.

159
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,662
Does your foot hurt?

160
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,662
The anesthesia's wearing off, so yeah...

161
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:12,862
But, I'm glad, that all you broke is the bone of your leg.

162
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:16,162
If it were your hands, you wouldn't be able to draw.

163
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,562
True.

164
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:20,562
He knows that he's an artist.

165
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,662
He's lying about having lost his memory after all.

166
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,962
He didn't want to give himself away being questioned by Officer Takagi

167
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:29,262
so he decided on the spot to feign having lost his memory.

168
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:36,662
About him heading over to his uncle's place back then

169
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:39,762
is probably just as Mitsuhiko deduced.

170
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:42,362
But, it wasn't to commit suicide.

171
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:45,762
But rather, to make it look like suicide and kill Ginbayashi.

172
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:49,662
Those gloves were to not leave his fingerprints behind.

173
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:53,162
The contents of the will make sense, if this was the case.

174
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:55,662
"I'm tired of going on living, already."

175
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,562
That's what an aged person would say!

176
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:01,562
If Mr. Ginbayashi dies, the entire estate

177
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,262
will fall into the hands of his only blood-related nephew, Mr. Manaka.

178
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:06,262
That was probably what he was after.

179
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:10,162
The problem is, how can I prove this attempted scheme?

180
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:11,562
What can I do?

181
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:13,262
Conan!

182
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,562
We were looking for you because you suddenly disappeared.

183
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:18,662
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

184
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:19,662
Yes?

185
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,762
Let's say there's a murder scheme here.

186
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:25,762
It's a crime that involves a person's life.

187
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:29,662
But, nothing's happened yet, it's going to happen in the future,

188
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,262
so there's no proof yet.

189
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,462
How would you corner such a culprit?

190
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,462
There's no need to corner the culprit!

191
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:44,062
If it hasn't happened yet, then you prevent it from happening!

192
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,562
Exactly.

193
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,862
There you are, Conan!

194
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,562
We looked all over for you!

195
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:55,962
Let's go to his uncle Mr. Ginbayashi's place and ask him to help out.

196
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:59,162
If he helps out with the debts,

197
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,362
Mr. Manaka won't have to think of doing something

198
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,462
as stupid as he did anymore, would he?

199
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,062
You mean when you said involving someone's life,

200
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,262
you were referring to suicide?

201
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,962
Just what are you talking about?

202
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:16,162
All I'm saying is let's stop a crime before it even happens!

203
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,267
Daijirou tried to commit suicide?

204
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:30,167
He happens to have amnesia right now.

205
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,567
But, if his memory comes back, he may again think of...

206
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,367
His problem involves debts.

207
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,867
So long as you dish the cash out for him...

208
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,667
-I have no intention of helping him out. -President.

209
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,967
You can still save him now.

210
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,167
I don't know if I should be telling you children this,

211
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:48,067
but after graduating from university, Daijirou worked for a bank.

212
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,067
I was happy.

213
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,067
Especially because I was thinking of having him succeed my company

214
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,067
when the time came.

215
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,767
But, he quit the bank in six months.

216
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,767
Just to follow an old dream to become an artist.

217
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,467
He's a selfish guy who trampled all over me.

218
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,867
Why do I have to go out of my way to help a guy like that?

219
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,467
But...

220
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:08,467
The last he came here was last month.

221
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,767
He asked me to lend him money.

222
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,667
A grown man begging on his hands a knees?

223
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,567
How wretched can you get?

224
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,967
Swear that you'll quit being an artist.

225
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:23,267
I'll lend you as much as you want if you do.

226
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,467
Never mind already!

227
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:29,067
I'm not asking a snob like you for anything anymore!

228
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:32,867
Well said. Don't you ever show your face again!

229
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:36,867
I told him that I'd help him but he refused, that idiot.

230
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,067
Money may not be his only purpose.

231
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,667
Maybe Mr. Manaka thought of killing him

232
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,367
because of a grudge against him for not understanding his feelings.

233
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,667
It's time for me to go to work.

234
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,367
Get ready, will you, Hinuma?

235
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:53,567
But, president...

236
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,767
He clung to his dream.

237
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:58,667
If so, he can starve to death or commit suicide.

238
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,767
He's free to do what he pleases!

239
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,567
Mr. Ginbayashi!

240
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,767
His eyes were wandering too.

241
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,867
What a cruel uncle.

242
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,067
-Conan! -Conan!

243
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,867
No use, there's nothing more we can do!

244
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:20,067
I can't let anything like this happen!

245
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,367
"Ginbayashi Corporation"

246
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:35,767
Are you sure you don't have to go see Daijirou at the hospital?

247
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,567
Just let that guy be!

248
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,067
I know that's not how you truly feel.

249
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,767
He wasn't being truthful after all.

250
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:43,967
You couldn't let him be,

251
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:47,267
that's why each time there's an exhibition...

252
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,167
You secretly send me there to buy his drawings.

253
00:13:58,267 --> 00:13:59,567
Shut up!

254
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:08,367
Stop pestering me. I'm not dishing out any cash!

255
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:12,067
You were secretly buying his drawings for him up to now too, weren't you?

256
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,267
You eavesdropped?

257
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,767
But, if you do it in secret,

258
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:19,367
Mr. Manaka won't know that you are rooting for him, right?

259
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,367
And because he doesn't know,

260
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:25,267
so I think that Mr. Manaka hates you a whole lot.

261
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,667
I think so too.

262
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,667
It's about time you tell Daijirou how you really feel.

263
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,667
Don't get me wrong, Hinuma!

264
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,967
I didn't ask you to go buy his drawings because I support his activity.

265
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,667
I did so to burn his drawings!

266
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,867
Where are the drawings I asked you to go buy, then?

267
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,967
There are none of them here or at the mansion.

268
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,467
Of course there aren't.

269
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,867
I burnt them to ashes to spite him for trampling all over me.

270
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,467
No way.

271
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,367
It's because you're blood related to him after all, right?

272
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,667
Just what do you mean?

273
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,667
You're both so much alike.

274
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,467
Your eyes, both yours and Mr. Manaka's wander when you lie.

275
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,867
You brat. I'm kicking you out of here!

276
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,267
Give me a hand, Hinuma!

277
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,867
No, because I want to know why you're lying too, president!

278
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,067
What lie are you talking about?

279
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,467
Hold it, you cheeky brat!

280
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,967
You brat! Just what do you think you're doing?

281
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,467
I'm sorry!

282
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:23,667
Even if you lie, there's bound to be some kind of evidence.

283
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,567
I've found the evidence!

284
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,767
No way.

285
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,767
Hey, sir, please go see Mr. Manaka,

286
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:34,667
and tell him that you've been backing him up all this time!

287
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,267
If you don't,

288
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,767
this case will never come to an end!

289
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,867
"Watanabe Central Hospital"

290
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:56,767
It seems that they think for now that I was trying to commit suicide,

291
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,767
but I'm sure they'll eventually find out the truth.

292
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,467
No use feigning that you have amnesia any longer.

293
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:05,867
You were scheming to kill your uncle Mr. Daizo Ginbayashi.

294
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,067
You're under arrest!

295
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,567
This is the end for you!

296
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,067
I can't leave things as is!

297
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:25,767
I see, you tried to solve the problem for him.

298
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,867
But, it turned out that there was nothing we could do.

299
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,567
Okay. Now, it's my turn.

300
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,567
I'll convince him after he gets his memory back.

301
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,467
"No matter how bad of a financial problem you have,"

302
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:38,267
"you can't ever think of suicide," I'll say.

303
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,667
They're the collectors!

304
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,967
He's lying about having lost his memory.

305
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,467
Don't think you can get away with something like this?

306
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,667
Stop!

307
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,267
Officer Takagi!

308
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,467
He heard us and fled!

309
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:58,667
Don't let him get away!

310
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,467
He's gone.

311
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:07,967
From here?

312
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,167
He couldn't have! He's got a broken leg, you know!

313
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,067
But where else did he...

314
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,467
He has amnesia, but he recognized the debt collector's voice?

315
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,867
It's reverse! He heard the voice of the collectors, he was shocked

316
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,367
and his memory returned!

317
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,367
So, shock treatment did it after all!

318
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:26,067
His memory returned, which means...

319
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:27,867
He may be thinking of committing suicide?

320
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,067
Mr. Manaka disappeared?

321
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,467
We're looking for him but...

322
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,167
Nobody on that side saw him!

323
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,267
Same here.

324
00:17:57,267 --> 00:18:00,367
Which means he could still be in the hospital?

325
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,667
Anyway, Conan, come over here too!

326
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,667
Okay.

327
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,267
He regained his memory

328
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:10,767
so unless we hurry, maybe this time for sure he'll commit suicide.

329
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:14,067
To be honest, you're worried about him, aren't you, Mr. Ginbayashi?

330
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,367
Hinuma, get the car!

331
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,867
He's not here.

332
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,867
There he is!

333
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,067
He stopped.

334
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,067
Don't tell me he's going to jump in?

335
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,467
We've gotta hurry!

336
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,067
I can't walk any farther

337
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:42,167
because I haven't eaten anything from yesterday so I'm starved.

338
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,367
I was striving to be an artist too.

339
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,967
But, I couldn't make a living so I got rid of that dream.

340
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,867
So, that's the story.

341
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,067
Then, you more than anyone else should be able to understand

342
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,967
the difficulty that Daijirou is going through.

343
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,867
I'd figure you'd help him from your side.

344
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,167
Just the opposite.

345
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,567
Yeah, because he understands,

346
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:06,667
he more so deliberately gave Mr. Manaka the cold shoulder.

347
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,667
Don't die, Daijirou.

348
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,267
Don't take rash action!

349
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,667
Don't die!

350
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,467
Don't ever think of committing suicide!

351
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,267
Your memory returned, right?

352
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,667
I'll hear you out, tell me about it!

353
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,967
If you hear me out, I'll give myself away.

354
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,567
Don't come! I'm going to jump if you do!

355
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,167
We've finally found you!

356
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,467
Return our 2 million yen!

357
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,367
Stay away! All of you stay away!

358
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,767
If you come, I'll jump, I mean it!

359
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,567
I'll kill myself! I'll really kill myself!

360
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,567
Shouting repeatedly that you'll kill yourself. How wretched can you get?

361
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,867
What brings you here?

362
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,367
When you came to tell me you wanted to become an artist,

363
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,367
I was against it!

364
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,567
I told you that you can't make a living as an artist.

365
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,567
But you wouldn't listen to me. You decided to pursue your dream.

366
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,867
You idiot!

367
00:19:56,867 --> 00:20:00,567
A snob like you would never understand how I feel!

368
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,967
Just as I thought, you came to me for help.

369
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,967
But, Daijirou,

370
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:08,067
asking for help as soon as you fall into a rut

371
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,667
with such a dependent attitude,

372
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,067
you would never be able to realize your dream!

373
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,567
That's why I went out of my way not to pamper you.

374
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,867
I refused to help you no matter how much you asked for help.

375
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,767
Stop talking to suit yourself!

376
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,667
But, you couldn't help not helping him,

377
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,967
so you were backing him up secretly, right?

378
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:31,167
He was buying your paintings.

379
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,267
My paintings?

380
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,867
He was buying your paintings and sending them to elementary schools.

381
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,967
See.

382
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,167
That's the elementary school I graduated from.

383
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:46,167
This seems to be a thank you letter from the students there.

384
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,367
"Thank you for all the beautiful paintings!"

385
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:52,867
Beautiful drawings will always make the hearts of children richer.

386
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:55,467
I believed so, and kept on sending the drawings to them.

387
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,967
You bought my pictures.

388
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:01,067
You were constantly helping me behind the scenes.

389
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,267
Why didn't you tell me?

390
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:04,867
I didn't help you!

391
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,667
I bought them because they were good drawings.

392
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,767
They just so happened to be what you drew!

393
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,467
He's going out of his way to look like a snob.

394
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,867
He turned out to be a nice man that is really thinking about his nephew.

395
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:15,867
Yeah!

396
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:18,267
His eyes are wandering again.

397
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,667
2 million yen, was it?

398
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,967
Thanks.

399
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,867
I'm not helping him!

400
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,767
I'm paying in advance

401
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,967
for the next drawing that the children are looking forward to!

402
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,567
Uncle.

403
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,867
I'm sorry. I was actually...

404
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,167
You need not say anything anymore.

405
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,967
Just don't ever think of committing suicide ever again!

406
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,667
I'm sorry.

407
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,367
I'm sorry, uncle!

408
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,367
It seems he didn't commit a crime

409
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:56,167
that involved someone's life.

410
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,467
I guess so.

411
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,767
I really want to taste this.

412
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:29,467
He's looking at it again.

413
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:32,667
It's going to come falling again, the steel-frames!

414
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,867
Look out!

415
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:38,867
Oh, that was close. I almost drooled on my shirt.

416
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,867
Conan?

417
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,967
What are you doing?

418
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,467
I wonder.

419
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,967
"Next Episode"

420
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,667
All done!

421
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:54,867
I hope you guys still remember that we came here to dig up clams.

422
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,667
It seems somebody's not enjoying himself much.

423
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,067
See!

424
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:03,167
It seems you've forgotten one very important thing.

425
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,867
This is probably a blood stain.

426
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:06,867
Blood?

427
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,867
No!

428
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,667
Next Conan,

429
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:16,867
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 1)"

430
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:19,952
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:22,352
"Pair look parkas"

432
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:24,252
I hope a bowl of eel over rice comes falling.

433
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:25,352
It falling!

434
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:26,652
It could never happen.
