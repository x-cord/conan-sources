1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,740
Pops Kogoro, Ran and I

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,140
went to visit a Noh museum located in the suburbs.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,140
The Mouri Detective Agency receives a letter warning

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,040
that a scheme to kill the owner of the museum is underway.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,840
At the museum that was closed that day,

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,840
besides the owner of the museum, Mr. Jisaburo Izumi,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,240
his private nurse, Ms. Hatsuho Toba,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,640
all employees at the museum, Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,740
Ms. Moyono Mibu, and Mr. Seinosuke Nagata,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,240
and Mr. Naruya Akaza, who came to visit the owner.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,840
While the owner was showing us through the building,

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,340
we encountered several dangerous situations

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,040
that could've taken our lives,

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,840
and eventually, Mr. Akaza ended up being killed.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,940
Ran and I who suspected Moyono, snuck into the office

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,440
in order to contact the police. However...

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,540
I've got to call the police right away.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,240
Huh? I'm sure that Ms. Mibu made the call already.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,140
She was just acting it out.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
Ran, run away!

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,140
Don't you move either, Miss.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
I'll bet it never dawned on you that

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,240
all three of us were accomplices.

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,740
You stay put right there until we finish off the director.

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,240
So, you mean that person called Nagata is also one of them?

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
Darn!

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,140
Director Izumi's life is in danger!

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,040
Aim for a 100% solution.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,440
Clear all mysteries and codes.

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,240
There are three eerie accomplices!

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,340
Solve the mystery of the premeditated homicide!

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,640
His name is Detective Conan!

35
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:43,504
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 2)"

36
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:55,104
And so I fell asleep at a time like that.

37
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:07,204
What's this?

38
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:08,904
Hey, Miss.

39
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:11,904
It can't be.

40
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:19,504
Did they get away?

41
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,804
Those brats!

42
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,604
Awesome.

43
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,704
Mr. Mouri. To tell the truth.

44
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:38,104
This woman is the daughter of Kodo, the mask maker.

45
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,204
Although her surname has changed to Mibu

46
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:42,204
after her mother's divorce.

47
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:43,304
Director!

48
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:46,704
No problem, is there? He'll eventually find out anyway.

49
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,704
When Kodo was healthy,

50
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,004
he used to carve Noh masks over there.

51
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,704
That area was where you used to play, wasn't it?

52
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:04,304
She was angry at Akaza for selling

53
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,904
her father's works for a cheap price.

54
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,304
Which means she had a motive for killing him.

55
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:16,404
Don't take him seriously, Mr. famed detective.

56
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:21,404
If you will excuse me, I'll go get you another cup of tea.

57
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,804
Oh, thank you.

58
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:29,804
Inspector sure is late, isn't he?

59
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:34,504
I'll go and check the entrance, then.

60
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,704
She's very diligent.

61
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:44,804
She helps me out a lot.

62
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,404
Not enough heavy weight.

63
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:58,704
So, it's you.

64
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:02,404
We almost did it but... too bad.

65
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:29,904
What's this? This is the mask of Ayakashi?

66
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:37,204
Mr. Nagata.

67
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:38,404
Why?

68
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:39,704
Fire!

69
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:44,804
Let's go inside using that small entrance over there!

70
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,604
Darn! It won't open!

71
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:50,404
A saru seems to be inserted.

72
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:51,404
Saru?

73
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,704
It's a small lock used to lock rain shutters.

74
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,004
Those brats!

75
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:08,504
Director!

76
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:09,504
Don't worry.

77
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,804
Dad! Open this door!

78
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,104
Dad!

79
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:16,504
Coming!

80
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,704
Take the director outside!

81
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,704
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,604
I'll open it now!

83
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:22,504
Okay.

84
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:25,604
Where's the director?

85
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:28,804
Ms. Toba took him outside just now.

86
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:30,204
Where's Moyono?

87
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:33,404
She left saying that she'd serve us a new cup of tea a while ago.

88
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,404
Fire?

89
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:39,504
Darn! My God!

90
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:41,104
Let's get out of here too!

91
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:43,904
What? It won't open!

92
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,704
Let's go out to the yard from the small entrance.

93
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,704
The exit's?

94
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,704
Over there! There's a door!

95
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:01,204
Oh, what good timing! Help me, will you?

96
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,504
It'll take at least 20 minutes

97
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,404
before the firefighters get here.

98
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,304
Saved.

99
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,604
This is...

100
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,604
The place where the Noh stage is.

101
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:29,804
There's an exit!

102
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:37,104
The fire's already gotten around!

103
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:39,604
Dad, look over there!

104
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,704
The mask of Kijo?

105
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:45,304
It's that woman. Hey, come down here!

106
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:48,804
Don't you flee!

107
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:51,504
More than that, how're we going to get out of here?

108
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,804
It's a ladder! If we climb up there,

109
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:56,904
we can probably go outside through the skylight, no?

110
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,504
The skylight.

111
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,604
Keep your eyes closed and you'll be fine!

112
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:07,904
Dad. Hang in there.

113
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,504
This looks bad, Ran.

114
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,604
We're quite a distance apart from the next building.

115
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:17,804
What now?

116
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:20,504
We'll use the ladder as a bridge now!

117
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:22,104
Bridge?

118
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:27,804
Quick, Dad.

119
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,404
Stop slave driving me.

120
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,704
Ready, get set!

121
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:38,904
We did!

122
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:42,004
If we cross the ladder, we can go over to the window.

123
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:51,104
I'll close my eyes.

124
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,904
Keep my eyes closed.

125
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:56,904
Just a bit more, Dad!

126
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:58,704
Keep...

127
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:02,504
It's suddenly turned modern.

128
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:05,104
They probably added on this annex later.

129
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,904
Let's get going. That woman was there.

130
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,904
They're should be a way out.

131
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,104
An extension phone? Where's it coming from?

132
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:17,304
Hello.

133
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:19,704
Oh, Ms. Toba, so you're okay.

134
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:23,004
Yes, I'm in the kitchen with the director.

135
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,504
The fire hasn't gotten around here yet.

136
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:26,804
Be careful!

137
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,604
Beware of the chief manager and the woman called Mibu.

138
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:31,404
Stay in hiding for a while.

139
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,704
We've already contacted the police.

140
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:35,404
Just hold it out a bit longer.

141
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,004
-No, don't, Sis. No! -What's the matter?

142
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:42,804
Sis?

143
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:47,804
Sis? You mean Hatsuho is Moyono's younger sister?

144
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,204
At any rate, we've got to hurry,

145
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:51,204
or the life of the director is in danger!

146
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:56,404
Somebody's lying on the ground.

147
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:57,704
No, it can't be.

148
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,504
It's the chief manager.

149
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:07,404
He's the third one.

150
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:09,104
Where are the director and Hatsuho?

151
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:11,104
In the kitchen. Let's go.

152
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,604
Darn. Too late.

153
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:37,504
Hatsuho?

154
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:41,004
Get a hold of yourself, Hatsuho.

155
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:55,004
I knew about my sister and her accomplices' plan and yet...

156
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,204
Yet in the end I had no choice but to kill her.

157
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:59,804
I stabbed my own sister,

158
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:03,104
so I'm a terrible sister.

159
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,404
You couldn't help it.

160
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:09,504
You could've been killed by her too, you know.

161
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:16,704
Director. And I warned you.

162
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,004
What's that?

163
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:23,404
An iron skewer and something is afloat.

164
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,104
What's this?

165
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,304
Inspector Megure.

166
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:37,204
These four people, Mr. Naruya Akaza. Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji.

167
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,204
Mr. Seinosuke Nagata and Ms. Moyono Mibu

168
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:41,404
have been confirmed dead, but...

169
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:44,604
Director Izumi has made it through.

170
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:46,104
Thank God.

171
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:49,504
We can't talk to him yet, though.

172
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:52,804
His stab wound matched the chisel

173
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,104
that Ms. Mibu was holding,

174
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:57,004
so there's probably no doubt that she's the one

175
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:58,704
who attacked him.

176
00:12:58,704 --> 00:12:59,904
Okay.

177
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:02,104
Chisel?

178
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,804
No, don't, Sis!

179
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:12,304
I see.

180
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,304
I get it.

181
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:26,096
I tried but couldn't stop her.

182
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,696
My older sister had a grudge against the director.

183
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:30,896
Because he used Akaza

184
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:34,696
to sell off our father's works abroad.

185
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:38,196
How did you feel about the director?

186
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:42,396
My mother is not the same as my sister's

187
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:44,496
and we were brought up apart from each other for a long time.

188
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:47,996
Besides, the director treated me very well.

189
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,696
That's why when you heard of the murder plan,

190
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,096
you wanted to prevent it.

191
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:56,596
Yes. That's why I sent Mr. Mouri the letter.

192
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,896
But I couldn't stop my older sister from going on with the plan.

193
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:03,196
Was she the one who killed the chief manager and manager too?

194
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:04,796
I think it was her.

195
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:06,896
Because she used to say if those two die,

196
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:10,896
all the cash would be hers.

197
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,496
I see.

198
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,796
Inspector.

199
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:16,096
Although I did it on the spur of the moment,

200
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,896
I'm the one who stabbed my sister.

201
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:22,596
You took the iron skewer out from the kitchen, didn't you?

202
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,796
I was trying to protect the director, you see.

203
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:26,896
Please...

204
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:32,396
It's true that you stabbed Ms. Mibu,

205
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,896
but in your case,

206
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,796
I guess it'll be concluded as killing in self defense.

207
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:41,496
I'll hear the rest of you out at the station.

208
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,696
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:45,196
Mr. Mouri. Come along with us too.

210
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,196
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,996
Hey. The case has already been...

212
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:55,796
Solved.

213
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:58,196
Far from it, Inspector.

214
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:02,496
The culprit is right in front of your eyes.

215
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:06,096
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

216
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,596
Dad, Hatsuho is a victim, isn't she?

217
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,396
First of all, I couldn't understand

218
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:16,196
how Mr. Akaza was killed.

219
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:19,696
How did the culprit lace the poison onto what the victim took?

220
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,496
Hatsuho licked the cheese

221
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:24,696
and Mr. Akaza who ate that same cheese

222
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:26,196
dies right after that.

223
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:32,196
So, was poison laced onto the butter knife that Mr. Akaza used?

224
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:35,396
But, everyone was free to sit wherever he wanted to back then

225
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:37,296
so, it would've been impossible to place an aim on,

226
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:39,496
and kill the target.

227
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,896
However, there is just one way that it could've been done.

228
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:45,696
By using the spoon that first used by the taster.

229
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:50,296
If the poison was laced only onto the back of the spoon.

230
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,396
Even if the cheese that was scooped was not poisoned,

231
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:53,596
at this instant,

232
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:57,196
the poison was laced onto the remaining cheese.

233
00:15:57,196 --> 00:16:02,096
When Mr. Akaza died, the spoon that fell to the floor

234
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:05,396
was switched to a clean spoon before we knew it.

235
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:08,996
Because if the spoon were to be left as is,

236
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:12,196
the trick would be exposed.

237
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:13,896
The only one who was capable of

238
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:18,596
doing something like that back then was you, Hatsuho

239
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:22,596
who wiped off the cheese from the director.

240
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:25,696
The real reason you sent me the forewarning of murder

241
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,696
was to set me up as a witness.

242
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,096
To make me testify that the three villains died

243
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:37,196
and you survived through legitimate self-defence.

244
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,896
After keeping me in check by the fire,

245
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:41,496
you went out and killed everyone during that time.

246
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:44,196
But, you couldn't afford having me burn to death.

247
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,896
You probably stuck your face out of that window

248
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,496
because of this.

249
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:51,996
Then, the person wearing the mask of Kijo wasn't Moyono?

250
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:54,696
No. And, the highlight of your act,

251
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:58,396
was your scream on the extension phone.

252
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,896
Back then, you had already stabbed the director

253
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,796
and killed your older sister.

254
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:05,896
But she screamed 'No, don't, Sis'.

255
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,996
She acted it out alone.

256
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,696
I couldn't have don't something like that.

257
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,196
The director was stabbed with the chisel by my older sister.

258
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:19,296
But, I didn't have time to take a weapon like that out with me!

259
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:20,796
I see.

260
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:23,596
It's true that Moyono could've done that.

261
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:26,596
You probably seduced her to do so, either way,

262
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,996
by telling her to use the tools

263
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,696
that your father use to use to kill the director.

264
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:33,696
But, you took the iron skewers.

265
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,496
It would never serve as a substitute for the chisel!

266
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:40,396
You stabbed your sister with the iron skewer.

267
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,596
Moyono Mibu may have been a terrible woman,

268
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,396
but I guess she trusted her younger sister?

269
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:47,396
No, I don't think that's it.

270
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,496
I'm sure she assumed that the one who sent me the letter

271
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,096
was her younger sister.

272
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:53,996
That's why I'm sure she figured that she couldn't trust you.

273
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:55,696
Then, you took the initiative

274
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,996
and stabbed the director before her eyes.

275
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,996
Then, after Moyono started to trust you,

276
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:05,096
you stabbed her from the front using the iron skewer.

277
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:07,696
But the director's wound

278
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:10,296
was one that was made using a chisel, wasn't it?

279
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:14,396
Right. That was your final stronghold,

280
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:19,096
but unfortunately, you left behind a crucial evidence.

281
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:21,596
The culprit was very busy.

282
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:25,396
You were unlucky that you had no time to erase the evidence.

283
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,596
Conan, bring it over here, will you?

284
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,596
Okay.

285
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,196
Here it is!

286
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:33,296
What is it?

287
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:35,596
It just looks like a plain piece of wood.

288
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:40,196
According to Pops, he thinks it's handmade by that lady.

289
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:43,596
There's a V-shaped slit made on it.

290
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:47,396
It looks sort of like the teeth of a chisel.

291
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,596
A chisel?

292
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,896
I get it!

293
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:56,196
Yep! That lady brought two skewers out of the kitchen.

294
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:57,996
She assembled the two skewers

295
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:01,396
so that the flat sides would form a V-shape

296
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:06,296
and inserted them into the slits of the two wooden pieces.

297
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:10,396
She stabbed the director with her handmade weapon.

298
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,696
Isn't that right, Miss?

299
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,696
You got me there! You really got me!

300
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,596
I give up, sonny.

301
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:33,796
Absolutely, that Hatsuho Toba's exclusive weapon making device.

302
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:36,496
At first, I made it look like a chisel,

303
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,896
the second time I used just one skewer.

304
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:43,496
Which means you did it, after all.

305
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:47,096
Yes, I'm the culprit.

306
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:51,596
Why'd you go as far as to kill your own sister?

307
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:53,196
Why wouldn't I?

308
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:56,696
That woman was the director's lover, you get?

309
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,596
She lead a rich comfortable life with the director's money

310
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:03,996
while my Mother and I were barely making a living.

311
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,796
She dares holding a grudge against her father at this point?

312
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:08,696
That's nonsense.

313
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:11,596
That jerk Akaza was selling off valuable Noh masks

314
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:13,896
as instructed by the director!

315
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,596
On top of that, he had the nerve to copy that director

316
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:18,196
and give me the eye.

317
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:19,596
Talk about giving me the creeps.

318
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:23,496
A museum so superficial should just burn down to ashes.

319
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,396
It would do everyone and the world more good

320
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:28,396
to turn this place into a park as soon as possible!

321
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:31,996
Inspector! I'm sorry to have kept waiting!

322
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,796
I'm done with my speech!

323
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:37,496
Go on and arrest me or do what you have to do!

324
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:38,996
Hey, Takagi!

325
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,796
Yes, sir!

326
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:46,696
Hello.

327
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:50,696
Oh, yes. I got it.

328
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,496
It seems that Director Izumi regained consciousness.

329
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:54,696
I see.

330
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,496
Just as I thought.

331
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:59,796
I thought it had a dull feel.

332
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:03,196
When I stabbed him, the wheelchair moved into the fountain

333
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,996
so I couldn't strike the final blow.

334
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:08,796
I'm still haphazard.

335
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,496
Oh, that's right.

336
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:14,996
The director seems to have said to tell the boy thank you.

337
00:21:14,996 --> 00:21:17,496
What did he mean, Conan?

338
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,896
I guess it was of some help to him then.

339
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:22,996
Hey, Director,

340
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:26,196
if you wrap a strong braided rope like this around yourself,

341
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,996
if something comes up, I'm sure it'll at least

342
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,696
be able to protect you a bit.

343
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,896
I see.

344
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:34,196
Okay, in fact the accessory of the armor

345
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:35,396
would probably protect me

346
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,496
even if I were to be attacked with a knife.

347
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:40,696
Thank God.

348
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,596
The ones who schemed the killing of the director,

349
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:11,996
ended up getting killed and so this ended ironically.

350
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:16,996
What's up, Pops?

351
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:20,296
This case sort of had a bad taste to it, didn't it?

352
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:23,496
To think that all those involved were bad people.

353
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:25,896
But in any case, it's like this!

354
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,896
Since it's a murder case,

355
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:29,996
it's not something that you can just say sorry and forget about.

356
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:33,296
But if you think you did something bad, you should apologise.

357
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,496
To the Noh masks.

358
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,896
Even if there's Noh excuse!

359
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:42,896
Get it?

360
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,696
Too funny!

361
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:50,796
I thought he was in deep thought and this is what comes out.

362
00:23:56,396 --> 00:24:00,296
Hey. I wonder why these chocolate bars was thrown away?

363
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:02,396
Why do such a thing deliberately?

364
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:06,396
I wonder if they're all really suspicious of that person.

365
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:11,096
"And the victor who survives alone laughs out loud."

366
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,196
As Ms. Chiga Kaido puts it,

367
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:16,096
"An ironic circuit is circling".

368
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:22,096
Next Conan, "The Devil's Circuit"

369
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,196
Next Conan's Hint:

370
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,096
"Chocolate Bar"

371
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,096
That initial "K" is going to join in on Lupa-Cona?

372
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,196
It's "K" for Kogoro, isn't it?

373
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:47,196
No, for King!
