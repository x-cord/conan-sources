1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,840
Well, thank you so much for everything.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,540
Thanks so much for breakfast too.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,640
No, not at all.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,540
Please forgive us for this was an unexpected occurrence!

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,840
Baloney.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,440
You were planning to spend the night here to begin with.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,940
Because you had change of clothes prepared too.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,340
See you soon then, Ran.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,540
See you.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,740
I'll be going too, then.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,740
Please drop by next time on your day off.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,540
Yes, sir, goodbye.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,640
Huh?

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,940
Where are you going, Mr. Otaki?

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,740
Tokyo Station is this way.

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,140
Yeah, you go on ahead.

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,240
I've got some business to finish off.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,340
I see.

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,840
The place is on the border of Saitama and Gunma prefecture.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,140
It's a western style mansion in the remote mountains.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,040
Tomorrow night they're having a conference

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,140
concerning inheritance of the estate.

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,340
Could you please attend it?

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,340
-"Heizo Hattori" -"According to the client,

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,940
-"Police Chief of Osaka," -it seems that the actions

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,240
-"Heiji's father" -of the owner of the mansion,

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
the inheritee is extremely weird.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,940
Therefore, we got a call asking for police personnel

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,340
to sit in at the conference.

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,840
Oh. Well, I don't mind.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,440
There was a murder

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,040
near the forest where that mansion is

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,340
and there're weird rumors going around too,

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,740
so this is not an order.

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
But, if you're going to attend, be careful

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,640
not to let them suck your blood.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
What're they going to suck?

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,540
You've been mumbling.

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm not going to be sucked and such for some time now.

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,740
Heiji?

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,940
I hope you're not talking about the lips of a woman.

42
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,240
Since when were you in the car?

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,440
We snuck in when you stopped

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,140
at the service station to the restroom.

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,640
You didn't realize we were here?

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Pops and everyone else is here too.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
But why?

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,240
They want to gaze upon the face of the woman

49
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,640
you're secretly meeting with, Mr. Otaki!

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,440
But, we had no idea that you had a woman here.

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,740
Ran and the others said that

52
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
they want to introduce her to them too!

53
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,940
Well, it's not a woman good enough to show you all.

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,240
Then will you tell us?

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
What kind of case is it?

56
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,340
It's a case, isn't it?

57
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,140
Since you're keeping it from me, I'll bet Dad's involved?

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Well, you see, six months ago...

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,340
A woman's body was found in the forest

60
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,540
near the mansion that we're headed for now.

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,040
She was found dead ruthlessly

62
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,540
tied upside down on a stake that stood vertically.

63
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,740
That's super gross.

64
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,140
That woman used to be the maid for that mansion.

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,040
But, since the way her body was found was sort of strange.

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,240
Sort of strange, how?

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,840
The old couple who found the corpse

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,640
thought at first that it was a scarecrow

69
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,140
to keep bears away

70
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,540
since the skin of the corpse was so white.

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,340
That's probably because the culprit cut her artery,

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,140
bled her to death, and tied her there.

73
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,140
But, there seems to have been no such

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,540
large wounds anywhere on her body.

75
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,940
All they found were two holes on her neck.

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,740
Two holes in her neck and she bled to death?

77
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,440
Hey. Dont tell me that's...

78
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
Yeah.

79
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,040
Otaki, do you believe they exist in this world?

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
Vampires?

81
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,140
Aim for a 100% solution.

82
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,540
Clear all mysteries and codes.

83
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,340
Dracula exists?

84
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,540
The curtains are raised to a shocking case.

85
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

86
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

87
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,740
His name is Detective Conan!

88
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:50,562
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (One)"

89
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:53,862
Vampire?

90
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:57,062
Are you saying that the murderer was a vampire?

91
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,962
It's just a rumor with no grounds.

92
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,462
It seems that such a feudal lord

93
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,162
used to govern this area in the past, you see.

94
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,962
A feudal lord?

95
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:09,662
And? That murderer hasn't been arrested yet?

96
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:10,762
No.

97
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:13,362
But, I'm sure you at least found a suspect.

98
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:15,762
Yes. The first to be suspected

99
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:19,262
was the owner of the mansion, Mr. Hakuya Torakura.

100
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:21,262
It seems that the maid who was killed

101
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,762
had confided in the Chef of the mansion.

102
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:25,662
That the owner of the mansion had been acting eerie recently

103
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:29,362
and that she wanted to quit because she felt endangered.

104
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:31,262
Then, it was the owner who did it after all.

105
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,762
Oh, no.

106
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:35,562
He had an alibi.

107
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,562
At the estimated time of death of the maid Ms. Shimizu,

108
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:41,262
the owner's alibi was that

109
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:44,362
he was confined to his room and asleep right through.

110
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,162
Ironically, the one who testified to this

111
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:52,262
was the Chef, who Ms. Shimizu had confided in.

112
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,762
Thank you for coming.

113
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,662
You're Inspector Otaki from the Osaka City Police, aren't you?

114
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:59,062
Yes.

115
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:01,162
So, you must be the one who called?

116
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:02,762
I'm Koga, the butler.

117
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:07,162
I was a comrades of Chief Hattori's father.

118
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,862
What is this about?

119
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,562
That the actions of the owner of this mansion's

120
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,262
been eerie recently?

121
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:15,062
Yeah. Recently, the owner

122
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:16,462
has been avoiding exposure to sunlight

123
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:19,462
and sleeping all during the day.

124
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:21,662
He also suddenly started saying that

125
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:23,562
he's become allergic silver and stopped using

126
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:25,462
the silverware he had been using all this time

127
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,262
and disposed of them all.

128
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,662
The other day, he cracked the soup dish

129
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,862
that had his favorite garlic flavor in it.

130
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,062
And said angrily, "Don't ever put garlic inside

131
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,962
because it'll rot my blood!"

132
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:38,462
Hey. It sounds just like...

133
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:40,962
Yes. It seems to have looked that way

134
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,362
to the maid, Ms. Shimizu.

135
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:47,462
He's just like a Dracula, a vampire.

136
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,362
Vampire?

137
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:52,062
Didn't he just say vampire?

138
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,062
What about the vampire?

139
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:55,262
Oh, no.

140
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:57,362
Bumper, the bumper.

141
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,962
We were discussing what to do about the dent

142
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,762
we made in the bumper of the rental car!

143
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:04,462
Oh, the bumper.

144
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:07,262
Hey! Come on in, Heiji and all of you!

145
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:09,662
It's like a castle and fantastic!

146
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:13,662
It's almost sundown

147
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:16,562
and about time that the owner will be getting up.

148
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,862
Please make yourselves at home

149
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,262
until it's time for dinner.

150
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:22,762
Oh, yes.

151
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,362
The talk about the inheritance

152
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:29,562
of the estate in question will be discussed after dinner.

153
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:32,362
I wonder if Inspector Otaki's sweetheart

154
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:35,362
is really in this mansion?

155
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:38,262
You mean you still believe that?

156
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,962
This is amazing!

157
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,962
I've only ever seen something like this in movies or dramas.

158
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,962
To think I'm actually experiencing it!

159
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:48,562
True.

160
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,262
I feel like we've become nobles too.

161
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:53,162
Who are you?

162
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:55,862
-"Ruri Torakura (38), Asanobu's wife" -Don't tell me that

163
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:58,462
you're brother-in-law's love children or something.

164
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,262
No way.

165
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:06,062
If so, he'd never ask us to come over here.

166
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,062
True. If he really had love children,

167
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,962
Hakuya's inheritance wouldn't be given to us, his siblings

168
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,962
but rather, all to his children.

169
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,562
But, you never know.

170
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:20,762
He suddenly brought a young beautiful fiance

171
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:24,262
with children here a few years ago, didn't he?

172
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:27,762
It's no surprise if he had two or three love children, right?

173
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:31,662
Well, although that fiance unfortunately died.

174
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:33,062
Oh, I get it!

175
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:35,162
For you guys, I guess I should say fortunately?

176
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:36,762
Hey, you.

177
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,962
Watch it!

178
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,962
If you ever say something like that again,

179
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:43,662
you're really going to get it!

180
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,462
What's with you?

181
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:48,562
I'll bet you thought you were lucky too, didn't you?

182
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,462
Oh, don't tell me that

183
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:55,062
you were really hooked on that lover with children?

184
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,062
Why you...

185
00:09:57,062 --> 00:10:00,262
Will you cut out the stuff about his lover?

186
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:03,662
After all, I'm the child of my father's lover too, you know.

187
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:08,362
Well, but if the inheritee only had siblings,

188
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:11,062
the amount of estate to be received would be the same,

189
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:12,762
so let's stay on peaceful terms.

190
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:13,862
Excuse me.

191
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,962
The Chef told me to ask you

192
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,862
if it's about time that we start serving dinner.

193
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:21,762
Oh, but if you're still not finished talking,

194
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:23,462
a little while later would do.

195
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,962
We can talk over dinner too,

196
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:27,562
so why don't you hurry and start serving?

197
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:30,662
Well, as for a mere love child of that woman,

198
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,262
it would be of no concern though.

199
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:37,462
This is a typical battle over inheritance.

200
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:38,662
I guess so.

201
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:42,662
Huh? An incurable disease?

202
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:45,362
Mr. Hakuya Torakura,

203
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:46,962
the owner of this mansion is afflicted?

204
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:49,862
Yes, that at most, he only had six more months.

205
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,962
Oh? Wasn't it three months?

206
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:56,162
That's why we came to this dinner meeting tonight.

207
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:57,762
Well, with something like

208
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:59,362
no inheritance for those who don't attend

209
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:01,962
written on the invitation card, who wouldn't...

210
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,362
But, what's taking him so long?

211
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,662
You're right. At this point, he'd usually

212
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:08,662
be complaining about the food.

213
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,962
Okay then, girls. I hate to trouble you,

214
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,062
but, won't you go and wake him up?

215
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,962
-Huh? -Us?

216
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,362
Turn right at the corridor

217
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:18,362
and it's the room at the very end.

218
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,962
True. Hakuya may feel much happier

219
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:24,162
if two young girls go to wake him up.

220
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:27,962
The room at the very end would be...

221
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,662
This one, right?

222
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,762
But, don't you think it's strange?

223
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:36,662
Would you normally ask your guests to do something like this?

224
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,962
Huh?

225
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:39,862
There's no bed.

226
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,062
Hey, no way?

227
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:45,162
-A coffin? -I see, I got it!

228
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,962
I thought that when they sent us to wake him up,

229
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:50,062
everybody was sort of grinning.

230
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:51,862
I'll bet they wanted to frighten us

231
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,562
by making us wake a man who is asleep in the coffin up!

232
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:57,962
No one should go into something like this before dying.

233
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,962
What is it, what's wrong?

234
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:16,562
The man's in here.

235
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,162
He's just asleep.

236
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:23,062
He sleeps in there recently saying that

237
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,362
he's eventually going in there anyway.

238
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:26,762
He was splattered with blood

239
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,662
with a stake poked into his chest, you know?

240
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:30,262
Splattered with blood?

241
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:32,562
He's taking his joke a bit too far.

242
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:35,962
It's no joke, he's dead!

243
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:38,862
What's going on here? It won't open!

244
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,762
There's nobody in here!

245
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,162
No way?

246
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,062
Are you sure he was in here?

247
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:51,562
Yep. I think he was.

248
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:55,962
You mean he evaporated and vanished?

249
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:58,262
As if he was some sort of monster...

250
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,754
We're not lying!

251
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,354
He was really sleeping in here!

252
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:13,954
With blood splattered and a stake

253
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:14,954
pierced through his chest.

254
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:16,854
He was wearing a black cape.

255
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:17,854
He had pointy ears

256
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:19,554
and had something that looked like fangs too.

257
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:21,054
As if he were...

258
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,654
Count Dracula!

259
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,454
He looked like...

260
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:27,254
Count Dracula?

261
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:29,954
Come to think of it, he was called by that nickname

262
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:32,654
when he was a child.

263
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:35,754
Count Dracula because he was Hakuya Torakura.

264
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,254
A nickname that only children would think of.

265
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,154
But, that nickname.

266
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,554
Maybe it wasn't just a play on words?

267
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:45,354
When you take into consideration

268
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:48,154
-the ancestors of the Torakura family. -True.

269
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,654
In addition, the eerily strange actions of Hakuya

270
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,554
in recent years.

271
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:56,954
Maybe he was really possessed

272
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,854
by a vampire.

273
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,954
It's a joke, only joke!

274
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:04,054
Hakuya doesn't have pointed ears

275
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,054
nor does he have fangs.

276
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,154
If what you saw was Hakuya,

277
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:13,254
he was trying to scare you by dressing up like a monster!

278
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:15,054
I don't know what trick he used to

279
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,854
disappear from the coffin though.

280
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:20,754
Well, to vanish just like magic...

281
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,654
you can see stuff like that in the movies etc.

282
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,754
It's indeed what a vampire would do.

283
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:26,754
Why you...

284
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:28,754
How dare you talk about Hakuya as if he were a monster!

285
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:31,954
I'll bet I'm not the only one who thinks so.

286
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,654
Right, Mr. Butler?

287
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:35,054
You asked them to come here

288
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,254
because you thought so too, right?

289
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:39,054
Yes, sir.

290
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:44,254
Because the owner was acting much too eerie recently.

291
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:47,054
I decided to have these police detectives

292
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,554
sit in on the talk about inheritance.

293
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,054
Police detectives?

294
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:54,654
I'm Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

295
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,654
He is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

296
00:14:57,654 --> 00:14:59,154
-No way. -Don't tell me

297
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:00,454
he's the Sleeping Kogoro?

298
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:01,554
The one and only!

299
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:03,654
Excuse me.

300
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,954
Your food's getting cold.

301
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:07,954
Would you like me to warm it up again?

302
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:09,654
Hey, Mr. Otaki.

303
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,954
I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're talking but...

304
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,854
Can I have you go to a police station nearby

305
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,654
and check this red thing out?

306
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,954
If it was as Kazuha and Ran saw,

307
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:23,554
this should be Mr. Torakura's blood.

308
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:30,954
Hakuya didn't show up after all.

309
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,554
It was written on the invitation card that

310
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:35,054
the talk would take place after dinner and yet...

311
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:37,454
Well, it didn't say that we were going to be having the talk

312
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:39,454
in the dining room either.

313
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:42,754
Hey, Conan. Dad's not around, is he?

314
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:45,254
Pops said he was going to buy cigarettes

315
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:48,054
and left by car with Inspector Otaki.

316
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:51,954
Hey. Why don't we at least finish taking pictures?

317
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:53,654
What's that about?

318
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,754
Every time we have a family gathering like this,

319
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,554
we take pictures together.

320
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:01,254
They've been doing this from three generations before!

321
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:03,854
But are you going to take pictures

322
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:05,554
without the owner of the mansion?

323
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,254
Yeah. Even last year,

324
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:12,054
Hakuya came bursting into the room saying, "Don't forget me."

325
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,554
True.

326
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,054
If we all get on with enjoying ourselves,

327
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:19,154
he might just pop in.

328
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:24,654
Mina, pull your chin in a bit.

329
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:25,654
Come on, sis.

330
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:27,654
Just how long are you going to spend fixing your hair?

331
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,854
You're not gonna get any younger no matter how long you mess with it!

332
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,754
Shut up.

333
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,254
Don't worry.

334
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:35,354
You're still beautiful, honey.

335
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:36,754
Thank you.

336
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:39,754
Okay, when I go over to that other side,

337
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:41,954
push the shutter, will you?

338
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,554
Oh, okay.

339
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:48,154
Okay, everybody, get ready!

340
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,054
-Say! -Cheese.

341
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,354
What's the fuss about?

342
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:00,754
Just now, behind everyone...

343
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,254
The man who was sleeping a while ago in the coffin!

344
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:07,354
What? Where is he?

345
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,554
He was here a while ago!

346
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:12,254
In between Johei and Kamiyo.

347
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:15,354
With a pale face like a ghost.

348
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:19,054
Right, right! What I saw was something like that too!

349
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,854
Hey, both of you!

350
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:22,654
That's enough.

351
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,954
I'll bet you heard of the vampire rumor

352
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,754
and came along with the detectives.

353
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,354
But stop making a fuss as if you came to

354
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:33,554
some haunted mansion or something!

355
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,154
Vampire rumor?

356
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,254
What's that about?

357
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,254
Huh? Don't tell me you don't know about it?

358
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:42,654
Six months ago, in the forest near this mansion,

359
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,154
Ms. Shimizu who used to work as a maid here

360
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:47,554
was found dead.

361
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:49,654
All the blood from her body was drained

362
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,454
and she was tied upside down onto a stake

363
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:55,154
poked into the ground.

364
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:58,054
Moreover, two holes were found on the neck of the corpse,

365
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:00,154
so there was a big fuss over it.

366
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:02,554
That a vampire appeared.

367
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:05,954
At any rate, let's split up and go look for Hakuya!

368
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,654
If we leave things as is,

369
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,354
he may really end up being thought of as a monster.

370
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:11,854
Is it true, Heiji?

371
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:13,954
That story about the vampire just now?

372
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:15,454
Yeah.

373
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:18,654
If we told you, you'd say you want to leave right away.

374
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:21,654
Then, we'd end up having to leave with you.

375
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,654
That's why we didn't tell you about it.

376
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,954
They're gone!

377
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:27,954
Over there.

378
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:30,354
Hey, you! Where're you going?

379
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,754
Huh? You want to eat food with garlic in it?

380
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:38,654
But, you already ate dinner a while ago, didn't you?

381
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,654
There was no garlic in the food!

382
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,154
If you let us use this kitchen and give us the ingredients,

383
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,554
we'll make it ourselves.

384
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:50,154
But the owner recently says he hates garlic, you see.

385
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:52,054
So, I wonder if there's any garlic around?

386
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,754
Oh, we can manage on our own.

387
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,954
We'll look for it ourselves.

388
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:59,654
Garlic for vampires?

389
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:01,754
Well, that's the usual.

390
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:05,254
Huh? This refrigerator won't open!

391
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:09,654
Oh, that's the refrigerator that the owner bought the other day

392
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:11,754
and it's locked.

393
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:13,354
A refrigerator with a lock?

394
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:14,354
Why?

395
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,354
Beats me.

396
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,354
I was told that it was to keep good beef

397
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,554
to serve to the guests that would coming today.

398
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:24,454
I didn't get to use it though.

399
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:27,254
Hey.

400
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:29,454
Are you the one, by the way?

401
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:32,054
Who testified during the incident six months ago

402
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,554
that the owner had an alibi?

403
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:35,654
Yeah.

404
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:37,754
If I remember correctly, you said that

405
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,454
the owner was confined to his room and asleep right through.

406
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:43,354
Yeah. There's no mistake about that!

407
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:44,754
Because he told me that day that

408
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:46,754
he wanted to check on the taste of the soup

409
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:48,154
right after he got up, so for me, the chef,

410
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,854
to wake him up and bring the soup to him in person.

411
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:54,154
Then, it's not that you were watching over that coffin right through

412
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,254
while the owner was asleep, eh?

413
00:19:56,254 --> 00:20:00,554
No, but I'm sure that he never came out of that coffin!

414
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:03,554
He told me before he closed the lid of the coffin.

415
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:05,854
That he felt like somebody's been opening the lid of the coffin

416
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:08,454
while he's asleep and watching him,

417
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:11,854
so to put something on top of the lid.

418
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:15,854
That's why I place three grains of sesame seed on the lid.

419
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:16,854
And when I went to wake him,

420
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,754
the seeds were in place just like I placed them.

421
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:22,854
That means that the lid of the coffin wasn't opened, isn't it?

422
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:32,954
Which means that this coffin is what's suspicious, but...

423
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,954
It doesn't look like there's any hole

424
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:36,954
under tile of the coffin either.

425
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:38,054
No.

426
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,554
But, why was the lid closed?

427
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:44,754
Because the lid closes only up to here.

428
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,554
If anyone saw him splattered with blood,

429
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:50,154
they would panic and let go of the lid.

430
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:56,554
No, the lid wouldn't open when we first tried to open it, right?

431
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:58,554
Right.

432
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:00,754
Besides, there's something about this room,

433
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:02,754
a strange something that doesn't feel right.

434
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:06,854
What was that sound?

435
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:09,154
It seems to have sounded from quite a distance away.

436
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,754
Hey, take a look at that.

437
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:15,354
The forest is burning.

438
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:18,354
Collapsed?

439
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,454
Are you saying the tunnel collapsed

440
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:22,254
due to an unknown explosion?

441
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:26,154
Yeah. I confirmed by phone a while ago and was told so.

442
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,554
No joke?

443
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,054
That's the only road that leads up to here, you know.

444
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:32,754
It seems it'll take some time before it's restored.

445
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:33,954
My God.

446
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:36,654
It's not a problem about having to look for Hakuya anymore.

447
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:39,454
Which means that the owner hasn't been found yet?

448
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:42,954
No. We've all split up and tried looking for him though.

449
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:46,354
By the way, have you seen my sweetheart?

450
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:48,854
She hasn't been around for a while.

451
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:51,654
Come to think of it, Kishiharu's not around either.

452
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,254
As for Kishiharu, he said that

453
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:56,454
he was going to develop the pictures that we took a while ago

454
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:58,954
after turning his room into a dark room.

455
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,954
It's really unusual that he still uses an analog camera

456
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,754
in this day and age, isn't it?

457
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,854
Well, sorry that I'm such an analog person.

458
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,754
But thanks to me being that way, I've figured out

459
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,754
the situation that Hakuya's in now.

460
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:12,454
Huh? You mean you found him?

461
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,954
Yeah. He's in the picture.

462
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,654
In the picture?

463
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:20,554
Just as those girls said.

464
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,854
In the room where the picture was taken.

465
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:25,654
He was right near us.

466
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:29,754
He's turned into a monster who can go through walls.

467
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:54,254
Why is Hakuya who wasn't here back then,

468
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:56,454
in the center of this picture?

469
00:23:56,454 --> 00:24:00,754
I'm sure that Mr. Torakura was in view back then.

470
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,954
Are you saying that the blood that was on the coffin

471
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:05,254
was really blood type AB?

472
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,154
Counting those associated with this mansion,

473
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,654
I believe the only one with type AB

474
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:13,754
was the maid Ms. Shimizu, who died half a year ago.

475
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,154
Next Conan,

476
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:22,154
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Two)"

477
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:39,754
Next Conan's Hint:

478
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,054
"Garlic"

479
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:43,454
Hattori, what're you looking for?

480
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:45,354
Garlic, a cross and a silver spoon.

481
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:46,854
Hey, calm down!
