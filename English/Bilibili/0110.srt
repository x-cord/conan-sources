1
00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:04.268
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:06.258
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:07.928
Today is a strict cooking class!

4
00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:09.688
What's on the menu?
Accident or incident?

5
00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:11.358
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:12.888
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:15.308
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.811
"The Cooking Classroom
Murder Case (Part 1)."

9
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.611
Cooking classroom?

10
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:07.471
Yeah.

11
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.441
A teacher named Uemori Michi
runs it out of her home.

12
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.771
I've heard of her!
She teaches French cooking, right?

13
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:20.411
Yeah! Sonoko asked if I'd
like to go with her this Sunday.

14
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.301
Thanks for the food!

15
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:33.511
I've always wanted to study
French cuisine, so I told her I'd go!

16
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.261
What time does it start?

17
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:42.261
It starts at 6:30 and ends at around 9:30.

18
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.341
9:30?

19
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:46.261
Forget it! That's too late!

20
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.221
But it's right nearby, in Haido!

21
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.091
That still doesn't matter!

22
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:54.381
Hey! Let's go with her, then!

23
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:54.981
What?

24
00:02:55.381 --> 00:03:00.571
We might get to eat the teacher's
yummy French food for free!

25
00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.491
Yummy French food...

26
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:08.221
Sunday

27
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.371
Something suddenly came up, so Sonoko couldn't come.
Sunday

28
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:13.171
Something suddenly came up, so Sonoko couldn't come.

29
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:20.551
Listen, Ran. I didn't come along
because I want to eat French food.

30
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:22.131
I'm just worried about you.

31
00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:25.171
Yes, yes. I understand.

32
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.301
Do you really?

33
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.311
Uemori

34
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:34.251
Dad! This is it!

35
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:45.381
Mori Ran-san, yes?

36
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:46.721
Yes!

37
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.411
We were told you were coming!

38
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.621
Here you are!

39
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:52.141
Thank you!

40
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:54.871
Here you are!

41
00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:58.261
Thanks!

42
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.801
I'm Komiyama Yuko, the teacher's assistant.
Komiyama Yuko (24)

43
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:10.051
Over there is a student,
the teacher's old high school classmate,

44
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:10.841
and a boutique owner, Yashiro Kazue-san.

45
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.131
Yashiro Kazue (52)
and a boutique owner, Yashiro Kazue-san.

46
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:14.061
Nice to meet you.
Yashiro Kazue (52)

47
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:16.761
It's nice to meet you!

48
00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:20.011
This is my father and Conan-kun.

49
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:24.071
What an impressive classroom!

50
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:26.031
Are these the cooking counters?!

51
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:29.491
Wow! What a big oven!

52
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.201
Ovens are vital to French cooking!

53
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:37.341
And we get to eat the
food you make at that table?

54
00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:38.121
Yes.

55
00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:42.541
It's Nishitani-kun.

56
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:45.921
Bonsoir! Let's have another good class!

57
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:52.921
I slept well...

58
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.511
Let me introduce you!

59
00:04:56.511 --> 00:05:00.591
This is Mori Ran-san,
who's filling in for Sonoko-san tonight!

60
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.381
And this is her father and Conan-kun.

61
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:04.531
It's nice to meet you!

62
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:05.221
Uemori Kaoru (25)

63
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.301
Oh. Well, good luck.
Uemori Kaoru (25)

64
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.861
Kaoru-san is the teacher's son's wife.
Uemori Kaoru (25)

65
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:11.131
Nishitani Hiroaki (29)

66
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:13.721
I'm Nishitani. Nice to meet you.
Nishitani Hiroaki (29)

67
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.871
Nishitani-san is a French chef.
Nishitani Hiroaki (29)

68
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.791
Oh, Kaoru-san.
What's with that eye patch?

69
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.291
I have a sty...

70
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:28.381
Is Sonoko-san not feeling well?

71
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.881
No, apparently something
urgent came up.

72
00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:34.471
It's only natural that
she'd want to skip class...

73
00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:38.051
Being yelled at every time...

74
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.061
You should be ready for it yourself.

75
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.091
Kazue-san! Quit scaring her!

76
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:48.381
Don't worry. You won't
be the only one she yells at.

77
00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:48.901
Okay...

78
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:53.871
Uemori-sensei sounds really strict...

79
00:05:54.221 --> 00:06:00.791
Ah, so that's why ol' Sonoko ran
off and used Ran as a replacement.

80
00:06:01.421 --> 00:06:03.501
Oh, Yuko-san! I'll help!

81
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:09.591
Incidentally, has Uemori-sensei
gone somewhere?

82
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:11.421
Yes, the beauty salon.

83
00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:14.801
The beauty salon?

84
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:16.931
Beauty salon?!

85
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:22.011
Her French recipe book
became a best-seller,

86
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.591
and there's a party
tomorrow in celebration of that.

87
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:27.401
She's really something.

88
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:31.111
Making lots of money
off of others' ideas...

89
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:32.071
Eh?

90
00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:39.661
One-third of the recipes in
that book are hers... Yuko-san's.

91
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:47.421
Stop it, Kazue-san.
That doesn't matter.

92
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:52.841
Oh? Why not?!
Your own recipes have been stolen!

93
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.551
You came up with those original recipes

94
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:59.091
while working so hard these
past five years as Michi's assistant!

95
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.561
But she did help...

96
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.881
So what if she helped a little?
They're clearly your recipes!

97
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:12.091
Yet, you don't complain at all.
You must be crazy!

98
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.611
Quit it, Kazue-san!

99
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:19.201
This is between our teacher
and Yuko-san! It's none of our business!

100
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:22.341
Oh, really?

101
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.881
I guess you're right.

102
00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:27.591
Michi has been giving you
financial assistance all this time.

103
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.841
So you can't say anything bad about her.

104
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:33.011
That has nothing to do with this.

105
00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:37.471
Oh? I'd love to hear
how they're not related.

106
00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:39.011
It's--!

107
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:50.261
Oh, man.
Things are getting weird in here...

108
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.281
She's back!

109
00:08:02.011 --> 00:08:03.541
Welcome back, Teacher!

110
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:04.091
Uemori Michi (52)

111
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:07.371
I'm back. I'm a little late, it seems.
Uemori Michi (52)

112
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:09.501
You must be Mori Ran-san.

113
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:11.961
Yes! It's nice to meet you!

114
00:08:12.841 --> 00:08:15.221
I'm Ran's father, Mori--

115
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:16.931
Oh, my shoulders are stiff.

116
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:19.321
Nishitani-kun. If you would.

117
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:19.921
Right.

118
00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:23.481
U-Umm, I'm M-Mori...

119
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:28.341
Here's the blouse you asked me to mend.

120
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.731
Yeah. Put it there.

121
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:33.671
Kaoru-san. Check my pulse.

122
00:08:33.671 --> 00:08:34.071
Right.

123
00:08:35.761 --> 00:08:39.261
Sheesh. Can't even say, "Thank you."

124
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:42.881
Is she unwell?

125
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:44.291
She's just fat.

126
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.631
She always has her pulse checked
like that after going somewhere.

127
00:08:48.631 --> 00:08:51.341
Kaoru-san used to be a nurse.

128
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:53.711
It's a little fast, but it's fine.

129
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:57.131
Her son is an elite businessman,

130
00:08:57.131 --> 00:09:01.551
but he grew up as an only child
and has a terrible mother complex.

131
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:05.681
Kaoru-san has it tough,
being Michi's daughter-in-law.

132
00:09:06.341 --> 00:09:10.271
I heard the teacher's
husband died of an illness.

133
00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.191
Yes.

134
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.741
He was such a nice, gentle man...

135
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:23.841
That'll do. I'm going to change now.

136
00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:24.281
Okay.

137
00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:29.711
I need to use the bathroom.

138
00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:32.211
I'll just go get an apron.

139
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:38.471
Hold on!

140
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:40.931
There's no smoking in here!

141
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.321
I'm sorry, but you'll
have to smoke outside.

142
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:46.141
Sorry.

143
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:49.381
Umm, where is the bathroom?

144
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:54.301
Through that door and to the left.
There's one for men and women.

145
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:55.721
Thank you.

146
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:58.111
Guess I'll go, too.

147
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:08.301
Yuko-san. I know
what I said earlier, but...

148
00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:12.131
Ran-san!

149
00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:15.171
Sorry! My mistake! You look alike!

150
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:50.881
Okay, let's begin.

151
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.121
Today, we'll be making mushroom
terrine and duck in orange sauce.

152
00:10:54.551 --> 00:10:58.001
Dessert will be pear clafouti.

153
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:02.471
Whoa, now. You're cooking with a ring on?

154
00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:05.681
Even if you are good,
that's not very professional...

155
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:11.601
Nishitani-san is wearing a ring, too?!

156
00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:16.561
Like teacher, like student...

157
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:23.471
That sounds great!
Duck, huh?! I just love duck!

158
00:11:23.471 --> 00:11:24.071
Yuko-san.

159
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.371
R-Right! I'm sorry!

160
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.371
Huh? You're closing it?

161
00:11:31.421 --> 00:11:32.471
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:34.711
Geez!

163
00:11:35.381 --> 00:11:37.671
Oh, Dad...

164
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:41.131
We'll start with the mushroom terrine.

165
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:46.681
I'll make some myself, so watch
me and follow my example.

166
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:50.891
First, slice 200 grams of champignon.

167
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:54.421
Hey. What's champignon?

168
00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:55.941
It means "mushroom."

169
00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:59.081
Now, we sauté it in butter.

170
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:04.301
Make sure to boil the moisture away.

171
00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:08.261
It's starting to smell good!

172
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.781
But we won't get to eat it for a long while.

173
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.051
You're quite good at that!

174
00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:19.751
Thank you!

175
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:27.681
You're so inept.
You haven't changed one bit.

176
00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:33.891
What's this? Now you can't
separate the white and the yolk.

177
00:12:33.891 --> 00:12:36.221
We're only using the white.

178
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.591
I'm sorry. I can only see with
my right eye, so it's hard to tell...

179
00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:41.591
No excuses!

180
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:45.341
Yuko-san. I don't see the
Gruyere cheese!

181
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:47.701
Right! I'm sorry! I'll get it now!

182
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:52.121
All three of you are hopeless!

183
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:55.301
She's an intense teacher...

184
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:59.081
Yeah. It's no wonder
Sonoko is avoiding her.

185
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:09.091
Nishitani-san is skilled,
so she has nothing to say to him.

186
00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:11.301
I can't stand it anymore!

187
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.341
I'm going for a smoke!

188
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:18.561
Wait a minute. The only way
outside is through the kitchen.

189
00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:22.421
I saw a back door past the bathrooms.

190
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:33.371
Huh? It's unlocked...

191
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:36.591
What a careless household...

192
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.961
What happened? A blackout?

193
00:13:44.881 --> 00:13:45.551
Who's there?

194
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:54.551
Yuko-san! Go to the electrical
room and check the breaker!

195
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:55.561
Right!

196
00:14:18.235 --> 00:14:21.985
Say! Did you hear a sliding door open?!

197
00:14:21.985 --> 00:14:23.365
A sliding door?

198
00:14:23.365 --> 00:14:24.485
Excuse me!

199
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:27.735
I'm sorry, but could
you give me some light?

200
00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:28.985
Right.

201
00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:32.325
Electrical Room

202
00:14:36.695 --> 00:14:39.445
That's strange.
Why is the switch off?

203
00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.845
I'll turn it on.

204
00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:46.005
Ice...

205
00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:49.545
What's this doing here?

206
00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:02.275
What's this?

207
00:15:02.275 --> 00:15:05.815
Mister! Someone set up
a trick here to cut the power!

208
00:15:05.815 --> 00:15:06.775
What?

209
00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:10.615
That weight's tied to a ring.

210
00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:15.325
They put the ring around the switch,
and the weight on the ice!

211
00:15:18.275 --> 00:15:22.315
In other words, if the ice melted...

212
00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:28.715
...the ring would be pulled
down and turn the switch off.

213
00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:33.315
But who set this up?

214
00:15:34.525 --> 00:15:37.985
Let's go back to the classroom!
Something might've happened!

215
00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:38.515
Alright!

216
00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:44.275
Dad!

217
00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:44.935
What happened?!

218
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:49.645
It's the teacher! She says her
chest hurts and it's hard to breathe!

219
00:15:54.735 --> 00:15:57.195
Hey! Who opened
the front sliding door?!

220
00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:00.275
Nobody did.

221
00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:01.365
Nobody?!

222
00:16:06.775 --> 00:16:09.245
M-My back hurts...

223
00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:14.755
I felt a sharp pain in my
back while the lights were out...

224
00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:17.365
I can barely breathe...

225
00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:19.345
Did you strain a muscle?

226
00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:23.555
She can barely breathe?! Could it be?!

227
00:16:23.555 --> 00:16:24.265
Let me see!

228
00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:32.155
H-Hey! What are you doing?!

229
00:16:32.155 --> 00:16:33.395
C-Conan-kun?!

230
00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:37.065
Just as I thought!

231
00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:38.945
She was stung by a bee!

232
00:16:39.445 --> 00:16:40.405
A bee?

233
00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:41.405
See? Here!

234
00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:43.675
There's a red speck here!

235
00:16:45.365 --> 00:16:48.235
It's right behind her right lung!

236
00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:49.985
Her right lung?

237
00:16:50.905 --> 00:16:52.165
T-This is--!

238
00:16:52.655 --> 00:16:57.615
Ran! Call an ambulance right away!
And Inspector Megure, too!

239
00:16:57.615 --> 00:16:59.055
R-Right!

240
00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:02.405
She needs to get
to a hospital right away!

241
00:17:02.405 --> 00:17:04.655
But who did this?!

242
00:17:06.115 --> 00:17:09.615
No one is to step
outside this classroom!

243
00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:11.935
And don't touch the front door, either!

244
00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:15.945
What gives you the
right to give us orders?!

245
00:17:17.445 --> 00:17:21.865
Pardon my late introduction.
I am Mori Kogoro, the detective.

246
00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:25.365
The famous detective...

247
00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:28.165
...Mori Kogoro?

248
00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:34.945
Could you explain
what's happened here?

249
00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:39.945
I believe someone stabbed
Uemori Michi-san in the back

250
00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:44.975
with something with a sharp tip,
like an ice pick or an awl.

251
00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:46.815
Come again?!

252
00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.005
She was stabbed...

253
00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:49.395
...in the back?

254
00:17:49.615 --> 00:17:56.615
Yes. There was a red
speck on her back, like a bug bite.

255
00:17:56.615 --> 00:18:01.365
An ice pick or something
similar would leave such a mark.

256
00:18:01.945 --> 00:18:07.275
And, even though ice pick
stab marks don't look like much,

257
00:18:07.275 --> 00:18:10.835
they can often pierce lungs
and other internal organs.

258
00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:15.775
So the reason her chest hurt and
she couldn't breathe was because...

259
00:18:15.775 --> 00:18:18.545
She may have a hole in her lung.

260
00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:21.735
So, who did this?

261
00:18:21.735 --> 00:18:27.615
Ran and the others heard the
sliding door shortly after the blackout,

262
00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:30.615
so it's highly likely the
perpetrator entered from outside.

263
00:18:30.615 --> 00:18:31.225
Outside?

264
00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.655
But that doesn't
rule out an inside attacker.

265
00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:38.365
I see.

266
00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:41.365
I must ask that none
of you leave the room.

267
00:18:41.365 --> 00:18:44.315
We'll check for
fingerprints on the door first.

268
00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:47.655
Who was the last person
to touch the door handle?

269
00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:49.815
Nishitani-san was!

270
00:18:49.815 --> 00:18:53.655
He was the last person here to arrive,

271
00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:59.655
and when Uemori-sensei came,
he opened the door from the inside!

272
00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:02.655
Then we'll need to take your fingerprints

273
00:19:02.655 --> 00:19:06.115
to differentiate them from the attacker's.

274
00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:08.485
Tell me about this other thing of yours.

275
00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:09.655
Right.

276
00:19:11.815 --> 00:19:15.615
So this back door was unlocked?

277
00:19:15.615 --> 00:19:17.275
Yes, Inspector.

278
00:19:17.275 --> 00:19:24.065
I believe the attacker snuck into
the electrical room via the back door

279
00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.365
and set up the ice trick.

280
00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:30.785
The attacker then
went around to the front,

281
00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:36.245
hid in the shrubbery in the yard,
and waited for the power to go out.

282
00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:42.155
The instant it went out, they opened
the door, leapt into the classroom,

283
00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:44.775
and stabbed Uemori-san and fled!

284
00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:47.595
But the classroom was pitch-dark.

285
00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:51.775
How did the attacker find her?

286
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.615
Well, uhh...

287
00:19:53.615 --> 00:19:58.365
She had something shiny on,
or something that made her stand out.

288
00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.275
No.

289
00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:03.445
She wasn't wearing anything like that.

290
00:20:03.445 --> 00:20:05.905
I don't think she was, either.

291
00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:10.115
Then the attacker must've
used infrared goggles or something.

292
00:20:10.115 --> 00:20:12.695
That would let them see in the dark.

293
00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:13.245
Yes.

294
00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:19.705
Are you serious? Infrared goggles
aren't that easy to get ahold of.

295
00:20:22.485 --> 00:20:27.365
Incidentally, the old guy says
it was likely an outside attacker,

296
00:20:27.365 --> 00:20:31.315
but it's strange that there
are no shoeprints left on the floor.

297
00:20:34.115 --> 00:20:37.735
Did the person actually take
off their shoes before coming in?

298
00:20:37.735 --> 00:20:39.155
That's crazy!

299
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.685
Well?

300
00:20:41.025 --> 00:20:48.825
Right. Only Nishitani-san's
fingerprints were on both door handles.

301
00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:52.655
The attacker was
probably wearing gloves,

302
00:20:52.655 --> 00:20:57.945
and Nishitani-san touched the
door last, so that's to be expected.

303
00:20:57.945 --> 00:20:58.835
Yes.

304
00:20:58.835 --> 00:21:03.655
But, oddly enough, the outside
handle fingerprints are fully there.

305
00:21:03.655 --> 00:21:06.945
Only the inside fingerprints
are somewhat gone.

306
00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:07.755
What?!

307
00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:11.425
That's not right!

308
00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:15.945
If the attacker opened
the door from the outside,

309
00:21:15.945 --> 00:21:19.355
Nishitani-san's fingerprints on
the outside handle should be gone!

310
00:21:20.115 --> 00:21:23.185
The fact the inside
fingerprints have rubbed off...

311
00:21:23.735 --> 00:21:27.155
...means the attacker opened
the door from the inside!

312
00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:30.025
Huh? What are you getting at?

313
00:21:30.025 --> 00:21:32.995
The attacker didn't enter from outside!

314
00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:38.955
Someone in the classroom opened
it from the inside to deceive us!

315
00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:43.545
They most likely used a
handkerchief or something to do it!

316
00:21:43.905 --> 00:21:48.655
In other words,
one of you four is responsible!

317
00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:52.315
Y-You can't be serious!

318
00:21:56.865 --> 00:21:58.195
It's me.

319
00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:00.945
What?!

320
00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.315
All right.

321
00:22:04.025 --> 00:22:06.775
Uemori-san has just passed
away due to respiratory failure

322
00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:08.695
resulting from a punctured lung.

323
00:22:16.525 --> 00:22:20.285
That means this is now a murder case.

324
00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:06.405
You killed her, Kazue-san!

325
00:24:08.705 --> 00:24:14.785
Nishitani-kun. I hear she was
going to cut off your financial support.

326
00:24:16.365 --> 00:24:22.085
Yuko-san. You held a grudge
because she stole your recipes.

327
00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:24.575
Now I got it!

328
00:24:24.575 --> 00:24:26.425
You killed her, Kaoru-san!

329
00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:29.825
On the next Conan--

330
00:24:29.825 --> 00:24:33.135

Murder Case (Part 2)."
