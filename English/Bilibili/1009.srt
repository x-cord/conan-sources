1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,230
This way. It's over here.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,940
I found this bracelet beneath these shrubs.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,810
I see.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,250
I'm impressed that you spotted
something down here, though.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,330
I took a peek because I heard a kitty meow.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,710
That's when I found this on the ground.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,700
I see.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,450
But this looks pretty expensive.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,690
It's got a jewel or something on it.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,040
Yes, it's a garnet.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,790
Like I said...

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,970
Conan.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,880
Hey, Conan.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,600
What are you doing?

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,230
Nothing.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,520
Why don't we return this
bracelet to whoever lost it?

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,330
Good idea. That sounds like
a job for the Detective Boys.

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,070
But how are we going to find them?

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,360
If we can find the store
that sells that bracelet,

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,520
we should be able to find whoever lost it.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,140

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,840
The Detective Boys are in big trouble!

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,020
Their search for the owner of a
missing item takes a surprising turn!

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,730
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,620
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,160
his name is Detective Conan!

Kaneko Jewelry

32
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,730
I feel like I've seen this before.

33
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,980
Really?

34
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,720
Yeah.

35
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,590
It might be one of our products.

36
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,470
Might be?

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,100
Or it might not be.

38
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,610
Well, we used to sell a similar design.

39
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,460
The initials S.Y. are on the back.

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,910
Sorry. Since we didn't sell it, I don't know.

41
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,780
We haven't been able to find them.

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,120
Is turning it into the
police our only option?

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,020
I'm hungry.

44
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,150
Hey, kids!

45
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,070
It's the guy from the accessory shop.

46
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,680
When I asked the other staff about it,

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,710
one of them said they remembered the
person who bought that bracelet.

48
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,540
Really?

49
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,840
Yeah. Their name is Yamaki Shinobu.

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,090
Since you've already got their bracelet,
could you return it to them?

51
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,310
Yeah!
You can count on us!

52
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,010
You can count on us!

53
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,020
This is the place.

54
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,020
All right. Let's ask if
that bracelet is theirs.

55
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,580
Coming.

56
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes?

57
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,900
Um, can I help you?

58
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,320
Miss, are you Yamaki Shinobu-san?

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,740
Shinobu is my older brother.

60
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,120
What? Your brother?

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,650
What? Your brother?
Yamaki Risa (25)

62
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,580
Yamaki Risa (25)
Yes, and? Do you have
business with my brother?

63
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,840
Yes, and? Do you have
business with my brother?

64
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:25,690
We found a bracelet that we believe
belongs to your brother at the park.

65
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,790
This is it.

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,470
See? It's got the initials S.Y. on it.

67
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,730
That's definitely my brother's.

68
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,160
All right.

69
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,100
We finally found him.

70
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,730
Thank you for coming all
this way to return it.

71
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,230
My name is Yamaki Risa.

72
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,610
Hey, where's your brother?

73
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,240
What? Oh, he's out of the house right now.

74
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,260
I'll return this bracelet to my brother.

75
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,550
Please do.

76
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,890
We're counting on you.

77
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,120
Here you go.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
Thank you.

79
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,240
Give me a second.

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,590
It could be important.

81
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,830
There.

82
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,140
Miss.

83
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,200
You smell wonderful.

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,850
Must be your perfume.

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,360
Thank you. It's my favorite perfume.

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,510
I see.

87
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,330
I'm glad we were able to return
the bracelet to its owner.

88
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,360
Yes. His sister was delighted, too.

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
That settles that.

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,470
Yeah!

91
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,310
Sorry.

92
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,620
I forgot that Ran-neechan asked
me to run an errand for her.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh, no.

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,420
Shall we go with you?

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,540
Nah, I'll be fine.

96
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,340
Careful on your way home, guys.

97
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,040
Sorry for visiting out of the blue, Oi-san.

98
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,290
Oi Yutaka (28)

99
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,420
Oi Yutaka (28)
Oh, it's fine. You're Yamaki-san's...

100
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,540
Oh, it's fine. You're Yamaki-san's...

101
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,170
I'm his sister Risa.

102
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,340
I actually lost touch with
my brother this week.

103
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,190
What?

104
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,180
I visited his home, but he
hasn't been back in a while.

105
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,680
I see. That's concerning.

106
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,270
Anyway, these are the last messages
I exchanged with my brother.

107
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,680
Anyway, these are the last messages
I exchanged with my brother.
When do you want to meet up?

108
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,060
When do you want to meet up?

109
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,570
Yeah, we went out to eat that day.

110
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,200
What was my brother like that day?

111
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,950
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

112
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,410
Anything helps.

113
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,060
Come to think of it,

114
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,960
he didn't have anything to drink
because he was meeting a friend later.

115
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,710
Do you know who that friend was?

116
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,320
No, I didn't ask.

117
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,470
I see.

118
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,570
But if Yamaki-san was meeting a friend,

119
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,300
then it was probably Yagi or Kogure-san.

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,850
Do you know them?

121
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,110
No.

122
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,690
Then maybe you should meet with them.

123
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,180
I'll give you their addresses. Wait here.

124
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,850
Thank you.

125
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,870
I'm pretty sure both of them live nearby.

126
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,330
Well, well.

127
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,710
This is the errand Ran-san asked you to run?

128
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,470
Guys...

129
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,530
Uh, I...

130
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,350
Why are you following Risa-oneesan?

131
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,270
I was worried if she'd actually
return the bracelet to her brother.

132
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,180
Risa-san's probably looking for him.

133
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,020
What?

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,610
What does that mean?

135
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,680
Did she and her brother get into an argument?

136
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,660
Is it a case?

137
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,230
That must be it.

138
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,540
Yeah. After all, Conan-kun
thinks it's suspicious.

139
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,790
Crap, Risa-san's gone!

140
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,430
Damn it. I lost her.

141
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,010
She's missing?

142
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,720
Where'd she go?

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,550
Do you have any ideas?

144
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,810
Risa-san went to meet either her brother's
friend Kogure-san or Yagi-san.

145
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,710
Let's split up and look for her.

146
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,560
Got it.

147
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,710
Yagi

148
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,320
Yagi
I'm sorry to disappoint you
after you came all the way here,

149
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,610
but I didn't see Yamaki-san that day.

150
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,200
I see.

151
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,620
But I don't think you need
to be so worried about him.

152
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,810
But I don't think you need
to be so worried about him.
Yagi Keita (25)

153
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,080
Yagi Keita (25)
Actually, this was found at a park.

154
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,140
Actually, this was found at a park.

155
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,460
My brother always wore this.

156
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,480
Since this was found,

157
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,570
I'm worried my brother may have
gotten caught up in something.

158
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,800
Have you contacted the police?

159
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,470
No, not yet.

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,030
I'm going to talk to Kogure-san next.

161
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,100
I was thinking after that.

162
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,130
I see. Very well. I'll go with you.

163
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,030
You must feel forlorn on your own.

164
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,110
Really? Thank you.

165
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,610
I'll get ready to go right
away. Give me a few minutes.

166
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,370
Okay.

167
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,240
Thank you so much.

168
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,620
I'm also worried about Yamaki-san.

169
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,270
We can't find her anywhere.

170
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,850
You can do it, Genta-kun.

171
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,100
According to Conan-kun, Yagi-san's
house should be around here.

172
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,100
Excuse me.

173
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,010
What is it, children?

174
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,370
We're looking for the residence of Yagi-san.

175
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,730
Do you know where they live, ma'am?

176
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,040
Kanno Shizu (65)

177
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,360
Kanno Shizu (65)
Yagi-san? Oh, Yagi-san.

178
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,590
Yagi-san? Oh, Yagi-san.

179
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,610
You know them?

180
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,070
Yes. He lives in this apartment building.

181
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,340
Yagi

182
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,840
This is it.

183
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,100
Yes?

184
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,930
Hello!

185
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,360
Sorry for dropping in suddenly.

186
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,980
Are you Yamaki Shinobu-san's friend Yagi-san?

187
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,280
What? Yes.

188
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,980
Hey, wait.

189
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,820
Who are you kids?

190
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,330
We're the Detective Boys.

191
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,930
We're looking for a lady
named Yamaki Risa-san.

192
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,620
Did she come here?

193
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,600
What?

194
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,120
Risa-san is Yamaki Shinobu-san's
younger sister.

195
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,920
She seems to be looking for her brother.

196
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,040
I was at home all day today,
but nobody visited me.

197
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,800
I see.

198
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,300
Then she must be at Kogure's
place where Conan went.

199
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,940
Now that you know, get out of here.

200
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay.

201
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Ayumi-chan, let's go.

202
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Okay...

203
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,540
Sorry I couldn't help.

204
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,320
It's fine. Sorry for interrupting
your busy schedule.

205
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,220
Later.

206
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,900
Jeez.

207
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,480
I can't believe those kids are involved, too.

208
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,960
Aw, man. This place was a dead end.

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
Yeah.

210
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,010
Risa-san must be where Conan-kun—

211
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,260
Hey, guys. Can you hear me?

212
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,220
Conan-kun, how did things go over there?

213
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,630
Risa-san isn't here.

214
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,480
According to the neighbors, Kogure-san
hasn't been home since this morning.

215
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,970
Risa-san probably headed to Yagi-san's place.

216
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,490
About that...

217
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,260
She didn't come here either.

218
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,450
I see.

219
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,120
Hey, Conan-kun.

220
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,390
I think Yagi-san is lying.

221
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,120
What?

222
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,670
I smelled Risa-oneesan at his apartment.

223
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,640
Is that true, Ayumi-chan?

224
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,760
Yeah, I'm sure I did.

225
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,220
It was the smell of her perfume.

226
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,390
Does that mean she was at his place?

227
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,520
Um, Conan-kun?

228
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,890
What is it, Mitsuhiko?

229
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,230
There was something about Yagi-san's
apartment that I found odd, too.

230
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,900
The shoes were tidily put away in
the shoe cabinet at the entrance,

231
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,410
except for a pair of boots that seemed
to have been sloppily stuffed in there.

232
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,300
What do you suppose that means?

233
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,160
Where are you guys right now?

234
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,080
What?

235
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,020
In front of Yagi-san's apartment building.

236
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,040
Got it.

237
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,450
Stay where you are, got it?

238
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,660
I'll be right there.

239
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,800
But what about Risa-oneesan?

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,800
It's the boots Mitsuhiko
said were sloppily put away.

241
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,130
What? What about them?

242
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,640
Since you guys suddenly showed up,

243
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,940
he probably hastily hid Risa-san's
shoes inside those boots.

244
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,140
Which means...

245
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,050
Yeah.

246
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,860
Risa-san is still inside
Yagi-san's apartment!

247
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,540
What?

248
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,720
But why would Yagi-san do that?

249
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,560
Probably because Risa-san brought
Yamaki-san's bracelet to him.

250
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,180
I found it odd when we
visited Yamaki-san's house.

251
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,370
Risa-san didn't live there.

252
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,480
Her brother lived there alone.

253
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,310
What? Really?

254
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,900
There was only a men's umbrella
in the stand in the entryway.

255
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,370
There was also a wilting houseplant
with yellowing leaves.

256
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,000
In other words, her brother
hasn't been home in a while.

257
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,670
Then why was Risa-oneesan there?

258
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,050
She probably went there because she
couldn't get in touch with her brother

259
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,980
and was worried about him.

260
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,000
But because we returned the bracelet to her,

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,890
she believed her brother may have
gotten swept up in something.

262
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,140
The string on the bracelet
was broken, remember?

263
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,130
It must've been torn off during
an argument with the culprit.

264
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,660
There were tire tracks in the road in front of
the park and what looked like bloodstains, too.

265
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,450
It was Yagi-san who got into an
argument with Risa-san's brother!

266
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,100
No way.

267
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,460
Whatever you do, guys, stay where you are!

268
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,960
Don't do anything until I arrive!

269
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,580
This wouldn't have happened to
you if this hadn't turned up.

270
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,760
It's your brother's fault.

271
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,450
I had Yamaki-san fork over some money
because I had an opportunity to get rich.

272
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,610
But there were some problems,
and I lost it all.

273
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,480
Yamaki-san was furious when he stormed in.

274
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,190
But that's how investments work, you know?

275
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,800
Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose.

276
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,650
That's how investments work.

277
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,870
But your brother insisted
that I return his money.

278
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,480
I explained repeatedly that
I couldn't right away,

279
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,630
but he was impatient and said
he'd report me to the police.

280
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,770
On top of that, he threatened
to tell my fiancée.

281
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,110
So I...

282
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,190
Don't worry.

283
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,980
I'll take you to see your brother tonight.

284
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,570
Good idea.

285
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,170
Indeed.

286
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,950
We can't wait for Conan-kun.

287
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,960
Yeah.

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,200
We should rescue Risa-oneesan ourselves.

289
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,860
Besides, if I hadn't found that
bracelet, this wouldn't have happened.

290
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,740
That's not true.

291
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,850
It's Yagi-san who's the
bad guy in this situation.

292
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,740
That's right, Ayumi.

293
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,760
Besides, if you hadn't found that bracelet,
we wouldn't have identified the culprit.

294
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,060
You're right.

295
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,260
Ready?

296
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,640
I'll ring the doorbell, and
while Yagi-san is distracted...

297
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,270
I'll jump out from behind
the door and tackle him.

298
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,770
Yes.

299
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,900
Then I'll go inside and rescue Risa-oneesan.

300
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,070
The perfect plan, if I say so myself.

301
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,730
We'll settle this case before Conan arrives.

302
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,700
I can already see Conan-kun's
disappointed expression.

303
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,330
Yeah.

304
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,830
What is it, Ayumi?

305
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,710
Is there a problem with my plan?

306
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,210
Behind you. Mitsuhiko-kun, behind you.

307
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,230
What? Behind me?

308
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,800
I thought I told you kids to leave!

309
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,470
Damn it!

310
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,230
Let go of Mitsuhiko!

311
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,920
Shut up!

312
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,490
This is what you kids get
for playing detective!

313
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,530
Mitsuhiko-kun, close your eyes!

314
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,700
Run, Ayumi!

315
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,950
Damn it. I'll teach those
kids to screw with me.

316
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,420
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

317
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,040
It skipped our floor.

318
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,300
What are we going to do, Mitsuhiko?

319
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,120
You're asking me?

320
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,930
There's another elevator over there.

321
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,600
Hurry!

322
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,170
Hurry, hurry!

323
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,610
Hurry up!

324
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,860
The elevator is still on the first floor.

325
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,320
Hurry, hurry.

326
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,450
If you don't hurry, you'll get caught.

327
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,620
Hurry!

328
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,180
Too bad.

329
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,430
That won't work.

330
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,110
The doors won't close while
I'm holding them open.

331
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,080
Now then, what should I
do with you impudent kids?

332
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,920
Get down, guys!

333
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,700
I made it in time.

334
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,210
Later, an investigation
revealed that the tire marks

335
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,950
in front of the park matched
the tires of Yagi Keita's car.

336
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,810
The blood left there was also
found to be Yamaki Shinobu-san's.

337
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,170
Thank you so much.

338
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,680
You saved my life.

339
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,760
Oh, right.

340
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,690
Here.

341
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,690
What is it?

342
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,530
Brother...

343
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,040
If not for this, my brother's
case wouldn't have been solved.

344
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,720
No, he probably wanted it to be
solved by you, the Detective Boys.

345
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,920
Um, that gemstone is a garnet, isn't it?

346
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,310
Yes, that's right. It's my birth stone.

347
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,470
My brother always...

348
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,110
Jeez.

349
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,770
I kept telling you guys not to go anywhere.

350
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,240
Sorry.

351
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,920
But, but, but...

352
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,250
The Detective Boys did good this time.

353
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,740
You guys...

354
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,250
Hey, wait.

355
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,130
I just found this over there.

356
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,300
