1
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.140
Hey. Gramps!

2
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.040
I think there's a residence called Inbushi near here,

3
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.340
but do you know where it is?

4
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.340
Inubushi?

5
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.940
What do you want with them?

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.740
We're going over to help them get rid of a puppy's curse.

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.940
I'll be frank with you.

8
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.040
Forget it.

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.140
If you stick nose into it out of curiosity,

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.540
you'll be badly burned.

11
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.840
And? Where's the house?

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.540
You see that house with the castle-like roof

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.540
part way up that mountain?

14
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.340
That's the Inubushi Residence.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.240
It's a house cursed by a dog.

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.840
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.340
Tears are the start of all dramas.

18
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.140
What lies behind the mystery of the burning dog

19
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.940
that attacks the cursed Inubushi family?

20
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:45.686
This is a case that Heiji Hattori had brought along.

24
00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.286
The adopted children of Mr. Tsunechika Inubushi,

25
00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:51.186
the chairman of the Inubushi Group, who died five years ago,

26
00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:54.086
begin dying of bizarre causes one after the other.

27
00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:55.986
Moreover, it is said that these are the doings

28
00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:59.086
of a monster who resembles a dog enveloped in flames.

29
00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:00.186
Since one of the adopted children

30
00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:02.486
was Kazuha's mother's acquaintance,

31
00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:05.586
we went along with Heiji to ask for the details.

32
00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:06.886
Surprisingly, the person we went to visit,

33
00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.586
although the Japanese characters were different,

34
00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:11.686
was named Shinichi Kudo, and had the same name as me.

35
00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:15.686
However, even before we got a chance to talk to him,

36
00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:18.486
somebody had killed and framed him

37
00:03:18.486 --> 00:03:21.086
as having committed suicide using a charcoal stove.

38
00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:23.186
What on earth is the identity of the culprit

39
00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:25.186
who dares to act as a possessed spirit?

40
00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:28.386
And what is the meaning of the pearl

41
00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:31.486
that Shinichi s corpse had in his mouth.

42
00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:36.286
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

43
00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:39.086
"(Will-O'-the-Wisp Chapter)"

44
00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.486
Hey, Heiji. Is it true?

45
00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:44.686
That story about the pearl that dropped out of the mouth

46
00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:46.886
of the corpse of one of the

47
00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:49.286
adopted children of the Inbushi family, called Shinichi.

48
00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:51.186
It's true.

49
00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.586
He probably bit off the pearl

50
00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:56.086
that was attached to his necktie pin just before he died

51
00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:58.786
with hope of leaving behind proof of the culprit.

52
00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:00.186
Right?

53
00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:03.586
If the saliva of that man is also on the necktie pin,

54
00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:06.686
it could be a dying message.

55
00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:10.186
It could be. You mean it's not definite?

56
00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:12.886
No. Although saliva was found on it,

57
00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:15.186
there is no trace of him having bitten it.

58
00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:17.086
So, maybe the pearl

59
00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:20.986
wasn't attached well enough to begin with or...

60
00:04:20.986 --> 00:04:23.586
The culprit had a message he wanted to relay

61
00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:27.086
and deliberately put the pearl into his mouth.

62
00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:29.286
Right, big brother Heiji?

63
00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:30.686
Right!

64
00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:33.486
You two sure get along like always!

65
00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:36.986
Really, it's just like you're Heiji's assistant!

66
00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:38.786
Cut out that assistant stuff.

67
00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:41.286
Either way, it's the doing of someone

68
00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:44.386
who has a whole of grudge against the Inubushi family.

69
00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:47.886
After all, Shinichi after giving up his portion of the inheritance

70
00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:52.286
returned to Tokyo, and yet was killed.

71
00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:56.186
Right. Satomi, the wife of elderly tycoon,

72
00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:57.586
Tsunechika Inubushi, inherits his estate,

73
00:04:57.586 --> 00:05:00.486
then falls ill.

74
00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:02.786
If someone is trying to get rid of the number of adopted children

75
00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:06.286
in order to increase the amount of the inheritance to be inherited,

76
00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:07.886
Shinichi would've been counted out

77
00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:09.386
because he gave up his portion.

78
00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:12.286
If I remember correctly, he had eight adopted children, right?

79
00:05:12.286 --> 00:05:15.386
Yes, although they all had different mothers.

80
00:05:15.386 --> 00:05:17.386
So, it could be that a person

81
00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:19.686
who is not his real child among the eight children,

82
00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.486
and is trying to clear a grudge or something?

83
00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:24.586
Even if it were to be his real child,

84
00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:26.086
maybe that person could also be holding a grudge

85
00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:29.086
because he left them be without looking after them.

86
00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:32.986
And, who of the eight passed away?

87
00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:36.386
Shinichi who was killed under the pretense

88
00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:39.186
of having committed suicide by using a charcoal stove.

89
00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:41.486
Before that, a lady by the name of Miwako

90
00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:43.486
who drowned in the swamp.

91
00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:45.186
The grass around the swamp where there was nothing

92
00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:47.186
that could've caught fire seems to have burned.

93
00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:49.786
And the first one who died was a man called Keiji,

94
00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:51.486
"Keiji Inubushi" -who fell from on top a cliff!

95
00:05:51.486 --> 00:05:54.786
It's said that he was chased by a demon dog engulfed in flames!

96
00:05:57.986 --> 00:06:01.086
If you're scared, you should've stayed back home.

97
00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:03.686
But if you hear the start of a scary story,

98
00:06:03.686 --> 00:06:05.586
you want to find out what happens in the end.

99
00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:09.086
I thought the same too, but I'm scared after all.

100
00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:12.186
Hey, it's too late to say you want to go back from here, you know.

101
00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:13.786
No! Go back!

102
00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:16.586
There's a cliff up ahead so you'd better stop quickly!

103
00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.586
What?

104
00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:30.986
Look out.

105
00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:33.586
Didn't you see the sign a little way back?

106
00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:35.286
Be careful, will you?

107
00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.986
Just the other day, somebody fell over and died too!

108
00:06:37.986 --> 00:06:39.286
Oh, well...

109
00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:40.886
we're on our way to investigate that case

110
00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:43.186
and are headed for the Inubushi Residence.

111
00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:44.386
"Miyuki Inubushi(28), Adopted Child of Inubushi"

112
00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:48.186
I'm a family member of the Inubushi's.

113
00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.586
It really looks like a Japanese castle.

114
00:06:54.586 --> 00:06:58.486
It seems that the people around here call it the Inubushi Castle.

115
00:06:58.486 --> 00:07:02.586
It doesn't look like a residence that is cursed by a demon dog!

116
00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.686
I guess not.

117
00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:08.786
What?

118
00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:14.986
-How cute. -It's an Akita dog!

119
00:07:14.986 --> 00:07:16.686
No, Hachi!

120
00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.086
These people and the others officers who have come here

121
00:07:19.086 --> 00:07:22.586
to investigate the accident big brother Keiji got into.

122
00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.086
No, I'm not an officer.

123
00:07:26.086 --> 00:07:29.186
You're the one that's no good, Miyuki!

124
00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.886
When dogs bark for nothing, calling their name

125
00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.486
"Takako Inubushi (47)" -or touching them

126
00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.286
will make them mistakenly think that they're being praised.

127
00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:38.486
How many times do I have to tell you before you understand this?

128
00:07:38.486 --> 00:07:41.986
I'm sorry, Takako.

129
00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:44.986
Never mind that, what did you want, officer?

130
00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.886
Just the other day, another police officer

131
00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.986
came and left after saying that

132
00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:50.586
it was concluded to be an accident.

133
00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:52.486
Oh, well, I'm not an officer.

134
00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:55.786
However, something that doesn't look like an accident occurred,

135
00:07:55.786 --> 00:07:59.386
so we've come all this way to ask you about it!

136
00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:01.986
-Right, officer? -You.

137
00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:07.686
Could you be talking of Shinichi who died in Tokyo?

138
00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:11.086
Before he left here, Shinichi said,

139
00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:12.686
a bunch of nonsense about somebody

140
00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:15.486
using a cursed demon dog that is engulfed in flames

141
00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:16.986
to annihilate the bloodline of Inubushi from its roots.

142
00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.086
Is that what you're referring to?

143
00:08:19.086 --> 00:08:22.886
But there's no such thing as a curse, so no need for worry.

144
00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:27.286
Besides, if mother hears of this, it will make her sad.

145
00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:30.486
Is Satomi here?

146
00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:32.886
I was under the impression that she'd be in the hospital.

147
00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:34.386
She's here.

148
00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:37.986
Although she's bed-ridden and can hardly talk.

149
00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.886
Cerebral infarction.

150
00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:46.086
She's been this way, ever since she collapsed last month.

151
00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:48.886
It's better for her to be hospitalized.

152
00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:50.186
But, since she's already quite aged,

153
00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:52.586
we decided to take care of her here.

154
00:08:52.586 --> 00:08:55.986
Oh, I'm Tomoaki Inubushi.

155
00:08:55.986 --> 00:08:59.586
I work as a doctor at the Inubushi Hospital near here.

156
00:08:59.586 --> 00:09:03.086
Then, are you one of the eight adopted children too?

157
00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:05.586
Yes. When I was at a loss what to do

158
00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.286
after the hospital that I previously worked for went bankrupt,

159
00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:11.586
Mother Satomi here came to my rescue.

160
00:09:11.586 --> 00:09:12.586
And?

161
00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.586
Didn't Satomi mention anything about

162
00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.886
who seemed to be an imposter?

163
00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:20.086
I wonder... not especially.

164
00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:25.086
Wasn't that man called Shinichi the imposter?

165
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.986
Terrified over a demon dog rumor that could never be,

166
00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:31.686
he's a betrayer who left the Inubushi house, you see!

167
00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:34.486
How could you talk rough like that Yoshiya,

168
00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:36.186
in front of mother!

169
00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:40.186
She's not listening. She's asleep, isn't she?

170
00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:41.986
One person is missing.

171
00:09:42.986 --> 00:09:46.686
The eight adopted children! Three died, right?

172
00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.686
So there should be five people left.

173
00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:53.686
But over here there are only Miyuki, Takako, Tomoaki

174
00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:56.686
and the one who just came Yoshiya, a total of four people!

175
00:09:56.686 --> 00:09:59.486
True. There should be one more person.

176
00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:02.186
Don't tell me that the person has a scar on the face

177
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.986
and wears a strange looking mask?

178
00:10:04.986 --> 00:10:07.486
This isn't the Inugami family, you know.

179
00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:09.486
The other one left is Saki!

180
00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.386
She's picking up some clothes

181
00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:14.086
at a cleaners a little far from here for me.

182
00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:17.386
Well, why not drink some tea while you wait for her?

183
00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:19.286
I guess it's difficult to listen to our story

184
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.686
unless all of us are gathered here, so...

185
00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:24.086
While you're at it, why don't you tell them

186
00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:25.086
about the demon dog story

187
00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:27.286
that is handed down for generations in the Inubushi family?

188
00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:28.786
Handed down for generations?

189
00:10:32.686 --> 00:10:34.186
Burned it?

190
00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:36.286
The ancestors of this house burned a dog?

191
00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:39.986
Yes. It seems to date back to the Meiji Era, though.

192
00:10:39.986 --> 00:10:42.886
All of the townspeople were helping to look for the only daughter

193
00:10:42.886 --> 00:10:45.086
of the Inubushi family, who suddenly disappeared,

194
00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:48.386
when the dog that the Inubushi family were keeping appeared

195
00:10:48.386 --> 00:10:50.286
holding the daughter who was all scratched up

196
00:10:50.286 --> 00:10:52.186
and on the verge of death in its mouth.

197
00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:56.186
The angry owner whipped the dog repeatedly

198
00:10:56.186 --> 00:11:00.186
and on top of it all, he set the dog on fire.

199
00:11:00.186 --> 00:11:03.586
But, later, when the daughter came back to life,

200
00:11:03.586 --> 00:11:05.686
after hearing that the dog had actually come to her rescue

201
00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:08.886
when she was lost and fell in the mountains,

202
00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:11.286
the owner who regretted what he did,

203
00:11:11.286 --> 00:11:13.986
built a fine grave for the dog.

204
00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:16.686
However, several days later, a fire occurred

205
00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:19.786
and only the owner couldn't escape in time and died.

206
00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:22.086
Since then, word went around that the Inubushi family

207
00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.086
was cursed by a demon dog engulfed in flames.

208
00:11:24.086 --> 00:11:27.086
It's like a story of long ago.

209
00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:29.886
Then, does that grave actually exist?

210
00:11:29.886 --> 00:11:30.986
Yes.

211
00:11:30.986 --> 00:11:34.686
Under the cliff that your car almost fell from this afternoon.

212
00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:37.386
Would you like me to take you there right now?

213
00:11:40.086 --> 00:11:41.486
True.

214
00:11:41.486 --> 00:11:43.786
The gallant beloved dog of the Inubushi family.

215
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:46.986
"Fusataro" lies here, it says.

216
00:11:46.986 --> 00:11:50.186
So if a dog engulfed in fire appears,

217
00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:51.786
it's understandable that anybody would think

218
00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:53.286
it's the curse of Fusataro.

219
00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:56.486
We'd better offer our prayers so that it won't curse us!

220
00:11:56.486 --> 00:11:57.786
Same here.

221
00:11:57.786 --> 00:12:00.086
There could never be such a thing as a curse.

222
00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:04.186
Is the cliff that Keiji fell over this cliff?

223
00:12:04.186 --> 00:12:06.186
Yes.

224
00:12:06.186 --> 00:12:09.086
Right above this grave.

225
00:12:18.886 --> 00:12:21.286
Saki?

226
00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:24.886
Get a hold of yourself, Saki!

227
00:12:24.886 --> 00:12:28.486
Saki, you mean the last of the adopted children?

228
00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:31.586
Dog... burned.

229
00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:33.586
Burned dog?

230
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.286
Kazuha! Call the ambulance and the police!

231
00:12:36.286 --> 00:12:37.986
We'll go together with Pops Kogoro by car

232
00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:38.986
to the top of the cliff!

233
00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:41.386
What? You mean you want only us girls to wait here

234
00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.786
in a place like this?

235
00:12:42.786 --> 00:12:44.386
If you want to go to the top of the cliff,

236
00:12:44.386 --> 00:12:47.086
it's faster to take the animal path up, than by car.

237
00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.986
Okay, take us there then!

238
00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:52.086
Ran, wait here with Pops Kogoro and the others then!

239
00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:54.086
Okay.

240
00:12:57.286 --> 00:12:59.486
Okay! Off to the top of the cliff!

241
00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:07.786
It's burning.

242
00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:10.086
There's no smell of oil.

243
00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:17.286
It looks almost like a dog on fire walked through here.

244
00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:18.686
Yeah.

245
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:27.991
Footprints that were on fire?

246
00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:31.591
You're saying that you found something like that up on the cliff?

247
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:33.291
Yeah, that's right.

248
00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:35.591
20m in the foreground from the edge of the cliff,

249
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:37.991
there were traces of fire here and there.

250
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:41.591
Just as if a demon dog engulfed in flames ran through the area.

251
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:42.991
What?

252
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:46.291
But, you didn't get to see the demon dog in question, did you?

253
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:48.591
I'll bet somebody just poured oil over the area

254
00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:51.391
and set fire to make it look like a demon dog really exists!

255
00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:54.691
No. There wasn't any smell of oil.

256
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:56.491
The space between the fire was greater

257
00:13:56.491 --> 00:13:58.391
the closer you got to the edge of the cliff too,

258
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:00.391
and the fire got bigger too,

259
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:02.891
so it looked like something that was burning pass through there

260
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.591
as it got bigger.

261
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:06.691
Isn't that right, Miyuki?

262
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:07.691
Yes.

263
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.491
So the cursed demon dog...

264
00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:13.591
Does exist after all.

265
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:15.291
Saki who fell from the cliff said,

266
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.491
"Dog engulfed in flames" too.

267
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:18.791
Idiot!

268
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.691
There could be no such thing as a demon dog in this world!

269
00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:23.191
It's a trick!

270
00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:27.491
Somebody's just trying to make it look as if a demon dog exists!

271
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:30.691
In order to put the blame on the demon dog for their crime.

272
00:14:30.691 --> 00:14:33.491
Exactly!

273
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:34.991
I mean this is a time when the world is talking about

274
00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:36.591
TV broadcasts going digital,

275
00:14:36.591 --> 00:14:39.491
how can you possibly make us fuss over a demon dog?

276
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:41.291
It's really making me "dizzy dear".

277
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:43.491
Inspector Yamamura!

278
00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:49.091
Oh, did you catch on to the play on words I just mentioned?

279
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:50.691
Who's this chum?

280
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:52.591
He's an officer from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station,

281
00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:53.691
although he may not look it.

282
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:56.491
So, this is Gunma Prefecture.

283
00:14:56.491 --> 00:14:58.291
And...

284
00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:00.691
how is Saki who fell off the cliff doing?

285
00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:05.191
Well, I heard that she was taken by ambulance to a hospital.

286
00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:07.291
That's our hospital.

287
00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:10.191
I got a call on my cell phone

288
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:12.791
and was told she died in the ambulance.

289
00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:15.191
Oh, no.

290
00:15:15.191 --> 00:15:18.791
I don't know who's manipulating the demon dog

291
00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:19.991
but it's definite that somebody's

292
00:15:19.991 --> 00:15:22.391
picking a fight with the Inubushi family.

293
00:15:22.391 --> 00:15:25.691
That's true. Out of all the eight adopted children,

294
00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:28.591
half of us, four have already died.

295
00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:31.991
Then, for the time being, out of the four that now remain,

296
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:35.591
will the three of you who are here give us your alibis?

297
00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:38.191
Tell us where and what you were doing around 19:00

298
00:15:38.191 --> 00:15:40.591
when Saki fell over the cliff.

299
00:15:40.591 --> 00:15:43.491
Miyuki has a concrete alibi because she was with us

300
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:45.391
when we went to look at the grave of the dog

301
00:15:45.391 --> 00:15:47.991
located below the cliff!

302
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:51.591
At about 19:00, I was taking a bath.

303
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:54.391
Since Saki didn't come back for a while,

304
00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:56.391
I went outside to check on her.

305
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:59.691
She still loses her way a lot even now so...

306
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:03.091
I was beside mother checking her body temperature,

307
00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:06.791
blood pressure and feeding her liquid food.

308
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.291
Well, but since she's bed-ridden.

309
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:13.191
I can't have her testify for me, though.

310
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:14.591
As for you two,

311
00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:17.491
you don't seem to have anyone who can testify for you either.

312
00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:18.691
No.

313
00:16:18.691 --> 00:16:21.991
Normally there are three people helping me,

314
00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:24.791
but they've taken leave to visit their families.

315
00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:27.891
Mr. Mouri! It's the job of the police to ask that question!

316
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:30.491
Please don't take my job away from me!

317
00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:34.191
Oh, isn't he a police officer?

318
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:37.591
Oh, no. I lost the chance to introduce myself.

319
00:16:37.591 --> 00:16:40.591
His name is Kogoro Mouri.

320
00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:42.891
-Mou... -Mouri?

321
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:44.191
Kogoro?

322
00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:47.291
Are you the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri?

323
00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:49.591
Yes, well...

324
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.791
Huh? The atmosphere's changed.

325
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:55.491
You just surprised us a bit.

326
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:59.391
Before he left the house, the late Shinichi said...

327
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.591
You'd better give yourselves up

328
00:17:01.591 --> 00:17:03.491
because he asked an acquaintance police officer to investigate

329
00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:04.991
and to solve the mystery

330
00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:07.491
of what is happening in the Inubushi family.

331
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:09.691
But I had no idea that it was going to be

332
00:17:09.691 --> 00:17:12.991
the renown Sleeping Kogoro.

333
00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:16.291
Well, I'm the one who actually asked to investigate the incident.

334
00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:18.191
By the way, the day Shinichi

335
00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:20.791
was killed in his residence in Tokyo,

336
00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:24.791
I suppose there's no one here that went to Tokyo, is there?

337
00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:27.691
All four of us were in Tokyo.

338
00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:33.291
We went to persuade him to come back to the Inubushi family.

339
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:36.791
It seemed that he suspected one of us,

340
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.891
so we wanted to ask him why he thought so too.

341
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:42.591
Well, but he was so afraid that he didn't tell us anything.

342
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:47.091
It was as if he was saying that the culprit is among us.

343
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:49.391
We heard about Shinichi's death

344
00:17:49.391 --> 00:17:51.991
as soon as we got back from Saki who we asked

345
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:53.591
to keep watch over the answer phone.

346
00:17:53.591 --> 00:17:54.991
Which means that all four of you

347
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.191
were together all the while you were in Tokyo?

348
00:17:57.191 --> 00:18:01.991
No. We all went together, but we all came back separately.

349
00:18:01.991 --> 00:18:05.091
By the way, isn't it about time you tell us

350
00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:08.391
about what you found out about Shinichi's case?

351
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:11.291
You also mentioned that the accident of Keiji and Miwako

352
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.091
that occurred previously had some connection

353
00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:15.091
with the chain of events that is happening too.

354
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:17.691
We don't know yet if this has any connection to the incident,

355
00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:20.791
but Shinichi had the pearl that

356
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:24.491
was on his necktie pin in his mouth!

357
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:27.891
What seems to be the matter?

358
00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:34.191
Oh, nothing. There was one near Keiji who fell over the cliff like Saki.

359
00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:35.991
A pachinko ball.

360
00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:37.591
A pachinko ball?

361
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:40.591
That old man used to love playing pachinko

362
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:43.491
so I though t it just fell out of his pocket or something.

363
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:45.291
Besides, after that,

364
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:49.491
even on the surface of the swamp that Miwako drowned in,

365
00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.391
there was a ping pong ball.

366
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:54.091
Balls, balls and more balls.

367
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:57.791
So, the pearl is not a dying message.

368
00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:01.491
It seems to be a message that the culprit deliberately left behind!

369
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:05.991
-Then, maybe... -That's the same too?

370
00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:10.591
We found it after Saki was taken to the hospital in the ambulance.

371
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:14.191
It was rolling on the ground near the dog's grave, a marble!

372
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:15.591
A marble?

373
00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:17.191
Do you have that with you now?

374
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:21.091
We thought it was an offering, so we left it on the grave.

375
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:23.891
Okay, we'll go take a look at that marble,

376
00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:26.091
so will you come with us too, officer?

377
00:19:26.091 --> 00:19:27.891
I've got some things I'd like to ask you too.

378
00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:29.391
Yeah.

379
00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:31.891
Kazuha and the rest of you, stay still and wait here!

380
00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:33.391
Ran, you too!

381
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:35.491
What? We'll go with you too!

382
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:37.491
We're the ones who found it, after all!

383
00:19:37.491 --> 00:19:38.991
You can come if you want!

384
00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:40.891
If you want to see the demon dog!

385
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:43.291
I... I guess not.

386
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:44.991
We'll wait here.

387
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:51.891
I... I'm sorry to have barged in on you like this,

388
00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:54.391
and yet to be served dinner.

389
00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:56.591
No problem, don't worry about it.

390
00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:59.891
I wonder if Heiji and the others will be back before dawn?

391
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:01.391
I wonder.

392
00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:04.291
More than that, we're really going to have it tough from now on

393
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:09.091
since Saki was the one who made preparations

394
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:11.991
and put things away most of the time.

395
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:17.291
Can I help you with something?

396
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:21.191
Then, could you go feed Hachi for me?

397
00:20:21.191 --> 00:20:22.991
Okay.

398
00:20:22.991 --> 00:20:27.091
I asked Takako and the others to do it, but they refused.

399
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:28.991
Why?

400
00:20:28.991 --> 00:20:32.191
It seems that Takako is used to the dog and yet?

401
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:36.691
Yes. It seems that she had a dog before she came here,

402
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:38.491
so she knows a lot but...

403
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:39.891
it seems she's got her hands full with

404
00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:42.491
making arrangements for the funeral and all.

405
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.591
Tomoaki had been bitten by a dog in the past

406
00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:47.091
and really hates dogs!

407
00:20:47.091 --> 00:20:51.091
Since he's always jittery, Hachi really barks at him too.

408
00:20:51.091 --> 00:20:53.291
And Yoshiya's allergic to dogs.

409
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.591
When near dogs, he can't stop sneezing

410
00:20:55.591 --> 00:20:58.191
and comes down with runny nose, he says.

411
00:20:58.191 --> 00:21:03.191
That's why it used to be Takako, Saki or I who fed the dog.

412
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:06.191
-Could I ask you to do it for me? -Okay! Sure!

413
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:09.291
Where's the doghouse?

414
00:21:09.291 --> 00:21:11.491
It's a bit far away.

415
00:21:11.491 --> 00:21:14.791
Far? Don't tell me that it's outside the house?

416
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:17.491
Don't worry! It's towards the edge of house,

417
00:21:17.491 --> 00:21:21.491
but it's fenced in so even the demon dog can't go inside!

418
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:24.091
Oh, I see.

419
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:33.291
Boy, it sure is a large yard.

420
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:34.891
Yes.

421
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:39.291
Isn't that it, the doghouse?

422
00:21:39.291 --> 00:21:42.091
Right! Hachi's there too!

423
00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:47.191
Hachi! We brought you dinner!

424
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:51.091
Eat it all now!

425
00:21:51.091 --> 00:21:53.491
-He's so cute! -Yes!

426
00:21:53.491 --> 00:21:56.491
It'd be nice if the demon dog is this way too.

427
00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:05.191
What's the matter?

428
00:22:08.191 --> 00:22:09.491
What's that?

429
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:11.991
Isn't there something glowing over there?

430
00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:13.291
Yes.

431
00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:48.691
This place is full of books on magic!

432
00:23:48.691 --> 00:23:51.791
There's a magic circle drawn on the floor too.

433
00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:55.891
I'm sure that someone cast a curse on the dog here.

434
00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:03.891
The culprit will probably not get caught.

435
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:07.191
After all we're going after a Black Magic Magician,

436
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:09.391
who can curse a dog, you know?

437
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:10.791
Next Conan,

438
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:13.091
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

439
00:24:13.091 --> 00:24:15.079
"(Footprints Chapter)"

440
00:24:15.818 --> 00:24:18.218
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:18.218 --> 00:24:20.018
"Onions"

442
00:24:20.018 --> 00:24:21.718
What will come out if you peel an onion?

443
00:24:21.718 --> 00:24:23.118
Nothing's going to come out.

444
00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:24.918
Tears are.
