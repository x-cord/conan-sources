1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.170
Hongo...

3
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.070
I don't think I'm going to make it.

4
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.570
Don't be silly!

5
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.270
It'll be morning soon.

6
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.570
Then the rescue squad will be here too.

7
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.570
Never mind comforting me.

8
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.970
My left leg that the guys bit won't move.

9
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.870
Hongo, you go on alone.

10
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.370
How could I ever do that?

11
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.070
Look to the window.

12
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.470
You can't even see outside because of the zombies.

13
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.470
Carrying an injured person like me,

14
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.470
you don't have a chance to get through that.

15
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.470
But if you're alone,

16
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.570
you can survive using the Zombie Blade.

17
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.370
So, Hongo...

18
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.870
You gotta live!

19
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.970
You gotta live on and and avenge my death, please.

20
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.570
Hey...

21
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.370
-Isn't Hayato acting strange? -Hang in there, Hayato! I'll take you home

22
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.970
-Quiet and watch. -even if I have to drag you along!

23
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.470
Come, stand up! Hayato!

24
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.470
I told you.

25
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.070
Hayato?

26
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.270
No.

27
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.970
Hurry and get out of there!

28
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.270
No...

29
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.170
Hayato?

30
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.170
A canvas stained black with crime.

31
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

32
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.670
Horror movies that Ran doesn't like.

33
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.170
The filming site is even more frightening!

34
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.870
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.270
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:33.927
"The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 1)"

38
00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:42.527
Hey...

39
00:03:42.527 --> 00:03:45.227
Despite it being summer vacation, you looked bored,

40
00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:47.427
so I decided to bring you along for a drive,

41
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:48.727
and you're yawning on me.

42
00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:52.427
It's because you went and borrowed that scary rental DVD, right, Dad?

43
00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:55.127
I couldn't get to sleep till morning because of it!

44
00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:57.027
I couldn't do anything about it, could I?

45
00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:00.027
It's a low budget rank C horror movie

46
00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:04.127
They won't air it on TV even though Yoko's acting in it.

47
00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:06.727
By the way, how's your stomach?

48
00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:11.227
You kept repeating that you were hungry earlier.

49
00:04:11.227 --> 00:04:14.227
I'm fine now.

50
00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:16.027
Don't eat between meals!

51
00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:19.827
The doctor told you that you've got too much visceral fat!

52
00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:21.127
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.727
And, where are we headed?

54
00:04:25.127 --> 00:04:28.327
You'll find out when we get there!

55
00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:32.927
Wait, isn't this...

56
00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:36.927
the rental villa that we saw in the zombie movie last night?

57
00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:39.827
Yeah! We're so-called pilgrims visiting a holy place.

58
00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:41.227
Don't you know?

59
00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:45.327
Fans go visiting locations used in movies and TV shows!

60
00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:49.327
I do, but they're usually great memorable scenes...

61
00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:54.227
This is the front door where Yoko coughed up blood!

62
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:58.427
That's the window Yoko kicked the zombie out of!

63
00:04:58.427 --> 00:05:01.027
One treasure after another!

64
00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:03.027
Hey, Conan.

65
00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:04.827
Doesn't this forest seem like

66
00:05:04.827 --> 00:05:07.827
there could actually be zombies out there?

67
00:05:07.827 --> 00:05:09.327
Don't worry!

68
00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:10.927
Zombies won't appear.

69
00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:13.127
It seems zombies do appear.

70
00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:15.027
I tell you, they won't.

71
00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:17.027
They appeared?

72
00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:19.027
Hattori and Kazuha!

73
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.527
What brings you here?

74
00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:24.527
There obviously here on a pilgrimage like me!

75
00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:26.027
No, we're not, idiot!

76
00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:30.327
Well, it's true that we're here on related business though.

77
00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:31.727
What do you mean?

78
00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:36.427
Well... There was this idiot couple that came here on pilgrimage.

79
00:05:36.427 --> 00:05:39.027
They both went around checking out the rental villas.

80
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:41.527
When they started their car in order to head home,

81
00:05:41.527 --> 00:05:44.227
something suddenly dashed out in front of their car

82
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.027
and they ran over it.

83
00:05:46.027 --> 00:05:49.827
They thought it was an animal, so they got off the car to confirm,

84
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:53.127
but when they opened the door, they smelled rotten flesh,

85
00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:57.627
so they looked under the car and it came crawling out.

86
00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:01.727
A zombie with a broke neck wearing tattered clothes.

87
00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:05.427
What happened to the couple after that?

88
00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:07.527
-They got out of there as fast as they could -Let's go home.

89
00:06:07.527 --> 00:06:10.727
and told their acquaintance Mr. Otaki about it.

90
00:06:10.727 --> 00:06:14.127
-And he told me about it. -Let's go home.

91
00:06:14.127 --> 00:06:15.327
Let's go home.

92
00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:17.627
Well, I'm sure it's just a prank

93
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.427
-some idiot's pulling off, though. -Let's go home.

94
00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:21.527
Let's go home and get out of this place!

95
00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:22.827
What with you?

96
00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:24.527
We just got here.

97
00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:28.627
Besides, "Zombie Blade: Dinner Party of the Dead"

98
00:06:28.627 --> 00:06:30.827
the movie we watched last night, has a cult following.

99
00:06:30.827 --> 00:06:33.427
It's rumored that a sequel will be made,

100
00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:37.327
so this villa may be used again.

101
00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:40.327
Well, I'm not sure if they'll be making it.

102
00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:41.927
There'll be a sequel.

103
00:06:41.927 --> 00:06:43.127
What?

104
00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:47.227
After all, we're here to shoot the trailer.

105
00:06:47.227 --> 00:06:48.827
Excuse me...

106
00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:50.127
Who are you?

107
00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:53.927
"Tetsuto Naito (38)" -I'm Testuto Naito, director of "Zombie Blade".

108
00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:56.627
If you're here to shoot the trailer,

109
00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:59.927
does that mean you've got tons of crew packed in the back of your car?

110
00:06:59.927 --> 00:07:01.227
Yeah.

111
00:07:01.227 --> 00:07:03.127
The lead actress too?

112
00:07:03.127 --> 00:07:04.327
Of course!

113
00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:08.727
She's our lead actress, Ria!

114
00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:13.427
It's not Yoko?

115
00:07:13.427 --> 00:07:15.227
It's a sequel, isn't it.

116
00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:18.727
Yes. I've known Yoko since she debuted,

117
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:21.827
so she appeared in the first one for the sake of our friendship but...

118
00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:24.027
"Ria Kawabata (29)" -What's with this old man?

119
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.527
Don't you like the idea that I'm starring in the movie?

120
00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:28.627
I don't like it at all.

121
00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:32.127
Hey, isn't that Ria Kawabata?

122
00:07:32.127 --> 00:07:34.727
The one that appears a lot in suspense dramas?

123
00:07:34.727 --> 00:07:38.527
Well, Yoko actually said she wanted to appear,

124
00:07:38.527 --> 00:07:42.527
"Takashi Harawaki (30)" -but her agency wouldn't let her.

125
00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:50.227
So I convinced her, my friend, to star in this rank C movie.

126
00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:52.127
I wish you'd stop saying rank C.

127
00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:54.227
I hope you're going to film it properly?

128
00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:55.827
Don't worry.

129
00:07:55.827 --> 00:07:59.427
Since we're old friends, I'll make sure you look good.

130
00:07:59.427 --> 00:08:01.327
"Kyoko Ejiri (30)" -Especially the scene where you're bitten by a zombie

131
00:08:01.327 --> 00:08:03.827
and become one yourself.

132
00:08:03.827 --> 00:08:05.827
There's no such scene, Kyoko!

133
00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:08.327
Oh, really?

134
00:08:08.327 --> 00:08:10.927
This movie is about the cousin of Yoko Hongo,

135
00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:13.927
the role that Yoko Okino is playing, Reina Kazama,

136
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.727
"Orie Baisho (29)" -who inherited the Zombie Blade

137
00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:20.127
and exterminating zombies.

138
00:08:20.127 --> 00:08:22.327
That's what was written in the script, right?

139
00:08:22.327 --> 00:08:25.827
So, there's no way that Ria would become a zombie!

140
00:08:25.827 --> 00:08:27.627
But I...

141
00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:31.127
"Masahaschi Ninomiya (29)" -I like that kind of bad twists too.

142
00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:33.227
No...

143
00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:35.627
This is not some school festival movie, you know,

144
00:08:35.627 --> 00:08:37.527
so we can't keep changing the story!

145
00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:40.527
But he would have.

146
00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:43.927
That's right.

147
00:08:43.927 --> 00:08:49.227
I'm sure he would have favored a crazy story

148
00:08:49.227 --> 00:08:54.127
like the starring actress turning into a zombie

149
00:08:54.127 --> 00:08:58.527
who massacres friend or foe in a bloody battle!

150
00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:00.227
But, well, forget it

151
00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:01.627
because he's not around anymore

152
00:09:01.627 --> 00:09:04.027
and the script is already completed.

153
00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:07.527
I even decided on the subtitle this morning,

154
00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:09.927
have it in an envelope and like always.

155
00:09:09.927 --> 00:09:12.927
I'll announce it later, so wait a little while more.

156
00:09:15.027 --> 00:09:18.027
Who's this "he"?

157
00:09:18.027 --> 00:09:21.127
He's the president of our university horror research club.

158
00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:27.127
Aside from the director, we're all former members of the club.

159
00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:32.127
Then, shall we go inside and start filming?

160
00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:34.327
-Yes. -May...

161
00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:37.527
May I go inside with you too?

162
00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:39.227
Dad!

163
00:09:39.227 --> 00:09:41.827
I'm sorry but you can't watch us.

164
00:09:41.827 --> 00:09:44.327
We can't have noise.

165
00:09:44.327 --> 00:09:46.827
No, it's not that I want to watch.

166
00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:50.427
I... I need to go to the restroom.

167
00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:57.027
What's wrong?

168
00:09:57.027 --> 00:09:59.127
You look like a zombie.

169
00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:01.627
Maybe he ate something bad?

170
00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:04.727
But we all ate the same breakfast.

171
00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:07.327
And we're fine, right?

172
00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:08.727
Come to think of it, Dad,

173
00:10:08.727 --> 00:10:11.527
on our way here you said you had to go to the restroom

174
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.327
and went into the forest, right?

175
00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.927
I'm sure he got stung by some insect at that time then!

176
00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:18.427
I wasn't stung.

177
00:10:18.427 --> 00:10:21.327
I was a bit hungry

178
00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:24.527
so I took a bite of this delicious looking mushroom

179
00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:25.927
that was growing in the forest.

180
00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:28.127
That's a moon night mushroom!

181
00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:31.127
It may be delicious but it's poison mushroom.

182
00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:33.727
What?

183
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:36.427
We're going to be filming,

184
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.727
so please keep the noise down.

185
00:10:38.727 --> 00:10:40.327
Okay.

186
00:10:43.027 --> 00:10:45.727
But is he really going to be okay?

187
00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:48.327
Yeah if he rests for a while.

188
00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:51.627
People rarely die eating moon night mushrooms.

189
00:10:51.627 --> 00:10:57.327
Well, we could take him to the hospital on my motorbike,

190
00:10:57.327 --> 00:11:01.427
but he probably can't hang onto me till the hospital.

191
00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.327
If you that worried,

192
00:11:03.327 --> 00:11:06.727
maybe we should ask one of the staff to drive him to the hospital?

193
00:11:06.727 --> 00:11:08.327
I guess so.

194
00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:11.027
Hey, Ran, come!

195
00:11:11.027 --> 00:11:14.427
They said so long as we keep quiet, we can watch them.

196
00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:15.927
Don't you want to watch them filming?

197
00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:17.527
What? But...

198
00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:18.527
Let's go...

199
00:11:18.527 --> 00:11:21.827
There's no point in us staying here.

200
00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:23.927
Dad, we'll be gone for a while,

201
00:11:23.927 --> 00:11:25.727
but stay quietly in bed, okay?

202
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:36.527
This is the sword that Yoko was talking about.

203
00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:40.127
The cursed sword that turns zombies that touch it into ashes.

204
00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:44.427
The Zombie Blade!

205
00:11:46.927 --> 00:11:47.927
What?

206
00:11:47.927 --> 00:11:50.127
What is this feeling?

207
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:53.127
Like something is entering my body.

208
00:11:57.527 --> 00:12:00.327
-Cut! -Cut!

209
00:12:01.427 --> 00:12:03.727
There was no noise.

210
00:12:03.727 --> 00:12:06.927
The way the sword glowed was good too!

211
00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.227
Director, the video is perfect too, no?

212
00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:10.227
Yeah.

213
00:12:10.227 --> 00:12:11.827
That was super intense!

214
00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:13.727
Really! It was fantastic!

215
00:12:13.727 --> 00:12:17.027
I can't wait to see how it'll turn out and want to go see the movie!

216
00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:20.827
I really don't have to go watch it.

217
00:12:20.827 --> 00:12:23.427
We'll have to wait till sundown for the rest of the scenes,

218
00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:25.927
so although it's a bit early, shall we have dinner?

219
00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:28.227
Yes, I guess so.

220
00:12:28.227 --> 00:12:31.927
Okay then. Ninomiya, will you go get the food out of the car?

221
00:12:31.927 --> 00:12:33.927
Okay.

222
00:12:33.927 --> 00:12:36.727
Where is Harawaki?

223
00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:38.027
This is strange.

224
00:12:38.027 --> 00:12:41.627
He normally sticks around to complain about the shoot but...

225
00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:43.927
Shall we go look for him?

226
00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:47.627
He's probably somewhere inside this villa, right?

227
00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:49.327
Yeah. Thanks.

228
00:12:50.427 --> 00:12:51.527
But, with you around, Ria,

229
00:12:51.527 --> 00:12:54.127
it really feels like we've gone back to our University days.

230
00:12:54.127 --> 00:12:55.127
Really?

231
00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:58.527
It'd be perfect if the president was here, though.

232
00:12:58.527 --> 00:12:59.927
Yeah.

233
00:12:59.927 --> 00:13:04.527
Well, but the president's older brother is shooting for us instead.

234
00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:08.027
So, I'm sure that the late president is happy too, won't he?

235
00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:10.827
Hey. Where are you?

236
00:13:10.827 --> 00:13:13.327
It seems they're all going to start having dinner.

237
00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:15.727
Mr. Harawaki!

238
00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:19.027
Geez. Maybe he's sleeping in one of the rooms?

239
00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:20.127
Oh, well...

240
00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:22.627
I guess we just gotta look into all the rooms then.

241
00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:23.927
Yeah.

242
00:13:23.927 --> 00:13:25.527
Mr. Harawaki...

243
00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:31.127
Hey, you?

244
00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:33.627
Are you okay?

245
00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:37.127
Darn it! He's not breathing anymore.

246
00:13:37.127 --> 00:13:40.227
What? He's holding something.

247
00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:41.727
It's his cell phone.

248
00:13:44.827 --> 00:13:46.927
Moreover, take a look.

249
00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:54.127
It's on record mode?

250
00:14:05.694 --> 00:14:08.294
What? Harawaki's dead?

251
00:14:08.294 --> 00:14:10.194
He swallowed poison?

252
00:14:10.194 --> 00:14:11.394
Yeah.

253
00:14:11.394 --> 00:14:13.694
The poison is hydrocyanic acid.

254
00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:16.294
His mouth smelled like almonds.

255
00:14:16.294 --> 00:14:18.594
Under the desk, there was a plastic bottle

256
00:14:18.594 --> 00:14:21.894
and a bottle labeled potassium cyanide!

257
00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:25.694
His jaws that were supposed to stiffen first are still soft,

258
00:14:25.694 --> 00:14:30.294
and he had death spots too but haven't merged yet.

259
00:14:30.294 --> 00:14:31.394
In other words,

260
00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:35.094
his estimated time of death is around 30 minutes to an hour.

261
00:14:35.094 --> 00:14:38.794
How do you know those things?

262
00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:40.294
Who are you?

263
00:14:40.294 --> 00:14:42.394
I'm Heiji Hattori.

264
00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:44.794
In the Kansai area, I'm fairly well known as

265
00:14:44.794 --> 00:14:47.494
the High School Detective of the West.

266
00:14:47.494 --> 00:14:49.594
A high school detective?

267
00:14:49.594 --> 00:14:53.294
If you're the west, is there a high school detective of the east?

268
00:14:53.294 --> 00:14:55.194
Of course!

269
00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.594
This boy that you see in front of you...

270
00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:59.294
Hey?

271
00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:03.394
knows him very well. A high school boy called Shinichi Kudo.

272
00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:08.094
You know more about Shinichi, right, Ran?

273
00:15:08.094 --> 00:15:09.394
Yep...

274
00:15:09.394 --> 00:15:13.194
Could it be that someone made him drink the poison?

275
00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:16.094
No. Well it seems he drank it himself.

276
00:15:16.094 --> 00:15:17.494
There was a video of it too.

277
00:15:17.494 --> 00:15:18.594
Video?

278
00:15:18.594 --> 00:15:19.694
Yeah.

279
00:15:19.694 --> 00:15:23.694
Mr. Harawaki was found dead holding on to his cell phone.

280
00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:25.994
And the video of him drinking the poison

281
00:15:25.994 --> 00:15:29.394
and falling to the floor was in his cell phone.

282
00:15:33.294 --> 00:15:36.094
It's really low angled, isn't it?

283
00:15:36.094 --> 00:15:38.794
Yeah. It seems he propped the phone up on the floor

284
00:15:38.794 --> 00:15:40.794
using a box of cigarettes.

285
00:15:40.794 --> 00:15:45.494
The timer was set to automatically start recording after a while.

286
00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:47.194
See. You can see it, right?

287
00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:50.194
He's putting the poison inside the water of the plastic bottle.

288
00:15:50.194 --> 00:15:53.994
Then, he drinks the poison in one gulp,

289
00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:55.894
writhes in pain,

290
00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:58.394
drops the bottle of poison and the plastic bottle on the floor,

291
00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:00.494
staggers backwards,

292
00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:04.994
loses his balance in front of the cell phone that is on the floor.

293
00:16:04.994 --> 00:16:06.894
And then, I don't know why

294
00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:11.594
but he stretches his hand out and grabs the cell phone that is recording.

295
00:16:11.594 --> 00:16:14.294
The cell phone falls to the floor and blacks out.

296
00:16:14.294 --> 00:16:18.694
After this, the video's black for a while, but keeps on recording.

297
00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:23.194
And about 50 minutes later, our voices are heard.

298
00:16:23.194 --> 00:16:25.794
This means that the estimated time of death I mentioned earlier

299
00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:28.394
-was more or less correct! -Hey, you? Are you okay?

300
00:16:28.394 --> 00:16:31.094
Yeah. That's your voice, Heiji.

301
00:16:31.094 --> 00:16:32.194
Right?

302
00:16:32.194 --> 00:16:34.694
Darn it! He's not breathing anymore.

303
00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:36.394
What?

304
00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:38.794
Was that your voice just now, Conan?

305
00:16:38.794 --> 00:16:41.094
It sort of sounded like Shinichi's.

306
00:16:41.094 --> 00:16:42.794
This is bad!

307
00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:44.594
He's copying me!

308
00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:47.194
Since we're always getting involved in cases together,

309
00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:50.894
he picked up my mannerisms without realizing it!

310
00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:56.694
This kid really seems to look up to me, you see!

311
00:16:56.694 --> 00:17:01.194
Yep. I want to be a detective like you, Heiji!

312
00:17:01.194 --> 00:17:04.794
You two are really close like brothers!

313
00:17:04.794 --> 00:17:08.394
I guess so.

314
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:12.294
Hattori, nice follow, thanks.

315
00:17:12.294 --> 00:17:14.394
You're a lifesaver.

316
00:17:14.394 --> 00:17:17.194
Kudo.

317
00:17:17.194 --> 00:17:19.894
This means you owe me one.

318
00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:23.094
He still holding a grudge

319
00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:25.194
against the recording of his confession to Kazuha.

320
00:17:27.794 --> 00:17:31.694
But what did he take such a video for?

321
00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:33.694
I don't know why yet,

322
00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:36.994
but it's almost definitely suicide.

323
00:17:36.994 --> 00:17:40.994
There was a memo in Mr. Harawaki's cell phone,

324
00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:44.194
a creepy sentence that sounded like a will!

325
00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:46.494
Creepy?

326
00:17:46.494 --> 00:17:47.794
Sentence?

327
00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:50.394
"To my old friend, Joji Naito."

328
00:17:50.394 --> 00:17:57.294
"Though this poison will stop the beating of my heart and I will die,"

329
00:17:57.294 --> 00:18:02.294
"my soul will remain in my body and gain an infinite amount of time."

330
00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:07.494
"Just like the scenes of this film, "Funeral Procession of the Dead","

331
00:18:07.494 --> 00:18:12.794
"I shall invite the living in this house to join our world."

332
00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:13.894
"Funeral..."

333
00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:16.194
"Funeral Procession of the Dead"?

334
00:18:16.194 --> 00:18:18.894
That's what was written on the paper

335
00:18:18.894 --> 00:18:22.394
inside the envelope in Mr. Harawaki's pants pocket.

336
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:24.894
I think it's the subtitle for this movie.

337
00:18:24.894 --> 00:18:27.794
Because he was saying that he would announce it later.

338
00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:31.094
Were the subtitles always decided on by Mr. Harawaki?

339
00:18:31.094 --> 00:18:34.494
Yeah. He used to say it was a job for the producer.

340
00:18:34.494 --> 00:18:38.194
He always decided on it alone, put it in a white envelope,

341
00:18:38.194 --> 00:18:42.094
then opened it in front of the staff and announce it.

342
00:18:42.094 --> 00:18:46.294
There was a time when Ninomiya mistakenly opened the envelope,

343
00:18:46.294 --> 00:18:47.994
Harawaki was furious

344
00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:51.794
and went through the trouble of changing the subtitle.

345
00:18:51.794 --> 00:18:54.894
Then, the sentence that was written in the cell phone

346
00:18:54.894 --> 00:18:57.894
was probably written by Mr. Harawaki himself.

347
00:18:57.894 --> 00:19:00.194
This paper is thick so that even if you put it up against the light,

348
00:19:00.194 --> 00:19:01.494
you can't see through it.

349
00:19:01.494 --> 00:19:05.394
There were no traces of the envelope being torn or wet either.

350
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:09.694
What bothers me more is what was written on the top of the sentence.

351
00:19:09.694 --> 00:19:11.694
Joji Naito.

352
00:19:11.694 --> 00:19:13.794
Who is he anyway?

353
00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.194
Just before entering this rental villa,

354
00:19:24.194 --> 00:19:25.794
we mentioned him once, right?

355
00:19:25.794 --> 00:19:28.094
He was the president of the horror club

356
00:19:28.094 --> 00:19:30.794
that we belonged to at the university!

357
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:35.994
And at the same time, he was my younger brother.

358
00:19:35.994 --> 00:19:39.694
The way he died was really strange.

359
00:19:39.694 --> 00:19:44.694
Maybe it influenced Harawaki.

360
00:19:44.694 --> 00:19:48.794
And? How'd he die?

361
00:19:48.794 --> 00:19:51.594
It was eight year ago,

362
00:19:51.594 --> 00:19:57.094
we stayed here to film a horror movie for our school festival.

363
00:19:57.094 --> 00:19:59.994
But Joji, our director and club president suddenly announced.

364
00:19:59.994 --> 00:20:01.894
"Joji Naito" -A mystery!

365
00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:05.494
Why don't we make this movie a mystery movie instead of a horror movie?

366
00:20:05.494 --> 00:20:09.594
If we can only come up with mediocre movies because we're amateurs,

367
00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:13.194
it's better to surprised the audience with a mystery!

368
00:20:13.194 --> 00:20:16.394
There you go again with your crazy ideas.

369
00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:19.494
There's not much time already before the school festival, you know?

370
00:20:19.494 --> 00:20:23.194
We have to return the equipment we borrowed from your brother too.

371
00:20:23.194 --> 00:20:26.894
You're the one who suggested we shoot a zombie movie, right?

372
00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.394
It's not that there'll be no zombies.

373
00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.794
The twist will be that the real murderer isn't a zombie,

374
00:20:31.794 --> 00:20:35.894
but a living human!

375
00:20:35.894 --> 00:20:37.494
If you think it's impossible,

376
00:20:37.494 --> 00:20:40.294
I'll disappear from this room right now,

377
00:20:40.294 --> 00:20:45.894
like a corpse that has returned to life as a zombie!

378
00:20:47.194 --> 00:20:51.094
The president always had crazy ideas.

379
00:20:51.094 --> 00:20:54.894
But they often made sense once he explained them to us.

380
00:20:54.894 --> 00:20:58.694
So, we all went along with his idea.

381
00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.594
Since he insisted, we wanted to see him do it!

382
00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:02.994
I see.

383
00:21:02.994 --> 00:21:04.894
And, how did it work out?

384
00:21:04.894 --> 00:21:06.994
He told us to wait ten minutes.

385
00:21:06.994 --> 00:21:10.794
So Ninomiya went outside to stand guard watching the window.

386
00:21:10.794 --> 00:21:15.294
Harawaki, Kyoko and I stood in front of the door.

387
00:21:15.294 --> 00:21:17.694
After ten minutes we re-entered the room,

388
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.394
we found that the president had really disappeared!

389
00:21:20.394 --> 00:21:22.394
He had completely vanished!

390
00:21:22.394 --> 00:21:23.994
Did you look for him thoroughly?

391
00:21:23.994 --> 00:21:25.494
Of course we did!

392
00:21:25.494 --> 00:21:28.394
Under the bed and even in the wardrobe!

393
00:21:28.394 --> 00:21:30.794
We even moved the wardrobe

394
00:21:30.794 --> 00:21:33.094
to check if there was a hidden corridor behind it

395
00:21:33.094 --> 00:21:35.994
that was connected to the room next door!

396
00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:40.994
And we thought that maybe he went out through the window

397
00:21:40.994 --> 00:21:44.194
while Ria and Ninomiya were going over to the window from outside.

398
00:21:44.194 --> 00:21:46.794
So we searched the forest,

399
00:21:46.794 --> 00:21:48.794
but he was nowhere in sight.

400
00:21:48.794 --> 00:21:52.494
Since we were calling the president's name until our throats got parched,

401
00:21:52.494 --> 00:21:54.794
we wanted to go get a beer.

402
00:21:54.794 --> 00:21:56.294
So, we decide to forget the president for now

403
00:21:56.294 --> 00:21:59.494
and go to town to drink some beer

404
00:21:59.494 --> 00:22:02.594
on Harawaki's car!

405
00:22:02.594 --> 00:22:06.794
Then Ria caught a cold and had to stay in bed for three days.

406
00:22:06.794 --> 00:22:10.394
And when we returned to the villa on the morning of the fourth day,

407
00:22:11.694 --> 00:22:14.194
he was there in that room.

408
00:22:14.194 --> 00:22:17.394
His emaciated body sitting holding his knees in his hands!

409
00:22:17.394 --> 00:22:21.494
His head was turned slightly as if he was saying,

410
00:22:21.494 --> 00:22:23.394
"You finally found me."

411
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.194
"Next Episode" -Why?

412
00:23:56.194 --> 00:23:58.894
It's got to be somewhere.

413
00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:00.994
It disappeared.

414
00:24:00.994 --> 00:24:03.394
Just like the president did eight years ago,

415
00:24:03.394 --> 00:24:06.594
he turned into a zombie and left the room!

416
00:24:06.594 --> 00:24:07.894
No darn way!

417
00:24:07.894 --> 00:24:10.994
A dead person can never come back to life.

418
00:24:10.994 --> 00:24:12.994
The corpse is gone.

419
00:24:12.994 --> 00:24:17.994
There are zombies around the house.

420
00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:24.378
Next Conan, "The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 2)"

421
00:24:25.037 --> 00:24:27.537
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:29.337
"Audition"

423
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:31.337
In the next episode there are going to be lot of zombies.

424
00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:32.637
How exciting.

425
00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:33.837
-Yeah, right! -Yeah, right!
