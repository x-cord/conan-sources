1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,840
A racing second hand,
a shining nebula!

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,340
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,890
Today's stage is on
a mountain again!

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,500
The case is solved
nicely in the fresh air!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,130
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,340
His name?

8
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,109
Six months ago,
the master hitman, the Fox,

9
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:42,449
murdered a man and
vanished without a trace!

10
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:46,159
Surprisingly, Ushio Bunzo,
president of a real estate company,

11
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,659
hired the Fox to kill himself.

12
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,159
Ran and I accompanied
him with the old man,

13
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,819
who was hired to be his bodyguard,
on a mountain traverse.

14
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,889
The five other hikers were
Takanashi Wataru, the company exec,

15
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,879
Hirai Kenichi, a member of
his college hiking club,

16
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:08,989
Nose Shingo, the novelist,

17
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,529
and the hikers Saegusa Kyoko
and Kawabe Akira.

18
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:19,569
There's a good chance that
the Fox is one of these five!

19
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:25,419
Because Ushio-san had requested
his death be during this traverse!

20
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,749
The first murder occurred!

21
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,479
Suspicion piled up about who did it!

22
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,319
And then it happened again!

23
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,489
"The Traverse of Terror
Murder Case (Part 2)."

24
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,519
Ran! I'm coming! Hang on!

25
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,559
Damn it! What the hell's going on?!

26
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,399
C-Conan-kun, Dad... It's terrible!

27
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,659
Ran-neechan...

28
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:06,489
R-Ran... You're... alright!

29
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,829
I thought you had been killed...

30
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,459
She's the one who's been killed!
Saegusa Kyoko-san!

31
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:12,989
What?!

32
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,049
W-What is this?!
Why was she killed?!

33
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,069
Killed with a knife...

34
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,009
Don't tell me this was
the Fox's second murder?!

35
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,969
K-Kyoko! Who?! Who killed you?!

36
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,889
Say! This knife is going
diagonally left and down!

37
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,839
Meaning the killer was
left-handed! Just as I thought...

38
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,649
But why did she have to be killed?!

39
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:45,569
Ran-neechan! Was this
lady all alone in the cabin?

40
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,029
I don't know. I'm not sure.

41
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,499
What do you mean, you're
not sure?! Weren't you in here?!

42
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,709
But everyone had
split up to look outside...

43
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,409
That's right. Everyone
went off in different directions.

44
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,819
There's no way to know
where everyone else was.

45
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,859
No one's got an alibi.

46
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,489
His left hand?

47
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,149
Wasn't Nose-san right-handed, though?

48
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:22,069
What on earth is going on?!
Who's doing this, and why?!

49
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:28,909
Very well. I'll tell you everything.

50
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,989
The truth is, among us is
a hitman known as the "Fox."

51
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,079
He's the one responsible
for these murders.

52
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,029
C-Come again?!

53
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,039
The...

54
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,339
...Fox?!

55
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,109
Dad!

56
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,659
Detective! Is this wise?!

57
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,549
Two people have been killed.
I can't keep it under wraps any more.

58
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,449
Yeah, this is the limit...

59
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,769
...but it's still too early to assume
the same person killed them both!

60
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,029
But, Detective!

61
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,409
Fear not.

62
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:02,159
I, the great Mori Kogoro,
have figured out the Fox's identity.

63
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,109
You what?!

64
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,909
Really, Dad?!

65
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:09,239
That's amazing. The great Mori
Kogoro-san is truly impressive.

66
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:13,489
So, who's the infamous Fox, then?

67
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:16,159
The Fox is left-handed.

68
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,489
Judging from the angle
of the knife in her body,

69
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:21,499
Saegusa-san's killer
was also left-handed.

70
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,919
And there's one person
here who's left-handed.

71
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:29,409
But I do believe the only left-handed
person among us was Hirai-san,

72
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,599
who was killed yesterday, Mori-san.

73
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,599
It would appear you have quite
the observational skills, Nose-san.

74
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:46,359
I am a writer. Observation and
curiosity are vital tools of the trade.

75
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:53,279
Might another vital tool be your
left-handedness, which you're hiding?

76
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,159
What?!

77
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,489
There's no point hiding it.

78
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:02,789
You're most likely a lefty who
learned to be right-handed, right?

79
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:07,759
Meaning you can use both.
You're a switch-hitter.

80
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,789
There's no question that's
the truth about Nose-san.

81
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,549
But...

82
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:20,019
Yes! The peerless Fox,
the one behind these incidents...

83
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,109
...is you, the novelist, Nose Shingo!

84
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,189
R-Really?!

85
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:35,109
What a shock!
To think I'd be Fox, the killer!

86
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:38,909
Mori-san. You'd make a
better novelist than a detective.

87
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,359
Don't play innocent!

88
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:45,159
You write novels about hitmen!
Ones based on real experience!

89
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,349
Really?! This guy is really the Fox?!

90
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,659
Damn you!

91
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,659
What are you doing?! I-I can't breathe!

92
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,809
Ushio-san! Hold on!
Violence isn't the answer!

93
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:58,739
Shut up!

94
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:01,489
I have... I have
business with this guy!

95
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,989
H-Help!

96
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,699
Hey, now! This is bad! Ushio-san
has lost it! He's gonna kill him!

97
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,649
I gotta stop him!

98
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:09,569
Huh?

99
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,529
Scraps of yarn... This color!

100
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,489
Hey, Ran-neechan.

101
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,819
What is it?

102
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,499
Do you really think it
was the Fox who killed her?

103
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:23,959
Quit spouting your nonsense
when I'm busy like this!

104
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:28,319
Dad! You don't need to
be so disparaging like that!

105
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,259
So, what do you mean, Conan-kun?

106
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,549
What I mean is, she may've been
stabbed from behind with a left hand,

107
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,389
but couldn't she have
been stabbed from the front, too?

108
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,029
What're you talking about?

109
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,809
You mean like this?

110
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,909
Here, Conan-kun. You'll be her.

111
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,409
O-Okay...

112
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:52,779
The killer stabbed
her from behind like so.

113
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,319
Well? It could've been done
with the right hand like this.

114
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,909
W-What? Get real!

115
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:02,699
But it wouldn't be very
easy to stab her this way...

116
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,419
Meaning it wasn't unnatural
for the killer to be in that situation.

117
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,129
Look! There are yarn scraps
caught around her fingernails!

118
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,389
This yarn's color...

119
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,089
What?!

120
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,949
That's it! Only one person has
this color sweater and could stab her

121
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:23,519
without her being wary...

122
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,059
Oh, crap!

123
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,019
He's not here!

124
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,979
I-It's Kawabe?! He's the Fox?!

125
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,159
No, that can't be right!

126
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,359
The Fox is left-handed,
yet Kawabe-san is right-handed!

127
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:41,989
So why did he
commit this murder?

128
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,329
Hey! Look! There are tons of
10,000-yen bills in this backpack!

129
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,379
And there's blood on them!

130
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,109
What?!

131
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:57,469
She didn't bleed very much,
so this must be someone else's!

132
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:01,809
But it's not that old...
So whose is it?

133
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:06,489
The mystery seems to go ever deeper...

134
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:08,229
This could make for good writing!

135
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:12,069
Say, where'd Ushio-san go?

136
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,189
Huh? He was here just a minute ago.

137
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,949
He rushed out frantically
only a moment ago!

138
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:20,779
You don't suppose he's
trying to catch Kawabe-san?!

139
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:25,579
This is bad! Ushio-san is the
Fox's target! We can't leave him alone!

140
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:28,369
The old cabin manager is gone too!

141
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:29,829
What?!

142
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,789
You don't think Kawabe-san's
taken him hostage?!

143
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:37,599
It's very possible. He knows
a lot about the paths in this area...

144
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:40,259
You two stay here!

145
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,219
If he's gonna lead the way,
he wouldn't use the path we took, huh?

146
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:47,469
Meaning he's taking the
path headed out of the prefecture!

147
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:47,939
Damn that Fox!

148
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,969
Yamanashi Prefecture
Damn that Fox!

149
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:50,399
Yamanashi Prefecture

150
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,279
Do you wanna die, old man?!
Walk! Come on!

151
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,199
What's that?!

152
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,539
A-An earthquake?!

153
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:13,289
Help! S-Someone!

154
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:15,749
Fox!

155
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,969
Oh no! That boulder's about to fall!

156
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,849
T-This is bad!

157
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,429
H-Help!

158
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,909
Mister! This!

159
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:25,389
Oh! Right!

160
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,349
Alright! Hurry!

161
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:30,309
Climb up!

162
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,189
Hurry! The boulder's gonna fall!

163
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:47,969
That was a close one...

164
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,099
We're saved...

165
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,259
Hey! Where's Ushio-san's group?!

166
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,179
Hey! Where are the other two?!

167
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,179
I-I don't know! The cabin manager
pushed me down and ran off!

168
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,169
That the truth?!

169
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,629
I hope they went back to the cabin...

170
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,139
This mountain path's been torn up.

171
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,439
We'll have to go back
to look for them anyway.

172
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:16,559
Case closed! The great
Mori Kogoro-sama is truly brilliant!

173
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,009
Whadya think now, Fox?!

174
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,279
Y-You got it all wrong!
I'm not a hitman!

175
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:26,599
That's the hitman who's given the
police so much trouble? It can't be!

176
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,199
In which case, who is he?

177
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,559
Still, where could
Ushio-san have gone?

178
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,889
I caught the Fox;
it's safe for him to come out now...

179
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,559
It's strange.
The old man is still gone, too.

180
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,419
Where could they both be?

181
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,179
Hey! Where are they?!
Where'd they go?!

182
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,809
Don't tell me you killed them both?!

183
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,889
I-I don't know! And I'm not the Fox!

184
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,349
Playing dumb won't help you now!
Give it up and tell me everything!

185
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:59,439
Mr. Mori! Look at this!
Inside Kawabe-san's bag!

186
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,879
Look at all this money!

187
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,679
Blood! There's blood on it!

188
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,489
What?!

189
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,449
It looks like the blood on the
10,000-yen bills in Saegusa-san's bag!

190
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,159
Hey! What's the story?!

191
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,639
Mori-san! Listen to this!

192
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,619
What is it?!

193
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,849
Given that the murdered
Tanaka-san was a former mob boss,

194
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:23,469
it's possible this was the result
of a strife between two gangs.

195
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:26,309
However, given that the man
and woman forced Tanaka-san

196
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:30,259
into opening his safe so they could
steal the 100 million yen inside,

197
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,149
it appears to have been
a simple robbery-murder.

198
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,979
I see! So the male and female
suspects are you and Saegusa-san...

199
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:47,889
Given that they killed a mob boss,
people might come after them.

200
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,409
That's why they were so afraid.

201
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,099
Then, the blood on the bills is...

202
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,389
Yeah. The blood of
the person they robbed.

203
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:00,379
And he was also the one who murdered
Saegusa-san, his accomplice.

204
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:04,469
Yeah! That's right! I killed Kyoko!

205
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:08,339
Because we thought you
were after us! It's all your fault!

206
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,049
Say what?!

207
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,519
He probably thought the mob
had hired you to follow and catch him.

208
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:19,479
So he panicked,
and had a falling out with her!

209
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,969
Is that true?! Hey!

210
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:22,889
Yeah!

211
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,529
Then you're also the
one who tried to kill me?!

212
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,349
Yeah! That's right!

213
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:32,239
It's too late now! Our only
option is to turn ourselves in!

214
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,389
Don't be stupid. I'll take
care of the guy following us.

215
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,159
Leave it to me!

216
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,559
I don't want to kill any more!

217
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,149
If you do that, I'll go to the police!

218
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,129
Sorry I snapped earlier,
Kyoko. Let's escape together!

219
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,719
I was going to be in
danger if I didn't kill her first!

220
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:02,559
Damn it! We shouldn't have
tried to hide in these mountains!

221
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,889
But I don't know
who killed that college guy,

222
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,989
and I got nothing to do with this "Fox"!

223
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,199
Hold on, now! Then what about the Fox?!

224
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:15,679
That's the biggest question of all!

225
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,389
I can't imagine the
Fox letting this chance slip by.

226
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,759
Slip...

227
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,169
Wait a minute! The fax machine!

228
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,389
Hey! There's a fax machine here, right?

229
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:27,209
What?

230
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,339
That's right!
One for contacting the office!

231
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,509
It should be on a different
line than the public phone!

232
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,269
Yeah! If the lightning
hasn't knocked it out...

233
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,729
...we can contact the police!

234
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:43,189
Well?!

235
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,109
No good, no good, no good!

236
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,969
Is our only choice to
go down the mountain now?!

237
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:52,529
W-What the--?!

238
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,349
The phone line's been severed!

239
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,929
The phone line we thought
had been knocked out

240
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,969
had been severed inside the cabin!

241
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,959
Why? Why?!

242
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:13,102
What?! What does this mean?!

243
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,692
Someone had cut the phone line...

244
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:23,062
Oh, Gramps? This is Hirai.
I'll be staying again tonight!

245
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:23,912
That's right!

246
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,072
What's wrong?

247
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:29,532
Mountain Lodge Guestbook

248
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:33,002
This is it! There's a clue inside here!

249
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:33,652
Hirai Kenichi

250
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:34,582
Here it is!
Hirai Kenichi

251
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,042
Here, too!

252
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:40,272
Hirai-san really was a regular here.

253
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,552
Of course he was. He was a
member of his college hiking club.

254
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:47,262
If this is the reason
Hirai-san was killed, then...

255
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:52,472
Now, then. Let's split up to look
for Ushio-san and contact the police.

256
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:55,942
I'll stay here and watch him.

257
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:59,692
Not you! You will accompany me!

258
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,312
You still suspect me? Sheesh...

259
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,312
I just don't wanna get sunburned!

260
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,572
Today's a sizzling, after-storm day!

261
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,652
Quit talking like some girl!

262
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:13,372
Of course you're gonna get
sunburned in the mountains!

263
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,022
Sunburned?

264
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:16,622
Yes! That's it!

265
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:20,482
That's what always
seemed out of place!

266
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,652
Even though he
manages a mountain cabin,

267
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:24,132
that old man doesn't have a tan at all!

268
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:27,902
Which means someone's
disguised as him!

269
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:30,232
He's the Fox!

270
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:34,142
What?! That old man
isn't the cabin manager?

271
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,352
How can you tell that?

272
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:42,022
The cabin manager should be really
tan from always being in the sun!

273
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:47,032
That's right, now that you mention it.
That old man had pale skin.

274
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,812
Does that mean
the old man is the Fox?!

275
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,952
And Hirai-san's killer?

276
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:57,402
Yes. Hirai-san knew
the real cabin manager.

277
00:16:57,402 --> 00:17:02,652
If he came to the cabin, he would've
known the Fox took his place.

278
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,482
That's why the Fox killed Hirai-san!

279
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:12,202
He must've heard Hirai-san call
the cabin while filling out the forms!

280
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:16,732
He knocked Hirai-san
over a cliff on the way here,

281
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:18,982
then rushed ahead of
us to cut the phone lines.

282
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:22,642
Then he waited for his target to arrive...

283
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:25,852
...disguised as the cabin manager,

284
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:29,362
someone more accustomed
to the mountains than the guests!

285
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:33,282
Damn him!
Pretending to be the manager!

286
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:38,152
Even if we know who the Fox is,
we still don't know where he is!

287
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:40,312
A gunshot!

288
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:41,252
Is it the Fox?!

289
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,172
Wait, Conan-kun!

290
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:49,902
The Fox is a professional killer!

291
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,572
He'd have planned an escape route
to get to safety before anyone else!

292
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:58,082
The quickest path down
the mountain, in other words!

293
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:00,572
Around here!

294
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:03,512
A wallet?

295
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:07,282
Isn't this...

296
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,222
What's this?

297
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:11,782
It's nothing!

298
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,202
It's Ushio-san's wallet!

299
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:16,882
Is this a photo of his daughter?

300
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:18,312
Takagi Kindergarten

301
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,002
Takagi Kindergarten?
Takagi Kindergarten

302
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,792
Wasn't that...

303
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,842
Kindergartener  Killed in Accident!
Ushio Chisato-chan (5)

304
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,922
That damn Fox...

305
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,722
That's it! Now I see!

306
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:38,642
Never thought your suicidal target
would attack back, did you?!

307
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:40,852
W-What's going on?!

308
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:44,812
He wants revenge for his
beloved daughter's death!

309
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:48,312
Remember that quick-loan company
CEO you killed six months ago?!

310
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:52,782
A school bus got caught in the
accident and a kindergartener died!

311
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,742
A kindergartener?

312
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:56,732
Don't pretend you've forgotten!

313
00:18:56,732 --> 00:19:00,912
You killed my one and only daughter!

314
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:06,332
But you didn't know
the Fox's face or identity.

315
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,802
With no other choice, you made
yourself a target and hired old Mori

316
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,302
as a way to lure him out, right?

317
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:15,142
Even the sniper was probably-

318
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:21,442
That's right! I had an associate do it!
To get the detective out here!

319
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:25,152
The guy I ran after was that Kawabe kid!

320
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:30,512
But to my surprise, the old man
he had hostage pushed him and ran!

321
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:36,532
It was suddenly very clear
who the professional killer was!

322
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,292
We finally meet...

323
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:42,752
Die, Fox!

324
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:43,872
Stop!

325
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:56,312
That's nothing at all,
compared to Chisato's suffering!

326
00:19:56,312 --> 00:20:00,972
Time to die, Fox!
I'll kill you slowly and painfully!

327
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:05,312
Don't shoot! Doing that won't
bring Chisato-chan back!

328
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:10,612
If you kill him,
you'll be a murderer, too!

329
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:13,612
Do you think Chisato-chan
would be happy about that?!

330
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:26,972
Chisato...

331
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,432
Chisato!

332
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,852
Quit being a sore loser!

333
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:50,982
Fox! So here you are!

334
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:56,652
Hi, fake manager.
So you're the Fox, huh?

335
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,352
He's definitely the Fox!

336
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,552
Not so fast!

337
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,102
How do you like
Mori Kogoro-sama's--

338
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,422
Huh?! What's this?

339
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:11,332
No way!

340
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,842
The Fox was still a young man!

341
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:48,262
The real cabin manager
was being held in a nearby cave.

342
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:51,372
Eventually, the police arrived,

343
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:56,022
and Fox the hitman and Kawabe-san
the murderer were arrested.

344
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:58,822
As was Ushio-san.

345
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:04,782
Boy. You're no ordinary kid.

346
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,492
I'm Edogawa Conan. A detective.

347
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:16,912
Now the case is closed!

348
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,922
Now to head home for a bath,
wild boar stew, and some beer!

349
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:22,382
Oh, Dad...

350
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:28,352
I guess he's no ordinary guy, either...

351
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:32,702
Stew sounds great!

352
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:54,292
A ghost?

353
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,502
I saw her! The Snow Woman
in a white kimono!

354
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:04,472
Eh?! Makiko-san was found dead,
in her Snow Woman costume?!

355
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:07,392
You must not take that body away!

356
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:12,522
On the next Conan:
"The Snow Woman Legend Murder Case."
