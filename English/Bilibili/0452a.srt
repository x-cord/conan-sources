1
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,166
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,066
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,566
Today's episode is a one-hour special!

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,766
It's the long awaited travelling performers' troupe story.

5
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,566
A phantom appears on the stage of Konpira!

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:15,966
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:17,566
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,666
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,866
This is just great!

10
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,866
It's nice and easygoing.

11
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,366
Yep.

12
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:05,366
I'm thirsty. I'd like a shot of beer, I tell you!

13
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:09,466
Dad, we've come all the way to Shikoku, you know.

14
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:10,866
We should be more interested in eating than drinking!

15
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,466
-Sanuki udon! -Sanuki udon!

16
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,966
I know.

17
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:18,166
That's why I want to moisten my mouth a little before that.

18
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:22,166
I'll bet you'll drink and fall asleep during the performance.

19
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:26,466
Right, I mean after Tamanosuke invited us and all!

20
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,266
I know.

21
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,666
Hey, the opera house that Tamanosuke and his troupe is going to perform

22
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,466
at called Kanamaru-za is a very famous place, isn't it?

23
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,566
Right!

24
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,166
Every spring they perform

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,866
the "Shikoku Konpira Kabuki Great Performance",

26
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:43,966
"Konpira Station" -every year a huge number of people come to watch it.

27
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,366
Look, look!

28
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,166
You're right. Amazing!

29
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,666
This is sure going to be something to look forward to!

30
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:58,766
"The Phantom of Konpira"

31
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,566
"Miyatake Hand-made Udon"

32
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,866
Is this the noodle shop that was recommended?

33
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,266
It looks like an ordinary house.

34
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:07,066
Welcome!

35
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:11,966
Well, well, appetizers to go with beer!

36
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,466
These are toppings to be put into the udon, Dad!

37
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,566
"Menu" -Thank you for waiting.

38
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:17,766
Oh, here it comes.

39
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,466
The tempura is over there so help yourself to as much as you like.

40
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,666
Okay!

41
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,166
It's delicious!

42
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,766
They just take your tongue with them!

43
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,766
This is really the real taste.

44
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:35,766
This sure is the taste of the genuine!

45
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,466
Okay, I've made up my mind!

46
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,666
Made up your mind?

47
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,466
I mean that, that.

48
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,666
What?

49
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,566
"Sanuki Udon roaming eating contest"?

50
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,366
"Omotesandou" -Hey, you girls over there!

51
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,866
Please use this cane.

52
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,866
Just return it when you come back down.

53
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,766
-Thank you! -Thank you very much.

54
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:59,266
Canes, my foot. I mean we're not old.

55
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,966
How many steps are there here anyway?

56
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,666
Until the main shrine which is at the very top,

57
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,866
it seems there are 785 steps all together.

58
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:14,966
Seven hundred...

59
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:16,966
And eighty-five?

60
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,566
Easy, easy, duck soup!

61
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,466
"100th stage" -We said to begin with that

62
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,666
if there's something as convenient as this.

63
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,866
Where's dad?

64
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,866
Over there.

65
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,366
This is so good!

66
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,266
Locally brewed sake sure is different!

67
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:34,766
Dad!

68
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,166
What about praying at the shrine?

69
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,566
Sorry, but pray for me too while you're at it!

70
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:40,766
What?

71
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:43,566
Besides, Kanamaru-za is right there, isn't it?

72
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,066
I'll wait for you guys here.

73
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,766
Miss! One more serving, please!

74
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,766
What happened to tasting udon at different restaurants?

75
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,666
I've finally made it.

76
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,766
It's so unfair only getting to ride the basket half way up!

77
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,466
What took you so long, Sonoko?

78
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:11,866
You should've stayed below and rested together with Dad!

79
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,566
Hey, don't put me in the same boat as Pops!

80
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:17,766
Konpira is the god that protects the sea, isn't it?

81
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:22,766
Right. It says that it is worshipped fervently by people who work at sea.

82
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,866
It's about time. Shall we head for Kanamaru-za?

83
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,366
Let's go!

84
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,266
I wonder if Tamanosuke is doing okay.

85
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,666
Yes, and Renge too.

86
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,366
-Right! That's the point! -What?

87
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,566
I wonder if those two are still lovey-dovey with each other.

88
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:42,366
-I've got my eyes on Tamanosuke, you see. -Come on, Sonoko.

89
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,966
What's with everybody...

90
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,328
Hello, everyone.

91
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:59,128
Thank you for coming such a long way.

92
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:01,328
This is hopeless.

93
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,628
I guess they're doing well.

94
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,128
You can tell just by looking at them that they're in love.

95
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,428
Conan!

96
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:08,828
Megumi.

97
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,628
Hello.

98
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:12,728
What's the matter?

99
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,228
The little ones are not here today, are they?

100
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,928
Oh, those kids?

101
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,128
They sort of couldn't make it.

102
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,028
I'm glad. It makes me so happy!

103
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:22,628
Hey, Megumi.

104
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:24,928
Hey, hey, what's this glasses kid!

105
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,028
You're popular, aren't you?

106
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:27,228
I'm gonna get you.

107
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,628
Conan.

108
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:31,828
This way, please.

109
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:35,328
It's a crawl-in entrance, so please watch your head.

110
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,328
And what's a crawl-in entrance?

111
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:40,328
-It's hurt... -Dad!

112
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,328
Are you all right?

113
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:44,028
I knew he'd do that.

114
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:48,328
We're still making preparations for the performance

115
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:50,528
so everyone's still busy here.

116
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,428
My, how fantastic!

117
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:56,328
Oh, they're right in the midst of checking the movement

118
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,328
"Seri (Trapdoor)" -of the trapdoor on stage.

119
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,528
Trapdoor?

120
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:02,828
It's being pushed up by a lot of stagehands in the basement.

121
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,928
The actors come out from there and pose.

122
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,728
The stage is moving!

123
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,428
That's a revolving stage.

124
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,828
Likewise, stagehands are pushing from the basement and turning the stage.

125
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:14,728
They're doing it in the same way as was done in the past.

126
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:17,328
They used to call the basement Naraku (pitfall) in the past,

127
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,328
because water drainage was bad

128
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,228
and the stagehands had it tough.

129
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:23,328
That's how it ended up being called that way.

130
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,728
That path on the other side is the flowery way.

131
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,328
The actors come from the birdhouse beyond

132
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:31,728
weaving through the audience and appear, then head towards the stage.

133
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:32,928
The thing you see part way along the way

134
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,128
is the Suppon (Soft-shelled turtle).

135
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,728
Just like the trapdoor that you just saw,

136
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,728
it is devised to rise from below.

137
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,228
And the thing right above the flowery way

138
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,728
that looks like a crane is called "Kakesuji".

139
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,528
It's used to pull the actors up and suspend them in air.

140
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,328
That's amazing!

141
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:50,028
"Grape vine trellis" -The ceiling is made of bamboo in trelliswork,

142
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:54,428
and confetti of cherry blossom petals are scattered from there.

143
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:56,728
"Balcony seat" -It's like we've time slipped 100 years back!

144
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,128
True!

145
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:00,228
It's even further back than 100 years.

146
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:02,428
Kanamaru-za was originally built towards

147
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,628
the end of the Edo Period, in the year of Tenpo

148
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,828
after approval from the shogunate.

149
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:10,528
It is the oldest playhouse in existence in Japan.

150
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:15,128
It's really an honor for an actor to be able to perform here.

151
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,628
Besides, you're both love-dovey too...

152
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:20,128
Sonoko.

153
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:22,828
I heard that you will be doing a performance of a samurai show

154
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:24,928
that takes after the Phantom of the Opera today.

155
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:27,828
That's right. This is a gruesome story of love and hate,

156
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:30,728
takes place on the flamboyant stage of this opera house,

157
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:34,228
between a mysterious phantom who covers his ugly dreadful face with a mask,

158
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:38,528
and a pretty singing princess and her lover.

159
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:41,628
Taking after the Phantom of the Opera, this is the Phantom of the Konpira!

160
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:54,028
-You're arrested! -Arrested!

161
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,528
My beloved princess, sing!

162
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,728
For me, who loves you!

163
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,728
For the angel of music!

164
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:05,428
Sing! You must sing!

165
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:08,828
You pure angel! Brilliant angel!

166
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,128
Take my soul way up to heaven!

167
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,628
Don't sing! Wake up!

168
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:17,328
That's the devil! It's a ghost!

169
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,628
How nice.

170
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,928
Hey, who's that?

171
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,228
He is Mr. Tatsuhiko Rausu, who's going to be supporting

172
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,828
our performance this time.

173
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:28,628
A sponsor.

174
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:29,828
Rausu?

175
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:32,128
The Rausu Concieron in Kansai?

176
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:33,928
I did read about it in the papers.

177
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,728
The family head passed away

178
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:40,528
and his yet young son became his successor.

179
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:42,228
Hi there!

180
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,728
Oh, no! Don't...

181
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,228
Not all of sudden like that.

182
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:51,128
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

183
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:52,828
Give it your best shot, Renge!

184
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,728
Yes, I will. Renge?

185
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,428
I, Tatsuhiko Rausu is with you all the way!

186
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:00,528
Thank you.

187
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:04,028
But, I only play a small part in this play.

188
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,128
I was thinking about that, but no matter how much I think about it,

189
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:08,428
you're the only one fit to play the role of the heroine singing princess.

190
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:11,028
-So, why not change... -Mr. Rausu!

191
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,828
I, the leader of this troupe is who decides,

192
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,228
not you, the sponsor.

193
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:18,628
Neither the phantom, right?

194
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:20,028
Absolutely.

195
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,228
Phantom?

196
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:23,828
You have no intention of taking in my request, do you?

197
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:24,928
Of course not!

198
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:27,128
Well, all I wanted to do was see my childhood friend

199
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,828
at her proud moment appearing as the star of the show.

200
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,228
Request. Changing heroines.

201
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:37,528
Childhood friend and the phantom.

202
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:40,028
This sounds just like that famous opera...

203
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:42,928
The Phantom of the Opera.

204
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:46,528
It's exactly that, don't you think?

205
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:49,428
He's Renge's childhood friend.

206
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:55,328
Wouldn't it be better if you would be a little more honest, Tamanosuke?

207
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:57,528
I'm talking about the feelings you have for Renge.

208
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:58,728
You like her, don't you?

209
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,928
Mr. Rausu.

210
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:03,928
If you dilly-dally, I'm going to take her away from you.

211
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:08,828
It's a love triangle?

212
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:10,028
Sonoko!

213
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:13,128
I don't mind, troupe leader.

214
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,928
I'll give Renge my role.

215
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,528
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,928
Don't be silly.

217
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:23,828
The purpose we had you come here would completely be lost!

218
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:25,228
That's right!

219
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,228
I've been your fan all this time!

220
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,328
Just sharing the stage with you will make me happy.

221
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,028
Thank you.

222
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,628
What a beauty!

223
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,428
She sure looks familiar...

224
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,828
Ms. Romi Karube.

225
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:40,528
She's a famous young stage actress.

226
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:43,928
Big brother went to ask her to act the heroine part for this play.

227
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:46,728
He was sure that she was going to refuse, but on the contrary,

228
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:48,728
she surprisingly agreed immediately.

229
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:51,228
Oh well, I'm so very sorry.

230
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,728
Please do your best.

231
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:58,128
Well, well, I guess she doesn't like me.

232
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:04,528
I'm really can't see well in dark places.

233
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,528
Somebody! Give him the luminous tape for sponsor.

234
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:08,728
Luminous?

235
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,328
Does she mean this?

236
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,528
What a dirty tape.

237
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,028
It's tape that shines in the dark.

238
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:16,928
Look. There are some over there too.

239
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,628
You're a smart fellow, sonny.

240
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:21,928
You're right, when the stage turns dark, it is pasted on the stage

241
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:24,828
so that the performers don't stand in the wrong place.

242
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:32,328
Either way, you don't have a chance, Sonoko.

243
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,028
I'm just fine.

244
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:36,428
-I've found someone else. -Someone else?

245
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,728
"Otoya Kawatake (25), Actor" -So we're finally starting practice.

246
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:40,428
Talk about a slow moving stage performance.

247
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:44,128
But, all I'm interested in is my role so...

248
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:46,028
He's so cool.

249
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:47,828
Move it, move it! Out of my way!

250
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:49,728
Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:54,028
Who let them in? It's no time to let the audience in yet, is it?

252
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,128
What a snob.

253
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,428
Sonoko!

254
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:59,628
I'm sorry, Mr. Nabe. I should've introduced them to you earlier.

255
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:02,728
He is Detective Kogoro Mouri and...

256
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:04,028
A detective?

257
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,328
Kogoro Mouri?

258
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,928
You mean that famous...

259
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:11,728
Yes, I am the famous Kogoro Mouri!

260
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:14,028
His daughter, Ran.

261
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,128
Nice to meet you.

262
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,128
And...

263
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,728
He's the boy I love, Conan Edogawa!

264
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,228
How do you do?

265
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:23,728
-And she is... -I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

266
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:24,928
Nice to meet you.

267
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,028
I don't care who, I don't like people getting in the way of my job.

268
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:32,528
The former leader was stricter when it came to things like this.

269
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,728
Father is father and I'm me.

270
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:38,328
Well, but I wouldn't have been able to pay my debts back

271
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:39,828
if it hadn't been for this job,

272
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:43,128
so I am grateful to you, leader.

273
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:44,328
Hey, let's go!

274
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:46,728
-Yes, sir! -Don't get in the way of practice.

275
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:53,128
Okay, let's begin!

276
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:56,028
Renge, will you go to my room backstage and get me my mouthwash?

277
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,628
-All right. -Conan and the rest, go sit in the audience.

278
00:13:58,628 --> 00:13:59,828
Okay!

279
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,328
Watch out!

280
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,128
Romi!

281
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,328
Are you all right? Romi!

282
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,766
Romi!

283
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:46,266
What's this?

284
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:49,166
Somebody, get an ambulance! Call the ambulance!

285
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,366
No, leader.

286
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:54,266
It's no big thing. I'm not all that hurt.

287
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,566
Romi.

288
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,366
It's just a scratch.

289
00:14:57,366 --> 00:15:01,066
But, this stage is known for coming in close contact with the audience,

290
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,366
so I've got to wear a bit more greasepaint than usual.

291
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:05,966
Shoots, how dare...

292
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,166
What dirt bag could've done something like this?

293
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,066
Empty that place up right away!

294
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,366
We've got to fix this up immediately

295
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,366
or we won't be able to make it in time for the show!

296
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:16,466
He's the pits! He's the one who did it!

297
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,466
Sonoko.

298
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:18,966
Let's give her treatment immediately.

299
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,366
Let's go to your room backstage, Romi.

300
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,066
There's a cut that looks like it's been slashed

301
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,066
with a knife or something on that rope.

302
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,366
Could it be the work of the phantom?

303
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,766
Don't be silly!

304
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,766
That's just some sort of prank.

305
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,966
Then, what about this?

306
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:39,066
If worse comes to worse, we may really have to change heroines.

307
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,866
I won't let that happen.

308
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,566
This is really challenging.

309
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:46,166
I won't let the phantom has his way.

310
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,066
Right, leader?

311
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,066
Uh, I hate to interrupt your conversation,

312
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,366
but what is this phantom thing about?

313
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,266
The Phantom of the Konpira!

314
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,666
Like I was saying, that's not...

315
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,566
If I remember correctly, that's the title of this performance,

316
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,166
Phantom of the Konpira.

317
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,066
Yes, but...

318
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,666
I see! It's the chandelier, the chandelier!

319
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,466
Right!

320
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,666
Chandelier?

321
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,566
Well, this stage that made after the Phantom of the Opera...

322
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,166
A chandelier's going to come falling onto

323
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,366
the first actress that acts the role of the heroine.

324
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,866
Not only that, the connection you have with one another,

325
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:27,066
greatly resembles the character setting of the Phantom of the Opera!

326
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,466
Come to think of it, you mentioned that

327
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,366
you wouldn't give in to the demand of the phantom

328
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,666
just a while ago, didn't you, Tamanosuke?

329
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,166
That's what exactly how it went in the story too!

330
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,466
But in the Phantom of the Opera,

331
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:38,466
the phantom was the one who demanded that the heroine be changed.

332
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,466
What does this mean?

333
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:45,366
It seems that you all have some you're hiding from us.

334
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:49,066
Well, well, as expected of a famous detective.

335
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:54,266
Tamanosuke, maybe we should tell Mr. Mouri about it already?

336
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,566
All right.

337
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:02,466
At first, I thought it was just a prank that someone was playing on us.

338
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,666
After all, it didn't really do anything

339
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,966
but, appear and scare people.

340
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,466
However...

341
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,966
10 of these types of letters

342
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:18,766
"To troupe leader" -were delivered here.

343
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:25,066
The contents are all the same.

344
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,566
What in earth is the meaning of this?

345
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:31,366
"Get a large audience, you shall be stabbed to death in the end."

346
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,966
"Phantom of the Konpira."

347
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,066
It's only natural to want to get a large audience.

348
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:38,266
I mean, after all this is a stage play.

349
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,266
"You shall be stabbed to death in the end"

350
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,266
sure sounds like a dialogue in the play too.

351
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:45,366
Isn't that a code? About the word "Sanuki"?

352
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,066
It's amazing you figured it out, sonny!

353
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,466
Sanuki?

354
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,566
What bothers me is that the code is too easy to decipher.

355
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,966
Sanuki...

356
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:57,566
Oh, I see! Sanuki means

357
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:00,766
removing the letter "sa" from the sentence and read it!

358
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,166
Let's see.

359
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,766
It may be easier if you changed the entire sentence into hiragana first.

360
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,466
So, the "sa" is removed.

361
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:08,866
Then...

362
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,866
That's incredible!

363
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:13,066
"Change the heroine to Renge"?

364
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:16,766
This is genuine blackmail!

365
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,066
But, if we take every such thing that we get seriously,

366
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,566
we can't be doing any stage performance!

367
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,866
Exactly.

368
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,666
But, after ignoring it, look what just happened a while ago.

369
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,566
So, it wasn't just a simple threat.

370
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,666
Which means, something else is bound to happen.

371
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,866
Leader.

372
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:36,366
I'm going through with this!

373
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,066
If it's okay with you, Romi...

374
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,066
Well, if you quit because of something like this,

375
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,466
I guess you can't be called an actress.

376
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:43,166
Hey, hey.

377
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,166
Are things going to be okay, Mr. Mouri?

378
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,366
There seems to be no direct connection

379
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:51,466
between the blackmail and collapse of the paper lantern.

380
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:52,866
And as for the cut found in the rope,

381
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,566
we've got to investigate further

382
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,066
to see if it was really cut with a knife too.

383
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,166
True.

384
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,366
Even if the police were to do something right now,

385
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:02,866
as far as the play is concerned,

386
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:07,366
they would have no choice but to leave the final decision up to the leader.

387
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:10,966
Okay, all set, the cast stands as is.

388
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,466
I want you all to do your best at today's show,

389
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,466
as well as tomorrow's general public performance.

390
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:33,666
Come, my beloved child!

391
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,766
Believe me and sing!

392
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,666
Those who believe in me shall not die!

393
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,966
Who is it?

394
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,366
Please wait!

395
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,766
Are you god?

396
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,866
Or are you the devil?

397
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:53,566
He's the devil! I shall punish you!

398
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:57,166
You inhabitant of the world of darkness where there is no light!

399
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:02,466
You ignorant and impudent youth! You shall be cursed!

400
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:05,866
You who attempt to take away my love and victory,

401
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:10,166
shall learn of the power of the world of darkness!

402
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,866
How touching!

403
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,766
Just as I thought. Dad drank again after that so...

404
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:23,266
What is she looking at from some time ago?

405
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,266
That's...

406
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,266
Hey, what's that?

407
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:34,866
Look there!

408
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,066
What happened?

409
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,466
Who is that jerk?

410
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:44,466
-What's up? -What's wrong?

411
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:45,866
What's with her voice?

412
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:47,466
That's...

413
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:48,766
She sounds just like...

414
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,166
A frog.

415
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,066
What's wrong with her?

416
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,266
This is the same as the Phantom of the Opera too!

417
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,566
Seriously?

418
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,966
Darn, where'd he go?

419
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,666
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

420
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,166
Romi, come back!

421
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,566
What's happening?

422
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,266
This is the only way in or out.

423
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,766
There are this many people in the audience and yet,

424
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:34,966
no one seems to have noticed the phantom passing through at all.

425
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,666
Why?

426
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,266
What's that?

427
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:46,566
Hey, brat, what're you doing?

428
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:50,166
Well, I thought it was fun being in a high place like this so I...

429
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,366
This isn't an amusement park!

430
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,066
Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!

431
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,066
I'm sorry!

432
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:58,666
Someone switch Romi's mouthwash?

433
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,566
She thought it was the same mouthwash as usual.

434
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:06,166
After the curtains went up, she went ahead and drank it.

435
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,166
Then...

436
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,866
How cruel. Who could've done something like that?

437
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,466
Don't tell me that...

438
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,666
Never mind that for now.

439
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,066
The problem is what to do about this stage performance.

440
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:20,166
You were Romi's prompter, weren't you?

441
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,766
You know the lines, don't you?

442
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,866
Don't tell me that you want me to...

443
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,866
We've no time to be arguing.

444
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,666
The audience is waiting!

445
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:31,066
But...

446
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:34,266
The curtains are down now but we'll open them in 15 minutes.

447
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,366
So, hurry!

448
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:46,066
The phantom? It' probably just a part of the performance.

449
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:49,766
It seems that the others in the audience think so too, but...

450
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:52,166
Where's Conan?

451
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,366
A dead end, huh? This is almost like a labyrinth.

452
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:08,166
Don't be afraid, my beloved child.

453
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,266
Who's there?

454
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,966
This is not too good... where am I?

455
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,066
I wonder if I can do it.

456
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:21,266
I wonder if I can act out Romi's part all right.

457
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,166
Don't worry.

458
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,166
The phantom?

459
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:28,366
I, the angle of music is with you.

460
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,266
Nobody's inside?

461
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:42,266
What's going on?

462
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:48,366
After meeting him, my heart was filled with joy.

463
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,666
But, he is an inhabitant of the world of darkness.

464
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,966
I am a captive of darkness.

465
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,866
Let's stop talking of the world of darkness.

466
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:59,766
I shall guide you to the world of light.

467
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:01,466
I shall be with you wherever you go!

468
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:03,366
Conan, where were you?

469
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:04,466
To the restroom.

470
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:07,766
Please swear that I am your only love.

471
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:11,766
I swear that you are my only love.

472
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:14,066
There is no way you can go back,

473
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,366
since you have already come here,

474
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:17,766
to this basement cell that is shut off from all things

475
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:20,266
and everything vanishes in darkness!

476
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:23,366
I am not afraid of your appearance.

477
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:27,366
What frightens me is your distorted heart!

478
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,066
Renge is fantastic!

479
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,066
She sure doesn't seem like a substitute actress at all!

480
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,966
This showing is a whopping success.

481
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:36,166
That substitute actress is fantastic!

482
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,866
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's show.

483
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:57,966
Shoots, this place is so eerie.

484
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,366
This is...

485
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:20,766
What on earth...

486
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:24,066
Mr. Nabe?

487
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,566
Freeze!

488
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,366
Stay right there and don't move!

489
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:30,266
No! I didn't do it!

490
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:31,666
I didn't kill him!
