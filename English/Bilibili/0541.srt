1
00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:03.057
My name's Kogoro Mouri,

2
00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:05.657
a famed renowned detective no need for mentioning.

3
00:00:05.657 --> 00:00:07.257
The request this time was for me to find an eye-witness

4
00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:09.457
to prove Mr. Gamo's alibi,

5
00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:12.857
since he was a suspect of murder.

6
00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:16.857
The investigation was tougher than first expected,

7
00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.357
and Mr. Gamo called every night demanding results.

8
00:00:20.357 --> 00:00:22.457
I'm doomed.

9
00:00:22.457 --> 00:00:27.057
The following morning, Mr. Gamo was found dead.

10
00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:28.557
Five years ago,

11
00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:31.057
Mr. Gamo experienced being mistakenly arrested.

12
00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:34.657
Afraid of having to go through the same thing once again,

13
00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:36.957
we first thought that he committed suicide.

14
00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:39.357
But, my eyes could not be deceived.

15
00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:42.657
This is a homicide made to look like suicide.

16
00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:45.257
The officer that mistakenly arrested Mr. Gamo

17
00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:48.157
"Isao Takeoka (40)" -was my old colleague, Takeoka.

18
00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:51.257
After coincidentally running into Takeoka

19
00:00:51.257 --> 00:00:53.757
who had quit the forces feeling responsible for his mistake

20
00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:56.757
and decided to investigate the case together.

21
00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.757
The suspicious one is Mr. Gamo's nephew, Kyosuke Arai.

22
00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:02.157
I'm sure that he's the culprit

23
00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:04.457
because he was in debt

24
00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:06.357
and had an argument with Mr. Gamo.

25
00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:10.757
However, Arai committed suicide.

26
00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:12.257
Soon afterwards,

27
00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:15.057
a witness proving his alibi appears.

28
00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:17.257
Arai wasn't the culprit.

29
00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:22.757
And yet I cornered him and lead him to death.

30
00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:23.957
I'm going to bring down

31
00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:26.857
the sign of the detective agency from today on.

32
00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:30.057
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

33
00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.457
Saturday nights are for mystery.

34
00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:34.757
Is this the last case for the famed, renowned Detective Kogoro?

35
00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:36.957
The real culprit is one who betrays all expectations.

36
00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:38.557
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.357
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:42.157
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:29.292
"The Day Detective Kogoro Mouri Goes Out of Business (Part 2)"

40
00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.192
"Mouri Detective Agency"

41
00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:39.192
He's totally depressed.

42
00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:43.392
But, are you sure that Mr. Kyosuke Arai wasn't the culprit?

43
00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:46.992
The woman who lived next to him testified

44
00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:48.592
that at around 8 pm,

45
00:03:48.592 --> 00:03:50.792
when she was about to turn on the TV.

46
00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:52.592
Time Machine?

47
00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:54.892
The readers will never go for something like that.

48
00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:57.992
She looked inside next door wanting to complain,

49
00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:00.492
and saw him with a FAX sheet that just came in

50
00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:03.392
shouting at the top of his lungs.

51
00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:06.692
Mr. Arai was in charge of inserting pictures

52
00:04:06.692 --> 00:04:08.792
in a serial detective novel.

53
00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:10.392
And he was told that the culprit would be using a time machine

54
00:04:10.392 --> 00:04:12.492
to carry out an alibi trick.

55
00:04:12.492 --> 00:04:15.992
I guess it's true that readers would never go for something like that.

56
00:04:15.992 --> 00:04:18.492
It takes at least 30 minutes by car

57
00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.892
from Mr. Arai's condo to Mr. Gamo's residence.

58
00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:23.292
And an additional hour is needed to get from the Gamo residence

59
00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:25.092
to the site where the corpse was found.

60
00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:27.092
He could've never made in time for the estimated time of death

61
00:04:27.092 --> 00:04:29.692
which is between 7 pm to 9 pm.

62
00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:32.492
So, it's impossible after all.

63
00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:36.392
If his next door neighbor heard his voice after 8 pm,

64
00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:39.092
Mr. Arai could've done it.

65
00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:43.592
Because if he killed Mr. Gamo in the woods at 7 pm,

66
00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:45.992
he could've returned to his room by 8:30 pm.

67
00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:47.992
That's not possible.

68
00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:52.592
Because Mr. Gamo called Mr. Mouri at 8 pm from his home.

69
00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.192
What if he faked his tone of voice?

70
00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:55.592
Wrong.

71
00:04:57.392 --> 00:04:59.392
The call I received didn't sound like

72
00:04:59.392 --> 00:05:01.592
a different tone of voice.

73
00:05:02.892 --> 00:05:06.592
But, Mr. Gamo had a very hoarse voice, didn't he?

74
00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:07.892
So, I don't think you could tell the difference

75
00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:10.492
if someone tried to mimic him?

76
00:05:10.492 --> 00:05:13.592
I would never mistake the voice of my client for someone else.

77
00:05:13.592 --> 00:05:14.592
But...

78
00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:18.192
Shut up! I've been making a living as a detective for ten years!

79
00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:29.992
I wonder who the real culprit X of this case is.

80
00:05:29.992 --> 00:05:32.092
What? The real culprit?

81
00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:33.592
"X"?

82
00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:35.292
The real culprit who killed both Mr. Gamo

83
00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:36.492
and Mr. Arai making it look

84
00:05:36.492 --> 00:05:39.192
as if they committed suicide.

85
00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:42.592
If his next door neighbor didn't testify for him,

86
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.092
we would've also suspected

87
00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:46.992
Mr. Arai as being the one who killed Mr. Gamo.

88
00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:50.192
The more so, now that he's committed suicide.

89
00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:52.692
That's exactly what X is after.

90
00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:55.092
Mr. Mouri.

91
00:05:55.092 --> 00:05:58.492
We're going to re-investigate this case once more.

92
00:05:58.492 --> 00:05:59.492
Excuse me.

93
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:03.592
If there's another culprit,

94
00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.392
dad will not be blamed at all.

95
00:06:06.392 --> 00:06:08.492
You don't have to quit being a detective.

96
00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:09.992
Yes.

97
00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:13.492
What's this about real culprit X?

98
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.292
Dad.

99
00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:21.792
He's really critically had it.

100
00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:23.892
Geez. There's no other way

101
00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:26.092
than for you to give him a slap in the butt, mother.

102
00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:27.592
He's that bad?

103
00:06:27.592 --> 00:06:29.092
"Mouri Detective Agency"

104
00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.492
It's all right already, dear.

105
00:06:35.492 --> 00:06:38.392
After all, you've kept going for the past ten years.

106
00:06:38.392 --> 00:06:40.692
I'm sure you're exhausted.

107
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.192
Mother.

108
00:06:43.592 --> 00:06:46.992
Kogoro!

109
00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:48.792
Just as you promised,

110
00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:51.792
you're mine from today.

111
00:06:54.992 --> 00:06:56.192
Dad.

112
00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:01.692
Animal cookies.

113
00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:03.092
Just like old times.

114
00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:06.492
Mr. Takeoka came by the other day.

115
00:07:08.592 --> 00:07:11.892
He said that it used to be his wife's favorite.

116
00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:14.592
By the way, about your dad.

117
00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:17.092
Is he going around with women like that recently?

118
00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:18.192
No, you've got it all wrong.

119
00:07:18.192 --> 00:07:20.192
She's not what you think.

120
00:07:20.192 --> 00:07:21.892
Talk about messed up.

121
00:07:21.892 --> 00:07:23.292
Bodyguard.

122
00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:24.992
Getting rid of excess flab.

123
00:07:24.992 --> 00:07:26.592
Keep me company when jogging.

124
00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:28.292
Okay, Kogoro?

125
00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:32.292
"Mouri..."

126
00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:37.592
The only way I can make pops snap back to himself

127
00:07:37.592 --> 00:07:40.492
is to make him solve this case himself.

128
00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:44.592
"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo"

129
00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:48.792
Everything began when he got a job request from his client.

130
00:07:50.392 --> 00:07:51.392
All you had to do was agree

131
00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:54.192
to taking on the job I asked you to do to start with,

132
00:07:54.192 --> 00:07:55.492
"Sayuri Tokomae (40)" -Kogoro.

133
00:07:55.492 --> 00:07:56.892
Yes.

134
00:07:56.892 --> 00:07:59.492
It was bound to turn out this way either way.

135
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.392
She's another one that would benefit

136
00:08:02.392 --> 00:08:04.792
from Mr. Ryozo Gamo disappearing from this world.

137
00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:08.092
This is so much fun.

138
00:08:09.392 --> 00:08:10.992
Hey.

139
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.092
Could it be that they want to shut me up

140
00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:15.892
because I've realized the truth.

141
00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:23.892
It's this trio.

142
00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:26.992
They've been after my jewelry for sometime.

143
00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:30.292
Excessive? Excessive self-defense?

144
00:08:30.292 --> 00:08:32.192
Just what do you mean?

145
00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:34.392
All he did was beat up the thieves.

146
00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:37.292
-Why? What's the meaning of this? -Yes...

147
00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:40.092
Yes, it sure was a surprise to hear he committed suicide.

148
00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:42.392
There was nothing abnormal in his exam results and yet...

149
00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:43.692
that Ryozo Gamo.

150
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:48.292
Are you talking about Mr. Ryozo Gamo?

151
00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:50.892
Yes. I just happened to run into him here

152
00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:53.892
during my physical exam, about ten days ago.

153
00:08:53.892 --> 00:08:56.392
It was last Sunday.

154
00:08:56.392 --> 00:08:58.592
Last week Sunday?

155
00:08:58.592 --> 00:09:01.292
I got the job the day before,

156
00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:03.192
on Saturday night.

157
00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:05.092
Did he go through a barium test back then too?

158
00:09:05.092 --> 00:09:06.992
Yes, he seems to have refrained from drinking

159
00:09:06.992 --> 00:09:09.292
or eating anything from sundown the day before,

160
00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:10.392
and there was no problem.

161
00:09:11.492 --> 00:09:14.592
But, back then at night Mr. Gamo...

162
00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:17.092
It doesn't connect.

163
00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:19.192
Come to think of it, that brat...

164
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:21.292
What if he faked his tone of voice?

165
00:09:21.292 --> 00:09:22.992
It can't be...

166
00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:25.192
But, if I piece them together that way...

167
00:09:25.192 --> 00:09:27.692
"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo"

168
00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:29.692
Wait a second.

169
00:09:29.692 --> 00:09:32.392
I would never mistake the voice of my client for someone else.

170
00:09:33.492 --> 00:09:34.992
I got it.

171
00:09:36.092 --> 00:09:37.292
Conan.

172
00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:43.192
I guess I cannot resign my job as a detective.

173
00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:46.692
Moreover I'm not tired!

174
00:09:50.692 --> 00:09:53.792
What brings you here?

175
00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:55.792
Maybe we just get along?

176
00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:56.892
No darn way.

177
00:09:57.992 --> 00:10:00.192
Maybe pops also.

178
00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:01.692
Although he used to patronize this shop,

179
00:10:01.692 --> 00:10:05.092
Mr. Gamo's a fairly new customer.

180
00:10:05.092 --> 00:10:07.892
He first came here about half a month

181
00:10:07.892 --> 00:10:10.592
before he came here together with Mr. Mouri.

182
00:10:10.592 --> 00:10:12.792
About a half month ago.

183
00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:14.392
About two weeks.

184
00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:16.792
About a half a month ago, I think.

185
00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:19.992
No doubt about it.

186
00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:23.692
Pops has also realized the method used by the real culprit X.

187
00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:31.392
There are many prints from from the same shoes.

188
00:10:31.392 --> 00:10:32.492
The bath tub.

189
00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:37.792
He was hiding here every night waiting for a chance to come by.

190
00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:39.692
Most probably.

191
00:10:39.692 --> 00:10:43.692
But, just how do you intend to prove your point, famed detective?

192
00:10:57.892 --> 00:10:58.992
"Haraiso Finance"

193
00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.292
A recording of Mr. Gamo's voice?

194
00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.092
A speech to his employees or anything for that matter,

195
00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:05.692
as long as I can hear his voice.

196
00:11:05.692 --> 00:11:08.092
"Reiji Tsuchida (43)" -What about the answer phone at is residence?

197
00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:11.592
This is Gamo. I cannot come to the phone right now.

198
00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:13.892
You know, since he recorded his own voice.

199
00:11:13.892 --> 00:11:15.092
Make the call.

200
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:16.792
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:19.992
"Speaker"

202
00:11:19.992 --> 00:11:22.492
I cannot come to the phone right now.

203
00:11:22.492 --> 00:11:24.992
Please leave your message after the beep.

204
00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.292
I wonder when it was changed.

205
00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:29.592
He erased it.

206
00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:31.192
Someone is beating us over here.

207
00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:32.892
Isn't there anything else?

208
00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:36.292
Well... come to think of it,

209
00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:40.592
there should be a video tape of last year's New Year's party.

210
00:11:41.592 --> 00:11:43.992
-Here it is. -Show it to me.

211
00:11:43.992 --> 00:11:46.992
There are no cameras or video deck here.

212
00:11:46.992 --> 00:11:48.892
-None? -No.

213
00:11:49.992 --> 00:11:52.092
Look for an electric shop or a camera shop.

214
00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:53.192
You go over there.

215
00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.192
Okay.

216
00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:10.592
Pops, I found one over that way!

217
00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.892
Are you okay, pops?

218
00:12:13.892 --> 00:12:15.092
Who the heck...

219
00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:18.092
The tape's gone! It's been stolen!

220
00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:22.392
It could've served as conclusive evidence and yet!

221
00:12:22.392 --> 00:12:25.492
Darn!

222
00:12:25.492 --> 00:12:26.492
Right.

223
00:12:26.492 --> 00:12:28.292
Smiley sweet black bean bun!

224
00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:29.992
Talking about an afternoon snack at a time like this?

225
00:12:29.992 --> 00:12:33.092
No, Mr. Gamo complained, didn't he?

226
00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:35.792
I see.

227
00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:37.892
"Nikoniko Bread Co. Ltd" -We've got to record the conversation

228
00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:39.592
to avoid trouble in the future you see.

229
00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:44.092
Just as I thought.

230
00:12:44.092 --> 00:12:45.492
Bull's eye.

231
00:12:45.492 --> 00:12:47.192
I've figured out the method,

232
00:12:47.192 --> 00:12:49.092
but who the heck is he anyway?

233
00:12:49.092 --> 00:12:51.592
The guy that framed me as well as killed the two.

234
00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:55.992
"Animal Cookies"

235
00:12:56.992 --> 00:12:58.292
It can't be...

236
00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:02.192
"Josai Police Station" -About the case five years ago?

237
00:13:02.192 --> 00:13:04.592
Like I already said a few days ago.

238
00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:07.492
Mr. Sakae Kinugasa was attacked by someone

239
00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:09.192
on his way home.

240
00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:11.592
Fortunately it was not fatal.

241
00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:15.092
The culprit fled on a car that he had waiting for him.

242
00:13:15.092 --> 00:13:18.192
However, there was a woman who just happened to pass by

243
00:13:18.192 --> 00:13:20.192
and saw him being ambushed and attacked.

244
00:13:23.092 --> 00:13:24.592
It's him.

245
00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:26.492
The one who was driving the car

246
00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:30.292
was a man in his mid-thirties with long hair.

247
00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:33.792
Gamo is helping his nephew out giving him living expenses.

248
00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:36.892
His name is Kyosuke Arai, an artist with long hair.

249
00:13:36.892 --> 00:13:38.492
Although he was told that motive

250
00:13:38.492 --> 00:13:40.992
and an eye-witness report were too weak to convict someone,

251
00:13:40.992 --> 00:13:43.992
he ignored what people told him and went ahead and arrested Gamo.

252
00:13:43.992 --> 00:13:45.592
However, a few days later,

253
00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:49.792
people proving Gamo's alibi appeared

254
00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.892
and Takeoka was accused of mistaken arrest.

255
00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:56.592
Although it's true that Takeoka got a bit carried away,

256
00:13:56.592 --> 00:13:57.892
he didn't have to resign his post.

257
00:13:57.892 --> 00:14:00.892
"Police Detective Hisamoto (50)" -The woman who testified

258
00:14:00.892 --> 00:14:02.792
was Takeoka's wife.

259
00:14:07.392 --> 00:14:10.092
"Mouri Detective Agency"

260
00:14:10.092 --> 00:14:11.592
Takeoka?

261
00:14:11.592 --> 00:14:14.492
It's me, you me, Mouri.

262
00:14:14.492 --> 00:14:15.792
Are you drunk?

263
00:14:16.892 --> 00:14:19.392
Totally wasted.

264
00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:23.792
I want to see you tomorrow, is that possible?

265
00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:27.292
Dad so drunk, I wonder if he's okay.

266
00:14:27.292 --> 00:14:30.092
He hasn't drunk at all and yet.

267
00:14:30.092 --> 00:14:34.192
Well, I guess this is a call he can't make unless he acts drunk.

268
00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:52.514
Do you remember this place?

269
00:14:52.514 --> 00:14:54.514
Of course.

270
00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:56.214
In summer ten years ago,

271
00:14:56.214 --> 00:15:01.714
two couples ran into each other.

272
00:15:02.714 --> 00:15:04.114
Takeoka?

273
00:15:04.114 --> 00:15:05.114
Mouri?

274
00:15:05.114 --> 00:15:07.714
Although we went to and were classmates of the same police academy,

275
00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:10.214
we were too embarrassed to talk about our wives,

276
00:15:10.214 --> 00:15:12.514
and never talked about them.

277
00:15:12.514 --> 00:15:15.114
Back then, we first got to talk to each other's wives.

278
00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.614
You got married when you were a student?

279
00:15:17.614 --> 00:15:18.914
Yes, sort of.

280
00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:20.114
We were childhood friends actually,

281
00:15:20.114 --> 00:15:22.014
or rather, ended up stuck with each other.

282
00:15:22.014 --> 00:15:24.014
What do you mean stuck with each other.

283
00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:26.814
We got to know each other in college.

284
00:15:26.814 --> 00:15:28.714
We both belonged to the drama club.

285
00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:30.814
You mean this awkward guy was in the drama club?

286
00:15:30.814 --> 00:15:34.814
Shut up! I used to be pretty keen back then.

287
00:15:37.614 --> 00:15:39.814
It's been ten years already.

288
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:43.014
We were both young back then.

289
00:15:43.014 --> 00:15:45.414
Are you sure the culprit's going to come here?

290
00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:48.414
That's what pops told me.

291
00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.814
Just as I thought, he's having a tough time saying what he wants to.

292
00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:52.514
I guess I'll have to do it, then.

293
00:15:53.914 --> 00:15:56.314
The detective revives.

294
00:15:56.314 --> 00:15:59.014
My prayer's been answered.

295
00:15:59.014 --> 00:16:03.214
I've got to let pops solve this case himself.

296
00:16:05.114 --> 00:16:07.414
About the case we're investigating now...

297
00:16:08.814 --> 00:16:13.114
The culprit, after finding out that Mr. Kinugasa was murdered,

298
00:16:13.114 --> 00:16:14.814
planned everything.

299
00:16:14.814 --> 00:16:17.814
The plan was to kill Mr. Gamo making it look like

300
00:16:17.814 --> 00:16:19.314
he committed suicide,

301
00:16:19.314 --> 00:16:22.314
and setting his nephew, Mr. Arai up as the murderer,

302
00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.314
then killing him off too.

303
00:16:24.314 --> 00:16:26.114
But, if the culprit wanted to make it look like Gamo committed suicide

304
00:16:26.114 --> 00:16:28.914
and set Kyosuke Arai up as the killer,

305
00:16:28.914 --> 00:16:32.014
why did he have to bring Gamo all the way out to a far place

306
00:16:32.014 --> 00:16:34.714
and make it look like suicide?

307
00:16:34.714 --> 00:16:37.314
To set up an alibi.

308
00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:40.114
At 7 pm, the culprit, drives his own car

309
00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:43.914
and takes Mr. Gamo to the scene of the crime and kills him.

310
00:16:43.914 --> 00:16:47.614
He then hides his car in an abandoned warehouse

311
00:16:47.614 --> 00:16:49.314
near the Gamo residence.

312
00:16:49.314 --> 00:16:51.614
Then at 8 pm, the culprit poses as Mr. Gamo

313
00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:53.314
and gives me a call.

314
00:16:53.314 --> 00:16:56.514
He leaves the Gamo residence in Mr. Gamo's car

315
00:16:56.514 --> 00:16:58.914
and hides the car for the time being in the abandoned warehouse.

316
00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:00.314
He spends time with the person he had arrangements to see beforehand

317
00:17:00.314 --> 00:17:03.414
at 8:30 pm and stayed together until after midnight.

318
00:17:03.414 --> 00:17:04.414
After the meeting,

319
00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:07.014
he goes back to the abandoned warehouse to get Mr. Gamo's car

320
00:17:07.014 --> 00:17:09.814
to move it into the woods.

321
00:17:11.514 --> 00:17:14.314
So long as I'm talking to Mr. Gamo at 8 pm,

322
00:17:14.314 --> 00:17:17.914
Mr. Gamo had to have died after 9 pm.

323
00:17:17.914 --> 00:17:21.314
And the culprit also had an alibi during that time

324
00:17:21.314 --> 00:17:23.614
because he was with someone.

325
00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:26.214
In other words, you're saying that the last call you got from Gamo

326
00:17:26.214 --> 00:17:30.814
was the culprit mimicking his tone of voice?

327
00:17:30.814 --> 00:17:32.714
Right.

328
00:17:32.714 --> 00:17:34.414
But dad said he would never mistake

329
00:17:34.414 --> 00:17:36.414
the voice of his client for someone else.

330
00:17:36.414 --> 00:17:37.714
But, Mouri...

331
00:17:37.714 --> 00:17:40.014
Is it possible to deceive the ears of a former police detective

332
00:17:40.014 --> 00:17:41.914
and private detective such as you?

333
00:17:41.914 --> 00:17:45.814
If it was only that one time, I wouldn't have been deceived.

334
00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:50.114
But the culprit had been repeating his trick from a half a month ago,

335
00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:52.614
in order to deceive me.

336
00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.914
From the first time he called.

337
00:17:54.914 --> 00:17:57.414
My name is Ryozo Gamo.

338
00:17:57.414 --> 00:17:59.314
I would like you to find somebody who can testify

339
00:17:59.314 --> 00:18:03.314
that I was at Akebonocho on the day of the crime.

340
00:18:03.314 --> 00:18:07.514
The one who kept calling me every night

341
00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:10.714
asking for results was not the real Gamo.

342
00:18:12.714 --> 00:18:19.014
I never ever met or talked to the real Mr. Gamo on the phone.

343
00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:20.414
Isn't that right?

344
00:18:20.414 --> 00:18:23.314
Drama boy back in your younger days, Takeoka.

345
00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:28.414
Mr. Gamo's characteristic appearance

346
00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:31.514
and voice were most convenient to copy, right?

347
00:18:31.514 --> 00:18:33.614
However, since I've known for quite some time,

348
00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:35.714
there was a risk that I would see through your disguise.

349
00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:38.814
That's why you deliberately came late that night

350
00:18:38.814 --> 00:18:40.314
when you came to see me.

351
00:18:40.314 --> 00:18:41.614
He says to give you his apologies,

352
00:18:41.614 --> 00:18:44.314
but to go ahead and start without him.

353
00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:49.014
You wanted to get me drunk and divert my concentration.

354
00:18:49.014 --> 00:18:50.214
-On top of that... -Mr. Gamo,

355
00:18:50.214 --> 00:18:51.614
I hope to be seeing you again soon.

356
00:18:51.614 --> 00:18:54.014
-Mr. Gamo. -I wouldn't doubt you,

357
00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:55.714
being that you virtually convinced

358
00:18:55.714 --> 00:18:57.614
all those around you of being someone else the way you did.

359
00:18:57.614 --> 00:19:01.314
It's only natural that the request made for finding a witness

360
00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:03.414
to prove alibi didn't go well.

361
00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:05.114
Because after all,

362
00:19:05.114 --> 00:19:07.114
the content of the request was fake to begin with.

363
00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:10.014
In order to keep anybody from getting to you

364
00:19:10.014 --> 00:19:12.114
from the telephone records, you...

365
00:19:12.114 --> 00:19:15.114
It's Gamo. You haven't come up with anything yet?

366
00:19:15.114 --> 00:19:17.514
You waited for Mr. Gamo to take a bath

367
00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:20.414
and called me every night on a cordless phone

368
00:19:20.414 --> 00:19:22.814
or something that you secretly set up.

369
00:19:25.714 --> 00:19:28.014
You've seen through everything.

370
00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:30.714
I guess, I was setting up useless tricks.

371
00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:33.014
Running into you at the horse race tracks

372
00:19:33.014 --> 00:19:35.214
wasn't a coincidence either, was it?

373
00:19:35.214 --> 00:19:36.414
No.

374
00:19:36.414 --> 00:19:38.214
Why?

375
00:19:38.214 --> 00:19:41.014
I'm sorry that I used you.

376
00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.414
Why'd you kill the two?

377
00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:44.414
Now, after five years have gone by!

378
00:19:49.214 --> 00:19:53.214
My wife... she died last month.

379
00:19:54.714 --> 00:19:58.214
After suffering with an illness for two years.

380
00:19:58.214 --> 00:20:05.514
She apologized to me just before she passed away.

381
00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:07.014
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:07.014 --> 00:20:08.614
About what?

383
00:20:10.314 --> 00:20:12.214
About five years ago.

384
00:20:16.314 --> 00:20:17.914
I was surprised

385
00:20:17.914 --> 00:20:20.914
that she had been regretting it all along

386
00:20:20.914 --> 00:20:26.014
that her testimony cornered me into resignation.

387
00:20:27.914 --> 00:20:31.814
But, I kept on believing her testimony.

388
00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:33.414
I kept thinking that the witness for Gamo's alibi

389
00:20:33.414 --> 00:20:36.014
was just somebody that he had paid off to testify.

390
00:20:36.014 --> 00:20:39.214
And the day after her funeral,

391
00:20:39.214 --> 00:20:42.014
after finding that Sakae Kinugasa was murdered,

392
00:20:42.014 --> 00:20:44.314
I called Gamo.

393
00:20:45.214 --> 00:20:47.114
Wasn't it you?

394
00:20:47.114 --> 00:20:49.614
Just like you attacked the victim in the dark five years ago.

395
00:20:49.614 --> 00:20:52.314
This time it's wasn't me.

396
00:20:53.814 --> 00:20:57.014
I guess this is what you call the slip of the tongue.

397
00:20:57.014 --> 00:20:58.814
His said, "This time it's wasn't me".

398
00:20:58.814 --> 00:21:01.114
In other words, he did commit the previous crime.

399
00:21:02.114 --> 00:21:04.814
Natsuko's testimony was true.

400
00:21:07.014 --> 00:21:08.614
She spoke the truth,

401
00:21:08.614 --> 00:21:10.014
but I refused to believe her

402
00:21:10.014 --> 00:21:12.614
and she died apologizing to me.

403
00:21:12.614 --> 00:21:15.914
All I wanted to do was clear her feelings of grief.

404
00:21:18.514 --> 00:21:22.114
Mouri, make up with Eri.

405
00:21:23.114 --> 00:21:26.214
Don't be silly, blurting something like that out.

406
00:21:26.214 --> 00:21:27.414
Takeoka!

407
00:21:28.714 --> 00:21:30.214
Mr. Takeoka!

408
00:21:30.214 --> 00:21:32.214
Takeoka!

409
00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.914
Takeoka!

410
00:21:35.914 --> 00:21:37.114
Where are you?

411
00:21:37.114 --> 00:21:38.914
-Takeoka! -There he is!

412
00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:39.914
What?

413
00:21:41.414 --> 00:21:42.714
It can't be...

414
00:21:42.714 --> 00:21:43.914
Hold it!

415
00:21:45.614 --> 00:21:46.714
No way!

416
00:21:52.314 --> 00:21:55.714
You're not dying on me.

417
00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:59.414
Live! You're making up for what you did!

418
00:21:59.414 --> 00:22:03.214
I'm not letting you die on me, Takeoka!

419
00:22:03.214 --> 00:22:04.314
Mouri!

420
00:22:06.514 --> 00:22:07.814
Mr. Takeoka!

421
00:22:09.614 --> 00:22:11.114
Mouri.

422
00:22:11.114 --> 00:22:12.614
Takeoka.

423
00:23:35.014 --> 00:23:38.014
Dad, you don't have to put the sign down for real.

424
00:23:38.014 --> 00:23:39.414
Pops.

425
00:23:39.414 --> 00:23:41.814
I always keep my word.

426
00:23:45.514 --> 00:23:48.114
A new one sure is good after all.

427
00:23:48.114 --> 00:23:50.114
You're not quitting being a detective?

428
00:23:50.114 --> 00:23:52.614
I never said anything like that.

429
00:23:53.614 --> 00:23:56.414
True, you only said was that you were going to bring the sign down.

430
00:23:56.414 --> 00:23:59.014
Being a detective is a lonesome job

431
00:23:59.014 --> 00:24:00.714
very usually misunderstood by others.

432
00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:11.314
What's wrong with you? From a while ago.

433
00:24:11.314 --> 00:24:13.014
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish"

434
00:24:13.014 --> 00:24:16.014
Mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish?

435
00:24:20.214 --> 00:24:21.514
Lipstick.

436
00:24:21.514 --> 00:24:25.014
Somebody for some reason switched the regulator.

437
00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:28.414
By the killer who came back here again.

438
00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:29.814
Next Conan,

439
00:24:29.814 --> 00:24:33.596
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 1)"

440
00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:51.483
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:51.483 --> 00:24:53.283
"Fish names".

442
00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:55.183
Eels, eels over rice, eel cookies,

443
00:24:55.183 --> 00:24:56.683
grilled eels, eel porridge, and eel soup.

444
00:24:56.683 --> 00:24:58.383
They're all different types of eel dishes.
