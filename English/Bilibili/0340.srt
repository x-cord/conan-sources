1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,240
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,340
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,140
Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,340
leaves the secret of the organization somewhere.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,668
"The Hidden Secret in the Toilet (Part 1)"

9
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:10,768
Do you know?

10
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:11,768
What?

11
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,268
If you put those on,

12
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,168
nobody will ever guess your identity.

13
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:21,868
You fool!

14
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,568
Don't run, Ai.

15
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,368
Don't run from destiny!

16
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,268
Besides, I gave her my word

17
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:46,468
that I would look after her if she gets into trouble.

18
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:49,368
Because she's not as tough as she looks.

19
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,868
There's medicine.

20
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,668
It seems like a doctor examined me.

21
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,268
But I don't remember that.

22
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:09,268
The only thing I remember

23
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,368
is that Doc carried me

24
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:13,968
and we left the department store.

25
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:18,668
If I remember correctly,

26
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:19,968
after that I...

27
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,368
How stupid of me.

28
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:38,868
If they had found me, I would be in no circumstance

29
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,068
to be dreaming something like that.

30
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,368
Dr. Agasa wouldn't be dozing off like that...

31
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,468
Doc?

32
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,368
Doc!

33
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:15,968
Hey, Ai.

34
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,368
So, you're up?

35
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,668
Tomato juice...

36
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,468
Tell Doc

37
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:49,168
not to drink canned tomato juice while surfing the Internet.

38
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,568
He always falls asleep part way and spills it.

39
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:56,368
By the way, why are you here?

40
00:04:56,368 --> 00:05:00,068
I had this bad feeling, so I came to check on you.

41
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:03,268
I told Ran that I would help Doc take care of you.

42
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,768
Well, it seems it wasn't worth the worry,

43
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,868
so you can go back to sleep.

44
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,568
Sorry to keep you waiting.

45
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,868
Your rice porridge is ready!

46
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:19,168
It's not as good as the one at Tamaga-tei, but...

47
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:22,268
She went to sleep?

48
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:23,568
That's strange.

49
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:25,868
I thought she was up just a minute ago.

50
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,968
Okay, then. I'll leave this here.

51
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:34,368
After Ai eats this, tell her to let me know how it tastes.

52
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,768
See you. I've got to go and see Sonoko.

53
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,468
Go out the same way you came in.

54
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:42,768
Go through the basement

55
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,668
and then through the back door, right?

56
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,968
You'd better hurry and get the front door fixed, Doc.

57
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,068
Yeah.

58
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,268
Bye, Conan.

59
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,268
Thank you, Ran!

60
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,268
What's with you?

61
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,668
You're really good at fake crying,

62
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,668
but you're the pits when it comes to faking being asleep.

63
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:05,968
What is wrong with you?

64
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,268
She came all the way here to make rice porridge for you

65
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,768
and you ignored her completely!

66
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:13,268
I didn't ask her to do it for me.

67
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,768
I understand you don't care much for people like Ran

68
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:18,768
who like to take care of other people, but still...

69
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,668
She did make it for you,

70
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:23,168
so eat it before it gets cold.

71
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,768
You don't understand anything, do you?

72
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:34,168
Well, it's not that I want you to know either.

73
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:42,468
Anyway, we're lucky that the weekend has arrived.

74
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,968
Yeah. We can't let Ai go walking around

75
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:48,968
when weird guys are sniffing around.

76
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:54,568
It's hot.

77
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:05,668
It seems like Ai's recovering from her cold too.

78
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:10,568
At this rate, we may be able to go visit

79
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:14,868
Ai's father, Dr. Miyano's friend next week.

80
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:19,068
Hey. What is that about?

81
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,968
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

82
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:26,168
I asked my doctor acquaintances about Dr. Miyano

83
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:28,968
and found out that he had a childhood designer friend

84
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,268
who was with him together

85
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:33,368
in elementary, intermediate and high school.

86
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:37,168
Apparently, this designer helped him bind a book

87
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:40,768
that he had privately published.

88
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:41,968
Although the book didn't sell well,

89
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,868
the design was innovative

90
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:47,068
and was reputed highly among the other doctors too.

91
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:51,568
If we see that person, we may be able to find out something

92
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,268
about the men in black you're looking for

93
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,768
and about Ai's parents too.

94
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:02,168
My father and mother...

95
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:12,268
You're not well at all!

96
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:14,868
We don't need to go today, do we?

97
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:18,968
We don't know where they're looking out for us, you know.

98
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:23,068
Aren't you the one who wants to go?

99
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:26,468
Well, it's true that I'd like to see him

100
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:27,868
to find out about those guys, but...

101
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:30,268
Then, stop blabbering.

102
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,968
Well, it's true that I'm worried,

103
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:36,368
but we're fine right now.

104
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:39,968
I'm sure they haven't grasped anything on us yet.

105
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:42,768
Yeah, I guess so.

106
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:45,168
If my deduction's correct...

107
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,368
we should all be in the world beyond by now.

108
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,068
"Dejima's Design Office"

109
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:55,968
Yes. It's true that Atsushi Miyano and I

110
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,468
were childhood friends.

111
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:01,968
But unfortunately, I haven't seen him for the past 30 years.

112
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,068
The last time I saw him

113
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,268
"Souhei Dejima (54)" -was when he rented this house

114
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:08,968
"President of Design Office" -that he inherited from his parents to me.

115
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:10,668
Does that mean...

116
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,868
this house belongs to Dr. Miyano?

117
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:17,768
Yes. I wanted a design office,

118
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:20,568
so he said that he'd rent it to me

119
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:22,568
since he'd be leaving his house empty for a while.

120
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,268
I see.

121
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:27,568
I've been renting this house ever since for 30 years.

122
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,668
This is where father was born and raised.

123
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:35,568
Then, where did Dr. Miyano live after lending this house to you?

124
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:37,068
Beats me.

125
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:39,268
He said that he was going to a large research laboratory

126
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:42,568
of a sponsor that approved of his theory.

127
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:45,368
But I have no idea where that is.

128
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,468
-It's those guys. -Yes.

129
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:48,668
Most probably.

130
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:53,468
And? Did you not hear from Dr. Miyano after that?

131
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,068
No, I only received a postcard

132
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,068
saying that he got married.

133
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:01,768
That person came once when you were out, President Dejima.

134
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,068
-What? -Remember?

135
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,668
"Ukihiko Zaitsu (41)" -You would go out for walks

136
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:08,468
"Designer" -when you couldn't think of design ideas

137
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,968
and would stay out for quite some time.

138
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:13,568
He happened to come by just at that time.

139
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:16,068
He came along with a pretty foreign wife

140
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,168
and a cute, little girl who was about four or five years old.

141
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,968
He seemed to want to talk to you about something important

142
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:25,468
and he ended up spending the night here, then left.

143
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:28,968
I told him that you might be back soon, but...

144
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,568
Didn't I tell you about it?

145
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,468
No!

146
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:36,468
By the way, his wife's name was Elena.

147
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:39,368
I think his daughter's name was Akemi.

148
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:40,668
My older sister...

149
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,368
Something seemed odd about them, right?

150
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:48,868
"Tetsuo Imai (52), Designer" -Yeah.

151
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:52,468
His daughter's mischief was really hard to handle.

152
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:56,368
She hid our tools all over the place.

153
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:59,868
She saw how troubled we were and seemed to enjoy it.

154
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,668
His wife remained quiet all the while,

155
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,968
so we thought she couldn't understand Japanese,

156
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:08,168
but later, she spoke in Japanese with her daughter.

157
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,868
Meanwhile, Dr. Miyano kept looking out the window

158
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,068
and seemed to be concerned about something.

159
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,468
Come to think of it,

160
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:16,468
a car was parked for some time outside this house.

161
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,868
It was a black car with smoked glass.

162
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,268
They were being watched.

163
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:24,268
Hey, when was that exactly?

164
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,768
It was just after we reformed the old house

165
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:30,368
into an office, so...

166
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:33,168
I think it was about 20 years ago.

167
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:37,568
Did Dr. Miyano say anything to you before he left?

168
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,168
No.

169
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,268
Nothing that I remember.

170
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:45,168
By the way, what's your relationship with Dr. Miyano?

171
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:48,268
Oh, well. We're both doctors...

172
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:51,168
He's going to finally get married at his age!

173
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,668
But he didn't have the doctor's address,

174
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:57,068
so he came to ask you for it!

175
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,568
-Right? -Yeah...

176
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:07,268
I'll go buy lunch pretty soon.

177
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,368
Okay, get me a hamburger then.

178
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:12,468
"Isamu Natsuhori (35)" -You want the usual teriyaki and fish

179
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:14,168
"Designer" -with medium-sized french fries

180
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,368
and corn soup, right?

181
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,568
What else?

182
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,968
I'll have the same food as the president.

183
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:20,168
I'll have the same,

184
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:23,068
but add an apple pie and two large-sized coke.

185
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,668
You always drink too much.

186
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:27,068
That's why you have to go to the toilet so many times.

187
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:29,468
Sorry, I'm so much like a kid.

188
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:33,668
Imai, will you please get coffee for the guests too?

189
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,068
Yes, sir.

190
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:37,468
So, I don't know Dr. Miyano's address either.

191
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,668
I don't want to be rude,

192
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,368
but since we have work to do, after you drink your coffee...

193
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,868
Yes, of course.

194
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:47,068
Akemi dropped by some time ago.

195
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,768
She did?

196
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:53,668
Why...

197
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,348
Do you remember the girl?

198
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,048
The cute girl who came to use the toilet.

199
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,148
She greeted us saying, "Long time no see",

200
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:10,348
and we were surprised by that.

201
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:12,748
Was she Dr. Miyano's daughter?

202
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,248
What? Didn't I tell you?

203
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,348
I said, you didn't tell me!

204
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:19,648
Sorry!

205
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:25,948
Did that woman really come just to use the toilet?

206
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:29,548
Yeah. But she did say something strange.

207
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,348
She said she was embarrassed that she came to use the toilet,

208
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,848
so she mentioned not to tell anybody about it.

209
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,748
I wonder who she wanted to keep it a secret from.

210
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:51,948
Hey, wait.

211
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:56,948
There.

212
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:01,348
You're both going in together?

213
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,548
There's no doubt about it.

214
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,948
Akemi definitely hid something here.

215
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,448
Yeah, it's somewhere in this toilet.

216
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:16,748
But even if she hid something in a small toilet like this...

217
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:20,548
I'm sure that someone would've found it already.

218
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,448
Yeah. It's very likely.

219
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,448
But still...

220
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:30,948
we might just discover something.

221
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:33,648
Clues that will shed light on who those guys are.

222
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:37,248
Hey!

223
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,748
Hurry!

224
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,748
Will you please hurry up?

225
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:53,148
I guess we'll search again later.

226
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,248
Yes.

227
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:57,348
Thanks for waiting!

228
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:59,848
Do you kids want to have some too?

229
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,748
No, thanks.

230
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:04,148
Hey, did anything strange happen

231
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,148
after that woman came?

232
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:08,848
Yeah. A burglar broke in.

233
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:11,048
And it happened twice.

234
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,448
A burglary?

235
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:15,148
Nothing was stolen though.

236
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,348
Is your stomach okay?

237
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:19,948
Yeah, it's getting better somehow.

238
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:23,148
The problem's the other thing though.

239
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,848
After that woman came...

240
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,548
for some strange reason...

241
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:31,948
For some strange reason?

242
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,348
President...

243
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,148
President...

244
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:02,048
Was he poisoned to death?

245
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,148
Yes.

246
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:06,648
The victim is Mr. Souhei Dejima, 54 years old,

247
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,948
the president of this design office.

248
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,548
He seems to have been eating his burger for lunch

249
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:14,248
together with the other three employees there,

250
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:17,148
when he suddenly started suffering and collapsed.

251
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:20,848
And who bought the hamburger?

252
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,648
I did.

253
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,748
Which means you had the most probable chance

254
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,648
of poisoning the hamburger.

255
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:30,148
Wait... wait a minute!

256
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:33,148
The president picked the hamburger on his own.

257
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,748
Besides, he picked up

258
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:37,248
the teriyaki burger that everyone else also ordered.

259
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,648
I couldn't have poisoned the hamburger

260
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,748
because I had no idea who would pick up the hamburger he did!

261
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:44,148
Is that so?

262
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,648
Right.

263
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:49,448
It could be that the poison was on something

264
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:51,648
that President Dejima always used.

265
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,448
Where is his desk?

266
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:55,448
Here.

267
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,748
Whose seat is this next to him?

268
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:59,648
Mr. Imai's.

269
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:01,848
Then, he would've been able to use the poison

270
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:04,448
without being noticed.

271
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:07,648
That may be my seat, but...

272
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,448
Before eating the hamburger,

273
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,348
the president had eaten some cookies as well.

274
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:16,548
See that empty cookie packaging

275
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:19,348
next to the coffee cup on his desk?

276
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:22,548
I brought that from the kitchen.

277
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,248
Since he asked me to bring coffee for everyone,

278
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:26,948
I brought his coffee for him too.

279
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,148
I see.

280
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,848
If the poison was on something that the president used,

281
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:35,248
are you saying that he would've died when he ate the cookies?

282
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:37,648
What's this medicine?

283
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:38,948
It's medicine for constipation.

284
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:40,648
The president had a bad case of haemorrhoids

285
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:42,048
and used to drink it all the time.

286
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:43,448
I see.

287
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,048
However, he would over drink it at times

288
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,748
and get a bad case of the runs.

289
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:49,548
Yes, especially recently.

290
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:53,148
Yeah, he went to the toilet just before eating the hamburger too.

291
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,348
He had a stomachache and ran to the toilet.

292
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,748
The toilet?

293
00:17:56,748 --> 00:18:00,648
Did anyone go into the toilet before the president did?

294
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:05,448
Well, I went in before I went to buy lunch.

295
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,048
I went in after him.

296
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:10,248
And after me, Mr. Zaitsu.

297
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,948
Then, after that the president went in,

298
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:15,648
came out and ate the hamburger?

299
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:17,148
Yes.

300
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:18,948
In other words, if you had put poison

301
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,248
somewhere around the toilet...

302
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:23,148
You must be kidding!

303
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:26,448
It's true that I went into the toilet before the president,

304
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:28,848
but it wasn't right before he went in.

305
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:33,548
Before the president went in, these children went in

306
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:35,348
right after me.

307
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:39,448
Conan?

308
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:42,848
And Ai and Dr. Agasa too?

309
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:46,448
Oh, well, we just happened to come by

310
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,548
because we had some business with Mr. Dejima.

311
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:51,848
You people sure get mixed up in all kinds of cases, don't you?

312
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:54,948
You're starting to look like Mr. Mouri.

313
00:18:56,948 --> 00:19:00,148
So? Which one of you went in first?

314
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:01,148
We went in together.

315
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:04,548
What? You used the toilet together?

316
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,948
Well, I dropped my loose change somewhere.

317
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,648
I thought maybe it slipped through the space under the door

318
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:13,148
and rolled into the toilet,

319
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,048
so we looked for it together, right?

320
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:16,048
Yes.

321
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:20,548
We looked for the thing that Akemi hid from the eyes

322
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:22,048
of the guys of the organization.

323
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:26,248
If so, where could the poison be?

324
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,148
Then, why not check all the way

325
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:31,248
from the work place to the toilet?

326
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:32,548
From the work place...

327
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,848
To the toilet?

328
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:37,148
After eating the cookies, the president went to the toilet,

329
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,048
went back to the work place, and ate the hamburger.

330
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:40,948
Then, he collapsed, didn't he?

331
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,748
This means that the poison

332
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,648
may still be somewhere around here!

333
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,148
Because from the time the president collapsed

334
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:48,248
to the time you came here,

335
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:50,448
nobody left the work place, took anything out,

336
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:53,648
threw away or wiped anything.

337
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:56,848
I see. Let's start checking anyway.

338
00:19:56,848 --> 00:20:00,048
Yes, let's do that and check everyone's body.

339
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,848
What? There's no poison reaction anywhere?

340
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,848
No. Nothing was found from the toilet, corridor,

341
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:16,348
work place and everywhere else that the victim could've touched.

342
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,948
But the strange thing is,

343
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,948
there was a reaction by the right side of the victim's slacks

344
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:23,348
and the place where the belt holes are.

345
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:27,348
The same goes for the victim's left fingertips, his handkerchief,

346
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:30,048
and the wrapper of the hamburger he was eating.

347
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:32,048
But it was a very small amount,

348
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,448
and it seemed that the victim

349
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,948
touched the wrapper with his poisoned hand.

350
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:39,248
But why was there poison only on his left hand?

351
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,748
I get it! The handle of the coffee cup!

352
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,448
If the poison was put on the handle,

353
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:46,848
he would eat the cookie with his right hand

354
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:50,548
and poison would go on his left hand when he drinks the coffee.

355
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,348
If so, even if he went to the toilet after that,

356
00:20:53,348 --> 00:20:55,448
if he opened and closed the door with his right hand,

357
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:58,548
there would be no poison reaction in the toilet.

358
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,548
In other words, the killer is

359
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,448
the one who brought him the coffee.

360
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:06,648
It's you, Mr. Imai!

361
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,548
No, Inspector!

362
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,448
We of course checked

363
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:15,448
the handle of the coffee cup and the cookie bag,

364
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,648
but there was no poison reaction.

365
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,348
Oh, is that so?

366
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:23,848
Besides, the lever to flush the toilet is on the left side.

367
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:25,048
If the poison was on his left hand

368
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,548
before he went into the toilet,

369
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:29,448
when he pulled his slacks up and down,

370
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:31,948
the poison would most likely be on the left side of his slacks.

371
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:34,148
So, why was there poison on the right side of his slacks?

372
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:35,148
I have no idea.

373
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:38,648
Did the president have some kind of habit?

374
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,448
Was he left-handed?

375
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,748
The only characteristic I can think of

376
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:46,048
was that he was very neat and loved coffee.

377
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,348
He was neat and loved coffee?

378
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,648
He always wiped his hands first

379
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:52,248
with wet tissue before he sat at his desk.

380
00:21:52,248 --> 00:21:53,748
It took me 10 years

381
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:57,548
before I succeeded in making coffee the way the president liked.

382
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:01,248
Did you see any suspicious people watching this house?

383
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:04,048
No. We were burglarized twice.

384
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:05,748
But nothing happened after that.

385
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:07,148
Burglarized?

386
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:10,348
Yes. The burglar broke in through the window.

387
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:13,648
Ai, don't tell me that the burglary is...

388
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:14,648
Yes.

389
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:17,248
It sure is similar

390
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,648
to the way those guys get rid of their target.

391
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,748
They leave no evidence

392
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:25,148
and vanish like the fog.

393
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:54,448
"Next Episode" -The burglary that happened

394
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:57,848
after my older sister visited here was most likely done by those people.

395
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,148
Yeah.

396
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:02,448
They probably guessed that she may have hidden something here

397
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:03,848
and came to look for it.

398
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,648
No, don't!

399
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:13,548
It's something you don't need to know about!

400
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:17,248
If you delve any deeper, you'll really...

401
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,848
Next Conan,

402
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:21,948
"The Hidden Secret in the Toilet (Part 2)"

403
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:25,816
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:28,016
"Toilet equipment"

405
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:29,916
A shocking message is left for Ai in the next episode.

406
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,516
-How shocking is it? -Shocking enough to make you cry.
