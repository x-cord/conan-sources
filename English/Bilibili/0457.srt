1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,599
Dazzling!

2
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:04,699
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,299
A big fuss is made over a handkerchief at a drama location site.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,099
An incident dyes even the maple leaves red.

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,699
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,599
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,999
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:16,685
Conan, be careful.

9
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:20,085
Don't carry yourself overboard.

10
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:25,185
-Okay. -Hey, glasses kid!

11
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:26,285
How is it?

12
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:30,585
Shut up. I don't see it.

13
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,285
Are you sure it's this tree?

14
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,885
-I wonder if he's going to be okay. -You're right!

15
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:38,885
I wonder if the glasses kid is really going to be able to find it?

16
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,985
That's not what I meant.

17
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:46,585
Hey. Is it really here or what?

18
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:48,685
How about it, Conan?

19
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:51,085
Did you find Sonoko's handkerchief?

20
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:53,185
It's red! Red, okay?

21
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:55,185
It's a precious red handkerchief!

22
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:57,485
So, look really good, okay?

23
00:02:57,485 --> 00:03:00,885
Why didn't you hang on to it and not let it go?

24
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:03,985
But I don't see it anywhere at all.

25
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,285
That's strange.

26
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,185
It looked like the handkerchief

27
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:20,685
was blown away by the wind and got stuck on that tree.

28
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:24,585
What? Did you find it?

29
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,685
Yes.

30
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,285
Well, I did find it but...

31
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,285
A handkerchief that was blown away by the wind

32
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:37,485
would never tie onto a branch on its own.

33
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:40,385
Hey! Did you find it or not?

34
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,385
Come on and tell me!

35
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:44,885
-Sonoko... -Hey, glasses kid!

36
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,385
-could that thing you're stepping on be? -Are you listening?

37
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,985
What?

38
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,585
Stepping on what?

39
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,185
Oh, no...

40
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,185
Ran...

41
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:02,985
Sonoko.

42
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:07,385
I guess I found it.

43
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:12,185
Conan!

44
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,385
Conan Edogawa!

45
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,285
Well...

46
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:17,985
Conan!

47
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:25,285
"Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 1)"

48
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:28,385
Hey.

49
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:30,585
Hey, are you listening?

50
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:33,785
Sonoko.

51
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:38,185
Isn't it about time for you tell me?

52
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:42,285
Why you suddenly wanted to come visit this scarlet maple leaves?

53
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,485
-Hey. -Yeah, that's true.

54
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,585
Oh, see this red handkerchief?

55
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:51,485
You can't tell even by looking at this handkerchief?

56
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,585
Handkerchief?

57
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,385
Red?

58
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:57,285
No, not at all.

59
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:01,885
Then you must at least know the title, don't you, Ran?

60
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,185
The title?

61
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,485
"Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

62
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:08,285
It's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

63
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:11,085
Oh! That's the super lovey-dovey drama

64
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,685
that was really popular last year, isn't it?

65
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,985
Right...

66
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,185
Don't tell me you weren't watching it.

67
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,185
You like that kind of drama too, don't you?

68
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,485
Yeah...

69
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,685
But Yoko Okino's program was on at the same time

70
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:31,085
and dad was watching it while recording her program so...

71
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:35,885
He's still head over heels over Yoko Okino.

72
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:39,285
What does that drama have to do

73
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,585
with the red handkerchief though?

74
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:46,385
Well, I don't think brats can understand even if I told you about it,

75
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:49,585
but I, Sonoko, will go out of my way and explain it to you.

76
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:50,785
Hey...

77
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:56,185
It's about a rich family's daughter and a young military officer.

78
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:59,685
It's a love and romance story!

79
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:03,285
They first meet because the military officer takes the handkerchief

80
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:05,585
from a red maple tree for her.

81
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:07,385
Some time later, they fall in love with each other.

82
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:14,485
However, a bad superior officer who envies their relationship

83
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:17,385
frames the young military officer for something

84
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:19,485
he had no recollection of doing.

85
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,285
He ends up becoming a fugitive whose whereabouts become unknown.

86
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:25,885
Just about when the war is about to end,

87
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,985
the young lady receives a telegram from him.

88
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,585
It said, "I will wait for you on New Year's day morning

89
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:35,185
under the maple tree covered with red leaves."

90
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:39,385
But New Year's day morning?

91
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:41,685
The maple leaves all wither away in winter.

92
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,985
Right.

93
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,385
All the rich young lady could figure out was

94
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,085
that he meant the mountain they first met

95
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:49,285
where there were maple trees covered with red leaves.

96
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,285
She had no idea as to where it actually was,

97
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,985
so she walked through the snowy mountain

98
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,785
looking for him all by herself.

99
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,085
But, of course, all there was in the mountain

100
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,085
were trees with leaves that had withered away.

101
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,685
Viewing red leaves of maple trees in winter

102
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:05,085
is an impossible thing to do.

103
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:07,585
She thought that "this meant we can never meet again,

104
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,685
so please don't wait for me."

105
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:11,985
But, just as she was ready to give up and go.

106
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:13,585
A certain scene strikes her eyes!

107
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,385
In the snowy white landscape of winter,

108
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,785
a red handkerchief is tied onto a branch of a tree

109
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,385
with leaves that had withered away.

110
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,785
This bright red handkerchief!

111
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:30,485
And they finally reunite under that tree.

112
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:33,185
They elope...

113
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,485
and the story ends happily ever after.

114
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,385
Oh, how nice!

115
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:42,385
That young military officer is strong, tanned

116
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:45,485
and has a simple and honest manner of speaking. He's so awesome!

117
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,285
You mean like Kyogoku?

118
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,685
Right! Exactly!

119
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:53,285
I watched the DVD again the other day and got hooked on it!

120
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,685
The love story of a rich young lady

121
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:58,085
and a strong and tanned young military officer.

122
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:01,785
It's just like me and Makoto, don't you think?

123
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:08,485
That's why I came to this mountain where the drama was filmed.

124
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:09,585
See!

125
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:12,485
I came to tie my red handkerchief onto the branch of a tree!

126
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:16,485
I see, so that you get to see Kyogoku!

127
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:19,185
But won't you get scolded for tying it on without permission?

128
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:20,485
Don't worry!

129
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:23,885
No one will notice just one handkerchief on the branch of a tree!

130
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:26,485
No, I think someone will notice.

131
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,285
-What? -How do you know, glasses kid?

132
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:30,385
Just how...

133
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,985
Hey!

134
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,085
What's that?

135
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,285
It's full of red handkerchiefs!

136
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,485
Sonoko.

137
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:48,985
Could this be the place that was used for filming the scene in the drama?

138
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:52,585
Yes. The young military officer was waiting here

139
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,485
with his back leaning against a large rock.

140
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,585
So I think so.

141
00:08:56,585 --> 00:09:01,685
In other words, a lot of other people felt the same way.

142
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,185
What shall I do, Ran?

143
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:08,385
-I already e-mailed Makoto about it! -What?

144
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:09,685
I wrote, "I'll be waiting for you under a maple tree

145
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,685
with red leaves on the eve of eve."

146
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,885
What shall I do?

147
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,985
Sonoko, you're really something.

148
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:19,685
You actually send e-mails with such implications.

149
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,185
But I'm sure you'll get to see him!

150
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,485
I mean, there are so many handkerchiefs tied on here so...

151
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,285
I'm sure that if you wait around here, he'll come and meet you.

152
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,785
Sonoko?

153
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:31,585
It doesn't mean a thing if he doesn't come under my handkerchief!

154
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:34,785
Come to think of it, I found one too.

155
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:35,785
Found what?

156
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,085
A red handkerchief was tied to the branch of the tree

157
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:40,885
that I climbed on just a while ago.

158
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,385
No way!

159
00:09:42,385 --> 00:09:45,385
That place is quite some distance from here!

160
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,885
What if handkerchiefs are tied onto the branches of

161
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:50,185
every maple tree in this area?

162
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:52,685
Where is Makoto...

163
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:55,985
Where is Makoto supposed to wait for me?

164
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:58,685
Even before you worry about something like that,

165
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,885
I wonder if that martial arts freak would know anything

166
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:03,885
about where the "Red Maple Tree in Winter" was filmed.

167
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:09,185
Okay, then as a last resort...

168
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:11,685
Here, glasses kid, wait here.

169
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,085
Oh, okay.

170
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,285
-Ran! Come help me. -What?

171
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:18,285
We're going to remove all the red handkerchiefs on this mountain!

172
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,385
What?

173
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,185
Hey, Sonoko.

174
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:25,085
The fate of Makoto and I depends on this!

175
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,385
Sonoko...

176
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,585
Is she okay or what?

177
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:30,885
Makoto...

178
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,885
Sonoko, look out.

179
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:37,085
Sonoko...

180
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,585
I'm sorry

181
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:41,185
that it turned out like this just because of me.

182
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,285
-Oh? -What?

183
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:44,985
You're removing all those handkerchiefs

184
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:45,985
because they'll get in the way of

185
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,985
viewing the red leaves of the maple trees, right?

186
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:51,285
Yes, sort of.

187
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,185
What did you mean when you said just because of you?

188
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:00,385
Aren't you the one who wrote the original "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"?

189
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:02,085
I'm a great fan of yours!

190
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:05,185
Oh, no, I'm just a staff working on that drama.

191
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:07,185
An AD (Assistant Director).

192
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,285
You're not the original writer?

193
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,385
I'm sorry, I disappointed you.

194
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:15,485
No, you didn't disappoint me or anything, right, Ran?

195
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:16,885
Oh, of course not.

196
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,085
But I'm the one who introduced this mountain to the playwright

197
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:22,685
who asked me if I knew of any beautiful mountain

198
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:26,085
that could be used for the drama.

199
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,785
This is my hometown

200
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,585
and I used to play on this mountain a lot in my childhood.

201
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:33,885
And while we were looking for a place to film the drama,

202
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,185
I found a red handkerchief tied to the branch of

203
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:37,785
a maple tree covered with red leaves.

204
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:40,385
When I told the playwright about this,

205
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:44,285
he said that he could use the story and rewrote the script.

206
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,785
-What? -Is that right?

207
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:49,385
Then it became so popular

208
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:51,185
that I was scolded by the owner of the mountain

209
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:54,485
who said that people began camping here without permission

210
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,185
or tying red handkerchiefs on the branches of the trees.

211
00:11:57,185 --> 00:12:01,485
He shouted, "Thanks to you, my mountain is full of handkerchiefs!"

212
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:05,085
Gosh.

213
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,485
You were too, Sonoko.

214
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:08,085
Well, on the other hand,

215
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:11,285
the store owners of the shopping arcade and hotels are happy

216
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:13,485
because customers have increased.

217
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,385
People hardly ever come here

218
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:18,185
other than the season when the leaves change color.

219
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:20,785
That's why all the calls that are made to the town offices

220
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,385
regarding this are referred to me,

221
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:24,885
so talk about tough.

222
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:27,885
I get calls like, "Where's that mountain?"

223
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,585
or "Please take me to the place the last scene was filmed."

224
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,585
Even today, I got a call from a fan

225
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,185
saying that he'll pay me, so to tell him

226
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:38,085
where the original tree with the handkerchief was tied on is.

227
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,985
So, I was going around looking for that tree since this morning

228
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,685
and I'm pooped.

229
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:43,385
I feel sorry for you.

230
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,485
You can say that again.

231
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:46,085
Oh, that's right.

232
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,285
Will you relay a message for me?

233
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,385
-What? -What?

234
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:53,585
I forgot the phone number of that fan.

235
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:54,585
And all I want you to do is write,

236
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:57,285
"I found the tree you were looking for,

237
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:59,485
so please come to the place

238
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:01,185
where the rock that was used in the last scene is"

239
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,485
on the message book that is placed at the lobby of Akagi Inn

240
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:05,585
right in front of the station.

241
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:10,185
I was supposed to meet that fan today at the inn

242
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:12,785
but I don't think I want to go all the way down

243
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:15,185
and come all the way back up again just to guide that person over.

244
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,785
I figure it's too tough on me.

245
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:23,085
Oh, then I think we should put your name on that message.

246
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,485
Oh, I see.

247
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,785
My name is...

248
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:28,785
"Hozumi."

249
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:31,385
If you write my name in katakana,

250
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,185
I'm sure the person will know who I am!

251
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:34,885
Are you sure writing it in katakana is enough?

252
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:38,785
Yeah, because I only talked to the person over the phone.

253
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,585
But that person said that he's a great fan of that drama

254
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:45,085
and had been here many times.

255
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,685
He also sent me an e-mail this morning

256
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,685
saying that he checked in to the inn this morning

257
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,185
and will be looking forward to hearing from me,

258
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,485
so I'm sure you won't have trouble finding him.

259
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:54,585
I already told him that if something comes up,

260
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,685
I'll write it in on the notebook too.

261
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,585
I'm sorry and thanks.

262
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,785
-Oh, okay. -Oh, okay.

263
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:09,485
"Akagi Inn"

264
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,985
Let's see.

265
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:15,285
"I found the tree that you were looking for."

266
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,585
"Please come to the place

267
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:21,485
where the rock that was used in the last scene is."

268
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,985
"Hozumi."

269
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:26,885
I guess this'll do.

270
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:29,485
Yes, I think that's good.

271
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,585
Okay, Sonoko, let's go have something to eat.

272
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:34,385
-What? -I'm starved.

273
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,585
I guess so.

274
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,785
-Conan, let's go. -Okay!

275
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,485
Oh? You're coming along too?

276
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,285
Of course, I'm going.

277
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:45,485
Oh, no! Not Kitada again. That's sexual harassment.

278
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,985
I thought so too.

279
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:48,485
Did he try to do something to you again, Ran?

280
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,385
I'm really going to give it to him!

281
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:53,285
"Message Book" -Who's Kitada?

282
00:15:56,894 --> 00:16:00,094
So, I heard Kitada was brushed off after all!

283
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,894
What's the matter, Sonoko?

284
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:06,594
You haven't been eating at all.

285
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:08,694
Are you feeling sick or something?

286
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,494
Sonoko.

287
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,694
Maybe I should go back there after all.

288
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:21,794
Go where?

289
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:22,994
Where we were a while ago.

290
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:24,094
What?

291
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:27,994
To tie that handkerchief on.

292
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:30,394
What? Right now?

293
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,294
This is nothing new.

294
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:35,394
Here goes capricious, rich young lady.

295
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,394
Would you not be bothered if you were me, Ran?

296
00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:40,694
This is just an example but...

297
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,694
Ran, you planned to wear your favorite color, red,

298
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:46,594
to meet up with Shinichi at a certain place.

299
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:51,094
But he saw a cute girl wearing red walks by and followed her.

300
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,694
You got to meet him

301
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:58,394
but you forgot to wear red.

302
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,094
It's just like that.

303
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:03,694
It's the same situation that I'm in now, isn't it?

304
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:14,494
What the heck is Sonoko talking about anyway?

305
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,894
Let's go, Sonoko! Right now!

306
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:25,994
What?

307
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,194
Yes!

308
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:36,494
She gets all carried away easily.

309
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,994
But with handkerchiefs tied on branches of trees

310
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:46,094
all over the mountains here,

311
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:47,494
even if you tie yours on,

312
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:50,794
nobody will know which is yours.

313
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,294
Don't worry!

314
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:55,694
See!

315
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,094
I wrote my name big enough to see on it

316
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,494
and attached it to a twig like a banner.

317
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:02,794
This way, Makoto can find it easily, right?

318
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:07,194
It's nowhere near romantic like "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

319
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,294
Sonoko?

320
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,094
What?

321
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:22,094
It's getting dark and getting kind of spooky.

322
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:23,394
Really?

323
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,194
Okay, let's hurry then.

324
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:27,594
I'm almost done.

325
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:31,494
"Hozumi"

326
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:33,294
Pocket diary?

327
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:34,894
This pocket diary...

328
00:18:35,994 --> 00:18:38,294
Isn't this...

329
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:41,394
Doesn't this belong to that AD we met a while ago?

330
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:42,794
True.

331
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,794
Did he drop it?

332
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,794
I guess.

333
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:55,394
There's blood on the calendar.

334
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,494
It seems to have been traced with a bloody finger.

335
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,794
But why April 1st?

336
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,694
Besides...

337
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,094
it seems to be a bit wet.

338
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:12,094
Okay, let's turn that diary in to the police later.

339
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:15,694
Okay. Let's go, Conan.

340
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:17,794
Okay.

341
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:29,694
Blood...

342
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,494
It's not dry yet.

343
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:39,694
Don't tell me that...

344
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:46,594
What?

345
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,694
Conan!

346
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:53,194
Get back here, you glasses kid!

347
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:12,894
See! It's because you run off like that!

348
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,494
What?

349
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,394
What's wrong, Ran?

350
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:37,794
He's the man we met a while ago, right?

351
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,794
Yeah.

352
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:42,194
The owner of the diary.

353
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:44,294
The one who asked us to leave a message.

354
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:46,294
The corpse is still warm.

355
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,794
Not even 30 minutes have passed yet since he was killed.

356
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,394
There's soil in between his fingernails.

357
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:00,594
Soil in between his nails? Why?

358
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:05,794
Hey. I think we should call the police, shouldn't we?

359
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:06,894
Yes!

360
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:18,594
Hello? Is this the police?

361
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:21,194
Soil between his fingernails.

362
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,094
Blood on the calendar of his diary.

363
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:25,894
April 1st.

364
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,194
I wonder what kind of message Mr. Hozumi is trying to relay.

365
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:41,394
Yes. A man is lying on the ground with a knife pierced through his chest.

366
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:42,494
Yes.

367
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:49,194
Somebody...

368
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:50,494
I sense somebody here.

369
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,494
Not only that...

370
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:56,894
it's not only one or two people.

371
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:00,894
What's going on?

372
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:05,594
"Next Episode" -I see.

373
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,294
The red maple leaves in winter

374
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:09,794
was simply to mark this grave.

375
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,394
What's going on?

376
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:25,894
Conan!

377
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:27,994
Glasses kid! Who are these people?

378
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:34,094
Next Conan, "Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 2)"

379
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:51,994
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,994
"April 1st"

381
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,294
April fool? Is it a lie or true (A homonym of 'makoto')?

382
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,994
What? Makoto? Where?
