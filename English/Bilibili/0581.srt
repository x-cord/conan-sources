1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,940
"Beika Department Store"

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,140
Excuse me, sir?

3
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,240
I'm sorry, I'll leave right away.

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,640
I just wanted to take a glimpse outside.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,040
I mean, the whole floor is sabotaged by a bomb scare,

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,440
I can't make myself eat anything.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,040
I see...

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,540
But, of course,

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,340
I would sure like to give the guys who are hiding

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,440
in this hot season waiting for their prey,

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,340
a taste of hot bitter coffee, if I had my way.

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,140
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,240
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,840
The overall picture of the bomb scare is finally revealed.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
As well as well as the fate of Akai's phantom.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

19
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:00,776
In order to solve the mystery of the red T-shirts

20
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,976
that were being sent every week,

21
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,476
we headed off to Beika Department Store

22
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,376
and what lay waiting for us

23
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:09,976
was a man with a bomb wrapped around his body.

24
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:13,176
The masked man who wrapped a bomb around this man

25
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:18,176
wants to find the T-shirts's sender that was supposedly on this floor.

26
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,176
Although it was found that all 13 T-shirts

27
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:25,276
were bought at 12:28 pm every Sunday,

28
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:28,976
the salesclerk says that she has no recollection who bought them.

29
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,076
What on earth is going on?

30
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:35,876
From the queer creases that were found on the red T-shirts,

31
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:38,676
I figured out that the snow mountain accident

32
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,476
that occurred more than 10 years ago

33
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:43,476
to a mountain climber was connected to this incident.

34
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,576
Wait, dad!

35
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,676
That's right near the bomb.

36
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:53,476
I'll be fine.

37
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:56,276
I won't let the bomb go off.

38
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,076
Isn't that right?

39
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,276
Bomb man?

40
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,476
Mr. Ordinary Citizen?

41
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:14,176
"The Target that Sways Red"

42
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,876
No, I...

43
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:19,476
Seeing that although it's 12:28 pm,

44
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,176
no one came to buy the wear,

45
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,276
so you figured.

46
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:28,176
It was the trap set by the sender

47
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,176
of the T-shirts to lure you out here.

48
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:31,776
That's why you're

49
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:36,176
trying to get that hateful sender of the T-shirts to come out!

50
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,476
Get him to come out, how?

51
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,576
If the sender knew the man's address,

52
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:44,676
he must also know the face of that man.

53
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:47,076
Because the man made a fuss saying

54
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:50,976
that the bomb would go off unless the sender is found,

55
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:53,076
he probably hoped

56
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:56,776
that the sender would come out declaring that it's a lie.

57
00:04:56,776 --> 00:05:00,176
Well, I've already figured out who the sender is

58
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:03,076
without having to use a complicated method such as he, though.

59
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:05,276
What? Really?

60
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:07,476
The receipts!

61
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:14,476
I don't think he'll be able to get a receipt indicating 12:28 pm.

62
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:18,376
If he asked to have a receipt with that time indicated,

63
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,976
he could probably have it done.

64
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,576
But if such a queer shopper came,

65
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:27,176
the salesclerk is bound to remember.

66
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,776
The fact that the salesclerks don't recall such a person

67
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:34,276
is because the sender himself is the one who issued the receipts.

68
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:37,676
In other words, it's the cashier

69
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,776
at the fitness section that carries red underwear.

70
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:44,276
Ms. Seta, it's you, isn't it?

71
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:47,676
The cash register of that section is in a small room

72
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:50,676
that is not visible to the customers or salesclerks.

73
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:52,476
Therefore, it's easy to issue

74
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:56,676
a receipt indicating 12:28 pm without being suspected.

75
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:59,276
It is also very likely that the sender

76
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,476
and recipient know each other's face.

77
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:07,676
Nevertheless, the fact that the recipient couldn't find you,

78
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:11,176
that's the further proof that the sender was you,

79
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,976
who had been hiding in that small room all this time.

80
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,276
Mai... Mai?

81
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,976
Are you Mai?

82
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,076
Mr. Maruoka's daughter?

83
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,976
Yes, that's right, Mr. Fukunishi!

84
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:24,176
My father, who you killed

85
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,276
on those snowy mountains 13 years ago.

86
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:29,476
I'm Daisaku Maruoka's daughter!

87
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:32,876
Don't call me using honorific as if you know me or something!

88
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,276
No, he got caught in an avalanche and...

89
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:40,276
Right, the avalanche that happened worked to your advantage

90
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,676
and the police didn't check the case any further.

91
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:47,376
It was closed as a mere case of accident in the snow!

92
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:52,376
But, on Sunday December 28th, 13 years ago,

93
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,776
the morning that you and dad went mountain climbing,

94
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:58,176
it was written in dad's diary!

95
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:01,376
That if you saw the grand scenery of a summit for the first time,

96
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:04,576
you would probably turn over a new leaf.

97
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:08,376
After dad's death, dad was suspected of embezzlement!

98
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,476
You used up the money of the company

99
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:14,076
and put the blame on dad who was your superior, too!

100
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:15,876
I know that!

101
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:19,176
What... What're you talking about, Mai?

102
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,776
I see, so she's the one.

103
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,276
She's the one who...

104
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:27,776
So, are you satisfied?

105
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,076
Let my son go!

106
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,876
Son? What's that about?

107
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:36,976
You're made me do something like this with this letter, right?

108
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:38,276
Letter?

109
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,976
Please let me see it.

110
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,476
I have your son.

111
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:44,976
If you want him back,

112
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:47,376
wrap the bomb that's inside around your body

113
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,176
and set the remaining bombs

114
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:53,076
to Beika Department Store and sabotage the entire sports floor.

115
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,576
Plead your heart out begging for your life

116
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:57,476
unless you find the sender.

117
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,676
If I get to burst out laughing watching you do this,

118
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,876
I'll give you back your son.

119
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:06,276
I know nothing about that letter.

120
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,576
You've got to be joking!

121
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,676
My son's been missing since last week!

122
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:11,776
-What? -What?

123
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,776
Come on, give me back my son!

124
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:18,476
I see. This is what your purpose was.

125
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,876
What? Dad?

126
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:26,776
Ms. Seta's weakness was that she kept sending red underwear every week.

127
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:29,476
You felt strong because if you didn't receive such letter,

128
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,576
you would never had caused this bomb scare to begin with.

129
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:36,876
That's why you made up that fake threat letter

130
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:41,176
and decided that you would deepen the crime of the sender!

131
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,076
Because you had no idea that Ms. Seta

132
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:49,376
had conclusive proof that you were the one who killed her father.

133
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:52,176
Conclusive proof?

134
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,076
What kind of proof?

135
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,476
Don't be ridiculous. She'll never have anything like that.

136
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:02,176
The 13 red underwear that Ms. Seta sent you!

137
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:05,776
The fact that the way the shirts were folded according to the crease,

138
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:08,476
is the shape for a flag signal.

139
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,176
Flag signals...

140
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,676
That's when you relay words by waving a red and white flag

141
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,776
that you hold in each hand, right?

142
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:15,876
Right.

143
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:20,176
If you read it according to the order the shirts were sent...

144
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:26,176
Buried...

145
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:28,176
I...

146
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,876
saw...

147
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,576
you...

148
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,976
-do it... -Buried, I saw you do it.

149
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,876
Does that mean, the place the body was buried?

150
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,076
So, you been bluffing after all!

151
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,676
Bluff?

152
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,276
It has to be!

153
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:48,476
Because back then the blizzard was so bad

154
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:49,676
that you couldn't even keep your eyes open.

155
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:52,376
Even if there have been someone other than me there.

156
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:57,876
Are you saying, no one could've seen you burying the body?

157
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,376
No... That's...

158
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,476
According to Mr. Maruoka's diary,

159
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,676
mountain climbing was a first time experience for you.

160
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,576
Therefore, being a novice,

161
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,576
you couldn't have left the mountain hut

162
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,076
that you were in to go and bury him.

163
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,976
Which means if we dig the area near the mountain hut you stayed,

164
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:17,076
then we should be able to find the corpse, right?

165
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,976
The corpse of the mountain climber

166
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:22,676
that you killed and buried 13 years ago.

167
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:24,876
You seem to be very sure

168
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:27,376
that nobody was watching you

169
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,076
but there was a witness.

170
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:34,476
And that's you, the one who murdered him.

171
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:03,776
By the way, is your son really gone?

172
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:07,276
Yes, I think he ran away from home like always.

173
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,876
I'm stupid.

174
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,176
I embezzled the company money because I wanted to enroll my son

175
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:13,576
into a famous elementary school.

176
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:17,576
I even killed my superior who scolded me for it.

177
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,276
And my son's ran away from home too.

178
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:25,176
Then, will someone call the police

179
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,476
and take Ms. Seta and him to the station?

180
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:28,676
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:30,576
Please announce to the customers here

182
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:32,676
that the bombs in the paper bags on this floor

183
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,576
are fakes that only emit smoke!

184
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:36,976
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:43,376
Besides, I'm sure that the riot police called by Ms. Seta

186
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:46,176
are also nearby too.

187
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:49,376
Yes, I told them to arrest him right away

188
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,976
because I figured all the bombs were fake anyway,

189
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:54,576
but they wouldn't do it.

190
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:58,976
How did you figure out that the bombs were fake, Dad?

191
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:02,476
From the lipstick on his shoulder.

192
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:05,776
If he really had a real bomb attached to his body,

193
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:09,776
he would never ride a crowded train, that's why.

194
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:12,876
So, that completes the job offer we got for this case,

195
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:16,676
but are you satisfied, Ms. Seta?

196
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,876
Yes, sir! So, you knew after all.

197
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:23,776
That I use a voice changer to call you.

198
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,076
All I wanted is for you to reveal

199
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:27,876
the meaning of the flag signal that dad taught me

200
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:30,076
and watch what kind of face he would wear

201
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:33,476
after hearing it from you.

202
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:36,376
But, to hear him confessing what he did,

203
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,376
you're really great after all.

204
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:39,976
With only that little hint,

205
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,876
you realized that it was the accident

206
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:44,676
at the snowy mountain that occurred on December 28th,

207
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,376
and made the little boy check on it.

208
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:49,476
-That's... -Flag signals

209
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,176
are used in places like the ocean

210
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:54,076
and mountains where voices are hard to hear.

211
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,576
If the message was, "I saw you bury him"

212
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:00,976
it has to be the mountains and not the sea.

213
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:05,476
And the right half of the receipts are deliberately torn off

214
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,776
bringing to mind a snowy mountain.

215
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:11,676
The red colour of the underwear suggests murder.

216
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:13,376
If murder is committed in the snow mountain,

217
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,276
it'll have something to do with accident in the snow

218
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:19,376
and it'll be difficult to determine the exact time.

219
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,676
I'm sure that the time 12:28 pm

220
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,776
indicates the date December 28.

221
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,776
That's what's written on the mail

222
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:33,176
that was sent to me by somebody I don't know.

223
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:35,276
Let... Let me see it.

224
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:41,176
And, what's come of the bomb scare?

225
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:42,276
What?

226
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,476
Mail from somebody he doesn't know?

227
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:51,076
Who on earth can it be?

228
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,099
Who on earth could've sent him this mail?

229
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,899
The only thing I can say

230
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,599
is that he sender of this mail was definitely

231
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:12,799
on this floor till just a while ago.

232
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,699
What's the matter, Conan?

233
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,699
Nothing...

234
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,799
I was thinking that the person who sent this mail

235
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,099
is a really great detective.

236
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:23,099
-Mail? -Look.

237
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,099
Well, I'll leave the rest to you.

238
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,699
-You must feel hot... -It's true!

239
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:34,199
Dad, don't tell me that you were just reading this mail.

240
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,899
But, the fact that the sender is me,

241
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,099
the daughter of the mountain climber

242
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:41,599
who was killed in the snowy mountains 13 years ago,

243
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,599
was unmentioned, does it?

244
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,899
Boy, you knew about it from Detective Mouri, right?

245
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,699
After all, you called me by my maiden name, Maruoka,

246
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,699
instead of the name on this name plate, Seta.

247
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,899
Yes! When I went into the cash register room

248
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,699
because I wanted to check on the accident that happened

249
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,999
in the snowy mountain on December 28th,

250
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,399
and asked you to lend me the computer,

251
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,499
you weren't surprised, were you?

252
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:08,299
That's how I figured out

253
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,799
you were the one who wanted this case checked

254
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,699
and were somehow involved with the accident in the mountain.

255
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,499
In the picture with Mr. Maruoka who died in the mountain,

256
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,999
his daughter was in it too.

257
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,899
And, you were wearing a wedding ring,

258
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,699
so I thought maybe you got married and your last name changed!

259
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:25,999
Really...

260
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,299
You're really something, aren't you, Conan?

261
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,399
Of... Of course.

262
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,499
I did all of what I did because Pops told me to do it.

263
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,899
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

264
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,899
But, the sender of this mail is quite a great detective himself!

265
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,599
Everything aside from your identity hit the bull's eye.

266
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,599
I wonder who it is?

267
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,999
Maybe that person is still here on this floor.

268
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,499
Then, maybe if you send a thank you mail,

269
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,899
that person will appear?

270
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,399
No, way.

271
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,599
From what's written there,

272
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,599
it seems that the person doesn't want to get involved.

273
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,199
What?

274
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,699
Maybe it's him?

275
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:10,899
I'm sorry!

276
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,699
Did you just receive mail that said, "Thank you?"

277
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,199
Yes, I did.

278
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,099
Then, are you the one who made that deduction?

279
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,099
No, I don't know anything about this mail.

280
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:28,199
What? But, the mail was sent from your cell phone, right?

281
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,499
Yes.

282
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:33,399
It could be the person who picked up my cell phone a while ago.

283
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,399
A man who was wearing a black cap

284
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,699
and had a burn scar on his right cheek.

285
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,099
What?

286
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,999
Where is that man?

287
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,099
Yes.

288
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,499
He went over to the escalator that started moving.

289
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,699
I think he went downstairs?

290
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,099
Conan?

291
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,799
What's up? What's the rush?

292
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,099
Jodie.

293
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:06,899
Don't tell me you're looking for the same person I am?

294
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,599
No.

295
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,799
Just as the message in question said,

296
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,099
it seems that this place is definitely dangerous.

297
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,099
Message in question?

298
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,399
The message that Shu gave me!

299
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,799
You met him? Mr. Akai?

300
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,799
No, when I left my seat for a while at the cafe in the basement,

301
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,099
he secretly wrote it in the back of the coaster!

302
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:34,899
And, why is it dangerous here?

303
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:37,299
The bomb scare incident's been solved, right?

304
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,099
Because I saw it.

305
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,799
A sniper-like person was seen from a window of the hotel opposite

306
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,999
this department store.

307
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:48,399
And parked right below, is a black Porsche 356A.

308
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,399
Gin!

309
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,699
Don't tell me, that he found out that Shu is alive

310
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,399
and is planning to shoot him?

311
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,899
Shu!

312
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,299
Where are you, Shu?

313
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,799
There he is. It's Shu!

314
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,099
No, Shu!

315
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,799
Don't go out!

316
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,699
They're coming after you!

317
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,099
Shu!

318
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:19,299
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

319
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,799
The rate of taking the blame would be fifty-fifty.

320
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,599
You weren't careful and attentive enough,

321
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,599
you're to be blame too.

322
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,799
Yes.

323
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,899
You looked to have been looking for someone?

324
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:31,899
Shu!

325
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,299
Where are you, Shu?

326
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,999
There he is! I found him!

327
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,199
I found the phantom!

328
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,799
On the left edge of the main entrance.

329
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,399
Right to the side of your car!

330
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,099
Hurry up and check it out if you're going to, Gin!

331
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,199
Because my finger that's on the trigger

332
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,199
is impatiently waiting and twitching

333
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,899
and may go off any minute!

334
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,499
Akai Shuichi.

335
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,099
Vermouth.

336
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,399
Did you get approval from that person?

337
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:17,699
Yes, boss is very discreet and careful.

338
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,199
Maybe too careful that the timing goes off.

339
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,799
What the heck are you doing?

340
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,599
Can I kill him? Or not?

341
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,899
Which is it going to be?

342
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:30,499
What the...

343
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:31,799
He looked...

344
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,999
That guy!

345
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,999
He looked this way!

346
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,699
He looked at me and laughed!

347
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:37,999
Do I kill him or not?

348
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,099
What do I do?

349
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,999
Gin, it's strange, right?

350
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:47,399
The customers are rushing back into the department store.

351
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,899
Where is he? Where'd he go?

352
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:51,999
The shoppers are suddenly rushing along.

353
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,599
It's hard to lock him on.

354
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,699
Hey, doesn't it look bad?

355
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,399
She's got a rifle.

356
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,099
Maybe their shooting a film or something?

357
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,499
-Let's go. -What?

358
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:07,199
Tell Korn too.

359
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:10,299
Hey, just what's going on? Gin...

360
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,699
Priority on his own discretion again.

361
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,099
Revolting like always.

362
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,299
What? Who are you talking about?

363
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:21,599
Like you said,

364
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,399
you wish they leave detectives

365
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,899
like Sherlock Holmes locked up in novels only.

366
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,899
Hey, hurry up and give me the gift certificate!

367
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,999
You're giving us 10,000 yen worth, aren't you?

368
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,999
Just what're you talking about?

369
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,099
A boy wearing glasses went around shouting

370
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,799
that as an apology of the bomb scare,

371
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,099
you're giving away gift certificate to all the customers who came!

372
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,799
I haven't heard anything sort of thing.

373
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,099
Hey, come on, man!

374
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,499
I came all the way back here.

375
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,699
I see, gift certificates, right?

376
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:20,399
I wouldn't say that it was too bright.

377
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,099
But, I guess it couldn't be helped

378
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,399
if you wanted to evacuate the customers from here, right?

379
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,499
Subaru?

380
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,999
I had some business to take care of at the Teito Bank

381
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,299
near this department store.

382
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,199
So, I did what I had to do and came out saw you all,

383
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:36,799
and ran after you thinking to call you,

384
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,099
and got messed up in the incident.

385
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,199
Who is this guy?

386
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,399
I hear that his apartment was burnt down.

387
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,699
He lives at Shinichi's house for the time being,

388
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,299
and his name is Mr. Subaru Okiya, a university student.

389
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:50,699
I see...

390
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,699
But, what was that about?

391
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:56,599
Conan evacuating the customers a while ago.

392
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:00,899
It's not worth hearing about.

393
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,699
It's a worthless story

394
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:05,299
about a bunch of stupid wolves letting the prey

395
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,399
that they hunted down get away.

396
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:12,699
But, you live quite a distance away from Teito Bank, don't you?

397
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:15,199
Why would you have a saving account in a place like that?

398
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,499
No.

399
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:19,799
I had other things to do at that bank.

400
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,399
Other things to do?

401
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:25,999
Remember the robbery at that bank some time ago?

402
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,499
In the news that was aired to look back on that case,

403
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:30,399
I saw my acquaintance.

404
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:35,399
I went there thinking that maybe he was using that bank.

405
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:38,699
If he's using that bank, he should be living in this vicinity.

406
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:41,799
I was hoping to get lucky and run into him.

407
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,299
So, you didn't get to see him?

408
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,999
Well, I coincidentally saw him on that floor.

409
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,599
But, unfortunately, it seemed to be someone else,

410
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,399
so I didn't call out to him.

411
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:58,999
His face is one that I've known for a long time,

412
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:01,599
so I'd never mistaken him for someone else.

413
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,199
A stalker, you say?

414
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,799
Unforgivable.

415
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,099
Targeting such a fragile woman.

416
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,899
Zombie?

417
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:24,099
No matter how you look at it, this is a case of self-defense.

418
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:28,499
Just as I thought.

419
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:29,999
Next Conan,

420
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,556
"The Night the Zombie Died"

421
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,076
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:53,076
"Strawberry"

423
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,576
This strawberry is very delicious.

424
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:58,276
Strawberry is very...
