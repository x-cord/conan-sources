1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.840
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.640
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.540
Today's episode is at a hospital. Kogoro is surprised

5
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.240
and Ran is acting strange too.

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.399
Yeah. I can't come home for a while yet.

10
00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.899
Gee, what on earth are you doing?

11
00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.999
All the others in class are also worried about you too.

12
00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.799
I've got no choice.

13
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.299
"I'm handling a dangerous and difficult case", right?

14
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.199
-Uh, you know what. -Oh, I'm sorry, Shinichi.

15
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.199
I have something to do and got to go.

16
00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.599
Bye, then, and take care because it's getting cold.

17
00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.299
There's something...

18
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.099
something strange about Ran recently.

19
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.499
She seems to be giving me the cold shoulder when I call her.

20
00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.099
She's not raving, "Shinichi, Shinichi"

21
00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.799
like she used to before either.

22
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.099
And, the strangest thing is...

23
00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.299
Conan.

24
00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.199
I'm going out for a while.

25
00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.599
I left your dinner on the table,

26
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.799
so warm it up with the micro-wave before you eat it, okay?

27
00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.999
Oh, okay.

28
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.199
She recently goes out in the evenings almost everyday.

29
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.099
Although Ran says she's going to karate lessons.

30
00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.599
Something bothers me about the way she looks so happy.

31
00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.799
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 1)"

32
00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.599
One day...

33
00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.099
What?

34
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.199
You were going to the hospital?

35
00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.399
Yeah. I'm going to get the results of the test now.

36
00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.499
Is something wrong with you?

37
00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.599
I feel a bit tired recently.

38
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.999
You're probably drinking too much.

39
00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.299
Right.

40
00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.099
I don't see why you have to take us with you

41
00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.299
when we just came back from school.

42
00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.499
Why make such a big thing of it?

43
00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.799
The doctor told me to bring my family along

44
00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.199
when I go to the hospital.

45
00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.899
Hey, don't tell me that you...

46
00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.099
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

47
00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.099
Mr. Mouri.

48
00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.199
Another six months.

49
00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.799
I know exactly how you feel but, unfortunately

50
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.199
for the next six months have to...

51
00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.799
Hey, you! How cruel can you get?

52
00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.199
Suddenly telling me that I only have another six months to live!

53
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.699
If I'm that seriously ill, isn't it only manners

54
00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.799
for you as a doctor to give it to me slowly?

55
00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.899
Huh?

56
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.599
Seriously ill?

57
00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.299
I just wanted to tell you to stay away from alcoholic drinks

58
00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.499
for the next six months.

59
00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.399
Huh?

60
00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:14.499
Alcohol?

61
00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.799
Yes. The results of the tests show that

62
00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.199
you have kidney trouble caused by over drinking.

63
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.099
Although the symptoms are still very slight.

64
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:27.299
Just as I thought.

65
00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.699
Dr. Araide, you really scared me.

66
00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.099
Telling me to bring my family along with me.

67
00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.199
For a person like you who likes alcoholic drinks,

68
00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.499
the cooperation of your family is a must.

69
00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.899
Please reduce your daily intake of alcoholic beverages.

70
00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:44.899
Yes, I'll make him quit drinking for good.

71
00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.099
You have a call from Ms. Sugita.

72
00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.699
She's asking you to give her a house call.

73
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.699
Not again.

74
00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.399
What a troublesome patient.

75
00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:58.899
All she's got is plain ulcers, but she's such a worrier.

76
00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.399
"Yoko Araide (46)" -Patient?

77
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:05.099
"Yoshiteru's wife" -Good grief. She's his lover.

78
00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.199
Oh, it's nothing.

79
00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.599
He'll be through in a little while, so please wait here a minute.

80
00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.899
Excuse me.

81
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.099
May I use the restroom?

82
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.499
The restroom for patients is broken.

83
00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:20.699
My.

84
00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.499
I turned right at the corridor so...

85
00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.399
It's this way.

86
00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.799
Yes, the examination room is right up ahead.

87
00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.399
Gee, what a large house this is.

88
00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:40.299
I'm sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going.

89
00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.199
Oh, no, it's my fault for being absent-minded.

90
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.199
Okay, that's all.

91
00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.899
Oh, thank you.

92
00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:54.899
Uh, who are you?

93
00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.399
I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter, one of the doctor's patients.

94
00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.899
Oh. Mr. Mouri's daughter.

95
00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:03.199
And, I'm the son of that doctor.

96
00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.799
I'm Tomoaki and share the work of examining the patients here

97
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.099
together with my father.

98
00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.899
But, I'm going to be working at a hospital in Aomori

99
00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:11.899
starting next month.

100
00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.699
Hey! Don't tell me it's you again!

101
00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.199
How long is it going to take you to get used to this house anyway?

102
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.199
You're the one who wanted to be maid here, right?

103
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.799
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.599
Come now, father,

105
00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.699
getting too excited is bad for your heart.

106
00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.699
Listen. If you do something like this one more time,

107
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.899
you're fired, understand?

108
00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:36.599
Hopeless scatterbrain, I tell you.

109
00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.199
"Hikaru Yasumoto (22), Housemaid"

110
00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.599
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.999
Keep away from drinking and live long.

112
00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.999
After all, you have the same name as the famous Kogoro Mouri.

113
00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:53.999
Oh, you've never heard of the renown detective?

114
00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:57.399
Uh, no, so, you see...

115
00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:01.199
What? You're the famous detective!

116
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.499
Yes.

117
00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:06.499
Well, I was wondering from the time I saw your name,

118
00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.299
but you're him in person, eh.

119
00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:10.899
I was completely deceived,

120
00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:15.599
because you acted like you knew nothing about medicine.

121
00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.999
How about having dinner over at our house tonight?

122
00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.799
Let's talk about medicine, the two of us.

123
00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:21.899
Oh, no!

124
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.799
No. I've got homework to do,

125
00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:27.199
and Ran has karate practice too.

126
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.399
Right?

127
00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.899
Why not? Let's have dinner here.

128
00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:35.999
Resting one lesson couldn't possibly hurt.

129
00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:37.499
Something...

130
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.599
Something's strange, after all.

131
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.999
"Clinic Araide"

132
00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:45.599
You graduated with honors from Tohto University, Tomoaki?

133
00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:46.799
Fantastic.

134
00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.699
True, isn't it, Tomoaki?

135
00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:50.299
I was just lucky.

136
00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:53.999
How about thinking of marrying my daughter?

137
00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:55.999
Come on, dad!

138
00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:58.699
My, I think you two make quite a nice pair.

139
00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:00.899
Oh, please knock it off, Mom.

140
00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.099
Ouch!

141
00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.999
Are you all right? Please be careful since chawanmushi is hot.

142
00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:08.399
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:10.499
Is it all right?

144
00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:13.099
Weren't supposed to have a a meeting tonight about your class reunion?

145
00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:16.199
Oh, that's right. I have to call Masae.

146
00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.899
Well, if you want to marry her, let me know anytime.

147
00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:26.699
If we join hands, we will indeed be like Holmes and Watson.

148
00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:29.099
Every case will be solved in no time.

149
00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:30.599
Give me a break.

150
00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:33.599
Besides, I don't think that a detective and a doctor

151
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:34.899
make a good pair.

152
00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:37.299
Our mission as doctors is not to perform an autopsy

153
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.199
so that the killer can be arrested,

154
00:08:40.199 --> 00:08:43.199
but rather, to save the victim's life.

155
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.699
Oh, you got me there.

156
00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:47.899
No.

157
00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:52.599
It's hard to tell who Holmes is, isn't it, Ran...

158
00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:58.299
Ran.

159
00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:01.299
Dr. Araide sure is late.

160
00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:04.099
He should already be finished working.

161
00:09:04.099 --> 00:09:05.899
He's taking a bath.

162
00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:10.799
He has a habit of taking a bath before dinner.

163
00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:14.399
He goes in before everybody else and dirties the water.

164
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:17.199
Grandma, that's not nice.

165
00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:19.699
He sure is the bread winner of this house

166
00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:22.299
to be the first to take a bath.

167
00:09:22.299 --> 00:09:24.499
Some bread winner!

168
00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:28.099
All he did was take after the family, and yet he acts so big.

169
00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:29.399
Grandma!

170
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:32.699
The only person that is related by blood in this house

171
00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:34.699
is you, my grandson.

172
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.699
And to think that you're going to be leaving this house

173
00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:38.899
at the end of this month...

174
00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:41.099
Are you telling me that I should die?

175
00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:42.899
Grandma.

176
00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:44.999
Oh, Mother, what about dinner?

177
00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:45.999
No thanks,

178
00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:49.299
why don't all you strangers enjoy dinner together?

179
00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:54.299
Don't let it bother you.

180
00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:57.099
Grandma is upset because father changed the toilet and bath tub

181
00:09:57.099 --> 00:09:59.199
from Japanese style to Western style.

182
00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:00.799
Western style?

183
00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:01.999
Yes.

184
00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:04.499
She was especially enraged when he changed

185
00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:07.399
the white cedar bath tub to one with a shower curtain.

186
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.699
She shouted saying,

187
00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:10.599
"Are you trying to dirt on the tradition of this house?"

188
00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:13.899
Well, she sure is an energetic elderly woman.

189
00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:15.899
Oh no. A black out?

190
00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.599
It seems that the black out is only in this house.

191
00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.899
The lights of the house next door are on.

192
00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:26.299
Are you all right?

193
00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:29.799
I'm sure there's a flashlight in that drawer over there.

194
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.399
Here it is.

195
00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:36.699
I'll go check the breaker.

196
00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:37.799
Can you handle it?

197
00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:38.999
Yes.

198
00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:42.099
Watch your step, Hikaru.

199
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:43.499
Okay.

200
00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:45.799
What's up? What happened?

201
00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:47.399
There was a black out.

202
00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:54.099
Oh, no, isn't this the sound of rain?

203
00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:55.099
Yes.

204
00:10:55.099 --> 00:10:57.099
Bummers.

205
00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:02.499
Oh, the lights are on.

206
00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:13.199
I'm sorry. I thought you were dad.

207
00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:17.399
What on earth is going on?

208
00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.699
Oh, mother.

209
00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:21.799
And about the charges...

210
00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:24.299
Well, I think 30,000 yen is a bit too expensive.

211
00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:25.699
Did the lights turn on?

212
00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:28.299
You idiot. Can't you see for yourself?

213
00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:31.599
Maybe you'd better go check on how father is doing?

214
00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:33.799
He's probably angry that the lights went out

215
00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:35.799
and besides, I'm worried about his heart too.

216
00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.399
-I guess so. -I'll go check then.

217
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.299
Oh, I'll go too.

218
00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:42.499
Why did it black out?

219
00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:43.999
I wonder.

220
00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.899
Probably a short circuit somewhere or the fuse blew out.

221
00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:51.499
What is it?

222
00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:53.199
It's from the bath tub.

223
00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.599
Father!

224
00:12:14.188 --> 00:12:15.088
Father!

225
00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:16.488
Don't touch him!

226
00:12:16.488 --> 00:12:17.388
Huh?

227
00:12:20.088 --> 00:12:22.588
If you touch him, you'll be electrocuted too.

228
00:12:22.588 --> 00:12:24.688
Electrocuted?

229
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.588
Hey, come on, don't tell that...

230
00:12:32.388 --> 00:12:34.188
He was killed because of this razor

231
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:36.188
that is connected to the extension cord.

232
00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:39.688
I'm going to try CPR!

233
00:12:39.688 --> 00:12:41.888
Mother, please prepare an I.V with cardiotonic drug!

234
00:12:41.888 --> 00:12:44.088
Hikaru, call the ambulance!

235
00:12:44.088 --> 00:12:45.588
Hurry!

236
00:12:45.588 --> 00:12:48.688
-Yes! -Oh, and call the police too!

237
00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:50.488
Okay!

238
00:12:54.488 --> 00:12:56.588
There seems to be no doubt that

239
00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:58.088
this extension cord got soaked in the water

240
00:12:58.088 --> 00:12:59.988
and he was electrocuted.

241
00:13:00.588 --> 00:13:02.288
He used the mirror above the bath tub

242
00:13:02.288 --> 00:13:04.888
when he shaved using the razor.

243
00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:07.388
But, why did he shave while bathing?

244
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:11.788
Wait a minute, don't tell me that this is...

245
00:13:12.788 --> 00:13:14.388
Unfortunately.

246
00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:18.488
Mr. Yoshiteru Araide has passed away.

247
00:13:18.488 --> 00:13:21.288
He did have a weak heart to begin with.

248
00:13:21.288 --> 00:13:25.188
Oh, no...

249
00:13:25.188 --> 00:13:26.288
And?

250
00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:28.788
Under what circumstances was Mr. Yoshiteru Araide found?

251
00:13:28.788 --> 00:13:30.888
Oh, well...

252
00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:33.688
His head was faced this way, and he was slack.

253
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:36.388
I wonder why he used his electric shaver

254
00:13:36.388 --> 00:13:38.188
while soaking in the tub.

255
00:13:38.188 --> 00:13:40.188
He had a habit of doing so.

256
00:13:40.188 --> 00:13:43.388
He always shaved while making his guest wait.

257
00:13:43.388 --> 00:13:47.288
The mirror has had a special coating put on it to prevent fogging.

258
00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:49.588
What a strange habit,

259
00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:52.488
to take a bath while his guests are waiting.

260
00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:54.088
Father liked to take a bath

261
00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:55.888
and he always took a twice a day,

262
00:13:55.888 --> 00:13:57.588
in the morning and before dinner,

263
00:13:57.588 --> 00:14:00.088
saying that sanitation was a must for doctors.

264
00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:02.588
It serves him right.

265
00:14:02.588 --> 00:14:06.788
The heavens punished him for not taking heed of Chiaki's warning.

266
00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:09.188
This is probably chastisement from Chiaki

267
00:14:09.188 --> 00:14:11.588
who is in the world beyond.

268
00:14:11.588 --> 00:14:13.188
Grandma.

269
00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:15.388
Chiaki...

270
00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:20.388
She's my mother who died in a traffic accident 4 years ago.

271
00:14:20.388 --> 00:14:22.888
Chiaki always warn him about using the electric shaver

272
00:14:22.888 --> 00:14:24.988
when taking a bath saying,

273
00:14:24.988 --> 00:14:28.388
"Don't use it with the cord on because it's dangerous."

274
00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:31.288
And you, Yoko?

275
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:33.888
I'm his second wife and married him two years ago.

276
00:14:33.888 --> 00:14:36.188
I used to be in the same class as Chiaki in nurse school,

277
00:14:36.188 --> 00:14:38.788
and she used to complain to me a lot.

278
00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:42.088
Inspector, please watch.

279
00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:44.888
He tries to shave using this mirror,

280
00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:47.588
the part where the shaver is plugged into the extension cord

281
00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:49.688
stops on the edge of the tub.

282
00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:52.188
Very dangerous indeed.

283
00:14:52.188 --> 00:14:54.788
Where were you all during a black out?

284
00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:57.388
We were all in the kitchen.

285
00:14:57.388 --> 00:15:01.788
I saw mother go up the stairs by the corridor

286
00:15:01.788 --> 00:15:03.488
opposite the bathroom too.

287
00:15:03.488 --> 00:15:07.488
If so, then the only likely conclusion would be that

288
00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:11.188
Mr. Araide mistakenly pulled the cord of the shaver into the water

289
00:15:11.188 --> 00:15:14.288
while was shaving, and electrocuted.

290
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.988
This is an accidental death.

291
00:15:15.988 --> 00:15:17.488
I guess so.

292
00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:25.588
Hey. Cut out that mischief!

293
00:15:25.588 --> 00:15:28.588
But, my head is messed up and feel like falling down.

294
00:15:28.588 --> 00:15:30.288
Huh? Why?

295
00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:33.888
Well, the man who died was shaving standing up,

296
00:15:33.888 --> 00:15:36.888
and Officer Takagi was copying him, right?

297
00:15:36.888 --> 00:15:39.088
If so, when he got electric shock,

298
00:15:39.088 --> 00:15:42.788
his head is supposed to come this way like Officer Takagi, right?

299
00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:46.088
But, that man's head was faced the other way.

300
00:15:46.088 --> 00:15:47.288
I wonder why?

301
00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:48.688
That's true.

302
00:15:48.688 --> 00:15:51.088
Hey, this may probably be...

303
00:15:51.988 --> 00:15:54.188
No big deal.

304
00:15:57.888 --> 00:16:00.688
While Mr. Araide was shaving,

305
00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:03.788
he realized that the cord was going to fall into the water

306
00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:05.888
and rushed to pick it up,

307
00:16:05.888 --> 00:16:08.588
but he pulled it into the tub instead.

308
00:16:08.588 --> 00:16:11.588
He then touched the railing accidentally

309
00:16:11.588 --> 00:16:16.088
and was electrocuted.

310
00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:17.988
So, you see.

311
00:16:19.588 --> 00:16:21.888
Pretty good, Pops.

312
00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:25.488
No. Don't touch that.

313
00:16:25.488 --> 00:16:27.988
The razor is vital proof, isn't it?

314
00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:31.388
Touch it? I'm just holding it.

315
00:16:31.388 --> 00:16:32.988
How about you, Officer Takagi?

316
00:16:32.988 --> 00:16:35.788
No, I only held it in my hand too.

317
00:16:35.788 --> 00:16:37.688
How about the Investigation Officer?

318
00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:40.488
I just took pictures.

319
00:16:40.488 --> 00:16:44.788
Strange. Then I wonder who played such a bad prank like this.

320
00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:47.888
Just what are you trying to get at?

321
00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:52.088
Because look, the switch of the razor is turned off.

322
00:16:52.088 --> 00:16:53.088
Huh?

323
00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:55.088
What's going on?

324
00:16:55.088 --> 00:16:57.188
It is strange after all.

325
00:16:57.188 --> 00:16:58.588
If he was electrocuted while shaving,

326
00:16:58.588 --> 00:17:00.288
the switch would have to be on.

327
00:17:00.288 --> 00:17:06.288
The switch must've moved when you fell.

328
00:17:06.288 --> 00:17:07.588
Like so...

329
00:17:09.888 --> 00:17:14.088
Huh? The plug should've been pulled out to avoid danger.

330
00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:16.188
Yes, I have it right here.

331
00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:19.588
I see. This is the battery charge type.

332
00:17:21.188 --> 00:17:23.188
Then, why was it switched off?

333
00:17:23.188 --> 00:17:26.488
It wasn't moving when the body was found, was it?

334
00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:27.788
No.

335
00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:30.888
I think that's only natural.

336
00:17:30.888 --> 00:17:34.088
Somebody didn't want the noise of the shaver to be heard.

337
00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:37.188
Huh? Who didn't want it to be heard by who?

338
00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:42.888
Beats me. I'm just making guesses.

339
00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:46.988
Maybe so that someone could put the cord into the tub

340
00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:50.188
without Mr. Araide noticing?

341
00:17:50.188 --> 00:17:51.688
You idiot!

342
00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:52.688
He'd notice if you did something like that,

343
00:17:52.688 --> 00:17:55.688
even if the shaver wasn't making any noise.

344
00:17:55.688 --> 00:18:00.388
Besides, everyone has an alibi when the house blacked out.

345
00:18:00.388 --> 00:18:02.488
When the lights went on,

346
00:18:02.488 --> 00:18:05.488
it turned off once then went on again, right?

347
00:18:07.488 --> 00:18:08.788
Hikaru?

348
00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:11.688
You were the one who went to lift the breaker, weren't you?

349
00:18:11.688 --> 00:18:12.788
Yes.

350
00:18:12.788 --> 00:18:17.288
Did you lift the breaker twice back then?

351
00:18:17.288 --> 00:18:22.888
Oh, I'm sorry. I seem to have touched the wrong switch.

352
00:18:22.888 --> 00:18:24.888
The breaker of another place seems to have been lowered,

353
00:18:24.888 --> 00:18:27.788
so I put it back again right away.

354
00:18:27.788 --> 00:18:30.388
I'm really sorry.

355
00:18:30.388 --> 00:18:33.988
Inspector, the second one was the overload current breaker.

356
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.788
Maybe this is...

357
00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:37.588
Yeah.

358
00:18:37.588 --> 00:18:40.688
Maybe a timer was rigged so that there would be a black out,

359
00:18:40.688 --> 00:18:43.288
and if someone went into the bathroom

360
00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.188
to sneak the electric cord into the tub,

361
00:18:45.188 --> 00:18:48.288
anyone of those four could've done so.

362
00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:50.488
It's possible.

363
00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:52.988
Uh, what are you whispering about?

364
00:18:52.988 --> 00:18:54.588
Oh, no, it's nothing.

365
00:18:54.588 --> 00:18:56.888
I would like to confirm your alibis before the black out occurred,

366
00:18:56.888 --> 00:18:59.088
just in case.

367
00:18:59.088 --> 00:19:01.788
We just gave you our alibis a while ago.

368
00:19:01.788 --> 00:19:06.088
Huh? Are you saying that the killer is among us?

369
00:19:06.088 --> 00:19:09.488
Like I just said I'm doing so, just in case.

370
00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:13.688
Oh, you were on the phone all through the black out?

371
00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:15.488
Yes. From the time before the black out

372
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.088
till the lights went back on,

373
00:19:17.088 --> 00:19:22.088
I was on the phone by the kitchen entrance.

374
00:19:22.088 --> 00:19:24.488
I was talking to my friend, Masae

375
00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:28.088
about arrangements on the reunion.

376
00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:30.888
Oh, I did receive a catch phone, though.

377
00:19:30.888 --> 00:19:34.388
No one answered when I picked it up, and the person hung up right away.

378
00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:36.288
Officer Takagi, will you verify this right away?

379
00:19:36.288 --> 00:19:37.388
Yes, sir.

380
00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:41.088
I was looking for a flashlight when it backed out

381
00:19:41.088 --> 00:19:42.988
and handed it over to Hikaru.

382
00:19:42.988 --> 00:19:45.888
I was here in the kitchen right through.

383
00:19:45.888 --> 00:19:47.988
Can someone verify that for you?

384
00:19:47.988 --> 00:19:50.088
No, not really.

385
00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:53.988
Tomoaki was here all the while.

386
00:19:53.988 --> 00:19:58.088
After Hikaru went to raise the breaker, I was scared,

387
00:19:58.088 --> 00:20:01.088
so I was clinging on to Tomoaki until the lights went on.

388
00:20:01.088 --> 00:20:03.188
Are you sure?

389
00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:05.688
Why?

390
00:20:06.988 --> 00:20:11.088
So like I said, I thought he was my dad.

391
00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:14.688
Next, Mitsu, where were you?

392
00:20:14.688 --> 00:20:20.488
I had just finished climbing the stairs when the lights went out.

393
00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:23.888
And, I fingered my way to my room upstairs.

394
00:20:23.888 --> 00:20:26.288
But, I hear that when the lights went back on,

395
00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:30.288
you were downstairs near the kitchen.

396
00:20:30.288 --> 00:20:32.488
I felt a presence.

397
00:20:32.488 --> 00:20:34.088
Just as I was about to hit the sack,

398
00:20:34.088 --> 00:20:37.188
I felt a presence outside my room.

399
00:20:37.188 --> 00:20:38.688
Don't tell me that

400
00:20:38.688 --> 00:20:41.688
someone else other than all of you had snuck into the house?

401
00:20:41.688 --> 00:20:46.488
I felt that way and followed the sound downstairs.

402
00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:47.488
But, I found out.

403
00:20:47.488 --> 00:20:48.888
What did you find out?

404
00:20:48.888 --> 00:20:51.388
It was the sound of the rain.

405
00:20:51.388 --> 00:20:53.188
Oh.

406
00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:57.188
And, finally you, Hikaru.

407
00:20:57.188 --> 00:20:58.388
Yes.

408
00:20:58.388 --> 00:21:02.288
I went over to the breaker to turn on the lights.

409
00:21:02.288 --> 00:21:06.888
I'm still not used to this house, so I got lost a bit, though.

410
00:21:06.888 --> 00:21:10.288
You didn't notice anyone suspicious, did you?

411
00:21:10.288 --> 00:21:12.188
No, nobody.

412
00:21:16.288 --> 00:21:17.688
Just as I thought.

413
00:21:17.688 --> 00:21:19.388
Gosh.

414
00:21:19.388 --> 00:21:22.088
I noticed you were holding your arm.

415
00:21:22.088 --> 00:21:25.488
You're always much too tolerant from before.

416
00:21:25.488 --> 00:21:27.088
A burn?

417
00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:29.488
Excuse me, but I'd like to treat her wound,

418
00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:31.788
so would it be all right to go to the clinic?

419
00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:35.588
Yes, but please have the officer in the corridor accompany you.

420
00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:38.188
We're under surveillance, eh?

421
00:21:38.988 --> 00:21:41.088
Oh, and one more thing.

422
00:21:41.088 --> 00:21:45.788
You seem to be the only one who had left the house

423
00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:48.888
between 5:00 and 7:00, where to?

424
00:21:48.888 --> 00:21:51.888
I went as temporary basket ball coach for a high school club.

425
00:21:51.888 --> 00:21:53.588
It's my alma mater,

426
00:21:53.588 --> 00:21:57.288
and since my mentor broke his bone,

427
00:21:57.288 --> 00:21:59.888
I'm substituting for him until he recovers.

428
00:21:59.888 --> 00:22:03.088
You, a doctor, a basketball coach?

429
00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:06.688
You can go ahead and ask Ran about it.

430
00:22:06.688 --> 00:22:11.388
I go to coach for Teitan High School, the school that Ran goes to.

431
00:22:12.488 --> 00:22:15.688
You know the advisor of the basketball club Mr. Tabuchi, don't you?

432
00:22:15.688 --> 00:22:17.488
Oh, yes.

433
00:22:17.488 --> 00:22:20.088
Hey... don't tell me that

434
00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:23.988
the karate club that Ran was going to daily is...

435
00:22:25.388 --> 00:22:26.588
It can't be?

436
00:22:28.088 --> 00:22:29.288
It can't be?

437
00:24:00.288 --> 00:24:02.988
Just as I thought.

438
00:24:02.988 --> 00:24:05.788
Will you please go check the breaker?

439
00:24:05.788 --> 00:24:07.488
Okay.

440
00:24:08.588 --> 00:24:11.388
I wonder why the lights went out.

441
00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:13.688
Come to think of it, that man

442
00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:16.788
was saying something about experimenting while taking a bath.

443
00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:19.088
Don't tell me that dad...

444
00:24:20.088 --> 00:24:22.488
You're the killer, aren't you?

445
00:24:22.988 --> 00:24:24.388
Next Conan,

446
00:24:24.388 --> 00:24:28.509
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 2)"

447
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:31.906
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:31.906 --> 00:24:33.506
"Burn injury"

449
00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:36.206
-Next episode... -Ran's heart is changing.

450
00:24:36.206 --> 00:24:38.506
Shinichi's in a fix.
