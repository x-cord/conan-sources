1
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:07,024
On Sunday, right after summer vacation...

2
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:13,024
it was after we went to watch a movie with Dr. Agasa.

3
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:18,024
It's 2:00 pm sharp!

4
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:21,024
I just saw the clock strike 2:00 pm.

5
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:23,524
Yes, yes, how lucky of you.

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,824
Genta, your voice is too loud.

7
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:30,624
Hey, look at that! On top of the building!

8
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,824
What is it now?

9
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:36,124
Could they be fighting?

10
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:39,624
What a dangerous thing to do in a place like that.

11
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:42,924
He's been pushed off!

12
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:06,024
Aim for a 100% solution.

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,624
Clear all mysteries and codes.

14
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,724
Falling slowly, a strange phenomenon.

15
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:12,924
An unthinkable mystery that moves time.

16
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:14,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,424
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:06,262
"The Man Who Fell Slowly".

20
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:18,762
Excuse me.

21
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:22,062
Is the person who reported this is here?

22
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,262
Yes, it's me.

23
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:27,462
I happened to pass by here, on my way back from shopping.

24
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,862
That's why I called 911 right away.

25
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,362
I see.

26
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,262
That's strange.

27
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,262
Hey, sir!

28
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,562
He didn't commit suicide.

29
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,062
It's not an accident either.

30
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:56,962
Somebody pushed him off the roof.

31
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:58,262
What?

32
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:02,962
I'm Sakai, a paramedic from Beika.

33
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,662
About the fall accident I reported just a while ago,

34
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,862
there's a possibility of it being an attempted murder.

35
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,162
Yes.

36
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:14,062
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, age 37.

37
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,762
He resides in Central Beika City.

38
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:17,462
Miss.

39
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,362
You called the ambulance

40
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:22,162
at about 2:10, right?

41
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,462
Yes, at 2:10 sharp.

42
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:30,062
It's only been five to six minutes since the ambulance got here, right?

43
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,862
And right now, it just about 2:20 pm.

44
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,962
The estimated time it takes for the ambulance

45
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:40,062
to arrive at the scene is about five to six minutes.

46
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:41,662
The approximate time of the call was made

47
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,662
can be calculated by subtraction.

48
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:46,662
I see.

49
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,362
Wait.

50
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:51,162
We saw the man being pushed off...

51
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,162
That's right.

52
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,062
At 2:00 pm sharp.

53
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:55,062
Yeah.

54
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,762
In other words, it was a long fall that took 10 minutes to hit the ground.

55
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:01,662
And this building is only five stories tall.

56
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,962
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

57
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:07,162
Was this building that low?

58
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:10,362
No. It looked at least five stories tall.

59
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,162
-Hey. -Wait.

60
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:18,362
Hey, wait. There's an elevator.

61
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:20,262
But look at it.

62
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,362
"Out of order" -It's out of order.

63
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:31,662
He must've fallen right around down here.

64
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,362
I see, so that's how it is.

65
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:38,062
The first two floors are protruded

66
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:40,662
and there is a veranda on the third floor.

67
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:41,762
I see.

68
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,162
The man who was pushed off from here,

69
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,962
fell onto that veranda.

70
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:50,062
Then, he fell from there to the ground.

71
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,762
That's why it took 10 minutes.

72
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,762
Poor thing that he had to fall twice.

73
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,362
Anyway, let's go search inside the building.

74
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:00,262
According to the lady a while ago,

75
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:03,362
nobody came out of this building.

76
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,962
More than 10 minutes have passed already.

77
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,962
Maybe the culprit got away from the backdoor.

78
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,062
Backdoor!

79
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:12,462
A clue to the culprit maybe left there.

80
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:13,762
I'll go over that way!

81
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:14,762
-Okay! -Okay!

82
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,862
Hey, you guys!

83
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:20,862
In that case, we'll go check out that veranda.

84
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:24,862
From that location, it's this room you'll end up with.

85
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:27,162
"Ogata Finance" -Ogata Finance?

86
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,062
If I'm not mistaken, the victim was...

87
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:33,262
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, age 37.

88
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,562
Maybe this is his office.

89
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,862
A money lender?

90
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,862
Hey, Shinichi.

91
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:42,662
So, this is where the crime took place.

92
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:43,662
What?

93
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,762
"Out of order" -What?

94
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:51,262
After we found the backdoor...

95
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,962
It's chain locked, which means...

96
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:57,362
The culprit didn't flee from this backdoor.

97
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:59,362
If so, than where on earth did he escaped?

98
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,562
It seems that they were fighting.

99
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:09,962
I don't think it's good to go inside on your own.

100
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,362
A driver's license?

101
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:16,762
Ryohei Honda.

102
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:19,862
Since this is on the sofa that's toppled,

103
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:22,462
one the victim was struggling with must've been him.

104
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:24,662
Maybe he's the culprit.

105
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,162
We don't know that yet.

106
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:29,262
Hey, you guys.

107
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,462
The emergency stairs.

108
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:35,462
I'm sure that the culprit

109
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:39,262
ran down to the emergency stairs from the third floor and fled.

110
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:41,762
It's muddy here.

111
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,762
There are no footprints or what so ever here.

112
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,162
That can't be.

113
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:48,862
If the culprit neither used the front door nor the backdoor,

114
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:51,462
or even the emergency stairs,

115
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:53,862
where on earth did the culprit flee from?

116
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,862
No, there could be no other way.

117
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,062
Which means

118
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,362
the culprit is still inside this building.

119
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,762
He's hiding!

120
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,662
Then, I'll call Conan.

121
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,662
No.

122
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:06,162
Mitsuhiko?

123
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:07,662
Are you saying that we're looking for

124
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:10,262
the culprit who's hiding on our own?

125
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:15,562
-This is... -Yes. Drag marks.

126
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,062
And blood stains, too.

127
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,662
It seems that the culprit

128
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:24,762
dragged the victim who fell from the roof into the room once.

129
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:28,062
And then pushed him off again from here.

130
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,562
Glasses.

131
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,962
It resembles the one that the owner of the driver's license,

132
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:34,562
Honda was wearing.

133
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:37,662
It was found outside on the veranda, which means

134
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:40,262
as he was pushed off the roof,

135
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:44,762
the victim Mr. Ogata tore it off from the culprit.

136
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:48,262
If those glasses are unmistakably belong to the man called Honda,

137
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,062
then we've got the culprit already.

138
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,862
I guess there's nothing for us to do.

139
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,362
But if the culprit was planning to push him off again,

140
00:08:54,362 --> 00:09:00,262
why did he drag Mr. Ogata back into the room?

141
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:02,562
For what?

142
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:10,762
Are you the ones who witnessed Masaaki Ogata being pushed off?

143
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:13,562
But you shouldn't be in here on your own.

144
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,762
Not whilst accompanied by Mr. Agasa.

145
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,462
I'm very sorry.

146
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:19,862
Since you're here from headquarters,

147
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,762
it goes to show that Mr. Ogata is no ordinary citizen, right?

148
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,562
He's a notorious loan shark.

149
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:26,662
Chiba!

150
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:31,162
There are glasses outside on the veranda.

151
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:32,762
And this, too.

152
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,462
A driver's license?

153
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:36,362
Ryohei Honda?

154
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:40,662
Ryohei Honda...

155
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,962
It seems that these glasses are his too.

156
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:44,962
Yeah.

157
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,462
There seems to be no doubt that he came here and had it out with Ogata.

158
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:51,962
We'll have the district police to check it out for now.

159
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:53,262
Okay.

160
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,362
Okay, I'll go check the roof, then.

161
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,562
Okay.

162
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:05,762
I think it's better to tell the police

163
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,862
that the culprit is still inside this building

164
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:09,762
rather than look for him ourselves.

165
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,162
Let's do all that we can on our own first.

166
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,562
Mitsuhiko.

167
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:15,662
I'm vexed at myself!

168
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:18,162
Only if we'd have been more observant,

169
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:20,962
maybe we could've identified the culprit.

170
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,462
Mitsuhiko.

171
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,762
Okay.

172
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,862
I'll go search upstairs.

173
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:28,062
I'll go to the basement.

174
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,562
Launch search!

175
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,762
"Ogata Finance"

176
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:35,962
Yes, this is Takagi.

177
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:39,562
What? The whereabouts of Ryohei Honda is unknown?

178
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:44,562
Okay. I got it. Good work.

179
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,262
It seems that he went out without telling anyone where he was going

180
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:49,562
and hasn't returned home after leaving his residence after noon.

181
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,362
He seems to have run into his old acquaintance yesterday

182
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:56,562
and went out to see that person.

183
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:59,262
That's the report we got. It seems conclusive already.

184
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,962
But it still bothers me.

185
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,962
Why was the body dragged back into the room?

186
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,462
Oh, no.

187
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,662
"Komehana Boots Shop" -Boots?

188
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,562
Nothing strange about it, right?

189
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:15,962
It's raining.

190
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:18,462
But this receipt is last night's.

191
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:21,362
The weather forecast yesterday said that it would be a fine day today.

192
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:25,062
"Ogata Finance"

193
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:30,262
He's not here in this room either.

194
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,062
He wasn't hiding anywhere upstairs!

195
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:36,162
That was really fast. Did you really check carefully?

196
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,362
For sure.

197
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,262
You guys.

198
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,462
What was that scream just now?

199
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,762
It's Ayumi!

200
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,762
She said she was going to check the basement.

201
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,262
Hey, Ayumi!

202
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:48,962
Ayumi.

203
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:51,462
Ayumi, are you all right?

204
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:53,862
Ms. Yoshida!

205
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,262
Are you okay? Ayumi!

206
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,062
A mouse...

207
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:03,262
I'm glad you weren't bitten.

208
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:06,862
Rather, thank God you weren't caught by the culprit.

209
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,162
Yeah.

210
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,662
There's no chance that Honda would still be here.

211
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,662
Who's Honda?

212
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:14,962
-You've already know who the culprit is? -You know about the culprit?

213
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:16,262
Well, no.

214
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:18,762
There's only one car,

215
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,962
so does that mean it belongs to that man?

216
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:23,662
Is something matter?

217
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:26,962
-Boots? -Yeah.

218
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,062
Together with something else that's bothering me.

219
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,062
A shovel?

220
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:34,262
The way these two things would be utilized is...

221
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,462
It's pretty limited.

222
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:39,762
"Out of order" -No clue on the roof.

223
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,562
Is there anyone here?

224
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:48,362
This is the police.

225
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,662
If anyone is here, please answer me.

226
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,962
Who is Honda?

227
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,962
You know him too, don't you?

228
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:06,362
So, nothing's conclusive yet.

229
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:10,762
Yes, Takagi here.

230
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:12,662
Oh, it's you, Chiba.

231
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:16,062
Caught? Who is it?

232
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,262
Me. I was caught by the culprit.

233
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,062
What? The culprit?

234
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,312
I didn't ask you to come.

235
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,312
I just asked for a get-away car.

236
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:39,712
It was you after all, Honda?

237
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,812
So he's the guy called Honda.

238
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:45,112
The culprit was still inside this building after all.

239
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,912
-Yes. -Right.

240
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:50,112
Why'd he do something like this?

241
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,812
Why'd you do it, Honda?

242
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:55,212
Why'd you kill Ogata?

243
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,912
Who are you?

244
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,812
Did you forget me?

245
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:01,312
I don't remember anything!

246
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:04,712
It seems he's got amnesia.

247
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:07,512
Amnesia?

248
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,612
That's why he did this.

249
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:11,612
Honda, listen to me.

250
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:14,812
You're not the type of person that do something like this.

251
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,212
I arrested you eight years ago

252
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:20,212
for alleged robbery.

253
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,512
I committed a robbery?

254
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:23,612
Yeah.

255
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,812
With a guy you happened to run into at a pub.

256
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:31,512
But the only clue that we had was that your accomplice had a hoarse voice

257
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,812
and that wasn't enough to nab him,

258
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,312
so you ended up serving time alone.

259
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:38,712
But after completing your sentence,

260
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,112
you changed into a fine man!

261
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,612
Not only that.

262
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:45,212
After taking your father's small factory,

263
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:49,912
you took in people who had criminal records like you as factory workers

264
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,212
and supported them.

265
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:55,012
I did something like that?

266
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:57,012
He's a very good man.

267
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,712
-Yes. -Yeah.

268
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:02,612
Why would somebody like you go back to commit another crime?

269
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,912
What's your connection with Ogata?

270
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,812
Yes, a connection.

271
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:09,112
Between this man and the victim.

272
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,512
Come to think of it, a while ago...

273
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,412
He seems to have run into old acquaintance yesterday

274
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:19,712
and went out to see that person.

275
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,712
If that's case...

276
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:34,512
I got it. So, that's how it was.

277
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:38,212
Honda, what went on between you and Ogata?

278
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,312
I've been trying to tell you.

279
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,612
I don't know what on earth is going on.

280
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,312
Where am I?

281
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:56,712
It seems that I had it out with someone over there.

282
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:05,512
I... I pushed him down from here?

283
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:08,512
I was afraid of getting caught.

284
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:12,012
But I had a headache and felt faint.

285
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,212
I figured out that I should hide myself.

286
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:19,612
When I finally thought that I could somehow manage to move...

287
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:26,312
"Out of order" -No clue on the roof.

288
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,212
Is there anyone here?

289
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:29,812
This is the police.

290
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:32,312
Police?

291
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,412
I didn't want to get caught.

292
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:39,612
But why did I try to kill him to begin with?

293
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:41,412
If he doesn't know,

294
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:44,112
there's no way anyone else would know.

295
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,412
So, there's no other way than for a detective to solve it for him.

296
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:52,312
Why did I try to kill that man?

297
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,012
You're wrong, Mr. Honda.

298
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:58,012
Didn't you come to visit Masaaki Ogata

299
00:16:58,012 --> 00:17:00,812
because he was an old acquaintance of yours?

300
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,912
Old acquaintance?

301
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,212
Officer Takagi,

302
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:08,612
I think that Masaaki Ogata had a hoarse voice.

303
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,812
Yes, a very gruff one.

304
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,512
Can't you remember, Mr. Honda?

305
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:15,212
It's the man with a hoarse voice.

306
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:19,212
You became acquainted with that man eight years ago at a pub.

307
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,312
It couldn't be.

308
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:24,012
Eight years ago,

309
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,112
a man with a hoarse voice.

310
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,612
I got to know him at a pub.

311
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:32,212
A man with a hoarse voice...

312
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:33,812
It's him!

313
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:36,012
He looked completely different,

314
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:38,012
but his voice...

315
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:43,812
I'll collect the money from you even I have to go to hell!

316
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,812
You get that?

317
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,612
What's with you?

318
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:53,512
It's you after all.

319
00:17:56,212 --> 00:17:58,612
It's true it's been eight years ago,

320
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:01,112
but the statute of limitations hasn't run out yet.

321
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:03,112
So you're telling me to turn myself in?

322
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:04,612
If you pay for your sins,

323
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,112
you can live your life under the sun

324
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,812
without feeling guilty towards anyone, right?

325
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:16,312
I was somehow trying to get him to turn himself in.

326
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,412
He's a good person after all, isn't he?

327
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:19,412
But...

328
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,012
That good man ended up...

329
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,412
So how'd you end up killing Ogata, then?

330
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,512
I don't remember that part.

331
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:28,712
It's the other way around.

332
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:32,512
Since you knew the wrongdoings of the past,

333
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,812
Masaaki Ogata tried to get rid of you.

334
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,012
After killing you,

335
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:38,312
he was probably planning to take your body to the remote mountains

336
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:39,912
to bury and hide it.

337
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,512
After making preparations to do so,

338
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,812
he called you over to come to your office that was empty

339
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,412
because it was a holiday.

340
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:47,912
Ogata carried out his scheme.

341
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,812
But he failed to kill you.

342
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:56,812
So he ended up pushing you off the roof.

343
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,312
Which means that when we saw it...

344
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:05,012
The one who was pushed down...

345
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,712
Was Mr. Honda?

346
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:11,612
Then Mr. Honda, who Ogata was ready to finish off

347
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:14,112
was dragged back into the office.

348
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:18,412
As proof of this... See? His jacket is soiled.

349
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:20,712
But the one who fell to the ground

350
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,812
was the one called Ogata.

351
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:24,212
Exactly.

352
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:25,812
However back then,

353
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,912
Mr. Honda had incurred a severe blow to his head

354
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:31,712
that was bad enough to cause amnesia and passed out.

355
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,012
So he couldn't have pushed Masaaki Ogata down.

356
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:37,312
If so, there's only one plausible explanation.

357
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:40,112
Masaaki Ogata, after finishing his target off,

358
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,112
was scheming to bury and hide him as planned.

359
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:45,312
In order to do so,

360
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:49,312
he had to hide traces of Mr. Honda coming over.

361
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:56,712
I've got to get rid of that too.

362
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,712
Where's his glasses?

363
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:00,012
Are they here?

364
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,612
There it is.

365
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:08,412
However, he was leaning on a really slippery surface.

366
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:10,912
Back then... Remember?

367
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:23,412
In other words, it was not that one person was pushed off twice,

368
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:26,712
but two people switched places partway

369
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:29,712
in a matter of 10 minutes.

370
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:33,712
So that's the truth behind the long fall.

371
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,812
What a bummer.

372
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,612
Honda.

373
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,612
It may be true that you did nothing

374
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:52,412
as far as Masaaki Ogata is concerned.

375
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:55,812
But you attacked and went as far as to confine Officer Chiba.

376
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,112
But Inspector...

377
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:59,012
That's a fact.

378
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:01,012
Inspector.

379
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,012
You'll have to come with me.

380
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,112
Yes, sir.

381
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,012
I feel sorry for him.

382
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:08,112
-Yeah. -Yeah.

383
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:09,412
Conan.

384
00:21:09,412 --> 00:21:13,112
There's nothing I can do about it.

385
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:16,112
He may have panicked after losing his memory,

386
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:18,812
but he did what he did and that's fact.

387
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,412
Besides,

388
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,012
I think he understands more than anyone else does.

389
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:26,912
I'm sorry for troubling you.

390
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,312
Not at all.

391
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:31,112
Never mind the handcuffs.

392
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,912
I'm asking him to come along voluntarily.

393
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:36,312
But before that, let's take you to the hospital.

394
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:40,312
Let's have them treat your head wound, Mr. Honda.

395
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:42,712
Masaaki Ogata was arrested

396
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:44,712
under charges of the robbery that was committed eight years ago,

397
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:48,712
as well as the attempted murder against Mr. Honda soon after the incident.

398
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:51,112
Both of the charges were dropped shortly.

399
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:17,312
Dr. Agasa, you really did a good job again this time too, didn't you?

400
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,212
-For sure. -Yes.

401
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:21,212
Well, I guess so.

402
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:24,912
A rainbow.

403
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:29,012
-Splendid. -It's pretty!

404
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:32,412
I knew that things would turn out this way to begin with.

405
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,712
That the incident would start at 2:00,

406
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,012
that is, it would start out like the movie "The Double Hour"

407
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:38,712
but end up happily like when one views a double rainbow.

408
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:40,512
Another one of his puns.

409
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,412
I went out of my way to compliment him.

410
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:44,012
All down the drain.

411
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,012
Another punch line with a long decent.

412
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:48,812
What a far-fetched analogy.

413
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:50,512
It's like always.

414
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:53,812
"Next Episode" -What seems to be matter?

415
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:59,112
That's the concept of the design plan

416
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:01,412
that Mr. Murase showed to Mr. Inomata.

417
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:02,912
I think it would be more accurate to say that

418
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:06,012
this is not an accident, but rather a homicide.

419
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:09,812
However, why was Mr. Inomata there?

420
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:10,812
This is...

421
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:18,112
Next Conan,

422
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:20,212
"Unidentified Impact".

423
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:40,112
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,012
"Cable tie".

425
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,512
-A guitar. -A bass.

426
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,112
-And drums. -Who's the vocalist?

427
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:46,912
No band here.
