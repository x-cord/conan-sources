1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,560
A racing second hand,
a glittering shooting star!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,470
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,730
Today's point is evidence-finding!
Don't overlook anything important!

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,140
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,390
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,970
His name?

7
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,499
"The Hobo Artist Murder Case."

8
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,169
Beika Art Museum

9
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:47,629
Abstract Art of the World

10
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,829
It was nice of my client to give
me free passes for solving his case,

11
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,479
but these make no sense!

12
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,439
Yeah, but they're still pretty!

13
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,399
You serious?

14
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,189
I agree with you, old man.

15
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,619
What's that guy up to?

16
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:26,209
Please, sir! Don't touch the art!
And smoking is prohibited!

17
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,669
Oh, sorry...

18
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,349
What a weirdo.

19
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,969
Okay! Here goes!
Catch it, you guys!

20
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:45,439
Why are we playing baseball
and not soccer?!

21
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,949
Conan! It's all yours!

22
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,489
Where are you aiming?!

23
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:02,789
Are you all right?! I'm so sorry!

24
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,579
Oh? Didn't I see you at the...

25
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,889
You were drawing sketches?

26
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:15,689
Huh? He was drawing these just now?

27
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,849
Why do you always
draw the same pictures?

28
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,009
Why... do I always...

29
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,559
I don't know...

30
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:30,619
Hey, Conan. Is he hurt?

31
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:32,409
Shall we call an ambulance?!

32
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,149
Are you serious?!

33
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,709
Who... who am I?

34
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,329
I can't even remember my name...

35
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,269
Does he have amnesia?!

36
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:46,619
Because of me?!

37
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,289
No! The ball hit his arm!

38
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:54,459
My head hurts!

39
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,339
Are you all right?!

40
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:59,299
My head... my head hurts!

41
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,259
Yamada General Hospital

42
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,769
So, he really has amnesia?

43
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:11,359
Yes. His headaches occur
as his memory slowly returns.

44
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,089
What a surprise...

45
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,319
What a shock...

46
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,909
So, he still doesn't
know who he is...

47
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,159
Poor guy...

48
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,539
Don't worry! We notified the police,
so we'll know soon enough!

49
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:40,969
Whoops! I forgot to
leave his sketchbook!

50
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,609
It's that man's, right?

51
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,179
Then let's go back!

52
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,089
You two, check the emergency exit!

53
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,399
Yes, sir!

54
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,109
Did something happen?

55
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,069
Actually, the patient you
brought in just disappeared.

56
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,619
I take it he didn't leave
through the front door.

57
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,249
No, we haven't seen him.

58
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,329
What about his clothes and things?

59
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:12,789
It looks like he changed clothes
and took his things with him.

60
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:18,909
Did his memory return?!
But then why would he disappear?

61
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:20,459
Just where did he go?

62
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:25,719
Ready?! Here it comes!

63
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,309
Ugh! Why aren't we playing soccer?!

64
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,359
Genta-kun! It's yours!

65
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,609
I got it! It's all mine!

66
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,279
Ow...

67
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,109
You okay, Genta?!

68
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,319
What the...

69
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:49,449
It's the man from yesterday!

70
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,579
Did the ball hit him again?!

71
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,499
No!

72
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,959
He was strangled with
string or something!

73
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,009
No way!

74
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,329
He was murdered?!

75
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,579
Inspector, he was strangled to death,
probably sometime last evening.

76
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,119
His pockets are empty.

77
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,729
Alright, Conan!

78
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,619
What's the big idea?! Bugging
the inspector again, are ya?!

79
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:24,739
No, no, Mori-kun.
These children discovered the body.

80
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,789
The victim was here last night, too?

81
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,789
Yes!

82
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,829
Perhaps the killer marked him
and mugged him when he was alone...

83
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,209
A robbery, huh?

84
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,709
Oh, brother...

85
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,719
Say, Inspector! The victim's
paint supplies are gone!

86
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,369
Paint supplies?

87
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,979
His canvas and easel are gone, too!

88
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,499
So is his paint box!

89
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,679
His bag, too!

90
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,539
He had such items?

91
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,899
They must've been stolen as well.

92
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:02,909
Yeah, right! Nobody'd ever steal
that junk, it'd just weigh 'em down!

93
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,709
Besides, one of his
shoelaces is in a granny knot,

94
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,619
which means he didn't tie it himself.

95
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,959
The ginkgo leaf in his shoe
is strange, too.

96
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,539
There are no ginkgo trees here.

97
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:21,619
Judging from his location,
he must've been killed somewhere

98
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:25,049
and tossed over the bridge
during the night!

99
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:28,499
And why did he disappear
from the hospital?

100
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,679
This doesn't seem like
any ordinary mugging to me!

101
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:37,829
We need to find out who he is first...

102
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:40,709
Say, Inspector, I think this is actually--

103
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:45,399
Hey! I'll tolerate you getting
in my way, but not the Inspector's!

104
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,949
But...

105
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,289
Go play somewhere else!

106
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,499
Now, then, Inspector.
Let's have a look at the victim.

107
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:56,079
Okay! Let's get started!

108
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,629
What should we do?

109
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,459
We're the Junior Detective League!

110
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,419
Wow! Talk about dependable!

111
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,669
Department Store

112
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:14,269
So, behind the house is a pylon
on the right and a factory on the left...

113
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,629
I get it!

114
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,579
So we just find that house!

115
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,659
Okay! Let's do it!

116
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,069
Not here!

117
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,529
Nor here!

118
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:32,249
It's not here, either!
How about you, Ayumi-chan?

119
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:34,199
I found it!

120
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,839
There it is!
It even has a ginkgo tree!

121
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,799
Okita House Cleaning

122
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,249
"Hayase..."

123
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:50,259
This car's brand new.

124
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:56,219
Why does she want it so clean
that there's not a single hair left?

125
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:58,709
It's the same with the house.

126
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,939
She wants everything a
person might touch wiped clean.

127
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,869
Don't tell me it's
to erase fingerprints...

128
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:11,239
Hey! What're you guys doing?!

129
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,659
lt's still dirty. Go through again and-- oh?
Hayase Kimie (37)

130
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,619
Hello!

131
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,749
Here you are!

132
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:27,289
Oh, yes! I have some nice
cookies! Just a minute!

133
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,089
Her apron's tied with a granny knot!

134
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,369
The sofas and tables are
different, and there's no tv.

135
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,869
It's completely different
from the pictures.

136
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:43,609
Say, Miss. Did you
remodel this room recently?

137
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,829
Yes. Why do you ask?

138
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,739
Where's all the old stuff?

139
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:50,909
I threw it all away.

140
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:52,889
Is that painting new, too?

141
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:53,909
Yes.

142
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,619
It arrived from the art gallery
just two days ago.

143
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:58,939
Isn't it lovely?

144
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:04,079
This is bad. It'll be hard to prove, now...

145
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,789
Incidentally,
what did you want to ask me?

146
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:10,159
Um, you go, Mitsuhiko-kun...

147
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,469
What was it, again?

148
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:14,299
Conan-kun! Look at that!

149
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,959
Hayase Tatsuo (47)
lt's him!

150
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,959
lt looks just like him!
Hayase Tatsuo (47)

151
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,689
Even that characteristic nose
is the same!
Hayase Tatsuo (47)

152
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,649
Huh? He's wearing glasses!

153
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,579
Who's he?

154
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:28,709
My husband.

155
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,229
When did he pass away?

156
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,109
Why?

157
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,069
He looks just like a murder
victim discovered this morning!

158
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:38,619
Then it was someone else.
My husband supposedly died a year ago.

159
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:39,959
Supposedly?

160
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,659
Disaster disappearance?

161
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,289
A person is normally presumed
dead after going missing for seven years,

162
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:49,579
but people in natural
disasters or shipwrecks

163
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,629
are presumed dead after only one year.

164
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,349
Come to think of it, a rich
banker by the name of Hayase

165
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:03,769
was caught in an avalanche
and went missing a year ago...

166
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,079
Yeah! That's him!

167
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,229
You have a good memory, Dad!

168
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,829
That's why I'm such a great detective.

169
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:16,569
Back then, there were rumors that
he embezzled huge sums of money.

170
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,829
He was just about to be investigated,

171
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,039
so the authorities figured
it was a sham at first.

172
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,249
The embezzled money
couldn't be tracked down,

173
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,499
so it was assumed
he disappeared with it.

174
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,879
But, it was eventually called
a disaster disappearance?

175
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,039
Yeah.

176
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,099
Anyway, Conan. Have you
told Inspector Megure?

177
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:44,179
Yeah! He had her verify the body!

178
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,459
District Police Station - Charnel

179
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,149
He resembles my husband, but it's not him.

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,249
Say, does the late Hayase-san
have any relatives?

181
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,109
A father, or mother, or siblings?

182
00:11:56,109 --> 00:12:01,029
No. He had no relatives.
Why do you ask?

183
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,459
No reason...

184
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,869
In other words, you're the
only one who can verify his body?

185
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,459
I suppose so.

186
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,459
No smoking!

187
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,959
Sorry...

188
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,639
Incidentally,
did Mr. Hayase do paintings?

189
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:22,289
Yeah! We can check the
fingerprints on his old things!

190
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:23,809
Right, Inspector?!

191
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,849
Yes.

192
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:28,619
My husband did indeed paint.

193
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:32,459
He was painting in the mountains
when the avalanche struck.

194
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,279
But I threw out all his things.

195
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,739
All of them?

196
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,579
The media and society
started to condemn me, too,

197
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,619
for the whole embezzlement thing.

198
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,749
I wanted to forget my husband quickly.

199
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:53,749
In the end, all we can
do is take her word for it...

200
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,789
No! There's no doubt that
the victim is Hayase Tatsuo-san!

201
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,959
There's gotta be
some way to prove it!

202
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,389
Hello!

203
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,599
Oh...

204
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,319
Sorry! We left
something here last time!

205
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,249
Those cookies earlier were so good!

206
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,619
We'd love to have more!

207
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,829
Oh, is that what you "left" here?

208
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:25,619
Bingo!

209
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:27,119
Just a minute!

210
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,499
Are there any traces
left that the victim was here?!

211
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,709
What're you doing, Conan?

212
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:39,629
Some kind of burn mark...

213
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,389
Ginkgo leaves...

214
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,709
If they're lying here, then they'd
come inside if the window was open...

215
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,809
Wait a minute! The leaf,
the window, the burn mark,

216
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:55,729
the glasses-less victim,
and the painting on the wall!

217
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,829
I've finally found it!

218
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:01,829
Proof that Hayase-san
returned here with his memory intact!

219
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:12,325
Inspector Megure! The victim is
unquestionably Hayase Tatsuo-san!

220
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:15,285
I've finally found proof of it!

221
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,995
What?! Really, Mori-kun?!

222
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:22,375
Seriously, Inspector Megure?!

223
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,835
Yes! Come immediately, Mori-kun!

224
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,995
Now, what is this all about?!

225
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,895
I understand how you feel.
Mori-kun will explain...

226
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:39,615
But I thought you were going to--

227
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:44,235
But, I guess not.

228
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:49,785
Allow me to shed light on
the truth behind this incident.

229
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:53,995
One year ago, Mr. Hayase went
into the mountains to paint

230
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,205
and was caught in an avalanche.

231
00:14:57,575 --> 00:15:01,445
He luckily survived,
but lost his memory.

232
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:05,905
He then walked all over
as a wandering artist,

233
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,005
unconsciously drawing
his house all the while.

234
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:18,355
A year passed, and he was judged
to have disappeared by disaster.

235
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:22,815
In short, his wife inherited his estate.

236
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:24,145
So?

237
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,575
So, you couldn't
have him showing up now!

238
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,615
What do you mean, Mori-kun?

239
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:36,575
Her inheritance likely included
the missing money he had embezzled!

240
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:43,405
So, she killed Mr. Hayase when
he returned yesterday, memory intact!

241
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,915
So she could keep all the money!

242
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:48,585
Are you serious, Mori-kun?!

243
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,075
My husband died in
the mountains a year ago.

244
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:57,805
Or do you have proof he was alive?

245
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:04,245
You're right, I don't. That's because
you disposed of all of his things.

246
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:10,575
Naturally, you removed all
possible fingerprints and hairs, too!

247
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:14,785
You even hired a cleaning
company to be extra sure!

248
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:19,365
Which means you can't prove anything.

249
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:24,325
But, the victim left behind
a connection with you:

250
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,995
a gingko leaf in his shoe.

251
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:30,795
There were no gingko
trees where he was found.

252
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:37,265
Yes, there's a gingko tree next to
my house... and all over Tokyo, too!

253
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:42,695
One other thing, for some reason,
only one of the victim's shoelaces

254
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:47,735
was in a granny knot...
just like your apron!

255
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,495
You're right!

256
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,815
Now that you mention it...

257
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:56,075
Probably, when you put his
shoes on after killing him,

258
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,785
you noticed one was untied!

259
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:05,245
Not wanting to be suspected,
you decided to tie it.

260
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:09,215
Claiming I did it because
of a granny knot? Hilarious.

261
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:14,675
I'll have no more of these insults!
I'll take you to court!

262
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,325
Dad...

263
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:20,845
Are you sure about this, Mori-kun?
You have proof, I hope?!

264
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:24,245
Well, then, let me
get to the real point.

265
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,185
Ran! Stand in front of the painting!

266
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,605
Me?

267
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:28,655
Yes.

268
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:29,855
Okay...

269
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:33,425
Like this?

270
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,445
That's just fine.

271
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:39,785
Now, Miss. Was Mr. Hayase
a heavy smoker?

272
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:41,995
That's right.

273
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:45,415
And you hate cigarettes, correct?

274
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,545
No smoking!

275
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:49,835
Sorry...

276
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,715
What about it?

277
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:58,175
Mr. Hayase, after regaining his
memory and leaving the hospital,

278
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:04,825
stood in front of this painting,
cigarette in mouth.

279
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:08,825
Naturally, you opened the window.

280
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:13,035
Several ginkgo leaves
likely fell inside then.

281
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:19,115
One got stuck to his foot
while he was inside the house.

282
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:24,075
But how do you know
he was smoking there?

283
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:29,195
Because of the burn mark
on the wooden cabinet.

284
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:34,085
As there was no ashtray in
the house, he put it out there.

285
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:40,425
I hope you're not going to make
me laugh by saying that's your proof.

286
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:44,895
Miss, was Mr. Hayase near-sighted?

287
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,725
Yes.

288
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:48,575
Ran, think back.

289
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:52,605
Look at that painting the way
he did at the Beika Art Museum.

290
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:56,105
If I remember right...

291
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:03,655
I think he got near it and--

292
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,285
Stop!

293
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,665
What is it?

294
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:12,255
I get it! His fingerprints, Dad!

295
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:16,825
Fingerprints? Are you saying
there are some on that painting?

296
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:22,215
But you said she cleaned the
whole place of fingerprints and hair!

297
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,535
Yes. She even hired a cleaning company.

298
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:29,435
But think about it, Inspector.

299
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,645
No professional would
wipe down a bare painting.

300
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:36,035
That's true...

301
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:40,615
But, if he had a habit of grabbing
paintings, she would've known!

302
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:46,615
No. That habit began
after he lost his memory.

303
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:51,835
Before he got amnesia, Mr. Hayase
wore glasses for his near-sightedness.

304
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,755
But, he lost them in the avalanche.

305
00:19:55,155 --> 00:20:00,345
After that, he started getting close
to paintings because of his poor vision.

306
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:04,265
And he formed a habit of
grabbing them to get a good look.

307
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:08,905
When Mr. Hayase returned here
and looked at the painting,

308
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:13,435
his wife likely opened the
window to air out the smoke.

309
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:18,405
As her back was to him,
she probably didn't notice this.

310
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,365
So, she overlooked it?

311
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:25,655
Miss. Can you explain why
your husband's fingerprints

312
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:29,785
are on a picture you
put up two days ago?

313
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,995
Takagi-kun! Call the examiners!
Check for prints!

314
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:33,705
Right!

315
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:35,795
I concede.

316
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:43,215
He did come here.
It's all as the detective said.

317
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:50,935
I killed him. I drugged his coffee
and strangled him with a rope.

318
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:55,525
Still, why did you dump him
in such a conspicuous spot?

319
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:58,575
I didn't want to wait any longer!

320
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:02,985
He was finally classified as missing
and I got his embezzled money!

321
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:07,535
If people learned he
was alive, amnesia or not,

322
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:10,365
he might've lost all his money!

323
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:16,825
Seriously! I suffered because
my husband was an embezzler...

324
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,745
That money was mine!

325
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:25,465
I wanted to get my time,
and life, back!

326
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:32,325
You'll have plenty of time.
Behind bars, that is.

327
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:10,405
Another great nap!

328
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:15,405
Way to go, Dad! You even
solved the missing-persons case!

329
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,585
Maybe I should hire you, too...

330
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:20,085
Huh? Did someone go missing?

331
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:21,875
Bad feeling about this...

332
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:23,785
You know who!

333
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:27,335
That lousy Shinichi'll never
come back unless I look for him!

334
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:28,715
I knew it.

335
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:33,155
I refuse! He'll ruin my
reputation if he comes back!

336
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,995
I hope he stays missing forever!

337
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:41,995
You know the score, all right!

338
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:48,155
Shiina-kun? What're you doing?
What's with that car?

339
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:51,865
Come on, Shiina-kun!
Say something, will ya?!

340
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,675
Minami-chan's been--

341
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:02,875
kidnapped!

342
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:07,155
Darn it! A kidnapping
right before my eyes?!

343
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,825
On the next Conan:

344
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:13,215

Abduction Case (Part 1)."
