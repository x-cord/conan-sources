1
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:03,215
Ms. Kobayashi witnesses a murder

2
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:05,815
during the night of the fireworks.

3
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:08,215
Never mind, just give me that!

4
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,515
I'm going to kill you.

5
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,315
Are you all right?

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,115
The victim is the woman owner of a pawn shop,

7
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:20,015
Ms. Akira Sumida.

8
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,715
Among the people who held a grudge against her,

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,015
three people were brought in as suspects

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,915
because they had no alibi on the day of the murder.

11
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:29,515
However, despite Ms. Kobayashi overhearing quarreling

12
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:31,815
between the culprit and the victim,

13
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:34,215
she was unable to select a voice

14
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:36,815
that matched the bellowing from the recorded voices.

15
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:39,515
Ms. Kobayashi is acting strange.

16
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:43,815
She for some reason seems to be avoiding Inspector Shiratori.

17
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,615
It seems she misunderstood

18
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:48,015
the relationship between Officer Sato and Inspector Shiratori.

19
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,215
Inspector Shiratori visits Teitan Elementary School

20
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:54,015
to get rid of her misunderstanding but...

21
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:58,215
I've met you long, long time ago.

22
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:00,315
The little girl that stopped some boys

23
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:02,515
from shoplifting in a bookstore.

24
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:05,715
I was moved by that girl.

25
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,515
That's why I became a police officer.

26
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,715
After seeing how courageous you were.

27
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:14,415
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

28
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:17,715
Besides, isn't that girl...

29
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:21,715
I think you've mistaken Officer Sato for me, haven't you?

30
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,015
If you will excuse me...

31
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:25,015
Wait.

32
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:47,515
Brooding over passing seasons

33
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:49,515
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

34
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:51,415
Both love and the case is solved at once?

35
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,415
News about Thief Kid comes bursting in too.

36
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:55,115
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,915
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,215
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:31,728
"Timeless Cherry Blossom Love Affair"

40
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,328
It seems that your trump card...

41
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:37,928
didn't work for you.

42
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,928
It's because you keep putting it off and don't tell her about it.

43
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,628
Besides, didn't you change the story too?

44
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:46,128
You didn't become an officer

45
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:50,028
because you saw Ms. Kobayashi bite back at the shoplifters,

46
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,728
but because of the cherry blossom flower decoration

47
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:56,528
she made out of a paper straw wrapper and gave to you, right?

48
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,828
Right, right.

49
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:00,928
It's because Ms. Kobayashi told you that Cherry blossoms are a mark

50
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:02,528
that all people of the police have on them

51
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,728
and that they symbolize strength, kindness

52
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:07,128
and is an awesome flower of justice isn't it?

53
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,428
No.

54
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,428
I thought it better to tell her that I became a police officer

55
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,928
because I saw how courageous she was.

56
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,228
I think that the words "courageous" and "police detective"

57
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,528
made Ms. Kobayashi imagine Officer Sato, who resembled her.

58
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,828
I'll go rephrase my sentence.

59
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,628
No good.

60
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:27,828
Making excuses from now would only worsen the situation.

61
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:30,428
I don't think she'd even give you a chance to talk.

62
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,228
What should I do, then?

63
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,328
There's only one way...

64
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:39,028
If you arrest the culprit that Ms. Kobayashi witnessed

65
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,428
and prove that her testimony was correct,

66
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,928
maybe she'll open her heart.

67
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:45,928
No, but...

68
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,528
But, weren't there any suspects

69
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:50,928
that matched the voice that Ms. Kobayashi heard?

70
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:51,928
No.

71
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,928
She did say that she saw the silhouetted figure

72
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,728
of the culprit flee, though.

73
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:01,728
It seems that all she could tell was that the woman had breasts

74
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,628
and had her long hair bunched and tied in the back.

75
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:06,928
Besides, the mover's truck-like vehicle

76
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,628
with large numbers "0" and "9" printed on it,

77
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:10,728
that she also saw hasn't been found either.

78
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,028
What kind of people were the suspects?

79
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:16,128
A former leader of a woman motorbike gang

80
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:19,528
with a foul mouth, Ms. Kikuna Kagitani.

81
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,028
And the woman owner of a Japanese cuisine restaurant,

82
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,928
who had a cold, Ms. Ryoko Takimoto.

83
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:27,228
Finally, former high school baseball player who hurt his shoulder

84
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:32,028
and is now working at a host club, Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

85
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:35,728
But at this point it's difficult to pinpoint the culprit

86
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,428
based on Ms. Kobayashi's testimony.

87
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:40,628
Then, are saying that Ms. Kobayashi is lying?

88
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:43,428
Ms. Kobayashi would never lie.

89
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,628
No.

90
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:47,028
Then, all we have to do is make a deduction.

91
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:50,128
That is, why Ms. Kobayashi was put under that illusion?

92
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,728
-An illusion? -Right. An illusion.

93
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,728
Conan!

94
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,728
What's up, Conan?

95
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,828
Was someone there?

96
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,828
Yes, a suspicious looking silhouetted figure

97
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,728
was looking in on us.

98
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:08,128
Wasn't it the culprit?

99
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,428
It's possible.

100
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:12,728
Since it seems that the culprit saw Ms. Kobayashi's face.

101
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:13,928
Idiot.

102
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,928
You can't tell who or where the person is

103
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:17,628
from by just looking at someone's face.

104
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,828
The culprit is probably is a camera brat

105
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,728
who relishes sneakily taking pictures of little girls or something.

106
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,128
What?

107
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:26,328
Well, staying here isn't going to get us anywhere

108
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,728
so let's head home.

109
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:31,828
Ms. Kobayashi said she'd be working late today again making texts,

110
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,328
so she won't be coming out for some time yet.

111
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,628
Hey, Conan!

112
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,328
-Please wait! -Conan!

113
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,128
Hey, you guys...

114
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:06,128
Yes, this is Teitan Elementary.

115
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,928
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

116
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,728
I'm calling from the police.

117
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,028
May I speak to Ms. Kobayashi please?

118
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:14,428
I'm Kobayashi.

119
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:17,028
I said I have nothing more to tell the police.

120
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:19,528
The car with the numbers "0" and "9"

121
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:23,128
that you witnessed has been found.

122
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:24,428
We've taken a picture of it,

123
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:27,028
so I was wondering if you could confirm it.

124
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:31,228
Yes. Then please come with that picture at a later date.

125
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:34,428
No, since I wanted you to confirm it right away,

126
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,828
I had the guard open the gate for me,

127
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,028
and I'm already in the school building.

128
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,028
I see.

129
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:41,828
Then, please come to the teachers' room.

130
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,928
How about the music room?

131
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,328
The thing is, this is my alma mater,

132
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:48,128
and I used to belong to the brass band club.

133
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:52,228
I felt so nostalgic that I was looking around here and there.

134
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:53,628
Really?

135
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:55,328
I'll see you in the music room, then.

136
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:57,128
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

137
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,528
This school is his alma mater?

138
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,428
I wonder what year he graduated.

139
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:08,028
Maybe he used to be my classmate.

140
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:21,728
But the music room was renovated last year

141
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,528
and all the walls and desks were changed,

142
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,728
so how could he feel nostalgic?

143
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:32,828
Besides, his voice just now sounds familiar.

144
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,828
"Music Room"

145
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,728
Make sure you be careful when you fall.

146
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:27,028
Darn. What the...

147
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,428
Who the hell are you?

148
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:30,428
The Metropolitan Police Department First Investigation Division,

149
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:32,928
Criminal Investigation Section 3,

150
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,028
Assistant Inspector, Miwako Sato.

151
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:36,628
Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

152
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:38,128
An officer?

153
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,828
Aren't you a teacher?

154
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:44,328
The real teacher was taken into custody

155
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,228
in the corridor by Officer Shiratori

156
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:49,328
and they switched.

157
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:52,828
Which means that you knew that I'd come here?

158
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,128
Yes.

159
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,228
By what Ms. Kobayashi testified.

160
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,428
Don't be ridiculous.

161
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,228
She also said unreliable things such as the culprit is a woman

162
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:03,428
or that she saw a car with the numbers "0" and "9" printed on it.

163
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:06,428
Isn't she, that teacher?

164
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,428
She's not unreliable.

165
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,628
The culprit just looked like a woman to her.

166
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:14,128
Your elbow, when she saw the silhouette of you fleeing,

167
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:16,528
just happened to look like the breast of a woman

168
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,728
since you had one hand on the shoulder that you hurt.

169
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,628
In addition, since there were several incidents

170
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:24,728
in which a woman mugger was attacking in that area,

171
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,128
it's understandable that she probably intuitively thought

172
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,428
that the culprit was a woman.

173
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,628
Besides, that lady,

174
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:33,028
no matter how you look at her, she's a man.

175
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:35,028
The arguing voices that Ms. Kobayashi heard

176
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,928
were that of a man and woman

177
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,428
and if the corpse that was found later was that of a man,

178
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:44,028
it's understandable that she would think that the culprit is a woman.

179
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:46,028
Is this how the deduction goes?

180
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,828
Yes. Because she wouldn't possibly think

181
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,428
that the shouting voice was that of the victim.

182
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:54,128
Well... you too seem to have tried to deceive everyone

183
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:56,528
by cutting off your long hair.

184
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:01,728
And the numbers that Ms. Kobayashi saw on the car at the site

185
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,428
were not "0" and "9" but rather,

186
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:06,128
the alphabets "O and S".

187
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:11,728
It's standing for Osaka Smile Transport Company.

188
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:15,728
They looked like numbers because they were cut off by a wall.

189
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:21,228
That car was that of Dr. Agasa's friend who was moving.

190
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:25,228
I confirmed with the driver of the truck just a while ago.

191
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,828
And he said that he saw you

192
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:30,128
and the victim go into that alley of the murder site.

193
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,528
By the way,

194
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:38,028
you found out that Ms. Kobayashi was an elementary teacher

195
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,228
because I called out "teacher" at the scene of the crime.

196
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:43,328
After all, if a child calls out teacher,

197
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,428
the first thing that comes to mind

198
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,028
would be an elementary school teacher.

199
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,728
So, you asked around the elementary schools

200
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,028
in the vicinity and found her.

201
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,028
You attempted to shut her up, didn't you?

202
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,228
Yes.

203
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:55,928
I was going to threaten and scare her

204
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,728
before she recalled everything,

205
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:01,328
and stop her from testifying further.

206
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,328
I didn't want to land up in prison

207
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:06,128
just for killing that devil.

208
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,028
But that devil lent you 5,000,000 yen, didn't she?

209
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,628
Yes, right.

210
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:14,928
It costs money to continue pursuing a dream.

211
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:18,628
Treatment fee for my shoulder as well as for training.

212
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:22,428
That lady seem to have been a fan of high school baseball,

213
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:25,428
knew me and had high hopes for me.

214
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:29,628
But as soon as she found out that I damaged my shoulder for good,

215
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,128
she started acting totally different

216
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,928
and treated me as if I were a broken piece of junk.

217
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:35,228
I still had hopes of being a batter,

218
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:37,628
but she pressed me every day to give her back what she lent me.

219
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,728
She went as far as to tell me

220
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:42,528
that I could join life insurance so to give her my seal.

221
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,228
Which means that the remark of the victim,

222
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:47,028
"Never mind, just give me that" was...

223
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,528
Yes, she meant my seal.

224
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:53,528
She was planning to make me join life insurance then kill me.

225
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:56,328
That's why I killed her before she got to kill me!

226
00:12:56,328 --> 00:12:58,928
I did it to continue pursuing my dream!

227
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,328
I killed her in self-defense!

228
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:03,228
Criminal Code 36.

229
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:06,028
When someone suddenly wrongly infringes on you,

230
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,228
any action performed out of necessity to protect oneself

231
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:12,728
or another is not to be punished.

232
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:15,028
In case the degree of protection

233
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,928
exceeds what is considered enough,

234
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,128
the punishment may be lessened

235
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,828
or exempt after taking into account all circumstances.

236
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:24,428
This is the provision described under self-defense.

237
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,728
During the time the crime was committed,

238
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,428
you had a knife in your possession and had the intent to kill.

239
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:31,828
Therefore, neither of what I just stated applies to you.

240
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:35,428
In addition, using a bat, a tool that should be used

241
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:38,828
to pursue your dream, as a weapon to shut someone up,

242
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:43,028
you don't even the tiniest right to talk of your dreams.

243
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:45,928
Criminal code provision 255.

244
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,528
Anyone who takes the possessions of another

245
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,528
will be punished for stealing...

246
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,528
and serve a sentence of less than 10 years.

247
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:00,628
Maybe long ago I met you at a bookstore.

248
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:05,328
So, you finally remembered.

249
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:09,328
From way before these children were born,

250
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,528
I was in love with you.

251
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:18,528
Yes.

252
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,428
Dorky.

253
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,528
Come, come now.

254
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,728
Hey, hey, Conan.

255
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,828
Is she the teacher that Shiratori is head over heels over?

256
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:29,428
Yes.

257
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,428
She sure looks familiar.

258
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,128
It's you, she looks like you.

259
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:36,628
You mean you served as her double not realizing why you were doing it.

260
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,628
Mr. Shiratori.

261
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:48,628
We're going to go eat lunch from now, would you...

262
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:51,328
No, I'm not going.

263
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,128
Because I have this.

264
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,628
See you, then.

265
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:01,928
I'm sure that's home-made lunch made by Ms. Kobayashi.

266
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,828
Home-made lunch.

267
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:08,028
Ms. Sato?

268
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:11,128
Sato!

269
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,128
Please make lunch for me too, next time...

270
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:17,228
Lunch... next?

271
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:20,528
If you're going to the convenience store to buy lunch,

272
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,228
will please get me one too.

273
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,028
I'll leave what you'll buy up to you.

274
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:26,428
As long as it fills me up, anything's okay.

275
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,028
Yes.

276
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,428
Mr. Takagi, hang in there.

277
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,808
"Second term"

278
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,108
Did you see that?

279
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,908
Thief Kid's news this morning.

280
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,108
I saw it. I saw it.

281
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:49,208
He seems to have sent out a letter of challenge again.

282
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:54,008
He is after the big jewel owned by Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.

283
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:55,708
The horn of the giraffe.

284
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,208
It seems to be valuable amber that is embedded with a seed

285
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,508
from several million years ago.

286
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,908
But, he's sure sending his letter of challenge out early.

287
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:07,508
Regarding the amber that was discovered at the old temple,

288
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,208
wasn't it just last week?

289
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,308
Well, since they had it advertised on TV

290
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:13,208
and in newspapers every single day,

291
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,208
even Thief Kid would take the bait.

292
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,608
But wait, do girrafe have horns?

293
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:21,108
They do. Two small ones.

294
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,108
You're talking about giraffes.

295
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:27,808
The one in question is said to be completely covered in golden scales,

296
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,208
is shaped like a deer,

297
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,808
has a cow's tail and a horse's hooves.

298
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:35,308
Growing from its dragon-like head is a single horn.

299
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:38,308
It's a divine beast from Chinese mythology.

300
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:41,308
Then, it's akin to azure dragon and white tiger.

301
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:45,108
So have you been summoned again?

302
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,308
No, I haven't heard anything yet.

303
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,808
How about, Edogawa?

304
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:53,808
Looks like you're having another duel with Thief Kid.

305
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,908
Do you have a strategy prepared?

306
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,608
No.

307
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,108
Just Conan again?

308
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:04,008
How nice. We want to duel with Thief Kid too.

309
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,708
It can't be helped.

310
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,908
Conan is the one who chases Thief Kid away every time.

311
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,308
Members of the Youth Detective Squad, how about a word too?

312
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,008
What is it?

313
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,508
Will you tell us what you intend to do?

314
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,708
Why them too?

315
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,108
Haven't you heard about it yet?

316
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,208
Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki announced it

317
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,608
at the press conference today.

318
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,508
This time, he said that he would ask

319
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:31,308
all the members of the Youth Detective Squad to help him.

320
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:32,308
No way.

321
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,408
Why?

322
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:35,908
Advisor,

323
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:38,708
I have my doubts about letting the children

324
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,108
into the site where Thief Kid is planning to attack.

325
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:45,208
Can't you tell from looking at his letter of challenge.

326
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,608
The night of the next full moon at 7 pm,

327
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:52,508
I will go to get a hold of the horn of the giraffe.

328
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,008
From Thief Kid.

329
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,208
Let's cut out all childish acts this time

330
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,208
and decide victory by adult methods.

331
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,608
That guy goofed from his side.

332
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,508
Mentioning adult methods,

333
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,608
he means don't call children.

334
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:10,908
In other words, Thief Kid is not at home with kids.

335
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:13,008
Not at home with kids?

336
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,308
Right.

337
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:16,308
No matter how good he is,

338
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:20,208
he can't disguise himself as a child who is short.

339
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,108
Therefore, my strategy is to call a lot of children

340
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,408
that he doesn't want around.

341
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,208
I see.

342
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,008
Moreover, the night of the full moon

343
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,408
that he warned of is the day after tomorrow.

344
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:34,808
It's the day that the typhoon will strike that mountain temple.

345
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:36,608
His hand glider that he's so at home with

346
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:39,808
probably can't be used blocked by the rain and wind.

347
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:43,808
Thief Kid without his wings is no more than a baby.

348
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:47,108
I will capture Thief Kid along with the Youth Detective Squad

349
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,808
in front of the TV camera,

350
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:54,208
and end my autobiography with beautiful victory.

351
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,708
You all look good,

352
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,908
in that detective parker.

353
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,408
-Thank you. -Thank you...

354
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:15,108
Then, let me introduce myself.

355
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:18,108
"Juri Shinkai (37)" -I'm journalist Juri Shinkai.

356
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:19,408
How do you do?

357
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,508
The one sitting next to me is cameraman, Mr. Masui.

358
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,108
"Shougo Masui (41)" -How do you do?

359
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:28,508
And the one in the front seat is...

360
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,508
Let's see...

361
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:31,908
"Tsutomu Hizumi (38)" -Hello.

362
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:34,508
I'm Hizumi in charge of audio.

363
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:38,508
I heard that the audio man was young man.

364
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:40,908
They couldn't get a hold of him,

365
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:44,208
so I ended up coming here all of a sudden.

366
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,408
I hope that young punk didn't take off

367
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:49,708
because he panicked about the typhoon that's coming.

368
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,008
It started to rain.

369
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,008
I've been waiting for you members of the Youth Detective Squad.

370
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:09,808
How do you like it? The clothes that I gave you?

371
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,608
Did you make this parker for us?

372
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,708
Yes. I thought you'd look more

373
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,308
like the detective squad with uniformed clothes.

374
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:20,808
Thank you. We love it.

375
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:24,308
And? Where's the horn of the giraffe?

376
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,508
The way I see it...

377
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:29,208
there's a large pillar in the center

378
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,208
and on all four corners

379
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,608
there are a white, black and green

380
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:37,508
and red pedestal.

381
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,108
A copper pedestal.

382
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,308
The color is faded, and the upper part is bumpy.

383
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,308
It seems like a statue of something was attached there,

384
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,908
but was taken away.

385
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:49,108
Look. Look.

386
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,308
There's what looks to be a keyhole.

387
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,808
Yes.

388
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:55,408
Hold it.

389
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:57,708
Hey, don't touch it.

390
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,708
Inspector Nakamori.

391
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,608
You should've at least told the brats

392
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:04,508
that a slight electric current is applied to the pedestal.

393
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:07,508
Children don't learn unless you give them pain.

394
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,608
And where's the horn?

395
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,908
I'll let you see it right now.

396
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:17,708
By using these four white, black, red and green keys.

397
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,008
Inspector Nakamori,

398
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,708
I'd like your men to help me.

399
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:26,308
Sure. Make sure you turn the electric current off.

400
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:30,508
Stop the electric current once.

401
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:31,608
Roger.

402
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,408
Are you going to use the keys that are the same color as the pedestals?

403
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:35,708
Yes.

404
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:40,708
What's this sound?

405
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,408
It's the sound of the electric current flowing

406
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:44,208
to the pedestal being cut off.

407
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,208
Each sound corresponds to the green,

408
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,708
red, white and black pedestal's

409
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,208
electric current being turned off.

410
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,808
Inspector, please send the signal.

411
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:54,008
Okay.

412
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:56,608
-All right. One, two... -What's that sound just now?

413
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,608
-That's... -three.

414
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:09,208
The pillar in the middle is...

415
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,408
Cracking open.

416
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:11,908
Something's coming out...

417
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,008
From inside.

418
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,408
So, this is the giraffe.

419
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,508
Awesome.

420
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:28,708
So, the yellow jewelry on its head is the...

421
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:32,108
Yes, it's probably the amber that's being referred to

422
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:33,308
as the "Horn of the Giraffe."

423
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,508
Beautiful.

424
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,908
Okay. Come whenever you like, Thief Kid.

425
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:44,608
I'm going to get you for sure this time.

426
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,108
Darn.

427
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:09,608
If there was only one keyhole

428
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:12,108
I would guard over my dead body.

429
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:15,108
We'll guard it for you then.

430
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,808
Black-out?

431
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:17,808
Conan.

432
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:20,908
Conan!

433
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,308
Thief Kid's card.

434
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:27,108
In other words, Thief Kid and his accomplices...

435
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:30,208
are still in here.

436
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,308
Next Conan,

437
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:35,807
"Giraffe Horn that Vanished in the Dark"

438
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:53,994
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,694
"Sparrow".

440
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,594
We'll capture Thief Kid.

441
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:59,294
-Yes. -Yes...

442
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:00,594
They're all out to get.
