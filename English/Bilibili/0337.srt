1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.940
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.040
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.640
A strange case at an ordinary train station.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.540
There's only a marginal difference between goodwill and evil.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:00.068
Ghads.

9
00:02:00.068 --> 00:02:02.568
You keep drinking so much juice,

10
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:04.668
that's why you have to keep going to the restroom.

11
00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:07.268
But, it was good, wasn't it, Pops?

12
00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:10.268
It would've been nice if Ran could've come with us, too.

13
00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:11.768
It can't be helped, can it?

14
00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:14.468
She had club practice and suddenly ended up not being able to come.

15
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.568
By the way, what do you say?

16
00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:19.168
That we go have some ramen before going home.

17
00:02:19.168 --> 00:02:21.968
What? You're going to eat again?

18
00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:24.968
There's something about French food that gives me stiff shoulders.

19
00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:26.868
I don't feel like I've satisfied my appetite.

20
00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:29.068
Come on, let's go drop by at a ramen shop.

21
00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.968
Next stop is West Sumita Station.

22
00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:35.968
Transfer here for the Saika Express.

23
00:02:40.768 --> 00:02:46.468
"The Truth Behind the Death Fall"

24
00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:55.968
The train will come in. Please stand behind the white line.

25
00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:04.568
-So, for ramen! -West Sumita Station.

26
00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:07.468
Let's go, Conan! I think I want salt flavored ramen.

27
00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:09.268
What flavor do you want?

28
00:03:09.268 --> 00:03:12.668
Hey, Pop's really set on going?

29
00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:13.868
You bastard!

30
00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:24.168
Talk about trouble, those guys.

31
00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:26.268
Cut it out, cut it out! Stop fighting!

32
00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.868
I'm telling you, cut it out! Are you guys deaf or what?

33
00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:30.668
Inspector Goto, we've been waiting for you.

34
00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:31.868
Is anything wrong?

35
00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:38.568
Mouri?

36
00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:42.868
You're Mr. Mouri, that renowned detective!

37
00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:45.468
Really?

38
00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.868
Yes.

39
00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:51.068
I am Goto of West Sumita Police Station.

40
00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:53.468
Well, I've heard a lot about you.

41
00:04:53.468 --> 00:04:56.568
But, I didn't think I'd get to see you here.

42
00:04:56.568 --> 00:04:58.068
I'm really honored.

43
00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:00.668
He coincidentally witnessed

44
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:03.168
what may be the cause of this incident.

45
00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:04.868
You did, Mr. Mouri?

46
00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:06.968
Yes. But well...

47
00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.968
I didn't think that something like this was going to happen.

48
00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:12.968
Well, it's really a great help that you're here, Mr. Mouri.

49
00:05:12.968 --> 00:05:14.868
We're counting on you.

50
00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:17.268
I hope I can be of help.

51
00:05:17.268 --> 00:05:21.168
I guess you can leave things to me since I'm here anyway.

52
00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:24.868
Hey, hey.

53
00:05:24.868 --> 00:05:27.368
Have you identified the victim?

54
00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:31.068
Yes, he is Keisuke Furuta, age 42.

55
00:05:31.068 --> 00:05:33.268
He is an office worker who lives nearby.

56
00:05:33.268 --> 00:05:35.368
He seems to always come home on this train,

57
00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.568
and it seems that he was on his way back home today, too.

58
00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:39.768
The cause of his death is due to a fractured skull

59
00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:41.668
from a violent blow to his head.

60
00:05:41.668 --> 00:05:43.768
He got into a fight with this person here,

61
00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:46.568
Mr. Hideki Sugimoto, age 27.

62
00:05:46.568 --> 00:05:49.468
He works at a company in the city of Tokyo.

63
00:05:49.468 --> 00:05:51.668
I am Goto from the West Sumita Police Station.

64
00:05:51.668 --> 00:05:55.768
Will you please explain what just happened?

65
00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:57.768
It's kind of noisy here.

66
00:05:57.768 --> 00:06:02.068
You may use the break room for station employees if you like.

67
00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:03.268
Mr. Noriwaki.

68
00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:05.468
Yes, sir. This way, please.

69
00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:07.468
That would be a great help.

70
00:06:11.468 --> 00:06:14.568
What is this wound he has here?

71
00:06:18.068 --> 00:06:20.668
I went to an after-hours business contact meeting tonight,

72
00:06:20.668 --> 00:06:22.768
and I was on my way back home.

73
00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:28.268
I suddenly had to go to the restroom

74
00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:30.668
and put my knapsack on the net shelf,

75
00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:32.368
then headed for the restroom.

76
00:06:37.368 --> 00:06:38.968
My stomach was feeling queasy

77
00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.368
so I stayed inside for some time and came out.

78
00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.568
My knapsack was gone.

79
00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:47.568
And?

80
00:06:47.568 --> 00:06:49.568
Then, I happened to look out at the platform

81
00:06:49.568 --> 00:06:52.368
and saw him with my knapsack.

82
00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:54.068
Hold it!

83
00:06:54.068 --> 00:06:56.568
What do you think you're doing? That's my knapsack!

84
00:06:56.568 --> 00:06:58.068
Just what do you think you're doing?

85
00:06:58.068 --> 00:07:00.768
What's with you?

86
00:07:00.768 --> 00:07:03.868
He wouldn't give my knapsack back to me.

87
00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:06.368
So you got into a fight?

88
00:07:06.368 --> 00:07:07.668
Yes.

89
00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:10.268
And when I tried to take my knapsack back...

90
00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:13.468
The strap cut off, and...

91
00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:26.268
Unluckily the under construction fence wasn't there.

92
00:07:28.168 --> 00:07:31.668
Which means you have never meet Mr. Furuta before?

93
00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:35.168
No, I haven't.

94
00:07:37.568 --> 00:07:40.068
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

95
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:42.368
I feel sorry for him.

96
00:07:42.368 --> 00:07:46.768
But Mr. Furuta wouldn't have gone through what he did

97
00:07:46.768 --> 00:07:49.768
if he didn't take Mr. Sugimoto's knapsack in the first place.

98
00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:53.368
I wonder

99
00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:57.968
if Mr. Furuta was really trying to steal Mr. Sugimoto's bag?

100
00:07:57.968 --> 00:07:59.968
What do you mean?

101
00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:03.868
Maybe he thought that somebody had forgotten it?

102
00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:05.268
Forgotten?

103
00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:06.468
Yes.

104
00:08:06.468 --> 00:08:08.268
He has delivered forgotten goods to us

105
00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:10.668
several times in the past, too.

106
00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:13.568
Among all of us, we thought that he was a nice person,

107
00:08:13.568 --> 00:08:16.168
a rare breed, not too easily found in recent years.

108
00:08:16.168 --> 00:08:18.268
He doesn't seem like the type who would steal something

109
00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:20.168
that someone else had forgotten.

110
00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:21.568
Really?

111
00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:22.768
Yes.

112
00:08:24.868 --> 00:08:26.168
Mr. Mouri.

113
00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:30.468
If it's really as you say,

114
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.868
he may have confirmed the owner of the bag

115
00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:35.268
before he got off the train.

116
00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:37.868
Go and question the passengers on the double.

117
00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:39.068
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:40.268 --> 00:08:43.068
Inspector.

119
00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:45.568
Please calm down, Mr. Sugimoto.

120
00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:48.468
We have to wait for testimony from witnesses.

121
00:08:48.468 --> 00:08:49.768
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:56.268 --> 00:08:58.668
It's just as the station employee had said.

123
00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:02.168
Mr. Furuta seems to have confirmed whether the owner was around

124
00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:03.468
before getting off the train.

125
00:09:05.068 --> 00:09:06.568
Really?

126
00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:11.268
Yes. There was a passenger who remembered you, Mr. Sugimoto,

127
00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:13.468
when you stood to go to the restroom,

128
00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:15.968
and also saw that Mr. Furuta came on the train after you.

129
00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:18.268
In other words, Mr. Sugimoto went to the restroom

130
00:09:18.268 --> 00:09:20.468
leaving his knapsack on the net shelf.

131
00:09:20.468 --> 00:09:22.968
Then Mr. Furuta who boarded the train later,

132
00:09:22.968 --> 00:09:24.968
took the knapsack to be a forgotten item,

133
00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:26.768
took it and got off the train.

134
00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:28.268
Mr. Sugimoto who had gone to the restroom

135
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:32.168
thought that his knapsack was being stolen,

136
00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:33.468
found Mr. Furuta among the passengers

137
00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:37.468
who had gotten off the train and tried to get it back.

138
00:09:38.368 --> 00:09:42.368
Mr. Furuta thought that he confirmed the owner,

139
00:09:42.368 --> 00:09:44.468
so when he was told to "Give the knapsack back",

140
00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:46.168
he couldn't believe it off the bat.

141
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:49.568
Mr. Furuta was also probably a very righteous man.

142
00:09:49.568 --> 00:09:51.268
He probably got into a fight

143
00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:53.268
trying to keep the knapsack from being taken away.

144
00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:56.868
I guess this is a tragedy that was born from a misunderstanding.

145
00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:58.868
Oh, no.

146
00:09:58.868 --> 00:10:01.968
Mr. Sugimoto, you're to blame too, you know?

147
00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:06.168
You didn't have to jump on him so aggressively as you did, too.

148
00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:08.568
I lost my temper.

149
00:10:08.568 --> 00:10:11.868
He goes out of his way to deliver a forgotten item

150
00:10:11.868 --> 00:10:14.968
and dies, poor guy.

151
00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:19.668
You can have this back.

152
00:10:27.968 --> 00:10:30.468
It's gone.

153
00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:32.168
What seems to be the matter?

154
00:10:32.168 --> 00:10:34.168
The receipt is gone.

155
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.468
Receipt?

156
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.868
The receipt of the store I went to with my client.

157
00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:40.968
I had it in here with the change.

158
00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:43.268
Both are gone.

159
00:10:44.668 --> 00:10:47.268
Maybe you put it in your pocket or something?

160
00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:50.068
No, I'm positive I put it in the wallet.

161
00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:51.468
Give me a break.

162
00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:52.868
Maybe it fell on the platform

163
00:10:52.868 --> 00:10:55.168
when you were struggling with each other.

164
00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:56.568
Officer Saito.

165
00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:58.268
I'll go check.

166
00:11:03.868 --> 00:11:05.168
How was it?

167
00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:09.368
Well, there was nothing of that sort on the platform.

168
00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:11.268
But inspector...

169
00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:13.968
I brought Mr. Furuta's belongings.

170
00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:19.168
Japanese Restaurant Sasayama?

171
00:11:19.168 --> 00:11:23.568
Inspector, could you show me that?

172
00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:27.268
Go ahead.

173
00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:28.568
Excuse me.

174
00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:30.368
Just as I thought.

175
00:11:30.368 --> 00:11:33.368
This is the receipt I was looking for.

176
00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:35.868
See. Mr. Hideki Sugimoto.

177
00:11:35.868 --> 00:11:39.468
The price was for the food was 25,000 yen.

178
00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:44.768
But, why was it in Mr. Furuta's pocket?

179
00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:49.068
I can't figure it out.

180
00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:52.768
The thing is...

181
00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:55.668
It was just once in the past.

182
00:11:55.668 --> 00:11:58.368
But, there was a time that money was taken

183
00:11:58.368 --> 00:12:01.768
from the forgotten item that Mr. Furuta had turned in.

184
00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:03.368
What?

185
00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:07.268
Back then, Mr. Furuta was suspected, too.

186
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.868
But, he was deemed innocent after we decided

187
00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:11.868
that the thief wouldn't go out of his way to turn in a stolen item.

188
00:12:11.868 --> 00:12:15.268
I see. So that's the story.

189
00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:20.468
Mr. Furuta probably had a habit of stealing money

190
00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:23.368
from the forgotten items he turned in.

191
00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.568
A habitual thief?

192
00:12:25.568 --> 00:12:27.868
That's why he couldn't return the knapsack.

193
00:12:27.868 --> 00:12:29.968
Because if he did, the fact that he stole the money

194
00:12:29.968 --> 00:12:32.668
would be revealed on the spot.

195
00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:34.968
Is that so?

196
00:12:35.968 --> 00:12:38.868
I can't believe Mr. Furuta would ever do something like that.

197
00:12:38.868 --> 00:12:40.468
It's very difficult to believe.

198
00:12:41.768 --> 00:12:43.168
Mr. Sugimoto!

199
00:12:43.168 --> 00:12:44.568
Yes.

200
00:12:44.568 --> 00:12:47.068
Just to be safe, will you check to see

201
00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:49.368
if anything else had been stolen?

202
00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:50.468
Yes, sir.

203
00:13:02.468 --> 00:13:03.968
Everything else is here.

204
00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:05.368
I see.

205
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:09.768
Please fill in this form then.

206
00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:10.968
Yes.

207
00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:18.268
Could you please lend me a ball pen?

208
00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:21.368
Excuse me for not noticing it.

209
00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:22.568
Here you are.

210
00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:24.868
Thank you.

211
00:13:44.068 --> 00:13:45.468
You bastard!

212
00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:51.168
It's just as I thought.

213
00:14:02.268 --> 00:14:05.768
I see.

214
00:14:05.768 --> 00:14:10.868
I figured out the real truth hidden behind this accident.

215
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.290
Ghads, what kind of important talk could there be?

216
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.490
And where'd Conan go off to after calling me out like this?

217
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.290
Pops, you can leave the rest to me.

218
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.490
Okay, this will be fine.

219
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.890
Inspector Goto.

220
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.190
What is it?

221
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.090
Mr. Mouri wants all of us to come to the platform.

222
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.590
To the platform?

223
00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.490
What on earth is it, Mr. Mouri?

224
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.790
That pose is...

225
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.090
The rumored "Sleeping Kogoro"?

226
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.890
But inspector...

227
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.290
Mr. Mouri, this case was solved as being an accident

228
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.190
that happened from a man trying to get back his knapsack.

229
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.990
Inspector Goto, that's not the story, though.

230
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.990
What?

231
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.690
Just what do you mean?

232
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.990
I'll explain that in a minute.

233
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.390
First of all, will all of you

234
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.890
try to recall Mr. Sugimoto's testimony?

235
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.190
It's true that Mr. Sugimoto returned after going to the restroom

236
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.190
and realized that his knapsack was gone.

237
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.490
He sees Mr. Furuta on the platform and rushes off the train.

238
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.090
That's right, isn't it?

239
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.190
Yes, right.

240
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.190
But we saw Mr. Sugimoto

241
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.490
came dashing out from near the vending machine, instead.

242
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.590
And is there anything strange about it?

243
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.090
Don't you think it's funny?

244
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.290
If Mr. Sugimoto jumped off the train from the front,

245
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.890
why would he be in a place like that?

246
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.390
He would've run there from a different direction.

247
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.490
I see.

248
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.690
Come to think of it, yes.

249
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.290
It's unnatural that he was by the vending machine over there.

250
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.490
But, why did Mr. Sugimoto do that?

251
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.590
He was waiting

252
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.390
for Mr. Furuta to take the money out.

253
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.390
What?

254
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.790
Why?

255
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.090
You're only running wild on imagination.

256
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.190
Mr. Sugimoto probably knew

257
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.990
that Mr. Furuta would take money out of the wallet

258
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.290
pretending to turn the knapsack in.

259
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.990
That's why he left the receipt

260
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.690
inside his wallet deliberately with the money.

261
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.790
Because if the receipt is found,

262
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.590
and the fact that Mr. Furuta stole the money is revealed,

263
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.290
Mr. Sugimoto aggressively trying to get his knapsack back

264
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.390
would be justified.

265
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.890
That's not true!

266
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.590
Then?

267
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:03.190
Yes, Mr. Sugimoto deliberately put the net shelf

268
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.290
and went to the restroom

269
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.190
to make Mr. Furuta steal the money.

270
00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.490
There were other passengers on the train.

271
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.090
Why did Mr. Furuta think that the knapsack was a forgotten item?

272
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.490
The cell phone.

273
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.190
The cell phone?

274
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.090
Didn't you realize

275
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.290
that there was a cell phone inside the knapsack?

276
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.890
Probably a cell phone with a history of incoming calls.

277
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.590
Mr. Sugimoto, who went to the restroom

278
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.790
just before arriving at West Sumita Station,

279
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.890
with his other cell phone

280
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.890
and called the cell phone in the knapsack.

281
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.990
The phone rang, but no one answered it.

282
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.890
That's why he thought that the knapsack was a forgotten item.

283
00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.490
I see.

284
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.890
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

285
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.690
Mr. Sugimoto quietly watched

286
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.490
while Mr. Furuta hid behind materials of the construction site

287
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.290
and took out the money.

288
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.690
He grabbed Mr. Furuta and dragged him

289
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.090
and pushed him into the keep-out area.

290
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.090
Then, he pushed him over with all his might.

291
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.990
Of course,

292
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.190
the rope that held the fence of the keep-out area in place

293
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.590
was cut beforehand.

294
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.690
Then all he had to do next

295
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.690
was pull the knapsack from Mr. Furuta

296
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.190
who was down on the ground.

297
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.090
If Mr. Furuta fought back to keep the knapsack from being taken away,

298
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.690
the strap which had been cut in advance would be slit

299
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.090
and Mr. Furuta who loses balance would fall off

300
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.390
the overpass platform to the ground below.

301
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.790
The shoulder strap was cut beforehand?

302
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.790
I'm sorry but I would have to check it.

303
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.690
Inspector!

304
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.790
Yes, it was no accident.

305
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.790
It was a planned murder under the pretext of an accident.

306
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.090
That's absurd!

307
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.990
That's nothing more than a far fetched story.

308
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.190
Listen, he tried with all his might

309
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.390
and resisted giving me back the knapsack.

310
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.990
How could I have knocked him down, then pushed him over?

311
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.290
Things don't work out that well.

312
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.390
As a matter of fact it does.

313
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.490
If you use the ballpoint pen

314
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.190
that you have stuck to the inner pocket of your suit.

315
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.990
Ballpoint pen?

316
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.190
You cornered him to behind the materials

317
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.490
and poked Mr. Furuta with all your might with that ball pen.

318
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.190
While Mr. Furuta flinched from the pain,

319
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.990
you pushed him.

320
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.390
The mark left by the ball pen was left

321
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.590
plain and clear on the back of his hand.

322
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.190
How about it, Mr. Sugimoto?

323
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.890
Mr. Sugimoto.

324
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.090
I couldn't forgive him!

325
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.190
He took the life of my girl!

326
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.890
6 months ago.

327
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.690
He rammed full speed into my girlfriend

328
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.190
who was crossing the pedestrian crossing.

329
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.690
We were going to get married soon.

330
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.290
There were no witnesses

331
00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.090
and Furuta's version insisting

332
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.690
that the pedestrian ran into the street went through,

333
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.090
and he wasn't even prosecuted.

334
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.290
That's much too cruel.

335
00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.290
Ruthless.

336
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.190
So, you decided to kill Mr. Furuta

337
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.690
under the pretext of an accident.

338
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.390
I just couldn't...

339
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.890
I just couldn't make myself forgive him.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.090
Okay, it's ready.

342
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.690
I tell you, Dad.

343
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.790
Just because the ramen shops were closed

344
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.290
you don't have to go out of the way to cup ramen, do you?

345
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.990
Don't you agree, Conan?

346
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.590
Who cares? What's the big deal?

347
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.990
This is just the thing for me after all.

348
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.690
It's so good.

349
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.890
Maybe I'll have another serving.

350
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.190
You're going to get fat.

351
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.890
Well, this indeed matches Pops

352
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.590
more than French cuisine for sure.

I feel bad for Ai,

356
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.090
but I guess she'll just have to stick it out till then.

357
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.890
I'd at least like to know

358
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.690
if it's me that's being marked or her.

359
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.590
Otherwise, I can't move.
