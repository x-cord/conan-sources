00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,400
Due to a misunderstanding,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,390
Kyogoku-san accidentally knocked
out a stuntman filming a TV drama.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,000
He was recruited to fill
in for the stuntman, but...

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,590
Looks pretty good. It's got intensity.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,810
So, has anyone seen Tokuzono-chan?

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,140
Hey, we're not ready ye—

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,970
Excuse me.

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,150
Is something wrong?

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,510
Makoto-san!

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,990

the suspicious pair of Conan
and Kudo Shinichi!

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,930
Always determining the one truth

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,670
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,210
his name is Detective Conan!

Let's have a nice long chat later.

22
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:17,841
Even if the culprit placed Tokuzono-san's
phone outside the fourth floor window,

23
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:21,681
how did they get him to fall?

24
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,101
Indeed.

25
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,441
If Tokuzono-san was afraid of heights,

26
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,101
he wouldn't have gone outside the window.

27
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:32,291
He wasn't afraid of heights.

Is that medicine?

33
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,331
They're iron supplements.

34
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:53,391
I'm on a diet, and remember
what I said earlier?

35
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,341
I run out of breath easily these days.

36
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,431
I see. I bet you could fit a
little device in that case.

37
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,091
Hey, don't assume I'm the
culprit just because of this.

In the first place, there are plenty of similar
small containers around the filming location.

48
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:26,041
The medicines and cases don't seem related.

49
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,911
Medicine, huh?

50
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:35,171
Speaking of medicine, Ran-kun,
I have a question for you.

51
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:39,421
Does your boyfriend take
any strange medicines?

52
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:40,281
What?

53
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:43,551
Boyfriend? You mean Shinichi?

54
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:47,561
You know, sometimes he seems really ill.

55
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:48,931
You're right.

56
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,071
He's frequently pale and seems
to be on the brink of death,

57
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:55,061
but a short while later, he'll be fine again.

58
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:59,571
You think he's taking some kind of medicine?

59
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:06,771
Does that phrasing mean you've
never seen him take anything?

60
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:08,121
No.

61
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,121
Then, to be blunt,

62
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,451
when Shinichi-kun is around...

63
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,571
Is Conan-kun absent?

64
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,761
Wh-What does that mean?

65
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,001
What does that mean?

66
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,761
It means exactly what it sounds like.

67
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,131
Isn't that right, Ran-kun?

68
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:44,651
Conan-kun and Shinichi-kun
have never been in the same—

69
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,031
They've been in the same place before.

70
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:49,221
What? They have?

71
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:51,221
Yeah. Right, Sonoko?

72
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:54,261
They were there together
at the school festival.

73
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:56,291
Yeah, I remember that.

74
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,791
Both during the play about the black knight

75
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:02,051
and when Shinichi-kun started solving the case,

76
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,381
the kid was there watching
with a sour look on his face.

77
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:09,741
And when I went to get Shinichi
for school the next day,

78
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:11,561
Conan-kun was with us.

79
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:18,311
That's when Haibara disguised herself as me

80
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:21,041
using the professor's
mask-shaped voice changer.

81
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,821
Oh, I actually quite enjoy this.

82
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:31,861
Do you think Conan-kun and
Shinichi are the same person?

83
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,781
What? Uh, yeah.

84
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:36,581
I thought the same thing a few times.

85
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:40,071
But I've changed my mind.

86
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,821
There's no such thing as magic.

87
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:47,841
Conan-kun is just Conan-kun.

88
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,091
Yeah!

89
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,971
I can't figure it out.

90
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:04,361
What did the culprit do
to make the victim fall?

91
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:08,361
We know they plotted to
make Tokuzono-san fall

92
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,121
by placing his phone outside the window,

93
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:14,371
but that wouldn't guarantee that he'd fall.

94
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,291
We're missing something essential.

95
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,911
No, wait.

96
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,181
When Tokuzono-san fell,

97
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:24,051
the rest of the staff were down
here directly below the window.

98
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:28,541
It's possible that they
waited for Tokuzono-san

99
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,301
to reach for his phone and called him then.

100
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:34,681
If they could choose different
ringtones according to the caller,

101
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:37,891
they could have set it to
some kind of loud noise

102
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:42,311
so that Tokuzono-san would be startled,
lose his balance, and fall.

103
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:46,651
Kyogoku-kun did mention
hearing a strange noise

104
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:49,611
just before Tokuzono-san fell.

105
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,101
I see.

106
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:54,461
In that case, we may be able
to identify the culprit

107
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:57,081
if we look through that phone's call history.

108
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:57,971
Yeah.

109
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,001
Kyogoku-kun!

110
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,981
You said you heard a strange noise
just before Tokuzono-san fell.

111
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,391
You're sure about that?

112
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:08,131
Yes.

113
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:13,891
And it was a noisy ringtone, right?

114
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,041
No.

115
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,751
If anything, it was like the flutter or buzz

116
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,521
of a bird of insect flapping its wings.

117
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,401
It was quiet.

118
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,151
A bird or insect?

119
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:31,091
Come to think of it,
Tokuzono-chan hated bugs.

120
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,611
Right, Odori-kun?

121
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:32,931
Odori Daisaku (48)
Assistant Director

122
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:36,241
Yeah, he was unusually terrified of them.
Odori Daisaku (48)
Assistant Director

123
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:37,461
Yeah, he was unusually terrified of them.

124
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,121
If a single bug flew his way while
we were filming, he'd lose his mind.

125
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:46,461
Then was this just an accident that
happened because he was startled by a bug?

126
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:48,581
Even then!

127
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:51,631
That doesn't change the fact that
his phone was in an unnatural place.

128
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:54,691
Anyway, what are we going
to do about the shoot?

129
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,351
It's obviously canceled.

130
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,891
We can't film under these circumstances.

131
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:02,051
Then could I remove these fake wounds?

132
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,401
I have a gravure shoot after this.

133
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:08,651
Sure. We don't know when we'll
be able to film the rest, anyway.

134
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:10,431
Hideka-chan, could you?

135
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:11,151
Okay.

136
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,661
Aburai-san, you can make wounds with makeup?

137
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:17,461
Yeah, as long as it's simple.

138
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:20,161
My boyfriend liked special effects.

139
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:25,331
Don't touch the cut on my temple.

140
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,951
It's real.

141
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:28,591
Yeah, I kno—

142
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:33,211
Isn't it time for you to
take your allergy medicine?

143
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,051
Yeah.

144
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,251
But I can't swallow capsules without water.

145
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,831
I can wait a little longer.

146
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,561
Then I'll go buy drinks at
the nearby Welcome Burger.

147
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:49,451
I'd like to take my cold medicine,
so I'll buy drinks for the staff.

148
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:50,821
Let's take a break for tea.

149
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:52,751
For the staff?

150
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,451
Can you carry all of that?

151
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:55,811
I'll be fine.

152
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:57,901
I'll go with Nishibe.

153
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,751
Oh, right. Nishibe isn't here.

154
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:05,331
Anyway, I'll buy the usual stuff.

155
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,101
Do you guys want anything in particular?

156
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:08,971
No.

157
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:11,401
Conan-kun, do you want anything to drink?

158
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,091
I'm good with anything.

159
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,991
I'm fine, thank you.

160
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:19,111
Then I'll get our regular
order plus five more.

161
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,181
Takagi-kun, go with him.

162
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:23,101
Yes, sir.

163
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,691
Hey.

164
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:31,361
Is Nishibe the name of the dead AD?

165
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,111
You were listening to that?

166
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:35,971
Yeah, that's right.

167
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,281
Nishibe-kun was an AD.

168
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:37,961
Nishibe

Nishibe-kun was an AD.

169
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,661
His face was just my type.
Nishibe
AD

170
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:39,981
His face was just my type.

171
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:41,621
I was pursuing him.

172
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:47,371
But Hideka-chan the makeup
artist snagged him.

173
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:50,881
Then her boyfriend who liked
special effects was...

174
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,741
Yeah.

175
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:55,881
He and Hoegi-kun the AD who just went
to buy drinks loved special effects.

176
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,451
He and Director Tomioka
grew up in the same place.

177
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,861
They'd check each other's Hiroshima dialect
to make sure they hadn't forgotten it.

178
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,971
When I see this scar, I think of him.

179
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,141
Why?

180
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:12,771
Nishibe-kun was supposed to come pick
me up from a certain on location shoot.

181
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,801
But he overslept.

182
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,151
I saw the news about that accident.

183
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:25,871
It was a drunk driver, right?

184
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:31,421
He didn't hit me, but I
hit my head when I fell.

185
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,691
When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

186
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:40,191
Nishibe-kun was asleep in a chair,
his hands covered in blood.

187
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:43,261
Apparently he showed up late
and did everything he could.

188
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,341
His hands were covered in blood?

189
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:48,271
The cut required four stitches,
and I lost a lot of blood.

190
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:53,401
Nishibe-kun applied pressure with a
handkerchief until the ambulance arrived.

191
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,651
I'm so sorry about that.

192
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:00,961
He overslept because he was
up late watching DVDs with me.

193
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,851
It doesn't bother me anymore.

194
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:04,781
Besides, it didn't leave much of a scar.

195
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:11,421
But he really regretted
scarring an actress's face.

196
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:13,761
And then he was pranked
by that bleeding soap.

197
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:16,551
Tokuzono-chan had a messed
up sense of humor.

198
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,871
No wonder Nishibe screamed like a dying man.

199
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,621
Oh, sorry.

200
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,061
Excuse me.

201
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:45,688
I got the drinks.

202
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:48,938
I had the officer help
me carry a bunch of them.

203
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:53,358
Let's see, which is whose?

204
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:55,028
I'll help.

205
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,948
This is an iced coffee, so...

206
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,058
That's mine.

207
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,458
Here's your milk, syrup, and straw.

208
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,768
Aburai-san, you ordered the iced tea, right?

209
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:07,588
Yeah.

210
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,888
This is a hassle.

211
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,318
It's fine. We'll get our own orders.

212
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:11,628
Huh?

213
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:12,918
I got a cola.

214
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:13,638
Coffee.

215
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:15,008
Any ginger ales?

216
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:16,008
Hey, wait.

217
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:22,168
This banana strawberry shake and peach
melon shake are Odori-san and Jinmei-san's.

218
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,848
Don't take them.

219
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,638
The AD's usual order, huh?

220
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,618
Jinmei-san, you got a shake, too?

221
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,748
Yeah, I sent Hoegi-kun a message
earlier asking for one.

222
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:32,858
I felt like having one.

223
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:35,298
But which is which?

224
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,368
I can't tell by looking at them.

225
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:41,898
Which means I need to have a little taste.

226
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:49,378
This one's peach melon, so it's Odori-san's.

227
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:52,428
Jeez. There are stickers on the bottoms.

228
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:54,328
You just wanted to taste them.

229
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:56,888
Huh? There aren't enough
straws for the shakes.

230
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,368
This is a regular straw,
but the AD can have it.

231
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:03,138
I'm not using mine.

232
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:06,288
Then I'll bring it to him.

233
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:08,018
Besides, I need to talk to him.

234
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,268
Hey, Odori-kun.

235
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,738
Here's your usual shake.

236
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:14,698
Thanks.

237
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:16,478
You sure do like these.

238
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,288
Yeah. I got into them after trying one once.

239
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,688
Sir, would you like a sip?

240
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:22,818
No, thanks.

241
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,858
What did you want to discuss?

242
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:26,538
You mentioned something about that earlier.

243
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:31,628
Huh? Oh, it's about the late
Tokuzono-chan's replacement.

244
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,318
Well, it can wait.

245
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,728
When are we going to talk?

246
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,718
How impatient.

247
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:11,838
Odori-san?

248
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:13,258
Is this a joke?

249
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:15,358
Hey, Odori-kun.

250
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:17,208
This is a joke, right?

251
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,888
Are you—

252
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:20,508
Move.

253
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:23,958
His mouth smells like almonds.

254
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,428
It's cyanide.

255
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:28,518
I don't think you should touch that.

256
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,718
He was probably poisoned.

257
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:33,648
What?

258
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:36,418
Right, Sera-no-neechan?

259
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,278
Yeah.

260
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:44,318
We currently believe the poison
to be a type of cyanide compound.

261
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:49,588
Do you ever use that type
of chemical while filming?

262
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:51,288
Not on location.

263
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:56,088
If anything, I think we might
use it in the prop studio.

264
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,708
Which means your staff could have
gotten their hands on a poison?

265
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,598
I didn't say that.

266
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:08,138
Either way, we can assume they
acquired the poison beforehand.

267
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:08,938
Yeah.

268
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:14,798
Is this everything Odori-san had on him?

269
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:16,188
Y-Yeah.

270
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:21,948
Hey, what's that?

271
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,818
That thing that looks like a butterfly.

272
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,368
Oh, this?

273
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:30,958
It was wrapped in a handkerchief and
carefully tucked away inside his pants pocket.

274
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,208
What is this?

275
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,708
You've found a fun toy, haven't you?

276
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:36,858
A toy?

277
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,978
Yeah, I've seen them somewhere.

278
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:42,678
I don't know why Odori-kun had one, though.

279
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,218
How does it work?

280
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:47,718
You turn the wings on top.

281
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:50,228
Once the rubber band is sufficiently wound,

282
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,228
you stick it inside a notebook or something.

283
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:54,728
Jinmei-chan.

284
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:56,998
Try opening this notebook.

285
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:59,098
We're doing this now?

286
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,988
I heard your conversation.

287
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:05,808
That thing you stuck in here
will come flying out, right?

288
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,908
You can't scare me when
I know what to expect.

289
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,748
No!

290
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,028
What is this?

291
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,618
It's so creepy.

292
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,998
Look at it fly.

293
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:20,628
Th-That's the sound.

294
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:21,598
What?

295
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:27,628
That's the flapping noise I heard
just before Tokuzono-san fell.

296
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:33,268
The sound that toy just made is the
same as the sound I heard then.

297
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:36,728
What? Which means...

298
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:41,528
That was set somewhere on the fourth floor.

299
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:46,198
But according to the staff, these practical
joke devices were a favorite of...

300
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:48,948
Yeah, Tokuzono-san.

301
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,698
Tokuzono-san had tons of
practical joke devices.

302
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:56,958
He often pranked me and the other girls.

303
00:17:57,148 --> 00:18:05,468
Then it's possible Tokuzono-san himself
was trying to set this device and slipped.

304
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,048
That doesn't make sense.

305
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:10,728
After all, doesn't Tokuzono-san hate bugs?

306
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:13,558
He wouldn't use a toy bug as a prank.

307
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:15,378
You're right.

308
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:19,568
Just today he lost his temper because he
mistook some fake lashes for a centipede.

309
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:23,278
Even if it's not real, he couldn't
stand things that look like bugs.

310
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:29,598
If it made a noise, that means the rubber
band powering the toy was wound up.

311
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:33,708
Once the rubber band is wound, something
needs to hold it down until it's ready to fly.

312
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,458
It would need to be stuck between
the pages of a notebook,

313
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,458
or have something set on top of it.

314
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,638
Odori-san had that toy in his possession?

315
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,008
Inspector.

316
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:53,348
No poison was found in the shake,
cup, or straw Odori-san was using.

317
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:59,628
Maybe they swapped out the entire
cup during the confusion.

318
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,978
The cup contained a peach melon shake.

319
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,608
Nobody besides Odori-san ordered one.

320
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:08,548
Then maybe they swapped out
just the poisoned straw.

321
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,118
I don't think so.

322
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:14,138
If you hastily pull out a straw, its
contents should drip back into the cup,

323
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:15,828
but there was no sign of that.

324
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,128
They didn't have time to
remove it carefully either.

325
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:19,858
Then how?

326
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,338
It's just one possibility,

327
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:26,628
but Odori-san himself could have taken
a poison he acquired beforehand.

328
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,638
S-Suicide?

329
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:31,308
But why would the AD do that?

330
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:35,388
Because Odori-san made Tokuzono-san fall.

331
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,398
And couldn't stand the guilt?

332
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,528
Hold on.

333
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:42,768
Why would Odori-kun kill Tokuzono-chan?

334
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:47,398
They loved swapping twisted
jokes with each other.

335
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,708
He didn't mean to kill him.

336
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:55,908
The AD probably tried to prank Tokuzono-san
the way he always pranked others.

337
00:19:56,078 --> 00:20:00,288
But he took the unexpected accident
to heart and poisoned himself.

338
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,718
That doesn't make sense either.

339
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:07,548
If it was a prank, he wouldn't need
to acquire the poison beforehand.

340
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:10,538
And Odori-san didn't have
a motive for murder.

341
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,848
I can't imagine why he'd kill himself.

342
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:17,058
Why did Odori-san have that butterfly?

343
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,308
If it's something he picked
up, it was probably then.

344
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,318
Was he killed because he figured
out the culprit's identity?

345
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:25,808
But it could have been
set by any of the staff

346
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:30,688
who were filming on the fourth
floor until just before then.

347
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:37,678
He must've determined the culprit's identity
based off some other information, but what?

348
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:45,668
Come to think of it, Odori-san laughed after
seeing the footage of Tokuzono-san's fall.

349
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:51,178
But there wasn't anything particularly
interesting in that footage.

350
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:52,338
Hold on.

351
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,678
We can probably narrow down the people
who could've poisoned Odori-san.

352
00:20:56,108 --> 00:21:00,008
It was the AD Hoegi-san
who bought that shake.

353
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,688
Odori-san always ordered the same shake,

354
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:05,858
so it would be possible to poison
it while purchasing the drink.

355
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:09,128
Hoegi-san was also the one
who inserted the straw.

356
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:11,698
What about Jinmei-san?

357
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:17,578
She sent a message ordering a different
shake and tasted Odori-san's shake.

358
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:21,488
If she poisoned the straw then,

359
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,968
she could've mixed it into the shake
by gently blowing through the straw.

360
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:30,768
Speaking of straws, Aburai-san
gave her own straw to Odori-san.

361
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,318
She could've poisoned that.

362
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:36,458
She's also the reason the
drinks were purchased.

363
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:40,808
But I can't swallow capsules without water.

364
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:45,808
And it was Tomioka-san who
handed Odori-san his shake.

365
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:48,918
He had plenty of chances, too.

366
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,318
And he tried to pick up the cup immediately.

367
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:56,828
In other words, these four
could've poisoned the shake.

368
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,388
But...

369
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:00,488
Yeah.

370
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:04,768
For some reason, no poison was
found in Odori-san's drink.

371
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,968
Yeah.

372
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:08,628
However it was poisoned,

373
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:12,318
there should be poison in the
shake itself or the container.

374
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:16,418
And if we can't figure that out,
we can't make any progress.

375
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,488
Right, Conan-kun?

376
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:22,108
Rather, Kudo Shinichi-kun?

377
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,748
Well, yeah.
