1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.840
That restaurant was surprisingly good.

2
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.740
Yeah, and that kind of price for lunch,

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.240
-it's a real bargain, right? -Right!

4
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.140
Look Out!

5
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.240
Darn you!

6
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.740
Oh no!

7
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.040
Are you all right?

8
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.440
Yes, thank you very much.

9
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.940
Like the fog clears.

10
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.140
Let's see through love and crime as well.

11
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.240
A Japanese style mansion with complicated contraptions.

12
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.040
An incident occurs at the Red Leaves Palace.

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.840
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:44.023
"Solving the Mysteries at the Red Maple Palace (Part 1)"

17
00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:54.023
Wow, somehow I feel sorry for troubling you guys!

18
00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:55.723
To think you'd invite us to your house

19
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:58.223
despite us not doing much.

20
00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:02.723
Since we were saved by the renowned great detective Kogoro Mouri,

21
00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:05.023
"Eiko Suzaka (48), chauffer" -our master insisted

22
00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:07.323
upon meeting with you to express his gratitude.

23
00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:12.723
Doesn't this road...

24
00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:15.723
lead to the Red Leaf Palace?

25
00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:17.623
That's my grandpa's house!

26
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:21.923
What? Is that case, is she really that real estate king

27
00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:24.823
Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose's granddaughter?

28
00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:28.423
No, they are not blood related.

29
00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:31.823
Her parents died in a traffic accident.

30
00:03:31.823 --> 00:03:34.023
And he recently adopted her

31
00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:36.023
from her relatives living in Hokkaido.

32
00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:39.223
My name is Kaede Nakakita, eight years old!

33
00:03:39.223 --> 00:03:40.523
Nice to meet you!

34
00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:42.723
And you?

35
00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.023
I'm Conan Edogawa.

36
00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.023
I'm seven years old.

37
00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:07.523
Please come in.

38
00:04:15.523 --> 00:04:18.123
Red leaves everywhere, I see.

39
00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:24.323
Who are those people, Suzaka?

40
00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.123
Milady Nobue.

41
00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:29.523
The truth is that we were saved from harm's way by these people.

42
00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:34.623
We were almost hit by a freak car!

43
00:04:34.623 --> 00:04:37.823
Thanks to this fine boy who called out to us.

44
00:04:39.423 --> 00:04:40.923
"Nobue Katayose (32), eldest daughter of Katayose"

45
00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:43.723
A freak car, huh?

46
00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:45.123
I see.

47
00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:49.923
Did someone drop by?

48
00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:51.423
Big brother.

49
00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:54.923
They say Kaede almost got into an accident with a freak car.

50
00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:56.223
"Ogito Katayose (35), eldest son of Katayose" -Accident?

51
00:04:56.223 --> 00:04:58.623
Bet it's because you were walking carelessly.

52
00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:01.023
And? Who're you guys?

53
00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:03.323
He's the one who saved us back then.

54
00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:06.923
The great detective Kogoro Mouri.

55
00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:08.123
Kogoro Mouri?

56
00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:10.823
The...

57
00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.723
That freak car was your doing, no?

58
00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:14.623
Were you driving the car?

59
00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:17.123
My car's still inside the garage!

60
00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:18.623
You're so adept at things like that,

61
00:05:18.623 --> 00:05:20.623
you could've used a stolen car.

62
00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:23.723
The garden fence! You put a hole in it, didn't you?

63
00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.123
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:25.123 --> 00:05:27.423
On the other side of the fence is a deep valley.

65
00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:29.923
Kaede likes to play around there, doesn't she?

66
00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:31.823
Kaede, that is.

67
00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:37.923
Oh, my bad.

68
00:05:37.923 --> 00:05:40.923
We both come from different mothers.

69
00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:44.323
We're both adopted children who survived our deceased mothers.

70
00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:47.223
We're not blood related to our father.

71
00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:50.723
In a household like this, problems are bound to happen.

72
00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:53.123
That's what's on your mind, isn't it?

73
00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:57.023
No worries, Detective Mouri will help us capture

74
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.723
the culprit who made a hole in the fence!

75
00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:02.123
The driver behind the wheel of that weird car!

76
00:06:08.123 --> 00:06:12.123
My sincerest apologies for your having to hear something like this.

77
00:06:12.123 --> 00:06:15.823
-Oh, no. -Well, please come in.

78
00:06:15.823 --> 00:06:18.123
The head of the household has been waiting for you.

79
00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:21.123
-Come on in, Conan! -Yeah.

80
00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:29.123
This sure is a spacious manor.

81
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:32.623
I wonder how much further this corridor goes.

82
00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:37.523
What's this?

83
00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:43.123
-This is a painting. -What?

84
00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:45.023
Peculiar, isn't it?

85
00:06:45.023 --> 00:06:46.723
It's Mr. Katayose's hobby.

86
00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:49.623
They say it's called "trick art".

87
00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:52.823
Trick?

88
00:06:56.523 --> 00:06:59.423
A maple forest growing inside the house?

89
00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:06.723
Not quite.

90
00:07:06.723 --> 00:07:08.923
While the trees immediately in front of us are real,

91
00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:11.023
those in the back are paintings.

92
00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:13.323
What?

93
00:07:13.323 --> 00:07:16.323
Now that you mentioned it.

94
00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:18.523
Pretty meticulous, I see!

95
00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:21.923
Huh? Where'd they go?

96
00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:24.523
Anyway, let's go on ahead.

97
00:07:28.223 --> 00:07:31.823
Don't tell me that this door's also a painting?

98
00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:33.123
Come on.

99
00:07:33.123 --> 00:07:34.823
Maybe you need to push it?

100
00:07:34.823 --> 00:07:36.323
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.323
Come on.

102
00:07:39.323 --> 00:07:41.923
Trick art again?

103
00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:44.723
Maybe it's a sliding door that opens sideways?

104
00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:48.023
It opened.

105
00:07:51.923 --> 00:07:54.223
Is Mr. Katayose's room over there?

106
00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.023
Seems so.

107
00:07:58.823 --> 00:08:00.723
This garden must be real, right?

108
00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:02.123
Yeah.

109
00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:06.823
Welcome.

110
00:08:17.623 --> 00:08:19.423
Please help yourselves in.

111
00:08:31.123 --> 00:08:32.223
Welcome!

112
00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:34.123
I've been waiting for you, Conan.

113
00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:37.323
Huh? Where's Mr. Katayose?

114
00:08:45.523 --> 00:08:48.523
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

115
00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:50.623
"Ouzaburo Katayose (68)" -Please have a seat.

116
00:08:50.623 --> 00:08:54.123
I am Ozaburo Katayose.

117
00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:56.923
Wow! How should I put it?

118
00:08:56.923 --> 00:08:58.523
Such extravagance.

119
00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:01.423
No, I mean, a fine hobby.

120
00:09:01.423 --> 00:09:04.623
Grandpa's "extravagances" are all fake!

121
00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:08.523
You can say so because you lived along with real nature, Kaede.

122
00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:10.423
I envy you.

123
00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:11.423
Due to circumstances,

124
00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:15.623
I adopted this child who lost her parents.

125
00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:18.823
To tell the truth, I regret it.

126
00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:22.623
Master Katayose.

127
00:09:22.623 --> 00:09:24.723
I heard you were in danger again today.

128
00:09:24.723 --> 00:09:28.023
I'm truly sorry about that.

129
00:09:28.023 --> 00:09:31.923
No, you don't need to apologize.

130
00:09:31.923 --> 00:09:34.723
It's what I'm the one who sowed the seed.

131
00:09:36.223 --> 00:09:39.723
I've provoked those not so good children.

132
00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:48.023
That was some vapid talk from me.

133
00:09:48.023 --> 00:09:50.623
Here, please try it.

134
00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.623
That milk was delivered straight from

135
00:09:52.623 --> 00:09:55.823
the ranch in Kaede's hometown.

136
00:09:55.823 --> 00:09:57.723
Any spoons, or...

137
00:09:57.723 --> 00:10:01.323
My apologies, but I don't use spoons.

138
00:10:01.323 --> 00:10:04.623
Enjoying the milk patterns drifting about in the cup

139
00:10:04.623 --> 00:10:06.323
is my joie de vivre.

140
00:10:06.323 --> 00:10:08.323
Call him stubborn.

141
00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:11.423
He will never even consider putting sugar in.

142
00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:14.623
Please help yourselves to these.

143
00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:16.523
Detective Mouri,

144
00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:19.423
I reckon you'd prefer sake instead?

145
00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:21.223
Well, well...

146
00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.923
In fact, I have matters I really need to consult with you.

147
00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:28.923
But unfortunately, I already have a meeting set at 3:00.

148
00:10:28.923 --> 00:10:30.423
After that's over,

149
00:10:30.423 --> 00:10:33.823
how about we talk over a few cups of sake?

150
00:10:33.823 --> 00:10:36.223
It would be my honor to join you.

151
00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:40.923
Too sweet!

152
00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:44.223
Please show him to the guest room.

153
00:10:44.223 --> 00:10:45.723
Understood.

154
00:10:46.523 --> 00:10:48.823
See, these are genuine!

155
00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:56.323
What a superb garden!

156
00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:59.323
They don't call this place "Red Leaf Palace" for nothing!

157
00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:04.223
I'll clean up.

158
00:11:04.223 --> 00:11:05.623
I'm fine. I'm fine.

159
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:08.323
It's a good distraction for me to move about.

160
00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:11.223
After all, my body won't last much longer.

161
00:11:16.523 --> 00:11:19.223
He's got cancer and doesn't have much longer to live.

162
00:11:19.223 --> 00:11:21.323
He's prepared for it.

163
00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:22.923
Mr. Katayose, I mean.

164
00:11:22.923 --> 00:11:24.723
Is that so?

165
00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:28.023
-Over here! -Wait up!

166
00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:30.523
-Huh? -What's wrong?

167
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.823
I thought the mountains were still a bit away,

168
00:11:32.823 --> 00:11:34.523
but it's actually this close?

169
00:11:34.523 --> 00:11:36.623
Grandpa's pretty proud of that.

170
00:11:36.623 --> 00:11:40.123
He said he tried to mimic the Hachiman shrine in Kamakura.

171
00:11:40.123 --> 00:11:42.623
Oh, the raised pathway (dankazura).

172
00:11:42.623 --> 00:11:45.323
By using the forced perspective effect,

173
00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:48.923
the pathway will appear to be much longer.

174
00:11:50.823 --> 00:11:53.123
Conan, look at that!

175
00:11:54.423 --> 00:11:56.123
It's my tree house.

176
00:11:56.123 --> 00:11:58.223
Grandpa made me that.

177
00:11:58.223 --> 00:12:00.523
Kaede, you're just like a boy.

178
00:12:00.523 --> 00:12:02.623
You got it! See?

179
00:12:05.823 --> 00:12:08.123
All right.

180
00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:10.023
Conan, climb up too.

181
00:12:10.023 --> 00:12:11.823
All right.

182
00:12:14.823 --> 00:12:17.123
This was cut by a knife.

183
00:12:17.123 --> 00:12:20.023
So it is true that Kaede's life's in danger.

184
00:12:24.523 --> 00:12:25.623
Then, does that mean

185
00:12:25.623 --> 00:12:28.223
you're not related to the Katayose family at all?

186
00:12:28.223 --> 00:12:29.923
That's right.

187
00:12:29.923 --> 00:12:33.623
Grandpa said my grandma was his best friend.

188
00:12:33.623 --> 00:12:37.023
I don't remember anything about grandma, though.

189
00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:39.323
Then, why were you adopted?

190
00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:40.723
I don't know.

191
00:12:40.723 --> 00:12:42.823
Grandpa can be forceful sometimes.

192
00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:44.223
He adopted me despite my uncle at the ranch

193
00:12:44.223 --> 00:12:47.623
agreeing to take care of me himself.

194
00:12:48.823 --> 00:12:50.623
I want to go back.

195
00:12:53.723 --> 00:12:56.323
-Conan! Come, show me how to play soccer! -What?

196
00:12:56.323 --> 00:12:59.323
You whipped a soccer ball up like magic earlier, didn't you?

197
00:12:59.323 --> 00:13:02.223
I'm surprised you noticed at a time like that!

198
00:13:02.223 --> 00:13:05.623
But that ball will go completely flat within ten seconds.

199
00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:09.923
I also have a ball in my house!

200
00:13:12.523 --> 00:13:14.523
I'll be the goalkeeper!

201
00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:17.423
You might fall into the pond if you stand there.

202
00:13:17.423 --> 00:13:18.823
I won't drop it!

203
00:13:18.823 --> 00:13:21.123
I don't mean the ball, I mean you.

204
00:13:21.123 --> 00:13:22.923
I won't fall either!

205
00:13:24.123 --> 00:13:25.823
She's a handful.

206
00:13:28.223 --> 00:13:31.023
Kick it stronger.

207
00:13:31.023 --> 00:13:32.523
Got it.

208
00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:35.123
Give it all you got! You're a boy, aren't you?

209
00:13:35.123 --> 00:13:36.823
All right!

210
00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:44.323
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.323
I'm sorry, grandpa!

212
00:13:47.323 --> 00:13:49.123
He's with a guest, right?

213
00:13:49.123 --> 00:13:51.523
Seems so since it's after 3:00.

214
00:13:54.423 --> 00:13:57.523
-What's wrong? -I heard a growl.

215
00:13:57.523 --> 00:13:59.523
I'm coming in.

216
00:14:04.023 --> 00:14:05.923
Grandpa!

217
00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:10.223
Steam is still coming from the cup.

218
00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:12.823
-The culprit's still around here! -What?

219
00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.323
Ran!

220
00:14:18.323 --> 00:14:20.123
Did someone come out from the annex?

221
00:14:20.123 --> 00:14:24.323
Someone? No, nobody came out.

222
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:25.523
Where's Pops?

223
00:14:25.523 --> 00:14:27.523
He's sleeping in the guest room.

224
00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:28.923
What happened?

225
00:14:28.923 --> 00:14:31.123
Hurry up and call him.

226
00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:35.223
This is...

227
00:14:39.323 --> 00:14:42.023
-He's dead. -What?

228
00:14:43.523 --> 00:14:46.623
Grandpa!

229
00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:48.723
Someone should've been here, right?

230
00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:52.723
Yeah. Look, the cup is still steaming.

231
00:14:53.523 --> 00:14:57.623
Looks like his death was the result of cyanide poisoning.

232
00:14:57.623 --> 00:15:00.023
What's all this racket about?

233
00:15:02.623 --> 00:15:04.023
Pops!

234
00:15:04.023 --> 00:15:06.523
What's wrong with father?

235
00:15:09.323 --> 00:15:10.523
Master!

236
00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:13.523
Please refrain from contaminating the scene!

237
00:15:16.723 --> 00:15:19.023
Is this... this a murder case?

238
00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:22.123
Nobue, was it you?

239
00:15:22.123 --> 00:15:25.023
What the... Was it you?

240
00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:26.923
You finally freaking did it!

241
00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:30.523
Cut the nonsense! I merely waited in my room!

242
00:15:30.523 --> 00:15:33.123
You were the one he called out first, no?

243
00:15:33.123 --> 00:15:36.323
-The culprit is this man! -She was the one who did it!

244
00:15:36.323 --> 00:15:39.123
Grandpa is dead.

245
00:15:40.423 --> 00:15:42.523
Kaede.

246
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.170
Where were you at the time of the incident?

247
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.670
I was in the garage cleaning the cars.

248
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.070
Is there anyone who can verify that?

249
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.870
No, because I was all by myself.

250
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.570
The guest who was meeting with Mr. Katayose from 3:00...

251
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.870
You have no idea who it was?

252
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.570
That is correct.

253
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.370
Since the conversation seemed to be quite a private one,

254
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.870
I didn't dare inquire further.

255
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.470
Does that mean the guest was either Ogito or Nobue?

256
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.170
Or it could have been both of them.

257
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.570
Have you any idea what kind of conversation it was?

258
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.570
Well, it would likely reveal Mr. Katayose's embarrassment.

259
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.770
Hello?

260
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.170
Yes, I'll definitely pay you next month.

261
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.670
What? You can't wait that long?

262
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.170
But...

263
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.970
Understood. I'll figure out a way.

264
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.270
Darn it!

265
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.770
It'll be too late if I have to wait for my share of the inheritance!

266
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.970
What should I do?

267
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.170
Mirror, mirror, tell me now.

268
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.070
Which dress should I wear to the funeral?

269
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.870
No way.

270
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.570
I can't declare bankruptcy now!

271
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.570
At least give me one more month.

272
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.270
Those two, immoral people...

273
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.570
They went after nothing else but Mr. Katayose's fortune.

274
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.370
Mr. Katayose, who had prepared for his death

275
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.770
would have had to talk to those two in due course.

276
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.770
However, we have no idea which of them was called first.

277
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.870
Inspector, that was forensics.

278
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.270
The milk in the pitcher tested positive for poison.

279
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.670
It's a simple case then!

280
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.470
The son and the daughter must have known well

281
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.870
about Mr. Ouzaburo's affinity to milk tea.

282
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:04.970
He or she took the chance

283
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.370
and mixed poison into the pitcher.

284
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.270
The only question is which of them did it?

285
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.670
But Pops, how did the culprit escape?

286
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.770
Huh?

287
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.070
What're you talking about?

288
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.070
Yeah. I had been standing in the corridor

289
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.270
for twenty minutes prior to the incident,

290
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.870
but no one came out from the annex.

291
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.970
Kaede and I were in the garden

292
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.870
and were watching the annex the entire time,

293
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.470
but no one stepped out!

294
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.770
In that case, the culprit had no place to escape.

295
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.670
So, was it a sealed room murder?

296
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.370
They must have concealed themselves

297
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.270
in Mr. Ouzaburo's hidden room.

298
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.570
It's behind that painting of the cottage door on that wall.

299
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.270
And when Conan ran away from the scene,

300
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.670
they secretly came out and fled, no doubt.

301
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.870
Kaede was still in annex though.

302
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.770
She was stunned by her grandpa's death and lost her composure,

303
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.570
so she didn't notice.

304
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.970
But, doesn't that door make a loud creaking sound when opened?

305
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.770
If a loud noise like that had sounded,

306
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.970
I bet even we could have heard it in the corridor!

307
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.870
That's because...

308
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.670
But then, where on earth did the culprit vanish to?

309
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.670
Miss, what's wrong?

310
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.770
Nothing.

311
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.670
Just thinking that Kaede is probably awake by now.

312
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.270
She was exhausted and cried herself to sleep.

313
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.570
There isn't a place in this house that's free from care.

314
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.070
Feel free to go check on her.

315
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.070
What shall I do?

316
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.870
Miss!

317
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.270
Let me go check on Kaede with you.

318
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.070
That's... What room is the key for?

319
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.670
Guess I really need to report this to the Inspector.

320
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.170
So he really did have hidden assets!

321
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.870
Why didn't you turn the key in to me instead of the cops?

322
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.170
This is private information among the Katayose family!

323
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.870
Only after we deem it irrelevant to the case,

324
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.970
will we abide to his will.

325
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.670
However, Mr. Katayose secretly entrusted Miss Suzaka

326
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.570
with that key, you know?

327
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.870
He said he would like me to hold on to this indefinitely if possible.

328
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.270
Now that Pops is dead, the entire house will become mine.

329
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.970
-I'm still here! -Shut up!

330
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.170
Hey! Open it up already!

331
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.870
Yes.

332
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.370
-There's something! -Bet it's a check!

333
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.570
So Pops planned to give it to this woman.

334
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.070
That's not true.

335
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.870
-I'll take a look! -I will.

336
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.370
-Hey, brat. -Hand it to me.

337
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.270
What? Something weird's written on it!

338
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.370
What?

339
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.970
Let's see...

340
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.570
Now, close the umbrella.

341
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.670
Gaze at the evening sun setting in the east.

342
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.970
Look at the two rods holding up the red leaves.

343
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.370
Search for a longer rod.

344
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.370
My dream of the red leaves shall lie dormant there.

345
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.070
What's that?

346
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.270
A code?

347
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.570
Could it be the location of the hidden assets?

348
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.970
The code...

349
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.470
Does it really lead to the location of a hidden fortune?

350
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.270
If so, why did he entrust Miss Suzaka with it?

351
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.670
And the culprit who murdered Mr. Ouzaburo?

352
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.870
What is the mystery behind the sealed room?

353
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.570
I need inheritance money instantly!

354
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.370
If only I could crack the code!

355
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.670
Wait!

356
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.870
The meaning of that...

357
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.570
I see.

358
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.970
That was scary.

359
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.970
But it looks like that guy figured something out.

360
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.770
That's it. I'll just wait for Ogito to solve the code.

361
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.970
I'll simply take everything away afterwards.
