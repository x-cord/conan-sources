1
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,810
Yeah. Welcome. I was waiting for you.

2
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,510
Thank you.

3
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,510
You don't look to be kids who live around here.

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,810
We came to camp.

5
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,110
And when we went to look at the lighthouse, it suddenly began to rain.

6
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,310
The roads became like rivers.

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,910
The way it's pouring, an umbrella will do you no good.

8
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,910
You can stay until the rain lets up

9
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,810
but once it stops, go home.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,910
Staying at this house will do you no good.

11
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,310
No good? What do you mean?

12
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,910
Strange things are happening at this house recently.

13
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,410
I think it's best you don't get involved.

14
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,610
Strange things?

15
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,110
I've never seen it

16
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,110
but the master says that a ghost appears.

17
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,710
What?

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,610
Come on. Stop saying things that scare children.

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,810
A ghost, they say.

20
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,810
Ghosts are a thing of the past.

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,410
It's not that I believe in it either

22
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,010
but the master is not someone who lies.

23
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:46,010
According to him, it seems to be yellowish white.

24
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,810
So, now that you've heard this, give me back the towels.

25
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,510
I'm sure it's a lie.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,810
He's just saying that because he wants us to leave as soon as possible.

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,110
Yeah.

28
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,810
Huh?

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,710
Hey. Didn't you just see something yellow?

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,610
I saw! It vanished right away, though.

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,510
Don't tell me that it's for real?

32
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,810
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

33
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,410
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

34
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,210
What was that we just saw?

35
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,310
The smell of a case at an old mansion!

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,910
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,010
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,810
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:22,868
"The Youth Detective Squad and the Haunted House"

40
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,668
It's still raining.

41
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,068
Huh? You guys are?

42
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:43,368
Sorry to be intruding on you. We're taking shelter from the rain here.

43
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,668
I see.

44
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,968
I'm Hideto Amamiya, a free loader here.

45
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:49,568
"Hideto Amamiya (27), Nobuteru's nephew" -Nice to meet you.

46
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,668
Wow!

47
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,768
It sort of looks like a science room.

48
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:57,068
There are a lot of devices here.

49
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:59,868
I'm a science researcher at the university.

50
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:01,968
I'm not only using this room, but also the annex in the yard

51
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,268
as a lab for experiments.

52
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:07,468
If you're doing such studies, what do you think?

53
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:10,168
About ghosts.

54
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,668
Oh. You heard Uncle's story.

55
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:18,568
I don't believe it. But uncle really seems to believe it exists.

56
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,968
This house is pretty old, isn't it?

57
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:25,068
Yeah. Uncle bought it 5 years ago when he resigned as president.

58
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:27,868
But, it was made almost 50 years ago.

59
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:31,368
Did he buy it without knowing of the rumor that a ghost appears?

60
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:33,168
Oh, about that...

61
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:37,968
No, uncle started saying that it appears from only about a half month ago.

62
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:39,768
So, nothing appeared till then?

63
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:44,268
No. The thing is, my aunt passed on two months ago.

64
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:48,168
Uncle says that my aunt is visiting him.

65
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:51,168
My aunt had bad legs.

66
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,468
Aunty!

67
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,868
My, Hideto.

68
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:59,268
Are you going out to sketch today too?

69
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,568
Yes.

70
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,268
I'm thinking of submitting it in the autumn exhibition.

71
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,368
Aunty!

72
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:21,268
It was where she usual went.

73
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:24,668
So, we can't understand why she fell over that day.

74
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,368
Poor aunty.

75
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:29,468
I'm sure your uncle was shocked too.

76
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,068
That's why he's saying things like he sees a ghost.

77
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:38,668
Thank you. For letting us stay for dinner.

78
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,668
It's still raining so...

79
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,668
Don't worry about it.

80
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,468
This stew is super delicious!

81
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:49,468
I see. If you like it, go for second servings, all you like.

82
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,868
Another plate for me!

83
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,668
You already finished eating?

84
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:55,168
I'm just making reservations!

85
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:59,168
I heard that your wife comes to visit you?

86
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,068
Oh, that's right.

87
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,968
But, your wife died, didn't she?

88
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:07,168
Yes. But she really comes.

89
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,668
She comes after it gets dark

90
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:12,868
and goes back at around 10pm.

91
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:16,068
How does your wife look?

92
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:20,668
Well, she just looks like a yellowish light.

93
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:23,368
Then I eventually hear...

94
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,568
Chieko's voice.

95
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:32,768
Just around tonight, she'll come and talk about her accident.

96
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:33,868
Huh?

97
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:35,768
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,468
Just what're you doing?

99
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,868
I'm truly sorry, sir.

100
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,568
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

101
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:48,668
Okay, it's about time I head back to my room.

102
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,568
I'm so very sorry.

103
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,568
I guess I'll be getting back to my lab too then.

104
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,268
Oh, Hana.

105
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,668
I cracked a beaker in my room.

106
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,868
Will you vacuum my room later?

107
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:01,468
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:04,268
It's in front of the drug cabinet.

109
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,468
Okay.

110
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:15,768
I wonder if he's talking to his wife's ghost now.

111
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:18,968
Somebody may be deceiving him.

112
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:22,568
But, he looked happy to be able to meet the ghost.

113
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,268
What shall we do?

114
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:26,468
-About what? -What do you mean about what?

115
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,568
If he's being deceived by someone,

116
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:32,768
we, the Youth Detective Squad can't overlook it.

117
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:36,268
But, you know. Mr. Ohtaguro is happy about it.

118
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:37,768
And we're not even sure if he's really being deceived.

119
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,068
Just what do you think you're saying?

120
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:42,268
You know very well that incidents of older people

121
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,068
being deceived and taken advantage of

122
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:46,368
is going around endlessly these days, don't you?

123
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:48,168
Okay.

124
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:55,168
Don't worry because there's no such thing as ghosts.

125
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,468
Hey, did you see that just now?

126
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:05,868
Yep. It moved on its own.

127
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:09,168
At any rate. Let's go upstairs.

128
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:18,168
Hi, Chieko.

129
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:20,668
It's Mr. Ohtaguro's voice.

130
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,868
So, you've come again tonight too.

131
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,668
Yes, I've come.

132
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,568
It's a woman's voice!

133
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,668
Nobody touched the door, but it opened.

134
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:38,768
I'm getting by somehow.

135
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:44,568
She really appeared!

136
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,768
The wheelchair moved on its own!

137
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,968
I heard the voice of a woman!

138
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:52,868
We didn't touch the door and yet it opened on its own!

139
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:54,968
In other words, what are you saying?

140
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:57,468
His wife's ghost appeared!

141
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:59,168
Huh?

142
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,868
We also saw the light. It was a yellowish color after all.

143
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:07,568
So, you're saying that it's exactly as Mr. Ohtaguro says.

144
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:10,768
Enough!

145
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:12,568
They're just children,

146
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:15,468
but I can't believe you're going on about ghosts.

147
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,368
And what do you people intend to do?

148
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,268
If you're leaving, I'll lend you umbrellas.

149
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,968
What shall we do?

150
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:29,268
Don't ask me.

151
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,968
"Poison"

152
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:04,068
Don't tell me that ghosts actually appear.

153
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,868
Let's go home already.

154
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:10,368
Mitsuhiko, go borrow umbrellas after all.

155
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,968
No! Why me?

156
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:18,368
Hey. Even if the ghost were to be real, it's Mrs. Ohtaguro, right?

157
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:20,868
I don't think she'll do anything bad, no?

158
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:21,868
Huh?

159
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,968
Conan, are you going to go borrow umbrellas?

160
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,668
No, just give me a minute.

161
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:58,568
I get the picture.

162
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,768
"Poison"

163
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:27,635
Thank you very much

164
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:30,835
for serving us dinner and giving us juice too.

165
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,635
Children shouldn't think about things like that.

166
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:38,335
Besides, here, we always drink tea just about this time.

167
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:41,635
Maybe a hot drink would've been better?

168
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,635
Because it's become quite cool recently.

169
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:49,235
We're fine. This juice is delicious.

170
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,035
Maybe Genta would've preferred eels over rice.

171
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,235
I guess.

172
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:56,535
I wonder if somebody would make a thing called eels juice.

173
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:58,335
What?

174
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,835
By the way, where is the other boy that was wearing glasses?

175
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,835
I thought he was here a minute ago.

176
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:05,335
Oh, you're right.

177
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:08,535
This is usual for Conan.

178
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:12,135
Yeah, he's that kind of guy!

179
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,835
This house is big,

180
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,235
so I hope he doesn't get lost.

181
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,635
Uncle!

182
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:27,735
Are you all right, Uncle?

183
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,835
Saburo, call an ambulance right away!

184
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:31,935
No need for that.

185
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,435
-You! -Conan!

186
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,135
Well, give me a break.

187
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:40,935
Hana, what's with this tea?

188
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:44,535
Uncle. Are you okay?

189
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:47,035
It's not surprising that it tastes bad.

190
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,735
Because there's salt in that tea.

191
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,135
Salt?

192
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:53,635
Why?

193
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:57,135
I switched the contents in the bottle with the poison

194
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,935
that was in your room, Hideto, to salt.

195
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,235
I saw Hana take the bottle with the poison in it from the shelf

196
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,935
and found the bottle that she had hidden in the kitchen.

197
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,635
Poison?

198
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,535
She took the poison with her?

199
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:13,435
Was she going to put the poison inside the tea then?

200
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:18,235
Hana was worried that the ghost would expose the truth about

201
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,535
Mrs. Ohtaguro's accident that happened 2 months ago.

202
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,735
The truth about the accident?

203
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,035
I... I...

204
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:34,835
I didn't think that she would die!

205
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:38,535
I just wanted to scare her a bit!

206
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,035
Hana, I won't tell you to return

207
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:46,835
the necklaces and broches that you took up to now.

208
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:50,835
But please don't steal anymore.

209
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:01,635
Somebody!

210
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,635
I figured if I tampered with the brakes of her wheelchair,

211
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:09,635
she would have trouble getting on and off from it. I felt good about it.

212
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:12,935
That's all I thought!

213
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:16,535
Hana thought that Mrs. Ohtaguro's ghost

214
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:20,035
might tell Mr. Ohtaguro about this.

215
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:23,735
But, you can't do anything about a ghost.

216
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:28,135
That's why Mr. Ohtaguro became Hana's target.

217
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,735
The salt that I had switched with the poison,

218
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:34,435
being poured into the tea is evidence.

219
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,335
You! What a thing to do?

220
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:43,135
I'm very sorry, sir.

221
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,935
But, you didn't have to worry about it.

222
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,935
Because there're no such things as ghosts.

223
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:55,935
Right, Hideto?

224
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:01,435
But, the wheelchair moved on its own, you know?

225
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:05,035
This house was made 50 year ago,

226
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,735
so it's no surprise that it's worn out here and there.

227
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,735
The wind that blew out from the space in the wall

228
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,935
pushed the wheelchair along.

229
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,235
The brakes were broken besides.

230
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:21,935
But, the door of the man's room opened on its own.

231
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:25,435
That door is old and the latch is weak

232
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:28,335
so the slightest shake will open the door.

233
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:32,235
Then what about the yellow ghost that was floating in that room?

234
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:36,635
Do you remember when we got here?

235
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:38,935
There's a greenhouse.

236
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:41,535
Gee. It's not serving as shelter from the rain at all.

237
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:42,735
Hey.

238
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,835
I wonder if we can get inside from there?

239
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,435
Hey, you guys!

240
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:50,135
Don't fool around now!

241
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,935
We just built that greenhouse half a month ago.

242
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:57,335
That greenhouse was built half a month ago.

243
00:16:57,335 --> 00:17:00,735
The ghost started appearing half month ago too.

244
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,735
By the way, is there anything around here that glows?

245
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,035
Something that glows?

246
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,135
You mean the lighthouse?

247
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:12,535
Yes, the identity of the ghost is the light of the lighthouse.

248
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:16,635
The light never used to shine directly on the house until now.

249
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,235
But, since the greenhouse was built,

250
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:21,735
and light directly reflected on the window glass,

251
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:25,135
it started to shine on the walls of this house.

252
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,635
The light that seeped in from the space in the wall

253
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:30,435
reflected on the glass of Mr. Ohtaguro's bookshelf

254
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,935
and created what looked to be a ghost.

255
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,735
I called the owner of the greenhouse a while ago

256
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:38,935
and was told that he closes the glass door at 10pm.

257
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:42,535
So that's why the ghost disappears at 10pm.

258
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:44,835
He also added that even on rainy days like this,

259
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:48,735
he keeps the windows open to keep the inside moisture free.

260
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:53,535
Then when we came, why did the 2nd floor wall flash with light?

261
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:56,735
Right after that Hideto came, remember?

262
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,235
That was probably the lights from his car.

263
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:03,435
We didn't hear the sound of the car because of the rain.

264
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:07,535
But I heard the voice of a woman from inside the room.

265
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,635
Right, right, the poison that I switched with the salt,

266
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,035
I put it in another bottle

267
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:14,735
and returned it to the shelf where it originally was.

268
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:19,235
Because the cabinet wasn't locked.

269
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,035
If Hana unlocked the cabinet,

270
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,835
she would've locked it to make sure nobody would notice.

271
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:29,435
So I think the cabinet was unlocked to begin with.

272
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:33,535
But despite the poison being inside the cabinet, why leave it unlocked?

273
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:37,535
It's strange for a professional like you to do something like that.

274
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:40,835
You're right. I was careless.

275
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:44,135
And back to the voice.

276
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:46,835
The ghost is the light of the lighthouse.

277
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,535
So, there must be a reason behind the voice too.

278
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:54,135
I thought so, so I checked Mr. Ohtaguro's room a while ago

279
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:55,535
and I found it.

280
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,035
Behind the bookshelf,

281
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:03,135
there was a speaker, a microphone and a wireless unit.

282
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:08,435
It's most likely that Mrs. Ohtaguro's voice was playing from here.

283
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:11,635
The one that can make things like these in this house is...

284
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:17,135
you, Hideto, right?

285
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,135
But, even if he did play the voice...

286
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,635
Does it mean that he used the voice of Mrs. Ohtaguro

287
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:24,135
that was recorded beforehand?

288
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:26,735
Hideto probably processed and changed his voice

289
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:30,035
to sound like a female's and played it.

290
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,035
Since Mr. Ohtaguro believed that the ghost of his wife was visiting,

291
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:37,035
Hideto probably assumed that Mr. Ohtaguro would think it was her.

292
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:39,835
Hideto, who ran over to the site of the accident,

293
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:44,435
realized that both brakes of the wheelchair were loose.

294
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:49,435
And from the way that Hana acted since Mrs. Ohtaguro passed away,

295
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:53,035
Hideto realized the connection between the accident and Hana.

296
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,735
So, he figured that if he cornered Hana even more,

297
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:59,835
Hana would act the way he was expecting her to act.

298
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:02,835
He acted out the voice of the ghost because he wanted her

299
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,835
to think that the ghost would speak the truth of the accident.

300
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,735
He then deliberately dropped his beaker

301
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:11,835
in front of the cabinet that wasn't locked, and asked her to clean it,

302
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,635
knowing what Hana would do.

303
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,435
Everything went as he planned!

304
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:22,635
Hana took the drug and tried to poison Mr. Ohtaguro!

305
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:26,035
Are you saying that I was after my Uncle's life?

306
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,035
Why would you say something like that?

307
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:29,635
The reason is this.

308
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:32,635
I brought this from the wastebasket in the room!

309
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:35,535
This is called a dunning letter, right?

310
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,435
It seems you've borrowed money here and there.

311
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:42,535
Your motive is money.

312
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,035
Since you had a lot of debts, Hideto,

313
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,335
you wanted Mr. Ohtaguro's assets.

314
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:54,335
Hey, then why didn't you talk straightforwardly

315
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:56,835
and honestly about it to Mr. Ohtaguro?

316
00:20:57,735 --> 00:21:04,035
Uncle is super strict when it comes to these things.

317
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:09,435
Hideto. Then, what this boy is saying is true?

318
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,835
Yes.

319
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:13,135
Please call the police.

320
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,035
The moon!

321
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:03,735
The rain has let up.

322
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:05,935
We just went to take shelter from the rain

323
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:08,435
but it turned out to be some night.

324
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:11,235
I'm sort of hungry.

325
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:13,435
Huh? Genta, not again.

326
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:27,835
Sir!

327
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:33,835
Will you keep that glass open a while longer just today?

328
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:34,935
Huh?

329
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:37,235
Please!

330
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:42,735
Conan, what are you doing?

331
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:44,235
Nothing.

332
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:47,935
Let's go home because Doc and Haibara are probably worrying about us!

333
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:50,235
Let's have Doc come pick us up.

334
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:52,135
Good idea.

335
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,935
How do you do?

336
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,135
Long time no see, Shuichi.

337
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:07,635
Is that joke popular in Britain?

338
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:11,735
Just like a child who is caught under the spell of Death.

339
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:12,935
How about it?

340
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:16,035
Can you do it, little Sherlock Holmes?

341
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,335
Yep! Of course!

342
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:24,335
Next Conan, "The Magician of the Waves (Part 1)"

343
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:27,578
Next Conan's Hint:

344
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:29,578
"Beach house"

345
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:30,678
In this episode, we're messengers for a ghost.

346
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,278
What will you be next time?

347
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:34,178
Maybe a messenger for a witch?
