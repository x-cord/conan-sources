1
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,991
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,791
After the tears is "The Company".

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,391
After the deduction, the culprit is finally found!

4
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:08,891
The black picture that connects to the Organization.

5
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,491
An unexpected person is there?

6
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:11,891
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,391
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,291
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:57,385
After getting information about

10
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,385
a clue to the past of the mysterious new student

11
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:02,885
called Eisuke Hondo from Heiji,

12
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:06,785
we visited the home of a plastic model shop owner

13
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:09,185
who said that he had the picture of Eisuke's father.

14
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:13,685
However, the picture we went to see was gone!

15
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,585
From the traces left in the room,

16
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:20,785
I deduced that it was the work of an intruder.

17
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,285
Well, by the way,

18
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:25,485
does anybody have the spare key to this room?

19
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,385
"Souhei Nishizato (32)" -Well, there are.

20
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:29,585
"Shopkeeper of a model shop" -Three people do.

21
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,485
Will you please call them

22
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,585
and ask them what they were doing today anyway?

23
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,285
Okay.

24
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,785
-Hey. -Conan.

25
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:43,285
How come you're not calling the police right away?

26
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:46,485
Don't tell me the one who broke in here is...

27
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:49,085
Not a member of the Black Organization.

28
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,485
There are too many clues left behind to have been carried out by them.

29
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:54,485
Then, why aren't you calling the police right away?

30
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:57,685
If the police come and start interrogation,

31
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,985
they'll find out immediately that

32
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:01,585
we're not his grandfather's acquaintance!

33
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:03,285
So, before that,

34
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:06,185
I'm trying to make him aware of the situation as soon as possible

35
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,985
and catch the one who snuck into this room.

36
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:12,285
I've got to get it back.

37
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:17,385
The picture of Eisuke Hondo's father that was taken!

38
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:24,985
"Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 2)"

39
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:27,785
Saori?

40
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:31,085
No, it's no big deal.

41
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,585
I was just wondering how you were doing.

42
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:36,385
What were you doing today?

43
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,685
What do I have to tell you,

44
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,785
who I don't go with anymore something like that?

45
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,785
I guess you're right.

46
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:45,185
Nothing really. I just went shopping for some clothes!

47
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,685
I'm going on a date with my new boyfriend from now.

48
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,385
I see. I'm happy for you.

49
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,385
Yes! We're going to go eat at an Italian restaurant in Beika Hotel!

50
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:56,285
I advise you to eat good food sometimes too, Souhei!

51
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,385
You're always eating cup noodles, right?

52
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,585
Yeah.

53
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:03,285
Make sure you take a bath! Understand?

54
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,685
Yeah.

55
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,685
Bye, then because he'll be coming here soon.

56
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,885
Don't call me anymore, okay?

57
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,585
Sorry.

58
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:19,585
Do I really have to do something like this?

59
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,485
Just in case.

60
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:28,185
Huh? What was I doing all day today?

61
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,385
Yeah.

62
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,385
I was confined to my room working on the war tank.

63
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,485
I was making the war tank! Tiger 1!

64
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,085
The contest is coming up too!

65
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,485
I see.

66
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,985
And? Is going well, Tago?

67
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,585
Yeah, just great!

68
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,585
Even the rust looks good!

69
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:45,385
Oh, I'll be looking forward to seeing it!

70
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,285
You've really become skillful recently too.

71
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,685
Oh, that's right.

72
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,885
Make sure you finish your soldier by tomorrow!

73
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:56,485
I want to make sure that it fits my tank.

74
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:58,685
-Tomorrow? -Yeah.

75
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:01,585
It would help a lot if you can also have it painted by then.

76
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:04,285
I'm going to start getting busy from day after tomorrow, you see.

77
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,785
No joke.

78
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:07,885
That means I've got to stay up all night.

79
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:11,585
I've got a load of dishes and laundry to do.

80
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,585
Do those things after you get up!

81
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:16,385
It's already late, and you'd be troubling you neighbors anyway!

82
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,985
If you like, I can go over to your place in the morning

83
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:23,285
and do your dishes and laundry while you're asleep, you know.

84
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:26,085
Thanks, that'd be a lot of help.

85
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,985
Oh, seems like someone's come.

86
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:30,785
See you tomorrow, then.

87
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,685
Delivery.

88
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,685
Okay, I'll be right there!

89
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:44,085
You were sick in bed all day with a cold?

90
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:46,585
Hey, are you all right or what, Furusho?

91
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,785
Yes, sort of.

92
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:52,185
It seems I've got a bad viral illness.

93
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,085
I advise you to clean your room up too, Mr. Nishizato.

94
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,385
Yeah.

95
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:01,685
Your room is just as bad as mine when it comes to being messy.

96
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,285
Yeah.

97
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,885
Talking about virus,

98
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:12,085
please make sure you upgrade your anti-virus software!

99
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:15,685
Yeah. A bad virus seems to be going around lately, I hear.

100
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:19,085
Yes. So if the pictures of the georama

101
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:22,585
that we made that you have on your blog is deleted by someone,

102
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,085
I'm going to cry.

103
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,185
But we can take the pictures over again anytime if we want.

104
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,285
Georamas are alive!

105
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:31,585
The feel and looks of the georamas change depending on the day!

106
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,085
Okay! Okay! I got it!

107
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,385
I'm always grateful for your skills in taking pictures.

108
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,885
Rest well and get well soon, okay!

109
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:43,885
Yeah, I got it. I'll upgrade the software,

110
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,885
-so don't worry. -It's wet.

111
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,185
Is this sweat?

112
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:53,285
Do you remember the number of the pairs of slippers you have?

113
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,685
No. Because when the georama is completed,

114
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,185
I call a lot of my friends over

115
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:00,085
and we talk about what we made while drinking.

116
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,685
I think I bought a lot of pairs though.

117
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:04,885
But I really don't know how many.

118
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,985
There aren't any damp slippers.

119
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:22,085
And? Are there any suspicious ones among the three?

120
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,385
Not at all.

121
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,785
They all seemed to be their normal selves.

122
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:28,685
Well, I guess we can call the police and leave the rest to them.

123
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:31,885
What kind of people are the three?

124
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,385
What kind of people...

125
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,185
I just told you a while ago, didn't I?

126
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:39,785
See, like are they fat, skinny, tall...

127
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:44,385
Saori, the first one I talked to is about 150 cm.

128
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,685
And a bit plump.

129
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,985
How rude!

130
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:52,185
Tago, the next one I called is quite small.

131
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:54,385
He's shorter than my ex-girlfriend.

132
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:57,485
The last one I called, Furusho is tall and thin

133
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:00,485
and is a little over 180 cm tall I think...

134
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,085
But who cares about things like that now?

135
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:06,085
Well... Now, I'm sure.

136
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,185
That the person who came in here

137
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:14,185
and took the picture is among the three.

138
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,585
-What? -What's more surprising is

139
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:23,385
that person is still right here with us hiding!

140
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:25,485
Hey, what do you mean right here with us?

141
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:29,085
Don't tell me together in this room with us?

142
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:30,985
Very interesting, kid.

143
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,385
If you insist that the culprit

144
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:35,285
is my ex-girlfriend Saori who has the spare key to this room

145
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:38,385
or my plastic model making friends Tago or Furusho

146
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,285
and they are here hiding in this room some place...

147
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:46,385
-drag the one out here right this minute. -Yeah, okay!

148
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:50,385
But, will you promise me something?

149
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,485
What is it? Tell me.

150
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:56,185
If the culprit comes out, before calling the police,

151
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:59,985
will you show us the picture that the culprit is still holding, to us first?

152
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:03,585
If the police come here,

153
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,585
they'll most surely confiscate the album as evidence, right?

154
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:11,185
Then, I won't be able to see the picture for quite some time again!

155
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,885
Yeah.

156
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:17,585
The picture of the guy who forgot his wallet at grandpa's Okonomiya shop

157
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:19,485
is what you're referring to, right?

158
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:26,485
Yeah. I think that he really needs the wallet back,

159
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,685
so I'd like to return it to him as soon as possible!

160
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:33,285
But, how do you know that

161
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:36,185
the one who stole the pictures is still in this room?

162
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,085
Sweat.

163
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:42,385
-Sweat. -Sweat?

164
00:09:42,385 --> 00:09:46,385
The chair that I used as a foot stool was damp with sweat.

165
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,385
In other words, the culprit like me,

166
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,285
used that chair as a foot stool

167
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:54,285
and the chair got damp from the sweat on the sole of his feet, right?

168
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:57,785
But just because the sweat isn't dried yet,

169
00:09:57,785 --> 00:09:59,785
that doesn't mean that the culprit is still hiding in this room, does it?

170
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:01,085
It's not here!

171
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,485
What's not here?

172
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,885
The slipper that the culprit

173
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:09,685
should've been wearing that is damp with sweat.

174
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,685
It's nowhere in sight.

175
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:15,385
See, since there are no footprints left on the floor,

176
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:17,685
it means that the culprit was wearing slippers, right?

177
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:20,385
Maybe the culprit wiped them off?

178
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,485
He broke in to the room after all!

179
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:25,585
If so, the culprit would've wiped the sweat that is on the floor too!

180
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:30,585
But, all you checked were the slippers at the entrance, right?

181
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:34,085
You didn't check the one that I'm wearing now, did you?

182
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:38,885
These could've been the slippers the culprit was wearing, you know.

183
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,385
My socks are quite thick,

184
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,285
so I wouldn't be able to tell even if the slippers were damp.

185
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:46,785
No, I think that even a super dense person would realize.

186
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:49,385
Because not only would the slipper be damp,

187
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:51,385
it would be warm too.

188
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:55,185
So, you'd know immediately that someone was here till a while ago!

189
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,685
When we came into this room,

190
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:59,185
nobody mentioned anything like that, which means...

191
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:02,085
the person who knew you were coming back to this room

192
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:05,785
still wearing those slippers rushed to hide some place.

193
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:07,085
True...

194
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:11,385
But, the culprit was rummaging through the room for the pictures, right?

195
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:14,485
How did the culprit know that he came back?

196
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,885
Oh, that's...

197
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,885
Look over there!

198
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:26,185
-The interphone? -Yeah.

199
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,885
When we came into the room a while ago,

200
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:31,585
I pushed the button of the interphone, didn't I?

201
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:40,385
And right after that, you followed us from behind.

202
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:44,485
That's why the culprit could also tell that you came home too!

203
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:47,285
Because the interphone tells you who's at the door right away

204
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,685
since everything is displayed on the screen.

205
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:58,585
Just like when the courier came a while ago!

206
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,685
Come to think of it, that's true.

207
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:01,785
I see.

208
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:06,385
With all of us coming up here to the room and ringing the doorbell,

209
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:08,685
the culprit would've had enough time to hide

210
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,385
while we open the front door.

211
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:11,685
That's right!

212
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:14,285
And? Who on earth is that culprit?

213
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:16,985
If you recall what the people were saying

214
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,285
when Mr. Nishizato phone them,

215
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,585
I think anyone can figure it out!

216
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:26,585
Because that culprit confessed where he was hiding...

217
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:32,185
on the phone.

218
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,985
No joke?

219
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:52,393
And? What were the three saying on the phone?

220
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,693
Yeah. I think it was...

221
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,993
Saori was like usual, was giving pieces of her mind.

222
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:02,893
Like eat right and take a bath.

223
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:06,693
Tago said he wanted me to finish my plastic model by tomorrow.

224
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:08,993
And, also to do my laundry and dishes

225
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:11,493
after I get up in the morning.

226
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:14,193
Furusho said for me to clean my room

227
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,793
so that I wouldn't catch a cold like him,

228
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:20,293
and advised me to upgrade the anti-virus software in my computer.

229
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:23,593
Which means that Mr. Furusho can be crossed off.

230
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:25,393
If you decide to clean your room,

231
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,793
you'd find him in there hiding.

232
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:29,893
Yeah, that's right!

233
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,393
Then, could it be Saori?

234
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:36,593
She told you to eat right and take a bath, right?

235
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:39,693
If you go out to eat or take a bath,

236
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,193
it would make it easy for her to get out of here.

237
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,993
That's suspicious.

238
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:47,593
Saori said I shouldn't call again because her boyfriend was coming.

239
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,393
I don't think it's Saori!

240
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,993
-What? -Because when you called her,

241
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:55,493
we couldn't hear her voice, right?

242
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:57,493
That means that the culprit is hiding in a place

243
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:00,993
where our voices or the noise we make can't be heard.

244
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:02,393
From a place like that,

245
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,693
I think the culprit would not be able to tell

246
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,593
if you leave this room or go to take a bath!

247
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:07,693
Besides, you said that

248
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:11,393
you usually leave the light on even when you go out.

249
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,393
In other words, the only teeny bit of information

250
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,693
that the culprit is able to get

251
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,193
if any is the time displayed on his cell phone.

252
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,893
Yeah, at this point.

253
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,493
Hey, wait a sec.

254
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,993
If the culprit's not Saori or Furusho, then...

255
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:29,893
The culprit is the one who asked you to finish the model by tomorrow

256
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:32,193
and moreover, told you to do the dishes and the laundry

257
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,793
after you get up in the morning.

258
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:36,993
I think it's Mr. Tago!

259
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,693
No way! Telling me to finish it by tomorrow

260
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:42,793
means he expects me to stay up all night, doesn't it?

261
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:45,393
If I'm up all night, he can't run away!

262
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:50,493
In order to flee, he had to take the risk of making you do so!

263
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:54,693
What things do you have to do

264
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,793
before preparing to make plastic models?

265
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:58,593
What things?

266
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,393
First, I have to get tools like the rasp,

267
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,693
the putty, paint, and etc out...

268
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,193
What, after you get all the tools ready?

269
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,393
Let's see...

270
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:09,593
I'll open the window to air the place out.

271
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:12,293
Don't tell me that...

272
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:15,193
you think that Tago is out on the balcony?

273
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,393
That's just it!

274
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:19,993
He had to have you open the window

275
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:22,393
in order to flee from the balcony.

276
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:25,993
Because just a while ago, after you and I went out on the balcony...

277
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:33,793
We locked the window!

278
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:34,893
I see!

279
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,493
He mentioned that you always keep the window open.

280
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,893
He figured that once Mr. Nishizato finishes making the plastic model,

281
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:42,993
he would open the window and go to sleep.

282
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:46,093
Yeah. So as long as he opens the window,

283
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:49,293
the culprit can also sneak a peek inside the room too!

284
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:52,393
But, when we came out here a while ago, there was nobody there!

285
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:55,093
Yep! Not anywhere in view.

286
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:58,493
Not anywhere in view?

287
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,893
You know now why the person told you

288
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:04,493
to do the dishes and laundry after you get up in the morning, right?

289
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:11,893
Hey, then don't tell me that he...

290
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:15,793
Right, the reason he said so

291
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:20,293
was of course to keep you from opening the lid of the washing machine!

292
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,293
Tago? You...

293
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:27,393
Oh, well, you see...

294
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:28,593
By the way, he said that

295
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:31,993
he'd do the dishes for you when he comes by tomorrow

296
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:34,093
because he was going to come into the room

297
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,493
from the balcony after you fell asleep,

298
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,393
and if by chance, you got up and caught him

299
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:42,293
before he goes out of the front door,

300
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,793
he could use it as an excuse and say, "I came early to do the dishes

301
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:48,093
but didn't want to wake you."

302
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:49,793
By saying something like this,

303
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,993
he could tiptoe around and act suspicious,

304
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,993
yet would be able to convince you of what he was doing.

305
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:59,193
Yeah. Of course what you told me of his height and physique

306
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,193
helped me reach my conclusion!

307
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,293
He probably used that chair as a footstool

308
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:07,093
in order to take the album that was on top of the bookshelf,

309
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,393
because he was short

310
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:12,093
and also built quite small.

311
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:15,093
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to hide in the washing machine!

312
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:20,393
I'm sorry, Souhei! I didn't mean malice at all!

313
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:21,993
I didn't touch anything else in the room

314
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,193
except for the room where the album was,

315
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,793
so please forgive me!

316
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,493
So, are you the one who deleted the data of the picture

317
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,993
-that was in the computer? -Yeah.

318
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:33,393
But don't worry! I took a back up of it.

319
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:34,993
After I deleted the picture in question,

320
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,893
I was going to secretly put it back where it originally was.

321
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,493
Same with the picture in the album.

322
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,193
That was all I was going to take out.

323
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,493
And! Just which picture is it?

324
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:46,493
I don't have any picture of yours that you wouldn't want me to have!

325
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,993
The model...

326
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:52,093
The one I showed you last time...

327
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:55,693
The German military number 4 war tank model H.

328
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:59,293
Huh? That war tank was pretty good.

329
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:02,093
The other model making members were praising it too,

330
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,093
saying that maybe you've started to get the hang of it.

331
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:05,193
That's not it.

332
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:08,893
I didn't make that tank.

333
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:10,393
It's something that I bought

334
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,893
when I went on a business trip abroad.

335
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:16,793
I actually bought it to use it as an example to make my own.

336
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,693
I just thought I'd surprise all of you

337
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:22,893
so I switched the name plate on it with mine and showed it to you guys.

338
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,593
But you guys believed that I made it

339
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:27,693
and started taking pictures of it.

340
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:28,893
On top of that, you started saying

341
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:31,893
that you would introduce it on your blog.

342
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:34,693
That's why I came here to retrieve the picture

343
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:37,993
before you upload it on the internet.

344
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:41,993
You usually go to the gym today, but you came back

345
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:45,293
so I ended up hiding in the washing machine.

346
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:46,793
Stupid!

347
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,393
I kept my mouth shut and played along with your lies,

348
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,393
-but you had to get all serious about it. -Huh?

349
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:54,793
I knew to begin with that you didn't make that tank!

350
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,493
We all decided to say nothing

351
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:00,693
and play along with you until you regained your confidence!

352
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:02,193
You were all just playing along with me...

353
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:03,793
How rude!

354
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,793
You're the one who's rude

355
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:08,593
because you're the one who tried to deceive us first!

356
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,593
Will you...

357
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:13,393
please show us the picture we came for?

358
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,993
And you won't be calling the police, will you?

359
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:17,393
Yeah.

360
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:20,193
You help look for the picture too!

361
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:23,693
Picture... What picture?

362
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,193
The picture of my grandfather

363
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:28,793
taken together with a customer that used to patronize the shop!

364
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,793
The man that often used to bring his son along!

365
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:34,493
-Do you know him too, Mr. Tago? -Yeah.

366
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:37,793
He used to go to the same university in Osaka as I did.

367
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,893
He used to take me a lot to the Okonomiyaki shop

368
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:41,793
that his grandfather used to run.

369
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,893
I was introduced to him there!

370
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,793
His grandfather said, that man was his number one customer!

371
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,093
If I remember correctly, that man used to scuba dive.

372
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:54,493
Huh? Didn't you say he was in the maritime-self-defense force?

373
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,193
Did he tell you that?

374
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:59,193
Oh, no. When I was about to pay the tab,

375
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,093
I dropped some loose coins.

376
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:04,393
The coins just happened to roll near his table,

377
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:07,193
and heard a bit of the conversation when I went to pick the coins up.

378
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:09,293
He said, "We're finally going to take the dive."

379
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,093
Take the dive?

380
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:16,793
I was absorbed in making tanks and warships since I was a child,

381
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:20,493
so back then, I thought he was talking about submarines.

382
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:23,093
So, I asked Souhei's grandfather about it, and he told me that

383
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,593
the man was just an employee working in an ordinary company.

384
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,593
So, that's when I thought

385
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,493
he's scuba diving with his colleagues or something.

386
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,793
-With his colleagues? -Yeah!

387
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:36,193
Back then, three or four men

388
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,193
dressed in black were with him

389
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,393
who looked to be foreigners were with him!

390
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,993
But it sure sounded like they were going

391
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:54,193
to challenge a very dangerous sea

392
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:57,093
because he was telling everybody

393
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:01,293
things like, "Good luck. No pain, no gain".

394
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,593
Good luck...

395
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:09,193
No pain, no gain...

396
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:15,593
At that time, was his son with him too?

397
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:17,193
No, he wasn't.

398
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,493
When he brought his son with him, it was only him and his son.

399
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:22,893
Isn't this the one?

400
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:24,693
Yeah, right, it's this picture!

401
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:27,593
This boy probably pushed the shutter of your camera

402
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:29,393
when he was looking through the view finder!

403
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:31,393
Yeah, I didn't know

404
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,093
until I had this picture developed either.

405
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:36,493
Was he really an ordinary businessman?

406
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:39,593
Yeah, at least grandfather said so.

407
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:41,093
That this man was a businessman

408
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,393
who was hired by the company!

409
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:48,193
So, do you know what company that is?

410
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:50,793
No, I have no idea.

411
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,493
Company?

412
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:35,993
I'm happy for you, Shinichi.

413
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:37,893
Shinichi! Shinichi?

414
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:39,693
Doc! No use.

415
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:42,893
He's been staring at that picture from a while ago

416
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:46,093
and I don't think he can hear you at all, Doc.

417
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,893
Shinichi is in a world of his own.

418
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:58,993
Company...

419
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,793
"Next Episode"

420
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:09,193
Something happened in this room.

421
00:24:09,193 --> 00:24:11,493
Yeah, most likely.

422
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,693
This is...

423
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,293
blood?

424
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,093
Evidence of "1/60"?

425
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:22,593
Yes. Evidence of "once an hour..."

426
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:25,693
Wrong, this didn't fly over here.

427
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:33,593
Next Conan, "Welcoming Cat from Right to Left"

428
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:50,993
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:53,793
"The face of the clock"

430
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,093
Doc, do you have a watch?

431
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,693
Well, my stomach watch is growling.

432
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,493
It's almost 20:00.
