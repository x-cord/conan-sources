1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.093
Well, I guess just about 500 cases.

2
00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:05.093
What? That's only half the number compared to mine!

3
00:00:05.093 --> 00:00:08.293
Yes, but that's if I limit the cases

4
00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:10.693
to those that I solved here in Japan.

5
00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:12.093
What?

6
00:00:12.093 --> 00:00:14.593
I've been staying in England as an exchange student for awhile

7
00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.393
and only returned to Japan occasionally,

8
00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:18.793
but my nanny would take on requests

9
00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:21.293
for solving cases of her own discretion.

10
00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:23.093
It's so unexpected that

11
00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:26.393
Hakuba who is famous abroad is here representing the east.

12
00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:30.193
Yep, I was so sure that it was going to be Shinichi Kudo.

13
00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:32.993
Right, the high school detective of the east

14
00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:37.493
is none other than Shinichi Kudo, right? It's not you!

15
00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:42.193
My nanny took the call from the director over there.

16
00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:44.693
He said that he wanted me to participate in place of Shinichi Kudo

17
00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:48.293
who he couldn't get a hold of as representative of the east.

18
00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:51.793
Nanny was hurt by the phrase, "in place of"

19
00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:53.793
and pleaded in tears for me to show the world

20
00:00:53.793 --> 00:00:57.593
that Hakuba is the high school detective of the east.

21
00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.893
So, I had no choice but to come back from England.

22
00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:03.593
That's the story,

23
00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:07.193
but it seems that I'm not suited to represent the east, am I?

24
00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:08.893
Of course you're not.

25
00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:10.493
Then, why don't we do this?

26
00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:14.493
I'm a guest participant from abroad.

27
00:01:14.693 --> 00:01:18.693
We'll appoint Conan Edogawa here as representative of the east.

28
00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:21.893
This young man here is pretty good at deductions too.

29
00:01:21.893 --> 00:01:23.593
I'm sure he is equal to if not better than the youth called...

30
00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:25.193
what's his name, Kudo.

31
00:01:25.193 --> 00:01:27.993
"What's his name"?

32
00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:29.693
But he's still a child...

33
00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:32.193
Who cares, no problem.

34
00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:33.993
I'd like to go to my room quickly.

35
00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.193
I'm pooped.

36
00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:37.393
I'd like to have dinner too.

37
00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:39.493
Oh, right.

38
00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:42.893
Okay. Mr. Koya is making dinner now

39
00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:45.393
so I'll come get all of you when it's ready.

40
00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:48.193
Oh, and I'd like to check your outfits that you'll be wearing

41
00:01:48.193 --> 00:01:49.393
when shooting the program tomorrow,

42
00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:50.693
so please wear it when coming to dinner.

43
00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:53.393
Make sure you wear outfits that suit the Detective Championship Game

44
00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:55.293
as we talked over the telephone.

45
00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:57.293
Huh, what?

46
00:01:57.293 --> 00:01:59.193
There's no such program?

47
00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:00.993
Is that true, Yoko?

48
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:04.393
No, I asked around the TV station,

49
00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:06.193
but nobody's heard of a special program

50
00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.593
called Detective Championship Game.

51
00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:11.193
Are you sure the man was really from Nichiuri TV?

52
00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.893
Yeah, he was wearing the stadium jumper of the station

53
00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:17.793
and his name is Hiroo Tsuchio.

54
00:02:17.793 --> 00:02:18.793
What?

55
00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:21.393
There's no director by that name?

56
00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:26.493
-Then who was that man... -That took the two of them?

57
00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:27.693
I see,

58
00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:30.293
that's what you call an outfit suited for the Detective Championship game.

59
00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:32.793
Yeah, I hate to dress like this

60
00:02:32.793 --> 00:02:35.093
other than to school or funerals.

61
00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:40.093
But, what a surprise that you knew that snobbish guy.

62
00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.993
Oh, you mean Suguru Hakuba.

63
00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:43.793
I met him when solving a case in the past.

64
00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:45.993
Did he get you that upset?

65
00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:49.993
Yeah, I hate the snobbish way he talks, like he's looking down at you.

66
00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:52.893
-He so much like you. -Oh...

67
00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:56.793
Well, at least you're cute, so way better than him in a way, though.

68
00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:57.993
I see.

69
00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:01.593
But from here, we're enemies.

70
00:03:01.593 --> 00:03:05.893
Don't talk to me no matter what comes up.

71
00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:06.993
Come in?

72
00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:12.193
Excuse me. Dinner's ready, so please come to the dining room.

73
00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.693
This sure is an old lodge.

74
00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:19.493
It looks to be fixed here and there, though.

75
00:03:19.493 --> 00:03:21.093
Who owns this place?

76
00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:24.293
I wonder? I hear that some rich person is renting it out

77
00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:26.993
since he has no use for it anymore.

78
00:03:28.993 --> 00:03:32.393
By the way, has she already gone to the dining room?

79
00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:33.493
She?

80
00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:36.493
No, I was just about to go call her now.

81
00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.593
Is there a woman here on this island too?

82
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:41.993
She was with us all the while.

83
00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:43.293
Yes!

84
00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:46.993
Dinner's ready.

85
00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.693
Oh, it's it time already?

86
00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:51.193
Oh no! I guess I took too much time!

87
00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:54.493
You mean, she was a woman?

88
00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:56.793
My school has strict rules.

89
00:03:56.793 --> 00:03:58.493
Skirts have to be 3 cm below the knee,

90
00:03:58.493 --> 00:03:59.993
scarves have to be symmetrical right and left,

91
00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:01.093
socks have to be black,

92
00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:02.593
and of course perms aren't allowed.

93
00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:04.593
If we shave our eyebrows, we get suspended.

94
00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:06.093
God knows how many times I was warned about

95
00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:07.693
this naturally brown hair of mine.

96
00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:10.193
But, I guess it's no big deal tonight

97
00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.193
because the cameras aren't here yet, right?

98
00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:14.293
Yeah, I guess so.

99
00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:16.893
Hey, you didn't change clothes.

100
00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:18.593
Yes, because unlike you people

101
00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:22.393
the school that I attend in England has no uniform.

102
00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:25.593
Wow, it looks delicious.

103
00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:27.693
Did you make all this, sir?

104
00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:30.593
-Yes. -Huh, where's the director?

105
00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:34.893
When I went to get him at his room a while ago, there was no answer,

106
00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:38.493
so I though he had already come here.

107
00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.493
Please show me to his room.

108
00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:43.393
Mr. Tsuchio.

109
00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:47.393
Dinner's ready. Mr. Tsuchio?

110
00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:50.693
No good, I guess he locked it so he could sleep.

111
00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:57.893
Blood.

112
00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:01.893
There's blood on the door knob.

113
00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:04.593
-Do you have a spare key? -No, there is no key to begin with,

114
00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:08.493
because like your rooms, the key can only be locked from inside.

115
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:10.993
If the rooms are the same, there should be two windows.

116
00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:13.293
Then, let's look inside through the window.

117
00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:16.393
You...

118
00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:23.793
Mr. Tsuchio!

119
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.578
I've figured out

120
00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:24.678
this locked room trick.

121
00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:27.478
Would you like me to show you?

122
00:07:27.478 --> 00:07:29.178
You've already solved it.

123
00:07:29.178 --> 00:07:31.778
Okay, show us.

124
00:07:31.778 --> 00:07:33.378
No, you can't.

125
00:07:33.378 --> 00:07:37.378
If you do so, the others will also figure out the trick.

126
00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:39.078
So, please write your deduction down

127
00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:41.578
and bring it to me like I mentioned a while ago.

128
00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:45.478
This is the first round, you know, and not the finals.

129
00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:49.078
Don't worry, he wouldn't do it right before our eyes.

130
00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:50.978
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

131
00:07:50.978 --> 00:07:54.378
the result would be the same even if this were to be the finals, though.

132
00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:56.478
What confidence.

133
00:07:56.478 --> 00:07:58.978
I hope that trick isn't something that goes like,

134
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:02.878
Mr. Tsuchio who was tied up in the locked room,

135
00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:05.678
after locking the door tied himself up, is it?

136
00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:06.878
No way,

137
00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:08.378
because if so, the representative of the west

138
00:08:08.378 --> 00:08:11.478
who untied him would've noticed,

139
00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:14.778
no matter how incapable a detective he is.

140
00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:16.778
How dare you call me incapable?

141
00:08:16.778 --> 00:08:18.778
That's true, it wasn't smart.

142
00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:21.178
You found blood on the door knob,

143
00:08:21.178 --> 00:08:23.878
broke the door down and entered the room.

144
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.078
In that case,

145
00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:27.478
we should've checked things out by looking in from the window

146
00:08:27.478 --> 00:08:29.478
and then decide whether we should break the door down

147
00:08:29.478 --> 00:08:31.178
or crack the window and enter.

148
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.478
Because if Mr. Tsuchio was leaning against the door

149
00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:35.578
or moreover, dead,

150
00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:38.178
at the point that the door is kicked open, the corpse would move,

151
00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:40.878
as well as disperse the evidence.

152
00:08:40.878 --> 00:08:42.578
Stupid, back then...

153
00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:43.978
Overreaching and carrying things too far

154
00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:47.178
for wanting to make it to scene before anyone else does.

155
00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:50.078
Aren't such people considered disqualified as detectives?

156
00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:51.478
Watch your tongue!

157
00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:53.778
He's not disqualified.

158
00:08:53.778 --> 00:08:55.478
Kudo.

159
00:08:55.478 --> 00:08:59.778
Heiji is just a bit too quick tempered.

160
00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:01.078
Hey...

161
00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:04.378
At any rate, I'm going back up to my room on the second floor

162
00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.178
and turn my room into a locked room,

163
00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:09.178
so wait for me while having dinner, will you?

164
00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:11.278
It'll take me at least an hour to do so.

165
00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:12.578
An hour?

166
00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:16.178
I see, the time it took Mr. Koya to show us to our rooms,

167
00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:18.578
to the time what happened at this room

168
00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:20.378
took just about the same time.

169
00:09:20.378 --> 00:09:22.778
The trick is an intricate one that requires that much time.

170
00:09:22.778 --> 00:09:25.578
Well, I guess so.

171
00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:27.278
I'd like to say this, just in case, though.

172
00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:30.378
This trick does not call for the foolish, uncouth detective's

173
00:09:30.378 --> 00:09:31.578
ill-mannered actions,

174
00:09:31.578 --> 00:09:32.978
so please keep that in mind.

175
00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:36.678
Well, I'm sure that he won't repeat the same mistake again.

176
00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:39.178
After all, he's got his local reputation as his father's name

177
00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.678
as chief of Osaka Police Department to maintain too.

178
00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:45.078
Right, representative of the west?

179
00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:46.778
But...

180
00:09:46.778 --> 00:09:50.778
I like passionate detectives like you.

181
00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:55.178
It's a ship

182
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.978
-that was anchored around here... -What's the matter, Kazuha?

183
00:09:56.978 --> 00:10:00.478
-and took the children. -Well, I have this bad feeling.

184
00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:02.478
The cell phone, it's still not going through?

185
00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:04.078
-The number you have reached... -No,

186
00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:05.678
it's still in the out of service area,

187
00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.378
and just keeps repeating that message.

188
00:10:07.378 --> 00:10:08.678
I see.

189
00:10:08.678 --> 00:10:12.678
Hey, Ran, don't you feel something strange?

190
00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:15.578
Like an unidentifiable eerie something

191
00:10:15.578 --> 00:10:18.178
is closing in on Heiji and the others.

192
00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:19.778
I think you're letting your imagination get the better of you.

193
00:10:19.778 --> 00:10:24.478
I'm sure that Heiji is okay and that he'll come back with Conan.

194
00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:26.578
I know, but something bothers me.

195
00:10:26.578 --> 00:10:29.578
The face of Heiji when he was being escorted off

196
00:10:29.578 --> 00:10:32.678
keep twirling around in my head over and over.

197
00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:35.878
How about Conan's cell phone?

198
00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:37.078
You still can't contact him?

199
00:10:37.078 --> 00:10:39.478
Nope, his is no good either.

200
00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:41.678
I wish that the representative of the east,

201
00:10:41.678 --> 00:10:43.178
Shinichi Kudo were there together with Heiji at a time like this.

202
00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:45.978
I would make me feel way better.

203
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:49.678
The number you have reached is out of service range...

204
00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:52.578
It's the same with Shinichi's cell phone too.

205
00:10:52.578 --> 00:10:55.878
Don't tell me that Shinichi is with them too?

206
00:13:08.778 --> 00:13:09.955
"Purple. Scent of Lavender"

207
00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:12.578
But it was found six months later that she had been murdered.

208
00:13:12.578 --> 00:13:14.278
And? The killer?

209
00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:15.878
Committed suicide before getting caught.

210
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.978
That's what I heard.

211
00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:23.378
What's up?

212
00:13:23.378 --> 00:13:24.978
No, well, you see...

213
00:13:24.978 --> 00:13:27.378
I forgot my cigarettes in my room.

214
00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:35.378
Wow, it's really raining cats and dogs now.

215
00:13:39.478 --> 00:13:41.878
What's the matter? You're drenched.

216
00:13:41.878 --> 00:13:45.078
Did you go look for a cigarette vending machine outside or something?

217
00:13:45.078 --> 00:13:47.378
Oh, no, I just went to check how things were outside.

218
00:13:47.378 --> 00:13:51.278
By the way, don't you think he's a bit too much time?

219
00:13:51.278 --> 00:13:54.478
Yes, it's been more than two hours since then already.

220
00:13:54.478 --> 00:13:56.378
I'll go ask him

221
00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.978
how much longer he thinks it will take him.

222
00:13:57.978 --> 00:14:00.078
Okay, please do.

223
00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:03.278
What? He's not in his room?

224
00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:05.078
No, no matter how many times I knock on the door,

225
00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.178
there's no answer.

226
00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:10.078
But, the door was locked, so maybe...

227
00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:13.178
I see, he probably completed the locked room

228
00:14:13.178 --> 00:14:15.478
and is watching from somewhere, snickering at us.

229
00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:18.278
If so, I'm sure he'd appear before us

230
00:14:18.278 --> 00:14:20.378
with that boastful look of his.

231
00:14:20.378 --> 00:14:23.278
I'll go check from outside, so wait here.

232
00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:25.178
Let me go with you!

233
00:14:25.178 --> 00:14:28.378
It worries me to let you go alone.

234
00:14:28.378 --> 00:14:29.978
Suit yourself.

235
00:14:35.678 --> 00:14:38.178
Come on. He's still there.

236
00:14:41.878 --> 00:14:44.378
He was smeared with blood, wasn't he?

237
00:14:44.378 --> 00:14:46.178
Yeah. Let's hurry to the room.

238
00:14:50.078 --> 00:14:51.478
You?

239
00:14:58.678 --> 00:15:00.278
Shoots.

240
00:15:02.078 --> 00:15:04.178
How is it, Heiji?

241
00:15:05.678 --> 00:15:08.878
No good! He's really dead.

242
00:15:15.178 --> 00:15:16.578
How are things?

243
00:15:16.578 --> 00:15:17.678
Just as you can see,

244
00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:19.978
he died on the spot after being hit on the head.

245
00:15:19.978 --> 00:15:21.778
The murder weapon is probably that hammer.

246
00:15:21.778 --> 00:15:23.678
It's got blood on it too.

247
00:15:23.678 --> 00:15:25.778
It was probably taken from that toolbox

248
00:15:25.778 --> 00:15:28.078
next to the lavender flowerpot.

249
00:15:28.078 --> 00:15:29.278
Were the windows locked?

250
00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:30.778
Yeah, they were,

251
00:15:30.778 --> 00:15:34.678
nice and tight until I opened them.

252
00:15:34.678 --> 00:15:38.178
The window frame also seems to be tightly in place with a screw.

253
00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:42.778
The entrance door doesn't look to have been tampered with either.

254
00:15:42.778 --> 00:15:46.778
Since there are no other escape holes or doors...

255
00:15:46.878 --> 00:15:48.578
It's a locked room murder.

256
00:15:48.578 --> 00:15:50.278
Moreover, the killers are either

257
00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:51.678
Ms. Koshimizu,

258
00:15:51.678 --> 00:15:54.878
Mr. Koya or Mr. Tsuchio, no?

259
00:15:54.878 --> 00:15:56.578
What? Brat!

260
00:15:56.578 --> 00:15:58.278
Why us?

261
00:15:58.278 --> 00:15:59.678
True.

262
00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:00.978
After Tokitsu left the room saying that

263
00:16:00.978 --> 00:16:04.678
he was going to turn his room on the second floor into a locked room,

264
00:16:04.678 --> 00:16:07.978
we began having dinner at the dining room downstairs.

265
00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:11.978
I left to go to the restroom, and wasn't there for about ten minutes.

266
00:16:12.178 --> 00:16:14.278
A few minutes after I returned,

267
00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:17.278
Mr. Tsuchio went to his room to get his cigarettes

268
00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:20.378
and Mr. Koya went to check on Tokitsu.

269
00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:24.678
If all during that time, Hakuba and you two were together,

270
00:16:24.678 --> 00:16:26.378
it would be most plausible.

271
00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:29.878
Hold it, I was only hired to come here.

272
00:16:29.878 --> 00:16:30.878
By who?

273
00:16:30.878 --> 00:16:33.178
The TV station would never plan a program like this

274
00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:35.078
where somebody would actually die, would they?

275
00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:36.478
I really thought it was a program

276
00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:37.978
that the TV station had planned to do.

277
00:16:37.978 --> 00:16:40.378
I'm an actor and I belong to an acting school.

278
00:16:40.378 --> 00:16:46.078
I received a letter asking to act the role of a TV director.

279
00:16:46.078 --> 00:16:47.778
I was told I'd be given an advance payment of 500,000 yen,

280
00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:49.178
and if the fact that I'm a fake is not revealed,

281
00:16:49.178 --> 00:16:50.878
I was supposed to have received another 500,000 yen.

282
00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:53.078
It's a great job that anybody would jump at, isn't it?

283
00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:54.378
And, now that everything's out in the light?

284
00:16:54.378 --> 00:16:59.578
Even so, if I just go through with the game,

285
00:16:59.578 --> 00:17:02.378
I was told I'd be given half the pay, that's 250,000 yen.

286
00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:06.278
Then, why did you go to your room to get your cigarette,

287
00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:10.278
and yet go outside and get drenched in the rain?

288
00:17:10.478 --> 00:17:12.378
I wanted to use the wireless radio that's in the shed

289
00:17:12.378 --> 00:17:14.078
to make emergency contact.

290
00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:15.078
But...

291
00:17:15.078 --> 00:17:16.978
it was destroyed!

292
00:17:16.978 --> 00:17:18.778
When I came to check the place out three days ago,

293
00:17:18.778 --> 00:17:20.978
it was just fine.

294
00:17:20.978 --> 00:17:22.778
-Honestly? -Yeah.

295
00:17:22.778 --> 00:17:24.778
But, how strange.

296
00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:28.678
You headed for the shed before this murder was committed.

297
00:17:28.678 --> 00:17:32.378
How did you know that this sort of emergency was going to happen?

298
00:17:32.378 --> 00:17:34.978
I just had a premonition.

299
00:17:34.978 --> 00:17:37.278
Honestly.

300
00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:41.678
Then, Mr. Koya, were also called by Mr. Tsuchio?

301
00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:45.578
Yes, I came here two days ago to look after all of you.

302
00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:48.378
I just happened to get time off

303
00:17:48.378 --> 00:17:51.278
from the household that I serve as steward so.

304
00:17:51.278 --> 00:17:54.278
But, you already knew the answer to the locked room murder, right?

305
00:17:54.278 --> 00:17:56.478
Because you told us to write the answer down and take it to you.

306
00:17:56.478 --> 00:17:59.378
I was told to say so if something happened in the locked room.

307
00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.478
The order went on to say to sneak the answer sheet

308
00:18:01.478 --> 00:18:03.978
under the toilet mat.

309
00:18:03.978 --> 00:18:05.878
That's a clever way to put it.

310
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:08.478
As if there's someone else pulling the strings behind the scene.

311
00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:10.378
No, I'm telling the truth.

312
00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:13.778
Whatever the story, I'm in the same boat as you all are.

313
00:18:13.778 --> 00:18:16.678
I was just told to come here as a high school detective

314
00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:20.278
representing the south by that fake TV director.

315
00:18:23.078 --> 00:18:24.678
I hate thunder!

316
00:18:24.678 --> 00:18:27.178
So, please close the window, quick, please.

317
00:18:27.178 --> 00:18:28.678
Yeah.

318
00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:31.778
Don't worry. I'll silence the thunder

319
00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.678
as well as the case soon.

320
00:18:33.678 --> 00:18:35.578
What's with him?

321
00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:43.478
At any rate, we three will check the place

322
00:18:43.478 --> 00:18:45.978
so you three suspects wait in the first floor dining room

323
00:18:45.978 --> 00:18:48.478
-till it's done. -If I could have my way,

324
00:18:48.478 --> 00:18:52.178
I would like you to do likewise and wait with them too.

325
00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:54.078
You're much too hot-tempered,

326
00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:55.378
or should I say reckless?

327
00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:56.978
What?

328
00:18:56.978 --> 00:18:59.878
Look at the shattered pieces of glass!

329
00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:03.178
And the footprints of your muddy shoes left on the desk!

330
00:19:03.178 --> 00:19:05.378
What a dreadful sight!

331
00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:07.878
Don't tell me that you opened the lock with your bare hands too.

332
00:19:07.878 --> 00:19:09.478
Yeah, I opened it!

333
00:19:09.478 --> 00:19:10.678
Bug you!

334
00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:12.278
He's venting his anger out on the wrong person.

335
00:19:12.278 --> 00:19:14.978
You really disappoint me.

336
00:19:14.978 --> 00:19:16.178
From what my father told me about you,

337
00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:18.978
I thought you were way more capable.

338
00:19:18.978 --> 00:19:21.578
After taking them to the dining room,

339
00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:23.878
we'll be resuming investigation

340
00:19:23.878 --> 00:19:26.178
but please try not to get in the way,

341
00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:28.278
representative of the west, okay?

342
00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:34.078
Hey, Kudo. Am I wrong?

343
00:19:34.078 --> 00:19:36.678
No. Not at all.

344
00:19:37.178 --> 00:19:38.878
Not at all?

345
00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:40.078
I'm referring to a ship that a man with a mustache,

346
00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:43.878
three high school students and a child boarded!

347
00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:47.878
There's no way you couldn't have seen them at all, right?

348
00:19:47.878 --> 00:19:49.478
What's the matter, Kazuha?

349
00:19:49.478 --> 00:19:52.878
Something bothers me after all

350
00:19:52.878 --> 00:19:54.478
about the look on Heiji's face back then.

351
00:19:54.478 --> 00:19:55.978
Okay, I'll leave behind a message saying,

352
00:19:55.978 --> 00:19:59.478
"Heiji Hattori was here!"

353
00:19:59.478 --> 00:20:02.678
Heiji was here?
