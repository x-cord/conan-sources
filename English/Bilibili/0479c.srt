1
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:03,328
"White. Highschool Detective in East" -So, now

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,930
"White. Highschool Detective in East" -since the high school detectives

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,731
of the east, west, south and north are all here

4
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:08,633
let's start with self-introduction!

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,935
Okay.

6
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:12,637
Are you're sure you don't mind the cameras not rolling?

7
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,308
I mean, there are no TV staff here at all!

8
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,810
Oh, the crew and TV talent who is MC for this program

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,712
are scheduled to be arriving tomorrow.

10
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:24,416
I wanted all of you to be here a day ahead.

11
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,817
Okay then.

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm Natsuki Koshimizu, a junior in high school.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,824
I was born in Fukuoka and is representing the south.

14
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,527
But, I've only solved about 100 cases to date,

15
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,229
so am still a beginner,

16
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:38,930
so take it easy on me, okay?

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,333
My name is Junya Tokitsu.

18
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,135
I was born in Tokyo, but since I was raised in Hokkaido,

19
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:46,638
I'm here representing the north.

20
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:48,907
I've solved up to 300 cases up to date.

21
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:52,210
People have been arrested and indicted in 250 of those cases.

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,012
But there were people who escaped

23
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,015
or committed suicide among them too.

24
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,416
I'm Heiji Hattori.

25
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm pretty well-known in the Kansai district.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,824
The number of cases that I've solved so far is one, two, three...

27
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,426
Well, with over a thousand cases to my name,

28
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:10,729
I've lost track already!

29
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,931
A thousand cases.

30
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,132
Wow.

31
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:17,536
Hey, stop bluffing like that.

32
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,837
It's true,

33
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:21,606
if I include the times I searched for cats in my childhood.

34
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:25,310
I see, so you're Heiji Hattori.

35
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,512
My dad used to talk a lot about you.

36
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:29,814
He said that you're a detective with very keen intuition.

37
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:31,816
Huh?

38
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:34,419
How come your dad knows me?

39
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:36,521
Because he's the same as you, Heiji.

40
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,522
Same as me?

41
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:39,524
Right, Hakuba?

42
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:42,627
Yeah, my father is a police commissioner.

43
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:43,828
So, strangely enough,

44
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,131
I lived in an environment similar to yours being that

45
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:49,634
your father was the leader of the Osaka Prefectural Police.

46
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,737
By the way, how many cases have you solved?

47
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,107
Well, I guess just about 500 cases.

48
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:58,109
What? That's only half the number compared to mine!

49
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,313
Yes, but that's if I limit the cases

50
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,715
to those that I solved here in Japan.

51
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,116
What?

52
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:07,619
I've been staying in England as an exchange student for awhile

53
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,422
and only returned to Japan occasionally,

54
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,823
but my nanny would take on requests

55
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,326
for solving cases of her own discretion.

56
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,127
It's so unexpected that

57
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:19,431
Hakuba who is famous abroad is here representing the east.

58
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,234
Yep, I was so sure that it was going to be Shinichi Kudo.

59
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:26,037
Right, the high school detective of the east

60
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:30,508
is none other than Shinichi Kudo, right? It's not you!

61
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:35,213
My nanny took the call from the director over there.

62
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:37,716
He said that he wanted me to participate in place of Shinichi Kudo

63
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:41,319
who he couldn't get a hold of as representative of the east.

64
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,823
Nanny was hurt by the phrase, "in place of"

65
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:46,825
and pleaded in tears for me to show the world

66
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:50,628
that Hakuba is the high school detective of the east.

67
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,933
So, I had no choice but to come back from England.

68
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,634
That's the story,

69
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,238
but it seems that I'm not suited to represent the east, am I?

70
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,906
Of course you're not.

71
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,508
Then, why don't we do this?

72
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:07,512
I'm a guest participant from abroad.

73
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:11,716
We'll appoint Conan Edogawa here as representative of the east.

74
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:14,919
This young man here is pretty good at deductions too.

75
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,621
I'm sure he is equal to if not better than the youth called...

76
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,223
what's his name, Kudo.

77
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:21,026
"What's his name"?

78
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,727
But he's still a child...

79
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:25,230
Who cares, no problem.

80
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,032
I'd like to go to my room quickly.

81
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,233
I'm pooped.

82
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,435
I'd like to have dinner too.

83
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,537
Oh, right.

84
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,907
Okay. Mr. Koya is making dinner now

85
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:38,410
so I'll come get all of you when it's ready.

86
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,212
Oh, and I'd like to check your outfits that you'll be wearing

87
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,414
when shooting the program tomorrow,

88
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:43,715
so please wear it when coming to dinner.

89
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:46,418
Make sure you wear outfits that suit the Detective Championship Game

90
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,319
as we talked over the telephone.

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,321
Huh, what?

92
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,223
There's no such program?

93
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:54,025
Is that true, Yoko?

94
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,429
No, I asked around the TV station,

95
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,230
but nobody's heard of a special program

96
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,632
called Detective Championship Game.

97
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:04,235
Are you sure the man was really from Nichiuri TV?

98
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,938
Yeah, he was wearing the stadium jumper of the station

99
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:10,809
and his name is Hiroo Tsuchio.

100
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:11,810
What?

101
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,412
There's no director by that name?

102
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:19,517
-Then who was that man... -That took the two of them?

103
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:20,719
I see,

104
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,321
that's what you call an outfit suited for the Detective Championship game.

105
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,824
Yeah, I hate to dress like this

106
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:28,126
other than to school or funerals.

107
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:33,131
But, what a surprise that you knew that snobbish guy.

108
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,033
Oh, you mean Suguru Hakuba.

109
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,835
I met him when solving a case in the past.

110
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:39,037
Did he get you that upset?

111
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:43,007
Yeah, I hate the snobbish way he talks, like he's looking down at you.

112
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,910
-He so much like you. -Oh...

113
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,814
Well, at least you're cute, so way better than him in a way, though.

114
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,015
I see.

115
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:54,619
But from here, we're enemies.

116
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:58,923
Don't talk to me no matter what comes up.

117
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,024
Come in?

118
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:05,230
Excuse me. Dinner's ready, so please come to the dining room.

119
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,734
This sure is an old lodge.

120
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,537
It looks to be fixed here and there, though.

121
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,139
Who owns this place?

122
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,308
I wonder? I hear that some rich person is renting it out

123
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:20,011
since he has no use for it anymore.

124
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:25,416
By the way, has she already gone to the dining room?

125
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,518
She?

126
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:29,521
No, I was just about to go call her now.

127
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,623
Is there a woman here on this island too?

128
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,026
She was with us all the while.

129
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:36,327
Yes!

130
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,031
Dinner's ready.

131
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,733
Oh, it's it time already?

132
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,235
Oh no! I guess I took too much time!

133
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:47,539
You mean, she was a woman?

134
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,808
My school has strict rules.

135
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,509
Skirts have to be 3 cm below the knee,

136
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,011
scarves have to be symmetrical right and left,

137
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,112
socks have to be black,

138
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:55,613
and of course perms aren't allowed.

139
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,615
If we shave our eyebrows, we get suspended.

140
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,117
God knows how many times I was warned about

141
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:00,718
this naturally brown hair of mine.

142
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:03,221
But, I guess it's no big deal tonight

143
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,223
because the cameras aren't here yet, right?

144
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:07,325
Yeah, I guess so.

145
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,928
Hey, you didn't change clothes.

146
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:11,629
Yes, because unlike you people

147
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:15,433
the school that I attend in England has no uniform.

148
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:18,636
Wow, it looks delicious.

149
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,738
Did you make all this, sir?

150
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:23,608
-Yes. -Huh, where's the director?

151
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:27,912
When I went to get him at his room a while ago, there was no answer,

152
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:31,516
so I though he had already come here.

153
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,519
Please show me to his room.

154
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,421
Mr. Tsuchio.

155
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:40,425
Dinner's ready. Mr. Tsuchio?

156
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,728
No good, I guess he locked it so he could sleep.

157
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,935
Blood.

158
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,906
There's blood on the door knob.

159
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,609
-Do you have a spare key? -No, there is no key to begin with,

160
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:01,512
because like your rooms, the key can only be locked from inside.

161
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:04,015
If the rooms are the same, there should be two windows.

162
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,317
Then, let's look inside through the window.

163
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,420
You...

164
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,828
Mr. Tsuchio!

165
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,628
"Gray. Highschool Detective in North" -Mr. Tsuchio!

166
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,831
"Gray. Highschool Detective in North" -The window is locked.

167
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,801
It seems the door was completely locked too.

168
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,903
Then, this is a locked door murder case?

169
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:39,909
Yes, but obviously that's only if he's dead.

170
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,113
He's alive.

171
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,015
What happened?

172
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,917
What a relief! What happened?

173
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,721
Oh, somebody knocked on the door.

174
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,324
I answered the door. But, there was no one there.

175
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,826
When I was about to go back into the room,

176
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,729
I was suddenly drugged from behind.

177
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,100
Problem number one of the Detective Championship Game!

178
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,502
Solve this locked room mystery.

179
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,405
After solving the mystery, write it down

180
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,807
and bring it to me.

181
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:15,111
If your deduction is the truth, you will make it to the second level

182
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:19,115
and as well as allowed to leave this island.

183
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:22,618
Which means that the battle has already been launched!

184
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:26,622
Then, is there a hidden camera somewhere?

185
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,024
But, how unexpected.

186
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:30,626
I thought that the first level was to see through

187
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,229
the fact that this person is a fake director.

188
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,032
Just what do you think you're saying? I'm really...

189
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,500
Quit playing dumb with us.

190
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,004
Back then, when he said you went overboard,

191
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,807
he meant you had a tough time because the shooting

192
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,810
took all the way till after midnight.

193
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,314
And the remark, "laugh" that the girl made after that

194
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:54,617
means do something about something.

195
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,619
I mean you're no new AD and all.

196
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:01,023
There's no director that doesn't understand movie language like those.

197
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:04,026
Besides, that mark of Nichiuri TV that you have on you is strange.

198
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,429
The groove of the eye isn't right.

199
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:09,232
The real one grooves in the opposite direction.

200
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:13,603
That's why everyone figured you were a fake and tested you.

201
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:17,607
Well, you can explain after we make complete the first round though.

202
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,511
Sorry, but count me out.

203
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,813
I've figured out

204
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,915
this locked room trick.

205
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,718
Would you like me to show you?

206
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,419
You've already solved it.

207
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,022
Okay, show us.

208
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,624
No, you can't.

209
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,628
If you do so, the others will also figure out the trick.

210
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,329
So, please write your deduction down

211
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,832
and bring it to me like I mentioned a while ago.

212
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,702
This is the first round, you know, and not the finals.

213
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:50,306
Don't worry, he wouldn't do it right before our eyes.

214
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,208
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

215
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,611
the result would be the same even if this were to be the finals, though.

216
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,713
What confidence.

217
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:00,216
I hope that trick isn't something that goes like,

218
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:04,120
Mr. Tsuchio who was tied up in the locked room,

219
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,923
after locking the door tied himself up, is it?

220
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,124
No way,

221
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:09,625
because if so, the representative of the west

222
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,728
who untied him would've noticed,

223
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:16,032
no matter how incapable a detective he is.

224
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,000
How dare you call me incapable?

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,002
That's true, it wasn't smart.

226
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,405
You found blood on the door knob,

227
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,107
broke the door down and entered the room.

228
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,309
In that case,

229
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,711
we should've checked things out by looking in from the window

230
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,713
and then decide whether we should break the door down

231
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,415
or crack the window and enter.

232
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,717
Because if Mr. Tsuchio was leaning against the door

233
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,819
or moreover, dead,

234
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,422
at the point that the door is kicked open, the corpse would move,

235
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,124
as well as disperse the evidence.

236
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,826
Stupid, back then...

237
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,228
Overreaching and carrying things too far

238
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,431
for wanting to make it to scene before anyone else does.

239
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:51,300
Aren't such people considered disqualified as detectives?

240
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,702
Watch your tongue!

241
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:55,004
He's not disqualified.

242
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,706
Kudo.

243
00:10:56,706 --> 00:11:01,010
Heiji is just a bit too quick tempered.

244
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,311
Hey...

245
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,615
At any rate, I'm going back up to my room on the second floor

246
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:07,416
and turn my room into a locked room,

247
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,419
so wait for me while having dinner, will you?

248
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,521
It'll take me at least an hour to do so.

249
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,823
An hour?

250
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:17,426
I see, the time it took Mr. Koya to show us to our rooms,

251
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,829
to the time what happened at this room

252
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,631
took just about the same time.

253
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:24,000
The trick is an intricate one that requires that much time.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,802
Well, I guess so.

255
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:28,504
I'd like to say this, just in case, though.

256
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:31,607
This trick does not call for the foolish, uncouth detective's

257
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,808
ill-mannered actions,

258
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,210
so please keep that in mind.

259
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,913
Well, I'm sure that he won't repeat the same mistake again.

260
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:40,416
After all, he's got his local reputation as his father's name

261
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,918
as chief of Osaka Police Department to maintain too.

262
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:46,322
Right, representative of the west?

263
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,024
But...

264
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:52,028
I like passionate detectives like you.

265
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,399
It's a ship

266
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,200
-that was anchored around here... -What's the matter, Kazuha?

267
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,704
-and took the children. -Well, I have this bad feeling.

268
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,706
The cell phone, it's still not going through?

269
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,307
-The number you have reached... -No,

270
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,909
it's still in the out of service area,

271
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,611
and just keeps repeating that message.

272
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:09,912
I see.

273
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:13,916
Hey, Ran, don't you feel something strange?

274
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,819
Like an unidentifiable eerie something

275
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,422
is closing in on Heiji and the others.

276
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,023
I think you're letting your imagination get the better of you.

277
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:25,728
I'm sure that Heiji is okay and that he'll come back with Conan.

278
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,830
I know, but something bothers me.

279
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,800
The face of Heiji when he was being escorted off

280
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,903
keep twirling around in my head over and over.

281
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:37,106
How about Conan's cell phone?

282
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,307
You still can't contact him?

283
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,710
Nope, his is no good either.

284
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,912
I wish that the representative of the east,

285
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,413
Shinichi Kudo were there together with Heiji at a time like this.

286
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,216
I would make me feel way better.

287
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:50,920
The number you have reached is out of service range...

288
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,823
It's the same with Shinichi's cell phone too.

289
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:57,126
Don't tell me that Shinichi is with them too?

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,703
"Purple. Scent of Lavender"

291
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,873
It's out of service range after all.

292
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:22,676
Well, this is an isolated island.

293
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,479
What, no joke?

294
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,980
I just went to the restroom for a while

295
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,282
and yet there almost nothing left already.

296
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,385
Hey, mister, you're eating too much.

297
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:34,688
I know, I was starved, you see.

298
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,189
Gosh.

299
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:38,592
Okay, so now that you're filled, tell us.

300
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,495
Won't you, fake TV director?

301
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:44,398
Tell us why you're participating as a fake TV director

302
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,299
for this Detective Championship Game.

303
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,502
If this program is to measure our capabilities,

304
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,504
what's your role?

305
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:52,105
No. I can't tell you that

306
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:54,374
because if I do, I won't get paid. I bound by contract.

307
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:57,277
With Nichiuri TV?

308
00:13:57,277 --> 00:14:00,680
Then, will you answer this question?

309
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,684
I was concerned since I set foot into this lodge

310
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:07,888
about the fragrance of the lavender flower over there.

311
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,991
Now that you mentioned it, there is a lavender flower in our room too.

312
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,092
Yeah.

313
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,794
There's one in my room too.

314
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:16,296
It seems to be in every room.

315
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:20,200
And that toolbox that's sitting over there.

316
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,803
There's a meaning to it too, isn't there?

317
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,905
Well, I wonder.

318
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,275
It is the detective's job to figure that out.

319
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,277
That's how I see it, is it not?

320
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:34,281
True, but since we're separated from the outside world,

321
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:36,183
we don't have the means to check.

322
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:39,286
Homicide at Lavender Manor.

323
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,891
The only thing lavenders bring to my mind

324
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:48,895
is the incident that occurred in Shikoku a year ago.

325
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:51,097
I've heard of that case too.

326
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:54,701
The one who was killed was the lady of the mansion.

327
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,783
Miss!

328
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,486
"Young Lady at the Lavender Manor Commits Suicide"

329
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:15,088
"Motive Unknown. The Door is Locked"

330
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,890
"Possibility of Intruder"

331
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,595
But it was found six months later that she had been murdered.

332
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:23,296
And? The killer?

333
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,898
Committed suicide before getting caught.

334
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:27,000
That's what I heard.

335
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:32,405
What's up?

336
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:33,974
No, well, you see...

337
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,376
I forgot my cigarettes in my room.

338
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:44,384
Wow, it's really raining cats and dogs now.

339
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,891
What's the matter? You're drenched.

340
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:54,094
Did you go look for a cigarette vending machine outside or something?

341
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,396
Oh, no, I just went to check how things were outside.

342
00:15:56,396 --> 00:16:00,300
By the way, don't you think he's a bit too much time?

343
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,503
Yes, it's been more than two hours since then already.

344
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:05,405
I'll go ask him

345
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,973
how much longer he thinks it will take him.

346
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,075
Okay, please do.

347
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,279
What? He's not in his room?

348
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,080
No, no matter how many times I knock on the door,

349
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,181
there's no answer.

350
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:19,085
But, the door was locked, so maybe...

351
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:22,189
I see, he probably completed the locked room

352
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,491
and is watching from somewhere, snickering at us.

353
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:27,294
If so, I'm sure he'd appear before us

354
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,396
with that boastful look of his.

355
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:32,299
I'll go check from outside, so wait here.

356
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,200
Let me go with you!

357
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,404
It worries me to let you go alone.

358
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:39,005
Suit yourself.

359
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:47,180
Come on. He's still there.

360
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,386
He was smeared with blood, wasn't he?

361
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,188
Yeah. Let's hurry to the room.

362
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:00,493
You?

363
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,302
Shoots.

364
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,206
How is it, Heiji?

365
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:17,877
No good! He's really dead.

366
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:25,585
How are things?

367
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:26,686
Just as you can see,

368
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,989
he died on the spot after being hit on the head.

369
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:30,790
The murder weapon is probably that hammer.

370
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,692
It's got blood on it too.

371
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,794
It was probably taken from that toolbox

372
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:37,097
next to the lavender flowerpot.

373
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,298
Were the windows locked?

374
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,799
Yeah, they were,

375
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,703
nice and tight until I opened them.

376
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:47,173
The window frame also seems to be tightly in place with a screw.

377
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:51,778
The entrance door doesn't look to have been tampered with either.

378
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:55,782
Since there are no other escape holes or doors...

379
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,584
It's a locked room murder.

380
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,285
Moreover, the killers are either

381
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:00,687
Ms. Koshimizu,

382
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,890
Mr. Koya or Mr. Tsuchio, no?

383
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,592
What? Brat!

384
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,293
Why us?

385
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,695
True.

386
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:09,996
After Tokitsu left the room saying that

387
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:13,700
he was going to turn his room on the second floor into a locked room,

388
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,003
we began having dinner at the dining room downstairs.

389
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:20,974
I left to go to the restroom, and wasn't there for about ten minutes.

390
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,276
A few minutes after I returned,

391
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:26,279
Mr. Tsuchio went to his room to get his cigarettes

392
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,382
and Mr. Koya went to check on Tokitsu.

393
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:33,687
If all during that time, Hakuba and you two were together,

394
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,388
it would be most plausible.

395
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:38,892
Hold it, I was only hired to come here.

396
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:39,893
By who?

397
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:42,195
The TV station would never plan a program like this

398
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,097
where somebody would actually die, would they?

399
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:45,498
I really thought it was a program

400
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:47,000
that the TV station had planned to do.

401
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,402
I'm an actor and I belong to an acting school.

402
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:55,075
I received a letter asking to act the role of a TV director.

403
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,776
I was told I'd be given an advance payment of 500,000 yen,

404
00:18:56,776 --> 00:18:58,178
and if the fact that I'm a fake is not revealed,

405
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,879
I was supposed to have received another 500,000 yen.

406
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,082
It's a great job that anybody would jump at, isn't it?

407
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:03,383
And, now that everything's out in the light?

408
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:08,588
Even so, if I just go through with the game,

409
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:11,391
I was told I'd be given half the pay, that's 250,000 yen.

410
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:15,295
Then, why did you go to your room to get your cigarette,

411
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:19,299
and yet go outside and get drenched in the rain?

412
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:21,401
I wanted to use the wireless radio that's in the shed

413
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,103
to make emergency contact.

414
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:24,104
But...

415
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,005
it was destroyed!

416
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,774
When I came to check the place out three days ago,

417
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,976
it was just fine.

418
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,778
-Honestly? -Yeah.

419
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,780
But, how strange.

420
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,684
You headed for the shed before this murder was committed.

421
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:41,387
How did you know that this sort of emergency was going to happen?

422
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:43,990
I just had a premonition.

423
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,292
Honestly.

424
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:50,697
Then, Mr. Koya, were also called by Mr. Tsuchio?

425
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:54,601
Yes, I came here two days ago to look after all of you.

426
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,404
I just happened to get time off

427
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,273
from the household that I serve as steward so.

428
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:03,276
But, you already knew the answer to the locked room murder, right?

429
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:05,478
Because you told us to write the answer down and take it to you.

430
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,381
I was told to say so if something happened in the locked room.

431
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,483
The order went on to say to sneak the answer sheet

432
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:12,986
under the toilet mat.

433
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:14,888
That's a clever way to put it.

434
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:17,490
As if there's someone else pulling the strings behind the scene.

435
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,392
No, I'm telling the truth.

436
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:22,796
Whatever the story, I'm in the same boat as you all are.

437
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,698
I was just told to come here as a high school detective

438
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:29,302
representing the south by that fake TV director.

439
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,673
I hate thunder!

440
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,176
So, please close the window, quick, please.

441
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:37,677
Yeah.

442
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,780
Don't worry. I'll silence the thunder

443
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,682
as well as the case soon.

444
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:44,584
What's with him?

445
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:52,492
At any rate, we three will check the place

446
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,994
so you three suspects wait in the first floor dining room

447
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:57,497
-till it's done. -If I could have my way,

448
00:20:57,497 --> 00:21:01,201
I would like you to do likewise and wait with them too.

449
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,102
You're much too hot-tempered,

450
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:04,404
or should I say reckless?

451
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:06,005
What?

452
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:08,875
Look at the shattered pieces of glass!

453
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,178
And the footprints of your muddy shoes left on the desk!

454
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,380
What a dreadful sight!

455
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,883
Don't tell me that you opened the lock with your bare hands too.

456
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,484
Yeah, I opened it!

457
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:19,686
Bug you!

458
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,287
He's venting his anger out on the wrong person.

459
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:23,990
You really disappoint me.

460
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,191
From what my father told me about you,

461
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,994
I thought you were way more capable.

462
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,597
After taking them to the dining room,

463
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:32,899
we'll be resuming investigation

464
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,201
but please try not to get in the way,

465
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,303
representative of the west, okay?

466
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:43,076
Hey, Kudo. Am I wrong?

467
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,678
No. Not at all.

468
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,881
Not at all?

469
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,082
I'm referring to a ship that a man with a mustache,

470
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:52,886
three high school students and a child boarded!

471
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:56,890
There's no way you couldn't have seen them at all, right?

472
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,491
What's the matter, Kazuha?

473
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:01,895
Something bothers me after all

474
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:03,496
about the look on Heiji's face back then.

475
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:04,998
Okay, I'll leave behind a message saying,

476
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:08,501
"Heiji Hattori was here!"

477
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,704
Heiji was here?

478
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:16,776
Ran, when Heiji said, "He was here..."

479
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,778
Could he have meant...
