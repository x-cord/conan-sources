1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,024
"We're having barbecue today"

2
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:04,224
"Barbecue from afternoon"

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:09,624
"While we're at it, we're having barbecue for dinner too"

4
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:14,224
Come, come. We're only invited over for lunch, you know!

5
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,224
But, how lucky we are

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,224
to be invited to have barbecue together

7
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:20,024
from a couple we met at camp!

8
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:22,724
Yep! Since they said they forgot to bring rice,

9
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:25,924
all we did was share some of the rice that we had with them!

10
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:29,924
Well, it's also thanks to someone who got kidnapped too, though.

11
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,524
If the day we decided to camp wasn't shifted because of that incident,

12
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:35,824
we wouldn't have met that couple either, you see.

13
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:37,724
It couldn't be helped, could it?

14
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:40,124
Because on the Sunday after the incident,

15
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,224
we were interrogated for so long.

16
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:47,624
But why'd you come along with everybody back then?

17
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,924
You should've let dangerous things like that

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,724
up to Doc and Subaru.

19
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:54,824
Because Subaru told me to come along.

20
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:58,424
Besides, I couldn't stand just being there without doing anything.

21
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:00,624
Huh?

22
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,524
I figured that if I just stayed back home,

23
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:05,924
I would miss out at seeing the end of you.

24
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,224
Is that so?

25
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:14,624
But it sure is strange.

26
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:15,824
What is?

27
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:20,024
It's the first time you're calling him Subaru, isn't it?

28
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:22,124
So, you finally got used to him, eh?

29
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:25,924
Wipe that look off your face.

30
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:29,624
I won't let her get away.

31
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:35,124
It's not... anything like that.

32
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,024
Yes. Hello?

33
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:44,124
Yahoo! Conan, how are you?

34
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:48,024
Yeah, I guess so.

35
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,024
What's with that low reaction of yours?

36
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,824
I rescued you from a bad lady the other day, didn't I?

37
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,224
Yeah.

38
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:57,824
Go for it!

39
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:04,924
I'm glad! You're okay!

40
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,824
I guess so.

41
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:08,824
Thank you for everything back then.

42
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,424
Who is it, on the phone?

43
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:13,024
Oh, no.

44
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:16,624
That voice... Is it that girl named Haibara?

45
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:19,324
Conan, who are you talking with?

46
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,424
If it's from Ran, will you give me the phone when you're done?

47
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,724
Which voice are you talking about?

48
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:25,224
Who cares!

49
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,024
We finished school early

50
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,224
so we're heading over to the detective agency now.

51
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:31,924
If it's okay with you, why don't you bring her along too?

52
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:34,024
I'm going to be having barbecue from now today,

53
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,624
so I won't be there even if you come over.

54
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:38,124
Bye.

55
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,624
Hey, what's this barbecue thing about?

56
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:42,724
He hung up.

57
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,624
Come to think of it, Conan was saying that

58
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:48,224
he was invited over to have barbecue with the others.

59
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,924
Why didn't you say that earlier?

60
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,024
Sorry.

61
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:54,224
What' s this? Don't tell me you came over to Ran's

62
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:57,724
because you wanted to see that glasses brat?

63
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,224
Well...

64
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:04,124
I actually wanted to see Amuro, Kogoro's disciple too.

65
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:07,824
I see. Back then, it was dark in the middle of the road

66
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:11,324
and at the police station we were interrogated in different rooms, too.

67
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,924
Maybe they have mutual feelings for each other.

68
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:18,324
By the way, have you guys met that girl called Haibara?

69
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,624
Yep. You mean Ai, right?

70
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:23,024
I don't take too well to her.

71
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,124
What kind of girl is she?

72
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,924
She a little different, but she's cute.

73
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:30,424
I guess you could say that a not too friendly grown up woman,

74
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:33,924
shrunk and turned into a child.

75
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:35,924
A grown up woman?

76
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,824
Yep! She sometimes says things that sound really grown up.

77
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:40,824
Right, right.

78
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:44,724
Sometimes, she really resembles that glasses brat.

79
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,324
But Ai doesn't seem to be a Holmes freak or anything like that.

80
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:51,024
Masumi, I guess you just met Conan,

81
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,624
so you don't know much about him

82
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:56,524
but, Conan, like Shinichi loves Holmes.

83
00:03:56,524 --> 00:04:00,324
I know it from way long ago.

84
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:04,024
The vivid colored memories of summer

85
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,224
solve mysteries all season round.

86
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:08,024
Something only we witnessed.

87
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,924
A husband and wife fight because of a misunderstanding.

88
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

89
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:13,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

90
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:16,124
His name is Detective Conan!

91
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:08,965
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 1)"

92
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,565
Strange.

93
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,265
We've come here on time, and yet...

94
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,265
Happy Halloween!

95
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:31,765
Halloween has long gone, already.

96
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,465
I mean, usually during Halloween,

97
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:36,765
the children who visit the houses are the ones who disguise themselves.

98
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,865
-Right. -Yep.

99
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,165
That's why I told you not to, because it won't work.

100
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:47,165
What? I thought the children would like it.

101
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:50,665
You used to always take things too far from before.

102
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:52,965
Even at last year's Christmas party,

103
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:55,265
you wore a reindeer outfit.

104
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:58,065
That's because you told me not to wear the mini-skirt Santa outfit

105
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,765
because it was embarrassing, right?

106
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,965
Think of how old you are!

107
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:03,865
Well, I'm sorry I'm a middle aged lady!

108
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:06,465
Come, come, you two...

109
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:10,465
This is delicious!

110
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,465
This meat is really good!

111
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:15,765
You'd better eat vegetables too,

112
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,765
to eat a nutritious meal!

113
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,965
Okay!

114
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,365
You too, Doc.

115
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,765
Leave me alone.

116
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:27,365
Eating together with the children is a lot of run after all.

117
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,565
If you will excuse me asking, do you have any children?

118
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,165
None.

119
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:34,165
Although it's been 10 years since we've gotten married.

120
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,065
Only if we had children,

121
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:39,265
I guess my husband would've stopped flirting.

122
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:40,965
Huh?

123
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,565
Well...

124
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:44,765
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,465
It's not something I should say in front of children.

126
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:50,765
-No. -Hey, Sumika!

127
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,765
Do you know where my cell phone is?

128
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,465
No, I don't!

129
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:57,465
Maybe you have it in the pocket of your coat?

130
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:00,265
It's not there.

131
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,065
I'm supposed to receive mail from my superior at the company.

132
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,765
Don't tell me you forgot it again at the cabaret.

133
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,965
I'm not going to go pick it up for you again!

134
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,865
It can't be helped, can it?

135
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,865
Back then, I got a call from the shop to my office

136
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,965
and I was working, so...

137
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,665
Or rather, back then, you looked at the contents of my cell phone

138
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,765
-and did something, right? -Yes!

139
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:23,965
I sent mail after mail to all the girls

140
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:25,765
that were sending you suspicious mails!

141
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:28,165
"Die, you thief" I wrote!

142
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,965
I was wondering why I suddenly stopped getting mail,

143
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,865
but it was you after all!

144
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:36,565
So what? Your flirting is to blame for everything!

145
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:37,965
What?

146
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:41,765
Thinking that a jealous monster wife like you is waiting at home

147
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,165
make me want to flirt the more!

148
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,465
What? You come home late recently

149
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:49,465
because you're meeting some woman, after all?

150
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,065
Excuse me.

151
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,465
I'm sorry. This is nothing unusual.

152
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:00,665
Don't let us bother you.

153
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,065
I've been irritated recently, you see.

154
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:06,365
At any rate, won't you help me look for my cell phone?

155
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,165
The Department Head gets angry

156
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,265
if I don't return his mails right away.

157
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:10,565
Are you really sure that

158
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:11,965
you're waiting for mail from the department head?

159
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,865
Yeah!

160
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:16,365
It's the usual mahjong game he wants me to join.

161
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,765
Call my cell phone from yours.

162
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,365
I'll look for it, listening to the ringtone.

163
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:24,365
But I can't find my cell phone from this morning either.

164
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,865
I'm sure it's somewhere in the living room, though.

165
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:30,265
I wonder if they'll be okay? Those two...

166
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,565
I guess.

167
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:34,465
Like they say, a spat is evidence that they get along.

168
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:36,565
Even a dog won't involve itself in an argument

169
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:39,565
between husband and wife.

170
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,565
Genta, you sure can eat.

171
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,265
Aye! Because I'm not a dog!

172
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,865
Huh? You're leaving?

173
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:48,865
Yeah.

174
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:51,965
Why don't you drop by because you came all this way?

175
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:54,365
I just remembered I had something to do.

176
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:58,965
Besides, it seems like Kogoro's disciple is off today, too.

177
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,965
Don't tell me that you're saying

178
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:04,565
you're going home because the glasses brat isn't here?

179
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,365
No, no.

180
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:09,865
I really remembered something that I have to do.

181
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:11,865
But, to make up for this, the next time I come,

182
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:13,365
I'll have you show me albums

183
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,265
and tell me a lot of stuff I want to know!

184
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:18,165
About your boyfriend too, okay?

185
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:19,865
What?

186
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:24,665
You're really cheerful through and through!

187
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,965
Really?

188
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:29,665
Well, long time ago, there was this person that never laughed,

189
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:30,865
and I turned out this way

190
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,465
because I kept trying to make that person laugh.

191
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:38,965
Hey!

192
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:41,265
What? What is it?

193
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,765
What's the matter? Running off all of a sudden?

194
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:55,065
An acquaintance of mine...

195
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:57,865
I thought I saw somebody I knew.

196
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,565
An acquaintance?

197
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,965
Not possible.

198
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:18,065
I sure did eat.

199
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:19,965
I'm really full!

200
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,665
Are you taking a picture of Genta?

201
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:24,565
Yes, I'm going to make a diary of Genta's growth!

202
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:27,565
To show that this is how he became like Doc.

203
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,265
Hey, hey.

204
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,965
He's already quite close to Doc, I think.

205
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,565
A cell phone!

206
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,165
Isn't that the cell phone the couple was looking for a while ago?

207
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,765
Then, I'll go give this to them!

208
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:51,165
Yeah, I'm sure they're still in that living room.

209
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,065
Okay.

210
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,965
Excuse me, I found your phone...

211
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:04,765
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

212
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,065
I'm gonna kill you!

213
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:08,965
Hey, Sumika.

214
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:10,665
Cool it.

215
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:12,865
Sumika.

216
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,165
Die!

217
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,965
Bad... bad news!

218
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:25,665
Those two are at it again!

219
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:28,665
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

220
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,265
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

221
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:32,665
she's going to kill him.

222
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,465
-What? -What?

223
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,165
We've got to stop them, quick!

224
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:07,257
Mrs. Konno? Mrs. Konno?

225
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:08,857
Please open your eyes! Mrs. Konno!

226
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,657
Please get a hold of yourself!

227
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,357
She's still breathing.

228
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,257
Her complexion is pale and her pulse is barely detectable.

229
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:18,657
She's bleeding badly and her blood pressure's low.

230
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:21,157
Hey, Conan.

231
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,857
This thing that's poked inside,

232
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:24,657
isn't it better to pull it out?

233
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:26,657
-Don't touch the knife! -Huh?

234
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:28,857
If you pull that out, her wound will open

235
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:30,857
-and she'll bleed to death! -What?

236
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,157
Ai! Is the ambulance here yet?

237
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:35,657
They'll be here in about 10 minutes!

238
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:36,657
Okay!

239
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:40,357
Mr. Konno, do you have any cushions and blankets?

240
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:42,857
Hey! Cushions and blankets!

241
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,457
Gosh.

242
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,157
Doc and Ayumi, go get the cushions!

243
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:49,957
Mitsuhiko, you go look for the blanket and bring it over!

244
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:52,557
-Okay. -All right!

245
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:01,757
She's wearing only an apron and sweater.

246
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,657
She's dressed so lightly.

247
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:07,157
Even her pants are short Sabrina pants.

248
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:09,757
Hey, Conan. Do you need water or something?

249
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:10,857
No.

250
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,957
More than that, that's the kitchen over there, right?

251
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,457
Can you go get me a plastic bag if there are any?

252
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:19,057
-She may throw up. -Okay.

253
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,657
Here're the cushions!

254
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:24,157
Place it under her feet to raise them!

255
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:25,257
Yeah.

256
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:27,257
That'll decrease the blood flow to the legs

257
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:30,957
and increase the blood circulation around her heart area!

258
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,757
Okay!

259
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:35,057
What should I do with the blanket?

260
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:38,057
Cover her from her chest where the knife is stabbed to below.

261
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:41,057
That'll prevent her temperature from going down due to shock!

262
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:43,057
-Yes! -Now, all we need is

263
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:44,957
her blood type and history of past allergies,

264
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:48,957
while we wait for the ambulance to get here.

265
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:51,857
But, with her husband in that state...

266
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,257
You...

267
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:59,557
I know you're spaced out because you unfortunately,

268
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:01,057
accidentally stabbed your wife and is in shock,

269
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,957
at least tell us your wife's blood type and allergy history!

270
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,157
You're husband and wife

271
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,757
who promised eternal love to each other, right?

272
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:14,757
Sumika!

273
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:17,057
She has no allergies.

274
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,357
Her blood type is AB,

275
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,757
RH minus.

276
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:25,857
RH minus, blood type AB?

277
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,457
There are only 1 in 2000 people!

278
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:31,057
Ai! We'd better let the hospital know about this right away!

279
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,157
They probably won't have any blood in stock!

280
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:34,257
All right.

281
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,557
It's not that they don't have any at all.

282
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:43,557
I'm also RH minus, blood type AB too, you see.

283
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,357
Although I sort of have a rough idea,

284
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:54,057
would you give me the details

285
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:58,057
of why you stabbed your wife?

286
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,957
Like I told the person at the hospital a while ago,

287
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:05,357
what triggered the whole thing was my cell phone.

288
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:07,857
-What? -Well, you see, back then...

289
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,957
remember, I was looking for it? My cell phone.

290
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:14,557
I found it under the sofa of the living room.

291
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,857
And the mail from the Department Head asking me

292
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,757
to play mahjong with him hadn't come yet,

293
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:20,557
so I was going to call him

294
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,257
and ask whether the game was on for tonight,

295
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:25,557
but my wife took the cell phone away from me,

296
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,057
saying that she wanted to call her cell phone first,

297
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,757
so that she could ring it and look for it.

298
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:32,157
We found that cell phone.

299
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,457
-Right, Ayumi? -Yep.

300
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,857
So, I went to deliver it to you.

301
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:40,357
Is that why you got into a fight?

302
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:41,757
No.

303
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:45,757
The fight started after my wife rang her cell phone.

304
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,857
Hey, what's with this woman?

305
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:52,557
A number for a new woman's been added again!

306
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:54,057
Again?

307
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:55,457
Don't tell me that

308
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:58,257
you've been looking through my cell phone without telling me?

309
00:16:58,257 --> 00:16:59,657
Of course!

310
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,557
It's the job of a wife to supervise her husband!

311
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:05,357
I've been checking it every night after you went to bed!

312
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,657
Hey, hey.

313
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,957
Privacy exists even between husband and wife, you know!

314
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:13,057
What a woman. I shouldn't have married you.

315
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,057
You took the words right out of my mouth!

316
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,857
And that's when my wife with knife in hand

317
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:22,057
said that she'd kill me and charged forward to stab me.

318
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:26,257
While I was struggling with her, I felt her go weak,

319
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:27,457
and before I knew what was happening,

320
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:30,357
I saw the knife poked into her chest.

321
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,657
Is that what happened, Ayumi?

322
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:33,757
Yep.

323
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:35,557
But all I saw was

324
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:40,857
Mrs. Konno holding the knife saying, "I'm not forgiving you."

325
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,357
I see.

326
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:45,657
Well, I guess it was in self-defense.

327
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:46,857
But it's amazing how you two

328
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,557
continued to be a couple the way you were.

329
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:55,057
She changed. My wife.

330
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,157
When I met her in front of the mobile blood donation center,

331
00:17:57,157 --> 00:18:00,757
she used to be a kind woman who laughed a lot.

332
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:02,957
We sure run into each other a lot, don't we?

333
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,757
Really. We mutually have valuable blood types.

334
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:11,257
But recently, she's been constantly irritated.

335
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,757
Even after she comes home from work,

336
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,357
all she says is, "I'm fatigued, tired, sleepy."

337
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:18,057
And doesn't even make dinner.

338
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:21,257
When I decide to cook for her at times so she can take it easy,

339
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:24,957
she throws up as if to say that she can't eat the food I make.

340
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:28,357
I invited her to go camping where we used to go to a lot,

341
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,057
before we got married for a change,

342
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,657
but we get into a big fight

343
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,157
when she finds out that I forgot to bring the rice.

344
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:37,157
But, back then, thanks to all of you sharing the rice with us,

345
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,557
my wife became cheerful again.

346
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,857
But honestly, I couldn't stand it anymore.

347
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:48,057
But I like Mrs. Konno!

348
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:51,857
She wore the Halloween costume to entertain us,

349
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:54,957
and she was all smiles when making barbecue, too.

350
00:18:56,157 --> 00:19:00,857
I don't want Mrs. Konno to die!

351
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,957
Wipe that look off your face.

352
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,857
I know she'll make it through.

353
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:08,157
Yep.

354
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:10,757
Wipe that look off your face.

355
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:15,357
I won't let her get away.

356
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,057
Wipe that look off your face.

357
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:24,957
I'll protect you over my dead body.

358
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,157
Dai Moroboshi.

359
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:30,857
My older sister's boyfriend, who betrayed the Organization.

360
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:36,157
But, if that lady makes it,

361
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:39,157
it's probably thanks to us who came here, right?

362
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,157
Yes, I guess so.

363
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:44,057
If back then, the cell phone wasn't found

364
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,457
and Ayumi didn't go to give it to him,

365
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:48,857
we wouldn't have realized that the two were fighting

366
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:51,457
and maybe it would've been too late to save her.

367
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,757
Something just doesn't seem right.

368
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:05,157
Everything's moving too smoothly.

369
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:08,457
Like something's being manipulated.

370
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:13,657
But, what on earth is it?

371
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:37,157
"Surgery in progress"

372
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,257
It's sure taking a long time.

373
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:47,057
Don't worry! I'm sure she'll be fine.

374
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,657
Yep.

375
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:53,857
Oh, mail.

376
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:57,457
That's Mrs. Konno's cell phone that we found a while ago, right?

377
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:00,057
-Yep. -Let me see it.

378
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:06,957
No, you shouldn't read other people's mail without permission.

379
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,457
About you not feeling too well

380
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,557
that you asked me for advice about last time...

381
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:13,657
I suggest you go to see a doctor.

382
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:17,457
A heart mark at the end of the sentence?

383
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:20,457
Why a heart mark when she's asking for advice on not feeling well?

384
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:21,857
Why?

385
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:25,657
Hey, Conan.

386
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:28,357
Are you going to check the mails she sent out too?

387
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:32,257
This is...

388
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:33,657
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

389
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:37,457
The husband was saying that his wife sent mails saying, "Die, thief"

390
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,957
to the women that sent him suspicious mails, right?

391
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:44,357
Yes, but there's nothing like that here.

392
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,257
It does seem that she was irritated

393
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:49,057
because she wasn't feeling good, though.

394
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:53,057
I see! That's why that cup was over there!

395
00:22:53,057 --> 00:22:56,557
She wasn't feeling good, that is, she was feeling sick, right?

396
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:59,757
It looked like the lady was about to drink medicine.

397
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:03,757
Because I found a glass cup with water inside in the kitchen!

398
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,557
Glass cup with water?

399
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:09,157
Then, did you find medicine nearby too?

400
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:13,157
No. The only other thing there was a sugar container.

401
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:18,757
I was about to bring that water to the lady, but...

402
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:24,257
Are you all right, Genta?

403
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:26,957
Maybe you're the one who needs medicine, Genta.

404
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:30,357
Could it be that you have a cold?

405
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:34,457
No. My nose feels ticklish.

406
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:36,857
I can't stop...

407
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:40,457
Then, why don't you try holding the space below your nose

408
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,657
with your index finger and blocking off your nostrils?

409
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:44,557
Like this?

410
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:48,557
If that doesn't work, pinch your nose.

411
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:49,757
It stopped!

412
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:53,057
Well, it's something like a lucky spell.

413
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,757
Lucky spell...

414
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:57,857
Don't tell me it's...

415
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:04,257
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

416
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,757
"Next Episode"

417
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,357
The lamp turned off!

418
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:15,357
It seems the surgery has finished!

419
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:17,257
Sumika!

420
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:22,457
Here. The lamp on Ayumi's cell phone is on, see?

421
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:25,457
Maybe it's the telephone answering service?

422
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:27,157
Just as I thought.

423
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:30,157
This isn't fighting back in self-defense.

424
00:24:30,157 --> 00:24:34,157
If so, the next action that'll be taken is...

425
00:24:34,157 --> 00:24:35,557
Next Conan,

426
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,557
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 2)"

427
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:57,557
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:57,557 --> 00:24:59,557
"Water in the cup"

429
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:01,357
The fight between husband and wife is really tough.

430
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:02,657
Like distasteful dog food, maybe.

431
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,657
That even dogs wouldn't want to get a taste of.
