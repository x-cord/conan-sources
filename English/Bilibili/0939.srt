00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.270
"I saw the Oninohamura Village website.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.070
An article on there says a moon's droppings

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.570
was found at the Oninohamura Village Museum excavation site.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.170
Based on my research,

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.270
the fossil was found in a layer of earth

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.570
130 million years old.

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.770
There's no precedent of the moon's droppings

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.370
being discovered on earth from that era.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.870
I was hoping I could visit you and have an in-depth conversation."

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.070
Wait, she totally doubts us!

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.470
Yeah.

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.170
So, what are we going to do?

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.270
At this rate,

14
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.270
someone might discover we lied about the fossil's origins.

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270
There you go again.

16
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.170
You can handle a reporter or two.

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.270
Right, Mr. Politician?

18
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
Don't be ridiculous! I'm not that influential!

19
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.570
I'm just a town mayor.

20
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270
What? Are you kidding me?

21
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.570
Why do you think I'm working with you?

22
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.870
It's so you can do something about this!

23
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.970
Just solve it with money, then.

24
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.570
You may not be influential, but you've got money.

25
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.070
But...

26
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.070
You'll pay, won't you?

27
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.170
After all, your political career depends on it.

28
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.470

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:03.769
I had no idea ammonites were so pretty.

39
00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.569
I thought fossils looked more like rocks.

40
00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.869
Well, your typical fossil is much more plain-looking.

41
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.069
Then why's this one so sparkly?

42
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.869
Because it's made differently.

43
00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:19.669
Typically fossils are made when the matter

44
00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.069
that comprises bones and shells is replaced with minerals.

45
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.669
That sparkly one is sparkly

46
00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.469
because it was replaced with a gemstone like an opal.

47
00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.169
You kids sure are knowledgeable.

48
00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:36.869
You've got a lot of rare fossils.

49
00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:38.269

It's just my hobby.

All right.

73
00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.169
Like you said,

74
00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.369
I've decided to settle the matter with money.

75
00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:55.669
Good.

76
00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.369
I knew I could count on you, Mr. Mayor.

77
00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.869
So you don't need to worry about anything.

78
00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:05.869
Seriously.

79
00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.369
A journalist? Did you come to write a story about us?

80
00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:14.669
Of course not.

81
00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.769
They must've found some kind of rare fossil.

82
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.769
Come to think of it, I saw a story about that on the village's website.

83
00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:23.269
That's right.

84
00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:26.069
I came here because I saw the same story.

85
00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:27.469
"Moon's Droppings found at Oninohamura Village" -See?

86
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.069
"Gunma Prefecture!" -It says they found a moon's droppings.

87
00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:32.669
What's a moon's droppings?

88
00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.169
It's when the inside of a conch shell becomes a jewel.

89
00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.369
Does that make sense?

90
00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.869
It's a very valuable type of fossil.

91
00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.869
And they found that at the excavation site here?

92
00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.569
That's right.

93
00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:45.569
Look.

94
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.069
It looks like a turd!

95
00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.269
That's right. Droppings mean poop.

96
00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:54.169
What?

97
00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.869
Maybe ancient people thought the rabbit in the moon

98
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.669
had pooped on them.

99
00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.069
But I don't see it on display anywhere.

100
00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.669
We're thinking of making it the village's symbol.

101
00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.869
It's on display at the town hall.

102
00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:11.269
Their symbol is poop.

103
00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:13.569
Genta, that's rude.

104
00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.069
I hope it doesn't become a negative symbol.

105
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:22.269
Everyone, we're ready to begin the tour.

106
00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:24.369
Go ahead.

107
00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:33.469
Mr. Ogami, could I take a look at the site

108
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:35.569
where the moon's droppings were found later?

109
00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.569
Yes, of course.

110
00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.469
There's actually something I'd like to tell you.

111
00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:42.369
Very well.

112
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.169
All right! Let's find an ammonite!

113
00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.769
Genta, you're not going to find an ammonite.

114
00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:58.569
What? Why not?

115
00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:01.869
We could make a major discovery.

116
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:04.769
Different types of fossils are found in different layers of earth.

117
00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:06.369
All you'll find here

118
00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:09.869
are clam or oyster fossils.

119
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:11.469
Clams?

120
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:14.569
I had some in my miso soup this morning.

121
00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:17.769
But apparently, they've found ornithomimid dinosaur bones

122
00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:20.369
and footprints before.

123
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:21.369
Seriously?

124
00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.569
I wanna find a dinosaur.

125
00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:24.569
Let's do our best.

126
00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:26.069
-Yeah! -Yeah!

127
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:45.669
I don't see any fossils in there.

128
00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:48.469
They're quite difficult to find...

129
00:08:48.469 --> 00:08:50.469
Maybe there aren't any here.

130
00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:53.869
I didn't find any again.

131
00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:55.969
Genta, what if you hit someone?

132
00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.269
Sorry.

133
00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:01.069
This is a fossil.

134
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:02.269
What?

135
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:06.269
Look here. The color's darker.

136
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:08.869
This is a clam fossil.

137
00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:09.869
It's tiny.

138
00:09:09.869 --> 00:09:11.269
It's so plain.

139
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:15.869
It's not easy to find big ones.

140
00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:18.269
The only shortcut to finding good fossils

141
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:21.369
is to dig a lot.

142
00:09:21.369 --> 00:09:24.469
All right! Let's dig, dig, dig!

143
00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:27.869
That's the spirit.

144
00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:31.269
As long as you dig with passion, the fossils will find you.

145
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:32.369
All right!

146
00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:39.269
Fossils sure are complicated.

147
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:41.269
I don't understand them at all.

148
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:45.869
But I thought you were sponsoring the moon's droppings PR program.

149
00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:48.869
I've left most of it up to Ogami.

150
00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:51.769
All I do is sign off on it.

151
00:09:57.469 --> 00:09:59.669
Do you have a minute?

152
00:09:59.669 --> 00:10:01.169
Yes.

153
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:04.569
I've been wondering whether or not I should tell you.

154
00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:06.569
Ogami!

155
00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.069
Do you have a minute?

156
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:09.769
Sure!

157
00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:11.869
Excuse me. We'll talk later.

158
00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:21.269
Ai, want to go to the bathroom?

159
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:22.469
Sure.

160
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:31.069
Someone's inside.

161
00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:37.369
Are you all right?

162
00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:38.669
This smell...

163
00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.169
Yoshida, stand back!

164
00:10:56.969 --> 00:10:58.069
Ayumi, what's wrong?

165
00:10:59.069 --> 00:11:00.769
In the bathroom...

166
00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:05.069
Mr. Ogami!

167
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:07.969
This smell...

168
00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:31.436
"Misao Yamamura"

169
00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:33.536
"Gunma Prefecture Police Inspector Division 1" -I see, I see.

170
00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:37.536
The victim was Oninohamura Village lodge & fossil museum owner,

171
00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:39.436
Akira Ogami.

172
00:11:39.436 --> 00:11:43.436
And the cause of death was cyanide poisoning.

173
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.536
Is that it?

174
00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:48.436
Yes, it is.

175
00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:51.736
The victim didn't eat or drink anything

176
00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:54.436
during the fossil excavation tour.

177
00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:59.436
Which means someone poisoned the bathroom beforehand

178
00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:04.236
and made the victim touch it.

179
00:12:04.236 --> 00:12:07.436
Do you think we did it?

180
00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:09.536
We'd never do that.

181
00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:10.836
That's right.

182
00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:13.736
Besides, why would someone choose to kill him like that?

183
00:12:13.736 --> 00:12:18.036
These children could have been harmed.

184
00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:21.136
What? Oh, uh, you're right.

185
00:12:25.136 --> 00:12:27.336
Isn't you Conan?

186
00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:28.736
Does that mean

187
00:12:28.736 --> 00:12:31.536
Mr. Mouri's here, too?

188
00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:34.236
Mouri isn't here today.

189
00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:36.136
Oh, it's you, Dr. Agasa.

190
00:12:36.136 --> 00:12:40.036
You sure do get caught up in a lot of cases, too.

191
00:12:40.736 --> 00:12:44.036
Excuse me, but I don't think this is a criminal case.

192
00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:45.536
What? Who are you?

193
00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:47.336
Nakatani, the mayor.

194
00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:50.236
What? You're the mayor?

195
00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.136
Please excuse me.

196
00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:56.336
Ogami seemed worried about something for a few days now.

197
00:12:56.336 --> 00:12:58.436
I see. He was worried.

198
00:12:58.436 --> 00:13:02.836
Yes. He said he couldn't sleep and wanted to die.

199
00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:03.836
Why?

200
00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:05.736
I'm not sure.

201
00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:10.336
Maybe it was because of the moon's droppings.

202
00:13:11.936 --> 00:13:14.336
What's a moon's droppings?

203
00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.736
It's an ancient fossil of a shell.

204
00:13:16.736 --> 00:13:18.236
I see.

205
00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:20.036
The truth is,

206
00:13:20.036 --> 00:13:23.336
I came to expose that that fossil's origins were faked.

207
00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.036
They were faked?

208
00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:26.036
Yes.

209
00:13:26.036 --> 00:13:30.836
I believe the moon's droppings were found at a different excavation site.

210
00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:34.536
So Mr. Ogami killed himself because he thought he'd be discovered?

211
00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:35.536
Yes.

212
00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:39.136
He said there was something he wanted to confess to me.

213
00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:42.936
Perhaps he couldn't bear the guilt any longer.

214
00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:44.936
Unbelievable.

215
00:13:44.936 --> 00:13:48.236
Mr. Nakatani knows barely anything about fossils.

216
00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:50.836
He couldn't help that he didn't notice.

217
00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:55.436
But my village renewal plan is already in motion.

218
00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.636
Well, this looks like a suicide.

219
00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:01.836
Darn.

220
00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:04.736
I thought I'd finally

221
00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:07.336
get to gloriously solve a case again.

222
00:14:07.336 --> 00:14:11.836
But Mr. Ogami was excited about his trip next month.

223
00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:15.336
What trip?

224
00:14:15.336 --> 00:14:18.236
He said he was planning to go to America.

225
00:14:18.236 --> 00:14:21.236
There was a plane ticket on his desk.

226
00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:25.636
Would someone considering suicide buy plane tickets?

227
00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:29.436
Maybe he felt like dying after he made his reservation.

228
00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:31.936
It's not too late to decide that

229
00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:34.536
until after we determine if there's poison present or not.

230
00:14:34.536 --> 00:14:37.836
We haven't searched everyone yet, either.

231
00:14:43.736 --> 00:14:44.936
See?

232
00:14:44.936 --> 00:14:48.736
We didn't find any poison anywhere.

233
00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:50.436
Really?

234
00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:52.436
Yes. We didn't find anything

235
00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:54.336
on places the victim was likely to have touched.

236
00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:57.036
We found lots of fingerprints, though.

237
00:14:57.036 --> 00:14:59.736
So it was a suicide, then.

238
00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:02.536
Excuse me, but there's something I forgot to report.

239
00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:06.436
We didn't find poison on the victim's sanitary wipes,

240
00:15:06.436 --> 00:15:11.836
but they are slightly more acidic than normal.

241
00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:15.136
-Acidic? -Yes.

242
00:15:15.136 --> 00:15:17.236
-More than normal? -Yes.

243
00:15:17.236 --> 00:15:20.136
It's obviously unrelated.

244
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:23.136
Didn't I say we're looking for a cyanide compound?

245
00:15:23.136 --> 00:15:26.136
Okay, everyone. Shall we search the lodge next?

246
00:15:27.336 --> 00:15:30.836
That mayor is definitely the culprit.

247
00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:32.036
Really?

248
00:15:32.036 --> 00:15:33.536
But there's no proof.

249
00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:36.736
Why are they all dead?

250
00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:39.536
What are you guys doing?

251
00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:42.736
Look. There are lots of dead bugs.

252
00:15:42.736 --> 00:15:43.836
Poor bugs.

253
00:15:43.836 --> 00:15:46.436
Let's dig a grave for them.

254
00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:47.436
Wait.

255
00:15:52.436 --> 00:15:55.036
Could it be...

256
00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:57.136
Don't touch those.

257
00:15:57.136 --> 00:15:58.836
What's wrong, Conan?

258
00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:00.836
Did you figure something out?

259
00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:03.136
Yeah, thanks to the Youth Detective Squad.

260
00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:14.836
Since we didn't find any signs of poison at the lodge,

261
00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:17.836
-this must've been a suicide. -It wasn't a suicide.

262
00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:21.636
It's a murder.

263
00:16:21.636 --> 00:16:23.536
I finally figured out

264
00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:27.436
how the culprit killed Mr. Ogami.

265
00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:30.836
But Dr. Agasa, we didn't find poison anywhere.

266
00:16:30.836 --> 00:16:33.536
How did they kill him?

267
00:16:34.436 --> 00:16:38.936
It's hard to believe the victim would've drunk the poison himself.

268
00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:43.936
Mr. Ogami didn't drink the poison.

269
00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:47.236
What are you talking about?

270
00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:50.736
The victim clearly died of poisoning.

271
00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:53.236
Yes, but isn't there other methods of taking in poisons

272
00:16:53.236 --> 00:16:56.436
besides swallowing or licking them?

273
00:17:02.236 --> 00:17:04.036
You still can't figure it out?

274
00:17:04.036 --> 00:17:08.136
That's it. The victim inhaled the poison.

275
00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:09.536
That's right.

276
00:17:09.536 --> 00:17:11.736
Inhaled it? But how?

277
00:17:11.736 --> 00:17:14.136
People say cyanide compounds kill

278
00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:16.136
when they're swallowed,

279
00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:20.236
but actually, the compound itself is not poisonous.

280
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:22.636
However, once it enters your body,

281
00:17:22.636 --> 00:17:26.536
it reacts with your stomach acid, creating a poisonous gas.

282
00:17:26.536 --> 00:17:31.036
That's why people say swallowing cyanide compounds kill you.

283
00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:32.336
Yes.

284
00:17:33.336 --> 00:17:35.336
What does that mean?

285
00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:38.936
In other words, adding acid to a cyanide compound

286
00:17:38.936 --> 00:17:41.936
creates a poisonous gas.

287
00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.936
Adding acid?

288
00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:48.736
That's right. The culprit probably dissolved

289
00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:52.236
the cyanide compound in the toilet bowl.

290
00:17:52.236 --> 00:17:53.836
Once the acid is added,

291
00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:56.336
the poisonous gas would be released.

292
00:17:56.336 --> 00:17:59.436
Come to think of it, there was hydrochloric acid at the lodge.

293
00:17:59.436 --> 00:18:02.836
I heard it's used to clean fossils.

294
00:18:02.836 --> 00:18:06.336
No, that's not what they used.

295
00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:09.936
Adding hydrochloric acid would produce a poisonous gas immediately.

296
00:18:10.736 --> 00:18:13.136
They could close the lid.

297
00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:15.636
Wouldn't that run the risk of killing

298
00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:19.336
whoever used the bathroom before Mr. Ogami?

299
00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:23.736
You're right. Then how did they do it?

300
00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:25.536
The acid was added not by the culprit,

301
00:18:25.536 --> 00:18:28.136
but by Mr. Ogami himself.

302
00:18:29.836 --> 00:18:34.136
When he wiped his hands with a sanitary wipe and tossed it.

303
00:18:35.336 --> 00:18:37.036
Into the toilet bowl?

304
00:18:37.036 --> 00:18:38.136
Yes.

305
00:18:38.136 --> 00:18:41.036
Forensics said the sheet

306
00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:44.436
was slightly more acidic than normal.

307
00:18:44.436 --> 00:18:49.436
The culprit added the diluted hydrochloric acid to the sanitary wipes.

308
00:18:50.036 --> 00:18:52.736
The cyanide compound in the toilet bowl

309
00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:55.036
reacted with the acid in the sanitary wipes

310
00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:57.236
and created a poisonous gas.

311
00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:00.136
With this method, even if someone entered the bathroom before him,

312
00:19:00.136 --> 00:19:05.236
the cyanide compound would be harmlessly flushed away.

313
00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:09.636
The culprit most likely told Mr. Ogami

314
00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.936
they hid something valuable in the bathroom

315
00:19:11.936 --> 00:19:16.936
so he'd search it.

316
00:19:16.936 --> 00:19:20.036
The clean-freak Mr. Ogami used the sanitary wipes

317
00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:23.736
to wipe his hands and threw them in the toilet.

318
00:19:25.136 --> 00:19:29.536
The poisonous gas was formed, and Mr. Ogami died.

319
00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:33.736
So? Who did it?

320
00:19:33.736 --> 00:19:37.436
The only one who knew Mr. Ogami was a clean-freak

321
00:19:37.436 --> 00:19:40.336
who carried sanitary wipes with him.

322
00:19:41.336 --> 00:19:44.336
Mr. Nakatani, you're the only one.

323
00:19:45.836 --> 00:19:47.736
Wait... wait a minute.

324
00:19:47.736 --> 00:19:50.236
That's just your theory.

325
00:19:50.236 --> 00:19:51.636
What about evidence?

326
00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:55.536
Do you have any proof that Ogami inhaled a poisonous gas?

327
00:19:55.536 --> 00:19:58.936
There is. There's one piece of solid evidence.

328
00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:05.336
What... what is this?

329
00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:07.736
They're just dead bugs.

330
00:20:07.736 --> 00:20:10.336
What's so important about these?

331
00:20:10.336 --> 00:20:12.936
We examined them at Dr. Agasa's request.

332
00:20:12.936 --> 00:20:18.436
Like the victim, these bugs were poisoned with cyanide.

333
00:20:20.036 --> 00:20:21.036
Look.

334
00:20:21.036 --> 00:20:23.736
This spot is right beneath the bathroom fan.

335
00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:28.136
The bugs gathered around the fan

336
00:20:28.136 --> 00:20:30.636
must have inhaled the poisonous gas.

337
00:20:30.636 --> 00:20:31.936
No...

338
00:20:31.936 --> 00:20:35.036
Fearing the poisonous gas would remain inside the bathroom,

339
00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:37.436
you must have left the fan on,

340
00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.736
but it backfired.

341
00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:42.636
Darn these insects.

342
00:20:42.636 --> 00:20:44.636
Darn it, these insects!

343
00:20:44.636 --> 00:20:47.536
Hey, wait. What are you doing?

344
00:20:47.536 --> 00:20:50.736
These insects ruined my plan!

345
00:20:50.736 --> 00:20:53.236
You mean you killed Mr. Ogami?

346
00:20:53.236 --> 00:20:56.236
That's right. I killed Ogami.

347
00:20:56.236 --> 00:20:59.836
You're the one who lied about the moon's droppings

348
00:20:59.836 --> 00:21:01.236
coming from this village, too.

349
00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:03.636
No, they were accomplices.

350
00:21:04.336 --> 00:21:05.636
Accomplices?

351
00:21:05.636 --> 00:21:07.136
That's right.

352
00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:08.936
We came up with the idea together,

353
00:21:08.936 --> 00:21:11.436
but he tried to place all the blame on me.

354
00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.336
So I told him I had a tape of evidence

355
00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:15.636
and told him to come to the bathroom.

356
00:21:15.636 --> 00:21:17.636
But you didn't have to kill him.

357
00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:20.636
If I didn't kill him, my political career would've been over.

358
00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:25.136
There are so many things I still have to do.

359
00:21:29.136 --> 00:21:31.636
What an awful mayor.

360
00:21:31.636 --> 00:21:35.336
There's only one thing you should be doing.

361
00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:39.436
The only thing you should be doing

362
00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:42.736
is showing remorse and atoning for your crimes!

363
00:23:20.236 --> 00:23:23.636
Look. I found an oyster fossil.

364
00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:26.436
I only found clams.

365
00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:29.036
What's going to happen to the fossil museum?

366
00:23:29.036 --> 00:23:32.236
I'll try working to keep it open.

367
00:23:32.236 --> 00:23:33.636
This is all I found.

368
00:23:34.636 --> 00:23:36.036
What is that?

369
00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:37.136
It's gross.

370
00:23:37.136 --> 00:23:39.736
Right? This worthless thing...

371
00:23:39.736 --> 00:23:43.036
Hey, wait. Isn't that dinosaur poop?

372
00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:47.536
If that's true, that's a major discovery, Genta.

373
00:23:47.536 --> 00:23:51.436
Really? I guess I'm lucky.

374
00:23:51.436 --> 00:23:52.436
Yeah, lucky.

375
00:23:54.436 --> 00:23:55.536
"Next Episode"

376
00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:58.136
This is my girlfriend.

377
00:23:58.136 --> 00:24:00.936
She suddenly disappeared a few days ago.

378
00:24:02.236 --> 00:24:06.836
I doubt we'll find a body in this current.

379
00:24:11.136 --> 00:24:14.536
We managed to stop him, but what now?

380
00:24:17.436 --> 00:24:18.436
Conan!

381
00:24:19.336 --> 00:24:21.036
Next Conan,

382
00:24:21.036 --> 00:24:24.336
"The Missing Girlfriend"

383
00:24:25.479 --> 00:24:27.579
Next Conan's Hint:

384
00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:29.579
"Necklace"

385
00:24:29.579 --> 00:24:31.579
-It's Golden Week. -For two more days.

386
00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:33.779
-What? -Genta turned into a fossil.
