1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,440
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,540
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,340
Ran's mom and my mom

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,340
have a deduction match that even scares Pops off.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:51,568
Here's your dish, sir.

9
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:55,368
It's scallop in ravioli with broccoli puree.

10
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:57,768
Looks delicious!

11
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:00,268
It's what you expect of a three star restaurant!

12
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:03,168
Excuse me, but will you bring wine that's suits this cuisine,

13
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:05,368
and choose one from the expensive wines, please?

14
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,968
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:12,968
Dad, are you sure? Can you pay?

16
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:14,668
Don't you worry.

17
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,668
I've got a big, easy job on my hands.

18
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:22,068
I don't remember any such request.

19
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:25,568
Today, while you were in school, I got a call.

20
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,468
From a wealthy madam.

21
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:33,868
She says that somebody in her premises is after her husband's life,

22
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:37,668
and she will shell out 10 million yen if I find out who it is.

23
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:39,168
10 million yen!

24
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,768
I don't believe it.

25
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,968
I've got the contract and 500 thousand yen deposit.

26
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:47,268
They seem to have enough evidence

27
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,668
that somebody on the premises is doing it.

28
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:53,668
You just make a little use of your brain, and the case is closed!

29
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:04,868
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 1)"

30
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:13,168
And? Did he find out who is after the rich man?

31
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:17,768
Well, dad went to that house

32
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:21,368
but their evidence turned out to be very weak.

33
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,068
Dad was completely at a loss what to do.

34
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,868
He is now drunk and asleep on the couch.

35
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,068
A shame.

36
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,868
If he has time to drinking,

37
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:32,368
he should use it for calling the client and declining the offer.

38
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,668
But before calling the client,

39
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:37,068
he got happy and partied up with the neighbors,

40
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:39,968
and already used up 3 million yen.

41
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,368
3 million yen, you say?

42
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:47,168
Holly Nelly!

43
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:50,168
But I suppose I can manage that amount of money.

44
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:51,668
And another thing...

45
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:54,768
Do you have anything else to say?

46
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,168
Yes.

47
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:59,168
He tried to get back the money, and...

48
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,368
Excuse me for interrupting.

49
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,068
What? He lost 5 million yen in horse racing?

50
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:09,968
I thought Pops would do it some day. And this is the day.

51
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,068
The debt in total is 8 million and 57 thousand yen.

52
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,968
What shall we do, mom?

53
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:20,868
Just leave him to fend for himself and come stay with me!

54
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:24,368
But dad talked in his sleep calling...

55
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:28,468
"Eri, help me. Eri, please."

56
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,568
Are you listening, mom?

57
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:32,768
Mom?

58
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:35,868
Okay. I'll be there right now, so you just wait.

59
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:38,168
What? Miss Kisaki!

60
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:42,168
You are supposed to meet with Mrs. Nakanishi at 3 o'clock.

61
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,668
Would you put it off to next week?

62
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,368
She will talk about divorcing her husband

63
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,268
but she just wants to complain about him.

64
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:54,168
Tell her I hate to get involved with the trouble my husband got into,

65
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,368
but I have to, and she will understand.

66
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,568
Okay.

67
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:01,368
Well, Miss Kuriyama, take care of the office please.

68
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,668
Okay.

69
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,468
Does she really hate to, I wonder?

70
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,668
Help... help me.

71
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,368
I had enough.

72
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,268
He has been like this.

73
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:18,468
Gosh.

74
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,168
I can't. Not anymore.

75
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:22,868
Here, I've come to you.

76
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:26,268
Now wake up, darling.

77
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:29,068
I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

78
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:30,768
What?

79
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:32,368
I can't, Yoko, dear.

80
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,068
What's that?

81
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:41,668
But he was really asking for help.

82
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:44,768
It could be this TV program.

83
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,368
This has been Yoko Okino's 4 minutes' cooking.

84
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,668
Until next week, everybody.

85
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,768
You could be right.

86
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:57,568
Mom, you're not leaving us?

87
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:01,768
No, I won't do such a childish thing.

88
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,868
But get this straight.

89
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,268
I'm doing this for you

90
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:10,368
and not for that dummy!

91
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:11,768
Yes, mom.

92
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:14,768
I can't eat anymore.

93
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,168
Childish enough.

94
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,168
I see.

95
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:26,368
So, somebody is after the life of that Mikio Fujieda.

96
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,068
You know about him, mom?

97
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:31,368
Yes, I heard about him.

98
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:34,868
He'd been playing around a lot when he was young, I heard,

99
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,968
and he made up to a young daughter of a wealthy man

100
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,768
and got married into her family.

101
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,568
Then he took advantage of the money

102
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,868
to make a small fortune in his dubious business.

103
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:49,468
Then, the daughter is your client?

104
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,568
No.

105
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:54,868
From what I heard, his wife died of an illness a half year ago,

106
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,868
so I suppose he got married again.

107
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:00,268
What? It's so soon after she passed away.

108
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:03,168
Anyway, he doesn't seem to be

109
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:06,068
the kind of person you'd want to protect his life of.

110
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,268
I have been waiting for you, ladies.

111
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:12,668
You're here on behalf of Mr. Kogoro Mouri, I presume?

112
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:13,868
That is correct.

113
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:20,868
I am Souhachi Ueki, the butler for the past 50 years for this house.

114
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:23,168
Please feel free to ask me for anything,

115
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:25,768
and I'll be at your service.

116
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:27,968
Excuse me for...

117
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:29,968
You have a cold?

118
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:33,468
No. I've got chronic asthma.

119
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,468
I apologize for the unpleasant sound I make.

120
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,168
Please come this way, ladies.

121
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,768
What a fine garden, this is.

122
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:44,368
The garden looks so well cared for.

123
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:48,868
Yes, it does. The late madam loved gardening.

124
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,568
With that gardener over there,

125
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,568
we three used to work in the garden.

126
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,068
I see.

127
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:57,168
The garden is marvelous!

128
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:03,068
Please pay no attention to him.

129
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,568
He used to be more sociable,

130
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,368
but from about the time Mr. Fujieda came into the family,

131
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:12,468
he stopped talking to people except for Madam and me.

132
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,868
But nowadays, when I talk to him,

133
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,468
he does not reply at all.

134
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,268
He must have liked her very much.

135
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:22,868
I mean my sister that died of an illness.

136
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:27,668
This is Mr. Shigeru Fujieda, the brother of the late madam.

137
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:30,468
And who are these beautiful ladies,

138
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,768
and the little one?

139
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,968
They are here on behalf of Mr. Mouri.

140
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:36,068
Yes, I mean, no, we are rather...

141
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:40,268
I am Eri Kisaki, the legal advisor for the Mouri Detective Agency.

142
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:44,968
I was asked to get the details of the case,

143
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:49,368
and when I talked of it to Miss Mouri, she got interested.

144
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:51,368
Are we inconveniencing you in any way?

145
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,668
Of course not.

146
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,468
Mr. Ueki, may I talk to you a while?

147
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,568
Excuse us, ladies.

148
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,868
See you again.

149
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:03,468
Say! Why didn't you say you're Mrs. Mouri?

150
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:06,968
If I did, they would underrate me.

151
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,868
And what's more, he looks cool and cute.

152
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:11,368
Mom!

153
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,568
So, it's you.

154
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:17,068
The one who is on behalf of the detective that is fool enough

155
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:19,968
to seriously take the prank that somebody is after my life,

156
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,868
and started investigating?

157
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:26,168
Well, this is just for routine investigation.

158
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:30,168
Then, do snoop around to find the culprit.

159
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:35,368
It's one of the workers who got insulted by the words I used on them.

160
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,568
Why spend ten million yen on this kind of nonsense?

161
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,868
Just the type of man I pictured him to be.

162
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:42,868
I'm with you.

163
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,268
I am so sorry, ladies.

164
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:48,868
He is in a bad mood today, I guess.

165
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:52,468
Are you his daughter, Miss?

166
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,668
No, no.

167
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:59,968
I'm Motoka. I'm Mikio Fujieda's wife, and your client.

168
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:02,968
-What? -But you are so young.

169
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:06,768
It's love that counts not the difference of age!

170
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:09,968
This much difference could be a crime.

171
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,768
But I'm so glad

172
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:14,468
to know that you're here on behalf of the detective.

173
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:16,268
Why, may I ask?

174
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:21,268
Because if such a beauty like you is the lover of Mikio,

175
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:23,468
I, Motoka, can't possibly compete!

176
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:26,668
Ran, should I be happy or what?

177
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,068
I'd say marginal, mom.

178
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,968
Anyway, would you show me

179
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,468
the things that point out that someone on the premises

180
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,168
is after your husband's life?

181
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:41,068
Yes. They are all gathered up and in the study, so follow me.

182
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,568
The memo sheets printed with a word processor that say

183
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:47,368
"Watch behind you!" and "I'll send you to heaven."

184
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,068
A bullet that is already used.

185
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,868
They were under your husband's pillow every night

186
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,168
for three consecutive days.

187
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:58,468
Yes, they were. Terrifying, aren't they?

188
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,768
If it's for fun or a joke, it's gone too far.

189
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,068
And?

190
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:06,568
Did you have the police look into the finger-prints on them?

191
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:10,168
Yes. But Mikio got mad about it

192
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,168
and shouted, "Who did this?"

193
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:15,268
Then he showed the things to everybody in the house.

194
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:17,668
Naturally everybody's fingerprints are on them,

195
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:20,268
and they aren't of any use.

196
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:24,968
Nobody can do anything about that.

197
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,768
Yes?

198
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:32,468
There's a lady who'd like to meet you.

199
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,568
What? What is she like?

200
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:40,168
She is as beautiful as the lawyer, Miss Kisaki there, madam.

201
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:41,868
What?

202
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,768
This time, she happens to be the real lover of...

203
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:46,368
No, Conan!

204
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:48,668
If you have no idea of the person,

205
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,568
may I ask her to leave this place, madam?

206
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,268
No, wait! I'll meet her.

207
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:54,068
She is in the hall, isn't she?

208
00:11:55,768 --> 00:12:00,068
Mister, I see there are surveillance cameras here and there.

209
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,868
Yes, madam. After the incident,

210
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:05,468
for security reasons, we have set up those cameras.

211
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,768
I want to have more cameras installed,

212
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:13,368
but Mr. Fujieda says these will do because he is certain that

213
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:16,768
someone in the house is playing a prank on him.

214
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:20,468
And he also said that he does not want to waste money

215
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:21,968
on a house that is going to get ruined.

216
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:23,868
Ruined?

217
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,468
You sneaky thief!

218
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:28,468
What are you here for? Go home this minute!

219
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:32,468
I know it! You're Mikio's lover!

220
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,968
I know you are after the inheritance.

221
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:36,868
But you won't get anything at all from us!

222
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:39,168
I told you and I tell you, I'm not for it.

223
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:42,968
Huh?

224
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:45,868
It's Eri.

225
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,668
Yukiko!

226
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,968
Mom!

227
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,048
You and your elaborate make-up to hide your age,

228
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:09,548
but you just failed in trying, you old Teitan High Princess.

229
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:12,848
What you said more aptly applies to you,

230
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:16,048
you old ghoulish queen.

231
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:18,948
Wait and calm down, you two.

232
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,648
It's been a long time, Yuki!

233
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,948
Yes, yes. You been happy?

234
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:28,148
What?

235
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,848
It's been ten years now?

236
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,748
It was before you divorced Kogoro, Eri.

237
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:35,048
Not divorced yet, Yuki, just living separately.

238
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,948
We are still married in a way.

239
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,148
But it's been since the high school festival

240
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,348
that someone called me a princess.

241
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:43,148
Good old days.

242
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:45,548
That Miss Teitan High School contest

243
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:48,248
brought such enthusiasm with the Princess and Queen competition.

244
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:51,548
Miss Teitan High? Was there a contest then?

245
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:54,948
Well, I remember Sonoko told me something about it once.

246
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,248
Some 20 years ago,

247
00:13:56,248 --> 00:14:00,548
there was a legendary queen contest that shook Teitan High School.

248
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:07,548
The contestant on one side was the Princess of Teitan High,

249
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:12,948
whose lovely look and acting power of a genius helped her debut.

250
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:14,048
And the contestant on the other side was

251
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:16,948
with a gifted mind and who got perfect on the Todai entrance exams.

252
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:20,348
At the age of 16, she was recommended to study abroad at Harvard.

253
00:14:20,348 --> 00:14:23,548
Gifted with both beauty and intelligence, the Queen of Teitan High.

254
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:29,348
But I never thought that the two were our moms.

255
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:34,748
And which one was the winner?

256
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,548
Both of them were well known

257
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:39,148
and their fans all over the country came to see them.

258
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:42,448
The commotion ended up in the competition being suspended.

259
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,748
I see.

260
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:48,348
That's why there's no festival competition in Teitan High since then.

261
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,448
And, who on earth is she?

262
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:52,748
Huh?

263
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:55,748
She seems to be an acquaintance of Miss Kisaki,

264
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,548
but I am very embarrassed as the wife of Mikio

265
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,648
if she is his lover.

266
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:01,748
Are you?

267
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,148
No, I am not!

268
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:05,648
Yusaku asked me to...

269
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:08,548
Excuse me, but aren't you Yukiko?

270
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,548
Yes, I am.

271
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:13,748
I am Shigeru Fujieda. I asked Yusaku to solve the case

272
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,448
and figure out the mystery.

273
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,948
He said he is very busy as he is engaged in a certain job right now.

274
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:20,848
So he said he would send his wife in his place.

275
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:23,348
I did not expect such a beauty.

276
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:28,048
Don't you know her?

277
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:32,148
She was the star of the silver screen, Yukiko Fujimine.

278
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,148
Excuse me for not recognizing her.

279
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:37,548
I am not familiar with that part of the world.

280
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:41,748
Yusaku and I met at a party of mystery writers.

281
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:44,148
I talked to him the other day about when we happened to be in L.A.

282
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:46,848
and asked him for help for what has been happened here.

283
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:49,348
Then, do you write mysteries, too?

284
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,948
Yes, I do. But I have no bestsellers as he does yet.

285
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,348
Besides, since I lost my sister,

286
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,648
I am just a freeloader in this house.

287
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,048
Unlike the newlywed Mrs. Fujieda who hired Detective Mouri

288
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:06,348
for a fee of 10 million yen to protect her husband's life,

289
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,648
in my case, I asked him to do the job for free.

290
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:11,848
10 million yen?

291
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,748
Does Kogoro ask for such a preposterous fee?

292
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:17,848
If all he did was just ask, I'd be as happy as a lark.

293
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,248
What? You don't say!

294
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:22,648
He's spent 8 million yen already?

295
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:26,948
That's why I'm here, on his behalf.

296
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,248
And, where is he now?

297
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:35,248
In the office, drunk and lying on the couch.

298
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:38,548
He can't get up even if he wants to.

299
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,548
What? What's this?

300
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,748
Hey! Come on!

301
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:47,048
Hey!

302
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,148
Ran! Where are you?

303
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:51,848
Hey!

304
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:54,948
I see.

305
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:58,148
These show that it's not just a joke.

306
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:01,048
But the evidences are only those three items.

307
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:04,348
It would be a miracle if you can close in on the culprit with them.

308
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:07,448
But we have him with us,

309
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,248
so the miracle could happen.

310
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,348
That reminds me.

311
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:14,548
You were with Conan in the last case, weren't you?

312
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:15,748
That's true.

313
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:18,948
He solved one mystery after another so quickly.

314
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,848
It's just what I would expect of my...

315
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:22,748
Of your?

316
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:24,948
Of my...

317
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:27,848
Grandpa's brother's daughter's cousin's uncle's grandson.

318
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,548
A sort of, you know.

319
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,448
Oh, he is, I see.

320
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:36,748
Anyway, first we need to meet Mr. Mikio Fujieda

321
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:37,948
and ask if he can think of anything

322
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,348
that may have caused someone to want to go after his life,

323
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,348
and we'll start investigation from there.

324
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:45,148
That will not be possible, I should say.

325
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,848
Right now, Mr. Fujieda is reading a book

326
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:51,348
in the audio room while listening to classical music.

327
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:54,448
Please allow one to two hours before entering the room.

328
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,648
He will really get angry if interrupted while reading.

329
00:17:58,648 --> 00:17:59,948
Is that so?

330
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,848
How can he be so unconcerned

331
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,448
when his life may be in danger?

332
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:07,248
But, is he safe being left alone?

333
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:10,548
Do you care to look inside the room?

334
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,248
We can watch it through the surveillance camera installed in the room.

335
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:28,448
For a facility that was hastily built, it's great!

336
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,648
I see they are still not sufficient enough, madam.

337
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,448
I understand. This place is so large

338
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,648
that it's not easy to take care of completely.

339
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,648
So this is the audio room,

340
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,948
and this is the surveillance room.

341
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:44,248
If something happens, you'll have to take time coming up here.

342
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,648
Who's on duty to monitor the room?

343
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:51,148
Myself and the house maids take turns.

344
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:52,448
Wait a minute.

345
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,148
There's somebody in the garden!

346
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,048
-What? -Over here.

347
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,548
A man wearing a knit cap.

348
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:02,048
He is Doi, the gardener, madam.

349
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:05,048
But what is he doing at this late hour?

350
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:08,448
He is working with more care than usual.

351
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,348
Tomorrow is the birthday of my late sister.

352
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:15,348
Well, I have to go and finish up the manuscript.

353
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:17,648
Ueki, take care of everyone while I'm not available.

354
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:19,148
Yes, sir.

355
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:24,248
I really want to stay longer with the beautiful ladies,

356
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,548
so it is regrettable.

357
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,248
It really is regrettable.

358
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,148
-Huh? -Regret what?

359
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:36,648
Because you two competed against each other for Miss Teitan, didn't you?

360
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:37,748
It is regrettable that the competition was suspended

361
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:39,548
before they got the final result.

362
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,148
-Oh, that. -But they did get the final result.

363
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,848
Each of us got exactly 10,000 ballots, it was a tie.

364
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,948
But the strange thing was that,

365
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:50,848
the number of ballot s prepared was 20,001 ballots,

366
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,048
so it shouldn't have turned out a tie.

367
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:55,348
They were one ballot short.

368
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:58,348
There was a great commotion over the missing ballot.

369
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:02,248
That's why the commendation ceremony was suspended, wasn't it?

370
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:03,848
Talk about nonsense.

371
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,548
But if you got that one ballot, Yuki, you would've won.

372
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:11,148
Of course not. I couldn't win over you.

373
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:15,748
Say. Did the ballot bear a golden color seal on it?

374
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,248
What? Yes, it did.

375
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,748
The seal of Teitan High on it.

376
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:23,248
Then I found a ballot in dad's uniform pocket of Teitan High School.

377
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:24,948
What?

378
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:27,748
I found it when I was trying to dispose of old clothes.

379
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:31,548
So now I know. That was the ballot for the contest.

380
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:34,548
Which? Which name was on it?

381
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:37,448
Was it Eri? Or me? Which?

382
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:41,948
But dad seemed to have washed the suits with the paper in it,

383
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,148
and the paper was torn into pieces.

384
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,748
Really?

385
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,748
Be honest and tell the truth, Ran.

386
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:52,348
Ran, you don't have to worry about your mom.

387
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,348
No. I mean, honest.

388
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:57,548
Well, you can always ask him for sure.

389
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,648
His hands!

390
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:02,748
The master is holding up his hands!

391
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,448
What does that mean?

392
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:07,248
Somebody came into the room and pointed a gun?

393
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,648
That can't be.

394
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:12,148
When I brought him coffee

395
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:13,948
and came out of the room just a while ago,

396
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:17,948
I'm sure the door was locked from inside.

397
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,048
It can't be! He was shot!

398
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:22,348
He'd been shot!

399
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,948
Where is the spare key to the room?

400
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,948
It's in my room, madam.

401
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:27,048
Go and get it quick!

402
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:29,348
Then, I will call the police.

403
00:21:29,348 --> 00:21:30,848
And an ambulance, too.

404
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:32,848
Hurry and call them.

405
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:39,348
What's the matter here?

406
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:42,948
Hey, Mikio!

407
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,048
Are you all right, Mikio?

408
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:46,748
We are in a pickle.

409
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:49,548
But did Mikio really go down?

410
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:52,048
Yes, he did after he held up his hands.

411
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:55,248
Gun... gun shots?

412
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,448
Gosh!

413
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,648
-Would you do it, Ran? -Sure.

414
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:01,248
Do what?

415
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:11,848
Here is the key, madam.

416
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,748
Master!

417
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:17,048
Master!

418
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:20,248
The worst has happened.

419
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:21,448
It did.

420
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,948
"Next Episode" -We were neatly taken in.

421
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,248
What? You don't mean...

422
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,848
If he was being threatened with a gun pointed at him,

423
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,548
why did he do such a thing?

424
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:11,148
But the culprit couldn't deceive the eyes of the detective.

425
00:24:14,948 --> 00:24:16,548
Hey!

426
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:22,648
Next Conan, "Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 2)"

427
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:26,016
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:27,816
"Bookmark"

429
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,216
Next episode! Pops is in danger.

430
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:31,416
-Which is it! -It's come! (I've been shot!)

431
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,762
I haven't shot the needle in you yet, Pops.
