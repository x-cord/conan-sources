1
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.440
Can this boy called Conan Edogawa...

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.140
really be trusted?

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.540
He does seem to be a bit sharp, though.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.940
Don't worry.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.940
And? When is this boy coming here?

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.040
The promised time is...

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.040
It's about time.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.040
I hope you made sure that he'd come alone?

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.040
Yeah.

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.640
I made sure that he wouldn't bring the children along.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.140
There he is, he's come.

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.540
Make sure to carry things out with great care.

13
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840
If they're people who aren't worth it,

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.140
we're getting out of here

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.740
and gotta find a new base to operate from.

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.640
Yeah, I know.

17
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.940
Go hide in the bathroom until you're convinced.

18
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.640
Yes, coming.

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.340
I have been waiting for you, Conan.

20
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.140
Yahoo!

21
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.940
We came along, too.

22
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.340
You... you didn't come alone?

23
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.940
Oh, yes.

24
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.240
When I told them that you told me

25
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.940
there's a pool in this hotel,

26
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.240
they insisted on coming along.

27
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440
Weren't we supposed to come?

28
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.840
Oh, no.

29
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.340
It's just that I was a bit surprised

30
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.140
because I didn't know you were coming.

31
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.040
Okay, then. You guys go on ahead to the pool.

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.940
I'll get ready and be right over.

33
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.340
-Okay. -Okay.

34
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.240
Sorry.

35
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640
You idiot.

36
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.040
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard

37
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.440
and move forward full speed without slowing down.

38
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.240
Shattered pieces of glass in the pool.

39
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.140
A strange sound to a blind case.

40
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.740
His name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:48.334
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 1)"

44
00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:03.634
How spacious.

45
00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:07.934
Well, it's maybe a bit smaller than the pool at my villa though.

46
00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.534
I mean, how big is your villa anyway?

47
00:04:10.534 --> 00:04:13.734
I can't wait to see Ms. Sera's swimsuit.

48
00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:15.634
I wonder what kind of swimsuit it'll be.

49
00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:17.434
Well...

50
00:04:17.434 --> 00:04:19.734
A sporty one-piece swimsuit maybe?

51
00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:21.634
You're looking forward to it too, aren't you, Conan?

52
00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.734
Oh, yes.

53
00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.734
As far as I'm concerned I'm more than satisfied already, though.

54
00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:32.934
Well, but Sera's got a flat chest.

55
00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:34.234
Sera?

56
00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:37.234
Well, she looks like a cute younger sister, doesn't she?

57
00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:38.534
I guess so.

58
00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:40.534
I'm fine with "Sera".

59
00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:47.334
I was called that when I was little, too.

60
00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:48.734
Stripe bikini.

61
00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:51.934
You don't have chest,

62
00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:53.534
but you've got guts.

63
00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:54.934
Guts?

64
00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:56.734
Huh? Lady Sonoko?

65
00:04:58.234 --> 00:04:59.934
Long time no see.

66
00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.834
Do I know you?

67
00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:06.834
"Raito Samaki (30)" -I'm Samaki, secretary for President Oiso.

68
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:10.134
Oh, right. Maybe I met you at a party several times?

69
00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:12.234
You remember me.

70
00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:13.634
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:14.834
Samaki!

72
00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:18.234
Will you come over here a minute, Samaki?

73
00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.734
Yes, right now.

74
00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:22.234
Who's that girl?

75
00:05:22.234 --> 00:05:26.234
She's the daughter of President Oiso that was just mentioned.

76
00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:28.434
Lady Nagami Oiso.

77
00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:30.134
"Nagami Oiso (31), President's Daughter"

78
00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:34.834
Oiso? Do you mean Oiso Finance?

79
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.734
Yes. They're a subsidiary

80
00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:39.734
of our affiliate company.

81
00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:41.634
Yeah...

82
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:42.634
What is it?

83
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.434
Will you put oil on for me?

84
00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:47.834
I let her do it for me, and she scratches me with her nails.

85
00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:49.934
I... I'm sorry.

86
00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:52.934
Then, who's the one that's obsequiously bowing?

87
00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:57.034
I think she's Nagami's younger sister.

88
00:05:57.034 --> 00:05:58.934
"Hamaka Oiso (28), Nagami's half-sister" -Lady Hamaka.

89
00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:00.934
Her younger sister.

90
00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:04.634
She's acting too obsequiously to be her younger sister.

91
00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:05.734
You can say that again.

92
00:06:05.734 --> 00:06:08.034
I heard that she's the daughter of the president's mistress.

93
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.234
Since her mother died of an illness.

94
00:06:10.234 --> 00:06:13.434
It seems she had no other choice but to stay at the Oiso residence.

95
00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:16.134
And the one behind her younger sister

96
00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:18.734
is the hired manager of this hotel.

97
00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:21.134
"Ensaku Toyoshima (56)" -I think his was called Mr. Toyoshima.

98
00:06:21.134 --> 00:06:24.634
"Hotel Manager" -The owner of this hotel is President Oiso.

99
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:28.434
I guess he's showing people around the pool that's just been renovated.

100
00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:34.734
You're good. I like it.

101
00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:37.634
You sure do it differently from the one who was doing it before you.

102
00:06:37.634 --> 00:06:40.734
I'm not used to doing things like this.

103
00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.134
Well, I guess it comes as no surprise that you're good.

104
00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:48.034
I guess you're rubbing oil all over for her, too.

105
00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:50.634
Just what do you mean by that?

106
00:06:50.634 --> 00:06:55.234
I've known for some time that you two were on intimate terms.

107
00:06:55.234 --> 00:06:58.234
And that you both eventually plan

108
00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:01.134
to get a hold of half of my father's inheritance.

109
00:07:01.134 --> 00:07:02.634
No, we don't.

110
00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:08.134
Lady Nagami, I think you're over thinking things.

111
00:07:08.134 --> 00:07:09.534
Shut up!

112
00:07:09.534 --> 00:07:11.634
I know that you're letting the two

113
00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:15.134
use this hotel for their rendezvous.

114
00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.634
I hope you haven't forgotten

115
00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:20.134
that you're my fiance.

116
00:07:20.134 --> 00:07:21.134
What?

117
00:07:23.034 --> 00:07:26.134
I'm going to talk to father about.

118
00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:27.234
Nagami...

119
00:07:27.234 --> 00:07:29.434
I don't want to hear excuses.

120
00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:33.234
No, the necklace that you were wearing...

121
00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:36.334
No...

122
00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:38.634
You were swimming just now.

123
00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:41.234
Could it be in the pool?

124
00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:45.234
Hey! No, just how much do you think it cost?

125
00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:47.234
Get the guests out of the pool right this minute

126
00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.634
and close this place off.

127
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.734
-What? -What?

128
00:07:49.734 --> 00:07:52.834
Don't forget to check the belongings of the guests, too.

129
00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:55.434
Somebody could've secretly taken it, you see.

130
00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:56.934
But...

131
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:59.634
Raito, you bring the snorkels.

132
00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:02.334
What? You mean you're going to look for it yourself?

133
00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:05.434
Maybe it'll be better to drain the water of the pool, then.

134
00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:06.534
Stupid.

135
00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:11.034
What if it goes out the drain together with the water?

136
00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:14.734
At any rate, get the guests out of here and look for it!

137
00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:15.734
Understand?

138
00:08:28.734 --> 00:08:29.734
No good.

139
00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:31.934
Snorkeling won't do.

140
00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:35.134
Samaki, get me the oxygen tank for diving.

141
00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:36.434
Okay.

142
00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:38.734
I thought that you'd say,

143
00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:40.734
so I already brought it here.

144
00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:42.334
And you.

145
00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.634
You're getting in the way of the search, so will you get out of the pool.

146
00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:48.134
But, Lady Nagami,

147
00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:51.734
I think it's faster if we all look for it together.

148
00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:54.234
Enough. Shut up.

149
00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.434
Oh, you're getting on my nerves!

150
00:08:56.434 --> 00:08:59.534
I'll look for it myself, so all of you get out of the pool!

151
00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:13.534
Gosh, I wonder if all rich girls are selfish like her?

152
00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:16.634
Sonoko's not like that, right?

153
00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:20.334
Well, I guess not.

154
00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:23.434
"Lunch menu: Burgundy-style Curry Stew" -Thank you very much.

155
00:09:24.934 --> 00:09:26.734
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:28.734
You guys wanted to have fun at the pool

157
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.434
and yet to have something like that happen.

158
00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:32.734
It's not your fault, Ms. Sera.

159
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:34.934
It's Sera. Sera.

160
00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:38.334
Well, I guess at least the hotel lunch was good so all is well.

161
00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:39.434
I guess so.

162
00:09:42.134 --> 00:09:44.134
Is something wrong, Conan?

163
00:09:44.134 --> 00:09:46.634
Yes. The bellboys of the hotel

164
00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:50.934
have been moving around busily from a while ago.

165
00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:53.734
I wonder if something happened?

166
00:09:55.534 --> 00:09:56.934
What?

167
00:09:56.934 --> 00:09:58.434
Lady Nagami...

168
00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:00.234
Disappeared?

169
00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:02.934
Wasn't she looking for her necklace in the pool?

170
00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:04.934
She was supposed to be,

171
00:10:04.934 --> 00:10:07.334
but she suddenly disappeared.

172
00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:11.134
I looked for her in the restroom and changing room near the pool, too.

173
00:10:11.134 --> 00:10:13.434
It doesn't seem she went home either.

174
00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:19.034
Hey, look!

175
00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:22.434
There's something in the water in the center of the pool.

176
00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:23.734
What?

177
00:10:23.734 --> 00:10:25.734
Isn't... isn't that...

178
00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:26.934
a person?

179
00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.534
Lady...

180
00:10:36.534 --> 00:10:38.534
Nagami?

181
00:10:48.426 --> 00:10:50.126
Hey, look!

182
00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:53.526
There's something in the water in the center of the pool.

183
00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:54.926
What?

184
00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:56.926
Isn't... isn't that...

185
00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:58.126
a person?

186
00:11:05.926 --> 00:11:07.726
Lady...

187
00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:09.326
Nagami?

188
00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:13.526
No way!

189
00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:14.526
How could that be?

190
00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:25.226
Nagami?

191
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.026
Hurry, call the ambulance and the police!

192
00:11:27.026 --> 00:11:28.326
-Yes! -Yes.

193
00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:29.526
Nagami?

194
00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:32.526
Nagami?

195
00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:34.326
Get a hold of yourself.

196
00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:35.626
Nagami?

197
00:11:35.626 --> 00:11:36.626
Nagami!

198
00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.726
Nagami!

199
00:11:39.726 --> 00:11:42.026
But it's odd.

200
00:11:42.026 --> 00:11:44.426
There was nothing in the pool

201
00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:46.826
when we looked ten minutes ago.

202
00:11:46.826 --> 00:11:48.026
You're right.

203
00:11:52.726 --> 00:11:54.026
That hurts!

204
00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:57.226
What... what is it?

205
00:12:01.126 --> 00:12:03.826
Shattered pieces of glass at the bottom of the pool.

206
00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:07.026
Shattered pieces...

207
00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.526
Glass?

208
00:12:11.926 --> 00:12:13.526
Drowned?

209
00:12:13.526 --> 00:12:16.526
Yes. According to the report of the forensic officer,

210
00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:22.026
the ETD was between 12:00 to 13:00.

211
00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:25.526
But I don't get it.

212
00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:29.026
This pool isn't that deep that your feet don't touch the bottom, is it?

213
00:12:29.026 --> 00:12:31.426
Yet, why'd she drown?

214
00:12:31.426 --> 00:12:33.626
On top of carrying the oxygen tank,

215
00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:35.426
she wearing weights around her hips,

216
00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:37.826
so that she wouldn't come floating up.

217
00:12:37.826 --> 00:12:41.226
Lady Nagami said that she wanted to concentrate on

218
00:12:41.226 --> 00:12:43.326
searching the bottom of the pool.

219
00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:44.726
Lady?

220
00:12:44.726 --> 00:12:46.026
The victim is...

221
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:51.226
the daughter of the President of Oiso Finance, Nagami Oiso.

222
00:12:51.226 --> 00:12:53.226
The daughter of a president?

223
00:12:53.226 --> 00:12:56.926
And? What was she looking for at the bottom of the pool?

224
00:12:56.926 --> 00:13:00.326
She was looking for her necklace.

225
00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:04.626
We noticed that it was missing when I was rubbing suntan oil on her.

226
00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:08.826
We figured she may have dropped it in the pool when she was swimming.

227
00:13:08.826 --> 00:13:12.526
After we asked the guests to leave the pool.

228
00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:15.126
The four of us, including Lady Nagami,

229
00:13:15.126 --> 00:13:16.926
checked the restroom and the changing room

230
00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:19.626
and inside the pool.

231
00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:24.426
Nagami said that she wanted to look for it alone.

232
00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:26.226
So, we did as we were told...

233
00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:29.126
but she ended up like this.

234
00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:32.026
I see.

235
00:13:32.026 --> 00:13:34.826
If so, this could've been an accident.

236
00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:36.026
Yes.

237
00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:40.626
It's probable that an accident like leg cramps caused her to panic,

238
00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:45.526
on top of the fact that she was wearing heavy weights.

239
00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:50.426
Then if the mouthpiece she used to breathe in air came off,

240
00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:52.726
she could've drowned.

241
00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:55.426
I don't think so.

242
00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:56.526
-What? -What?

243
00:13:56.526 --> 00:14:01.926
They said there was nothing in the pool ten minutes

244
00:14:01.926 --> 00:14:04.426
before she was found.

245
00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:06.426
Right, sir?

246
00:14:06.426 --> 00:14:08.126
Oh, yeah.

247
00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:09.826
Is that true?

248
00:14:09.826 --> 00:14:11.226
Oh, yes.

249
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:14.326
The manager and two others plus both of us

250
00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:18.126
came to this pool to look for Lady Nagami.

251
00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:20.226
But we couldn't find her.

252
00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:23.526
And when we came to look for her again ten minutes later.

253
00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:26.326
Lady Nagami was sunk at the bottom of the pool.

254
00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:29.126
Do you know about what time it was?

255
00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:33.026
I think it was a little after two in the afternoon.

256
00:14:33.026 --> 00:14:35.526
Hey, I thought you said that the ETD

257
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:39.026
was between 12:00 to 13:00?

258
00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:40.226
Yes.

259
00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:44.126
If so, after drowning Nagami between 12:00 to 13:00,

260
00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:48.626
somebody hid her corpse somewhere.

261
00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:51.126
And at about 14:00 without being seen by anyone,

262
00:14:51.126 --> 00:14:54.326
brought her to the center of the pool and sunk her.

263
00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:56.726
Right?

264
00:14:56.726 --> 00:15:00.826
Was it possible for someone to have done that unnoticed?

265
00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:04.526
No. All of us spilt up to go look for her.

266
00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:09.526
So I think it wouldn't have been possible to not be noticed by us.

267
00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:12.626
Besides, at the entrance of this pool,

268
00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:14.926
the receptionists at the counter

269
00:15:14.926 --> 00:15:18.026
are checking who goes in and out.

270
00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:21.026
I don't think they'd let anyone suspicious through.

271
00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:23.826
But...

272
00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:27.926
it seems that something strange was at the bottom of the pool too.

273
00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.526
Something strange?

274
00:15:29.526 --> 00:15:32.126
There were a lot of shattered pieces of glass at the bottom of the pool,

275
00:15:32.126 --> 00:15:33.526
you stepped on it

276
00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:37.326
and hurt the sole of your feet, right, manager?

277
00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:38.526
Yeah.

278
00:15:38.526 --> 00:15:40.626
Is... is that true?

279
00:15:40.626 --> 00:15:42.126
Oh, yes.

280
00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:44.926
I carried Lady Nagami's oxygen tank

281
00:15:44.926 --> 00:15:48.026
to the pool side,

282
00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:51.426
but when I was about to come out of the water with it.

283
00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:52.626
That hurts!

284
00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:57.026
I felt a surge of pain on the sole of my foot,

285
00:15:57.026 --> 00:15:58.726
and dove in to look.

286
00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:02.826
A lot of shattered glass was at the bottom of the pool.

287
00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:04.826
What... what did you say?

288
00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:07.026
Drain the water of the pool immediately.

289
00:16:07.026 --> 00:16:08.226
We'll talk after that.

290
00:16:08.226 --> 00:16:09.626
Yes, sir!

291
00:16:16.926 --> 00:16:19.526
These do look to be shattered pieces of glass.

292
00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:21.526
But why are there so many?

293
00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:27.226
Were these here when you were searching the pool with Ms. Nagami?

294
00:16:27.226 --> 00:16:28.326
No.

295
00:16:28.326 --> 00:16:29.726
There weren't any.

296
00:16:29.726 --> 00:16:31.726
If there were, we'd notice.

297
00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:35.126
But with so much shattered,

298
00:16:35.126 --> 00:16:36.226
we'd have to put them back together

299
00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:38.626
to find out what it originally was.

300
00:16:38.626 --> 00:16:40.226
True.

301
00:16:40.226 --> 00:16:42.226
-It's an aquarium. -It's an aquarium.

302
00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:44.526
An aquarium?

303
00:16:44.526 --> 00:16:47.226
You see, the piece that you're holding now

304
00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:49.826
looks like the corner of a box.

305
00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:53.026
And the L-shaped piece that Inspector Megure is holding.

306
00:16:53.026 --> 00:16:54.826
There are four each of them, right?

307
00:16:57.226 --> 00:16:59.026
True.

308
00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:01.826
There are four each.

309
00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:05.126
If you assemble them in your head,

310
00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:08.726
you get something that looks like an aquarium, right?

311
00:17:08.726 --> 00:17:11.026
I see.

312
00:17:11.026 --> 00:17:14.126
This is making less and less sense.

313
00:17:14.126 --> 00:17:16.826
Why would an aquarium be at the bottom of the pool

314
00:17:16.826 --> 00:17:19.526
and much less shattered to pieces?

315
00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:20.726
Inspector Megure.

316
00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:25.526
We found a long fishing line stuck in the drain of the pool.

317
00:17:25.526 --> 00:17:26.626
A fishing line?

318
00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:29.626
Yes. I think it's about fifty meters.

319
00:17:29.626 --> 00:17:31.726
Why would such a thing be there?

320
00:17:35.426 --> 00:17:36.526
Ms. Hamaka!

321
00:17:36.526 --> 00:17:40.026
What kind of necklace did Ms. Nagami lose?

322
00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:43.026
A necklace with a lot of diamonds on it.

323
00:17:44.426 --> 00:17:48.426
If so, the perp probably by using the pieces of glass

324
00:17:48.426 --> 00:17:50.226
and the fishing line tried making a fake version of the necklace

325
00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:53.326
in order to do something.

326
00:17:53.326 --> 00:17:57.026
I think the fishing line is much too long for something like that.

327
00:17:57.026 --> 00:17:59.326
What if you make a loop at the end of the line

328
00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:02.326
and put the pieces of glass on it.

329
00:18:02.326 --> 00:18:06.326
Then, pull it through the water in order to lure Ms. Nagami?

330
00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:10.026
I... I guess if so it's probable.

331
00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:12.926
Then, please continue searching inside the pool.

332
00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.026
Yes, sir.

333
00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:18.026
In the meantime, let's ask for the details.

334
00:18:18.026 --> 00:18:21.826
The sequence of events that lead to the search of the necklace.

335
00:18:21.826 --> 00:18:25.626
Let's ask those three that have a connection with Ms. Nagami.

336
00:18:29.126 --> 00:18:31.326
All three of you...

337
00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:33.826
put oil on Ms. Nagami?

338
00:18:33.826 --> 00:18:38.926
Yes. But she said that I wasn't good at it and turned me down.

339
00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:41.626
Enough already. You're terrible.

340
00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:46.526
I seem to have scratched her with my nails and gotten her angry.

341
00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:49.726
That hurts. What's with you scratching me?

342
00:18:49.726 --> 00:18:52.226
I'm the last one who put oil on her.

343
00:18:52.226 --> 00:18:54.926
But after she found out that she lost her necklace,

344
00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.926
the rubbing oil bit was dropped.

345
00:18:56.926 --> 00:18:58.626
Nagami.

346
00:18:58.626 --> 00:19:00.826
The necklace that you were wearing...

347
00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:03.826
No...

348
00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:06.226
You were swimming just now.

349
00:19:06.226 --> 00:19:08.726
Could it be in the pool?

350
00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:12.726
Hey! No, just how much do you think it cost?

351
00:19:12.726 --> 00:19:14.626
Get the guests out of the pool right this minute

352
00:19:14.626 --> 00:19:16.226
and close this place off.

353
00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:17.226
-What? -What?

354
00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:21.226
I thought it would be possible to take off her necklace

355
00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:24.126
while rubbing suntan oil on her.

356
00:19:24.126 --> 00:19:27.926
We had no idea that she made all three of you put suntan oil on her.

357
00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:31.626
She favored doing things like that.

358
00:19:31.626 --> 00:19:33.226
-What? -What?

359
00:19:33.226 --> 00:19:37.626
She would make men zip her clothes up.

360
00:19:37.626 --> 00:19:39.126
Or make them check her temperature

361
00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:41.626
by having them place their hands on her forehead.

362
00:19:41.626 --> 00:19:45.026
It was cute the way she enjoyed

363
00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:47.026
watching people's reactions.

364
00:19:47.026 --> 00:19:48.926
Cute?

365
00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:51.226
She's the type that girls don't like.

366
00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:52.926
Are girls like that?

367
00:19:52.926 --> 00:19:55.226
But you're a girl too, aren't you, Ms. Sera?

368
00:19:55.226 --> 00:19:57.326
It's Sera. Sera.

369
00:19:57.326 --> 00:19:59.026
Oh, right.

370
00:19:59.026 --> 00:20:03.526
Of course, I knew that she would say she'd go and look for it alone.

371
00:20:03.526 --> 00:20:06.426
Because she was picky about everything.

372
00:20:06.426 --> 00:20:09.626
Well, I accepted that part of her thinking

373
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.826
that it was her individuality though.

374
00:20:12.826 --> 00:20:14.326
I see.

375
00:20:14.326 --> 00:20:17.526
But Ms. Nagami mentioned, didn't she?

376
00:20:17.526 --> 00:20:20.026
That Mr. Samaki, her fiance,

377
00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:22.526
had something going with you, her younger sister.

378
00:20:23.326 --> 00:20:27.826
I've known for some time that you two were on intimate terms.

379
00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.826
And that you both eventually plan

380
00:20:30.826 --> 00:20:34.126
to get a hold of half of my father's inheritance.

381
00:20:34.126 --> 00:20:36.626
She also said that the manager offered them

382
00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:38.626
to use the hotel room for their rendezvous.

383
00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:39.926
Shut up!

384
00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:42.126
I know that you're letting the two

385
00:20:42.126 --> 00:20:45.026
use this hotel for their rendezvous.

386
00:20:46.026 --> 00:20:50.126
If that's true, it can be a motive for murder.

387
00:20:50.126 --> 00:20:51.526
You've got me wrong.

388
00:20:51.526 --> 00:20:53.626
Nagami just over thought things.

389
00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:58.526
The thing is her birthday was coming up.

390
00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:01.426
We were discussing celebrating her birthday

391
00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:04.926
in the suite room of this hotel that she favored.

392
00:21:04.926 --> 00:21:07.826
We talked of the decorations and food.

393
00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:10.226
Of course, it was to be a surprise party,

394
00:21:10.226 --> 00:21:13.226
so it was kept a secret from Lady Nagami.

395
00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:16.626
We were discussing this in that room,

396
00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:20.026
so Nagami probably misunderstood.

397
00:21:20.026 --> 00:21:23.826
She's always been the jealous type.

398
00:21:23.826 --> 00:21:25.326
Always?

399
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:29.126
Yes. I used to be classmates with her in high school.

400
00:21:29.126 --> 00:21:31.326
I used to go with her since then.

401
00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:37.026
Well, Lady Nagami really liked that room,

402
00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:39.326
so it's no surprise that she would get upset.

403
00:21:40.326 --> 00:21:41.626
She liked it that much?

404
00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:45.226
Yes. I hear she kicked a guest who had reservation out of the room

405
00:21:45.226 --> 00:21:47.226
in order to spend a night there.

406
00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:51.926
So, we have no motive to want to kill her!

407
00:21:51.926 --> 00:21:55.026
We were trying to celebrate her birthday!

408
00:21:55.026 --> 00:21:58.826
If you still suspect us, you can ask the other staff of the hotel.

409
00:21:58.826 --> 00:22:03.626
We talked of the decorations and other stuff with the staff too.

410
00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:06.826
We'll be confirming that later.

411
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.826
First of all, we'd like you to tell us

412
00:22:09.826 --> 00:22:13.726
what you've been doing after Ms. Nagami started searching alone.

413
00:23:48.926 --> 00:23:52.226
"Next Episode" -This is an impossible crime!

414
00:23:52.226 --> 00:23:53.826
Right, Takagi?

415
00:23:53.826 --> 00:23:55.626
Where's Officer Takagi?

416
00:23:55.626 --> 00:23:58.326
Officer Takagi's here.

417
00:23:58.326 --> 00:23:59.626
In the pool.

418
00:24:02.426 --> 00:24:07.326
After the perp drowned Ms. Nagami who was searching for necklace alone...

419
00:24:08.326 --> 00:24:10.126
It disappeared...

420
00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:12.326
Just like Conan did a while ago.

421
00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:15.126
Next Conan,

422
00:24:15.126 --> 00:24:18.926
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 2)"

423
00:24:34.726 --> 00:24:37.026
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:37.026 --> 00:24:39.026
"Bubbles"

425
00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:41.326
When I said bubbles in the lounge, I got champagne.

426
00:24:41.326 --> 00:24:42.426
Oh, no. Liquor?

427
00:24:42.426 --> 00:24:43.826
You're still a minor.
