1
00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:05.124
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad used our holidays

2
00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:06.724
and first of all came to Kyoto.

3
00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.624
We're finally in Kyoto!

4
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:12.024
-How exciting! -Yes!

5
00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:15.024
But we're boarding the ship tomorrow,

6
00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:16.624
and yet why are we here the day before?

7
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:20.224
Well, that's because while we're here in Kyoto,

8
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.524
we may as well enjoy delicious food too, right?

9
00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.224
Especially sweets of Kyoto!

10
00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.324
That's right!

11
00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.224
Besides, I can drink local sake

12
00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:28.624
while watching the cherry blossoms at night!

13
00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:30.924
Wait a minute!

14
00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:32.024
Listen.

15
00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:33.824
We came all the way to Kyoto

16
00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:38.024
not to drink liquor or to eat sweets!

17
00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:42.024
We came to go onboard and experience a cruise on the Aegis Hotaka!

18
00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:46.024
You came as our chaperones!

19
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.924
But...

20
00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:50.324
While we're at it, we may as well...

21
00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:51.424
-Right? -Right?

22
00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:52.724
Right!

23
00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.224
Talk about off the point...

24
00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.524
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

25
00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:01.524
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

26
00:01:01.524 --> 00:01:03.724
A day before the cruise on the Aegis ship experience.

27
00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:05.824
A surprising incident occurs in Kyoto.

28
00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:07.324
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:09.324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:11.824
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:02:56.845 --> 00:02:59.845
"Famed Shop's Sweets Disappears".

32
00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:07.245
Rice oil is brushed onto the mold of the Bird of Kyoto to prevent sticking,

33
00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.945
which after the exclusive batter is poured in.

34
00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.345
It looks really good, doesn't it?

35
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:15.945
They don't just look tasty, they are tasty!

36
00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.845
Even Ran got hooked on it after eating it at my house,

37
00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:22.245
and came all the way here to buy it!

38
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.345
So, this is what you really came for after all.

39
00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:27.245
What? No way!

40
00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:29.945
What's the matter, Ran?

41
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:31.645
Listen to this, Sonoko!

42
00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.345
All the chocolate flavors are sold out!

43
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.045
Don't scare me like that.

44
00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:37.845
You scared me out of my wits.

45
00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:41.945
But, we stopped over in Kyoto just for that, you know!

46
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.045
But, this isn't the only place

47
00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.145
that carries the chocolate flavor, is it?

48
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:48.345
Yes, other us,

49
00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:50.645
you can find them at the shops in Arashiyama, Shiokouji Street,

50
00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:52.845
Shinkyougoku and Shirakawa.

51
00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:54.945
Hey, is it true

52
00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:57.545
that all the chocolate flavors disappeared?

53
00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:59.345
The chocolate flavors disappeared?

54
00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.245
What does disappeared mean?

55
00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:02.545
"Kozo Umehara (63)" -Right, right.

56
00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:05.445
"President of Umehara" -How did such a thing happen?

57
00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.845
The thing is, we don't really know.

58
00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:09.145
You don't know?

59
00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:11.645
This morning,

60
00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.845
the craftsmen of Umehara

61
00:04:13.845 --> 00:04:17.245
definitely delivered the items.

62
00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:19.045
40 boxes of Ogura flavor,

63
00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:20.545
40 boxes of Maccha flavor

64
00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:22.645
and 40 boxes of chocolate flavor are here.

65
00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:24.445
Okay, thank you.

66
00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.045
Shall we line them up then?

67
00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:48.845
Huh? You're not finished lining up the items, are you?

68
00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:51.745
Huh? Why?

69
00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:53.045
Strange,

70
00:04:53.045 --> 00:04:55.545
we certainly lined them up a while ago, didn't we?

71
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.345
Yeah. That's strange.

72
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:02.845
At any rate, you've got to line them out right away,

73
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:05.145
or the customers will come.

74
00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:08.345
Huh? They're gone. The chocolate flavors are gone.

75
00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:09.645
-What? -What?

76
00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:11.545
Who did it? Where are they?

77
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:12.945
How come?

78
00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.345
And now,

79
00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:16.345
in order to have the items shared from other shops,

80
00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:18.745
the craftsmen...

81
00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.645
Hey, we've got trouble.

82
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.945
The chocolate flavors have disappeared

83
00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:24.745
from the shops in Shirakawa and Shinkyougoku too!

84
00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:28.845
No good!

85
00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:31.745
Even at the shop in Uzumasa, the chocolate flavors are gone!

86
00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:34.045
There are none at Shiokouji Street either.

87
00:05:34.045 --> 00:05:35.545
What?

88
00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:38.845
Which means, the chocolate flavors have disappeared from all five shops?

89
00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:41.745
I... I guess so.

90
00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:44.245
Is such a thing possible?

91
00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:45.245
What's this?

92
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.445
What's all the fuss about?

93
00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:47.945
Pops!

94
00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:50.445
This is no time to be looking for souvenirs!

95
00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:51.945
We've got a case, a case!

96
00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:54.845
They say that the sweets that were here disappeared!

97
00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:57.845
You know, I'm a great detective.

98
00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:00.445
It's duck soup for me.

99
00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:01.845
A great detective?

100
00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.745
Right! Pops is the famed Kogoro Mouri!

101
00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:07.945
Alias...

102
00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:10.045
That Sleeping Kogoro?

103
00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:14.345
Indeed! I am the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

104
00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.845
Please! Please lend us a hand!

105
00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.245
Well...

106
00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:22.245
I was going to go drinking under the cherry blossoms of Kyoto from now.

107
00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:25.345
Oh, come on, please.

108
00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:28.645
That's right, Dad! It's a grave case!

109
00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:30.445
Grave case?

110
00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:32.645
Hey, hey!

111
00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:36.145
Isn't that thing on the ceiling a surveillance camera?

112
00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:43.045
The image that is shown is only from 10:00 when the shop was opened.

113
00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:44.445
What?

114
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:48.645
The shelf with the missing sweets is not shown.

115
00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:52.745
The Bird of Kyoto is displayed right under the camera.

116
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:56.045
It's the time that we're realized that the chocolate flavors disappeared.

117
00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:59.745
After this, we all looked everywhere in the shop.

118
00:07:00.645 --> 00:07:01.945
Can you stop it right there?

119
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.445
What's the matter, Conan?

120
00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:08.045
The person wearing the pink shirt on the upper left side of the screen...

121
00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:09.445
Isn't she a bit strange?

122
00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:14.145
Because she went near the shelf of the Bird of Kyoto?

123
00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:15.145
No matter how you do it,

124
00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.545
it's impossible to steal in such a short time.

125
00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:21.845
Besides, she came after the chocolate flavor disappeared.

126
00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.645
No, that's not it.

127
00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:25.945
It's pretty cold today, isn't it?

128
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:29.045
Despite that, she's dressed quite lightly, isn't she?

129
00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:34.245
Come to think of it, yes.

130
00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.845
What's the big deal?

131
00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:38.245
Oh, my.

132
00:07:38.245 --> 00:07:39.645
This is a surprise.

133
00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:43.145
Who do I find here but Mr. Mouri?

134
00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:46.345
Who are you?

135
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:50.045
Inspector Ayanokoji from the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department, right?

136
00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:52.945
What brings you to a place like this, Inspector?

137
00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:55.945
"Fumimaro Ayanokoji" -Well, it's my day off today, you see,

138
00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:58.145
"Inspector of Kyoto Prefectural" -so I was taking him for a stroll.

139
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.145
I see.

140
00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:03.045
Do chipmunks need to take walks?

141
00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:04.245
I wonder.

142
00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:07.545
I mean, I don't think he's walking.

143
00:08:07.545 --> 00:08:09.645
But, what good timing to drop by.

144
00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:11.145
It's a burglary case.

145
00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:12.545
It's showtime for the police!

146
00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:14.145
I'll leave the rest to you!

147
00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:15.545
Huh?

148
00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:19.045
I'm so sorry.

149
00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:21.645
We'll have some in by tomorrow.

150
00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:24.645
It's still before noon and you're already sold out.

151
00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:26.245
Isn't it a bit too early?

152
00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:28.545
We were looking forward to it,

153
00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:30.845
the chocolate-flavored Bird of Kyoto.

154
00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:36.245
Can't you make the chocolate flavor from now?

155
00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:40.445
We used up all the chocolate for today.

156
00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:42.445
The chocolate that is used for the chocolate flavor

157
00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:44.445
is not something we make here,

158
00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:47.945
but we purchase choice selected chocolates from abroad.

159
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:51.945
Tomorrow's one won't come in till tomorrow.

160
00:08:51.945 --> 00:08:55.245
Then, we can't taste the chocolate flavor until tomorrow.

161
00:08:56.145 --> 00:08:59.545
No. It's got to be today.

162
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:03.245
It's got to be today? Why?

163
00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:06.345
Today is the memorial day of the previous president.

164
00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:11.645
That's why I wanted to start selling the new item today.

165
00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:14.845
I'm sorry. It's all sold out.

166
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:16.445
Sold out?

167
00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:18.145
What? Already?

168
00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:23.745
I feel really bad for the customers who have been looking forward to it.

169
00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:25.645
"Ogura"

170
00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:29.045
Is this true?

171
00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:31.345
I see, I understand.

172
00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:35.145
I asked one of my colleagues

173
00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:39.045
to interrogate at the shop in Uzumasa.

174
00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:41.145
A shop that carried the Bird of Kyoto?

175
00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:44.745
Yes, then they were told that the chocolate flavors disappeared

176
00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:49.045
and someone saw a suspicious car parked in front of the shop.

177
00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:50.945
A suspicious car?

178
00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:52.345
What about the model and license plate number?

179
00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:54.145
It was a pink compact car

180
00:09:54.145 --> 00:09:57.145
and the model nor license plate number are unknown.

181
00:09:57.145 --> 00:10:00.545
A pink colored compact car is not sufficient info.

182
00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:02.445
Actually...

183
00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:05.845
I saw a pink compact car too.

184
00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:09.345
You saw it? When?

185
00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:12.545
Let's see. It was when...

186
00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.845
When we were looking for the chocolate flavors that disappeared.

187
00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:18.345
You saw it too?

188
00:10:18.345 --> 00:10:21.345
Yes, it was parked in front of the shop.

189
00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:23.145
But...

190
00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:26.345
If we could only find out what the license plate number is...

191
00:10:26.345 --> 00:10:29.045
If so, why not ask the other shops too?

192
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.245
Huh?

193
00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:33.445
Because if the driver of the car is the culprit,

194
00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:36.345
she could've been witnessed at the other shops too, right?

195
00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:39.245
Okay, then send officers out to ask around!

196
00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:41.545
Hey, wait a minute.

197
00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:43.245
If that many men are needed,

198
00:10:43.245 --> 00:10:45.845
please ask the burglary division with jurisdiction over this area for help.

199
00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.345
After all, I'm off-duty today.

200
00:10:48.345 --> 00:10:50.545
Talk about being petty.

201
00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:54.045
I'll go over to the shop on Shiokouji Street.

202
00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:56.445
We can't be taking our time, or the culprit will get away!

203
00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:59.945
-Okay, I'll go over to Shinkyougoku then! -Yep!

204
00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:02.445
You go to the remaining shop in Shirakawa, okay, Dad?

205
00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:03.745
What?

206
00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:05.145
Mr. Ayanokoji,

207
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:07.345
can you wait here for contact from everyone?

208
00:11:07.345 --> 00:11:09.245
Huh? Me too?

209
00:11:09.245 --> 00:11:10.745
Listen,

210
00:11:10.745 --> 00:11:12.945
Ayumi go with Ran,

211
00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:14.845
Genta go with Sonoko

212
00:11:14.845 --> 00:11:17.645
and Mitsuhiko go with Pops.

213
00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:19.445
Get the license plate number of the car,

214
00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:22.945
be it in fragments and contact me on it.

215
00:11:22.945 --> 00:11:24.545
-Okay! -Understood!

216
00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:27.045
I'll connect everything together!

217
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.595
It's a pink compact car.

218
00:11:39.995 --> 00:11:43.095
Come to think of it, it was parked in front of the shop.

219
00:11:43.095 --> 00:11:45.295
Really? What was the license plate number?

220
00:11:45.295 --> 00:11:47.995
Huh? I didn't look...

221
00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:49.195
Just a little will do.

222
00:11:49.195 --> 00:11:51.695
If you remember any number, let me know.

223
00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.695
But...

224
00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:57.295
I think it was a Shiromi number.

225
00:11:57.295 --> 00:11:58.695
Thank you very much!

226
00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:01.195
I saw it, I did.

227
00:12:01.195 --> 00:12:03.495
I think it was a Shiromi number

228
00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:07.195
and the top was "one, one". That's all I remember.

229
00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:09.395
The top was "one, one", right?

230
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:13.395
But to think that it disappeared from all the shops...

231
00:12:13.395 --> 00:12:15.795
Does anything ring a bell?

232
00:12:16.995 --> 00:12:20.895
It could be the curse of the previous president who passed away.

233
00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:26.595
"Shirakawa" -Conan, Mitsuhiko here.

234
00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:32.595
The only info I got was that the number 8 was towards the end.

235
00:12:32.595 --> 00:12:34.595
The number "8" towards the end, right?

236
00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:36.095
I got it!

237
00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:37.295
I see.

238
00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:39.295
A pink compact car,

239
00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:41.595
and if we know that much of the license number,

240
00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:44.595
maybe we can carry out a user inquiry.

241
00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:55.795
We found the user of the car that was witnessed.

242
00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:59.995
Her name is Mako Kawasumi, 22 years old, who lives in Shromi in Osaka.

243
00:12:59.995 --> 00:13:02.195
Have you ever heard of her?

244
00:13:02.195 --> 00:13:04.895
-No. -Not at all.

245
00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:07.095
It's a name I've heard for the first time.

246
00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:09.495
I see. At any rate,

247
00:13:09.495 --> 00:13:10.895
we're having that position of the car

248
00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:13.495
tracked by the N system right now.

249
00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:14.495
Okay.

250
00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.495
You guys...

251
00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:19.895
Eat too, Conan.

252
00:13:19.895 --> 00:13:22.695
Sonoko bought it for us!

253
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:25.895
The maccha is good!

254
00:13:25.895 --> 00:13:26.895
You think so too, don't you?

255
00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:30.495
I got hooked on the Bird of Kyoto after eating this flavor too.

256
00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:34.695
But it seems that the previous president didn't like it.

257
00:13:37.195 --> 00:13:38.895
To begin with, the Bird of Kyoto

258
00:13:38.895 --> 00:13:40.495
originally started with only the ogura flavor,

259
00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:44.495
but the current president started selling the maccha flavor.

260
00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:47.595
So, maybe they started the chocolate favor

261
00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:51.195
because the maccha flavor had a good reputation?

262
00:13:51.195 --> 00:13:54.295
That's why the craftsmen at Shinkyougoku...

263
00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:56.795
If the previous president hears of the chocolate flavor,

264
00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.495
he'll probably die of shock.

265
00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:00.295
That's what he said.

266
00:14:00.295 --> 00:14:04.595
So, maybe this is...

267
00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:06.595
a curse!

268
00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.595
Cut it out, Sonoko!

269
00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:14.995
Ouch.

270
00:14:14.995 --> 00:14:17.695
I forgot how much Ran hated ghosts.

271
00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:18.795
Sorry.

272
00:14:25.195 --> 00:14:27.695
Inspector Ayanokoji!

273
00:14:27.695 --> 00:14:29.095
Detective Kurumazaki.

274
00:14:29.095 --> 00:14:30.595
Good work.

275
00:14:30.595 --> 00:14:32.695
"Detective Kurumazaki of Kyoto Prefectural" -10 minutes ago, the car

276
00:14:32.695 --> 00:14:37.495
is shown on the N system camera on Marutacho Street.

277
00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:39.995
It's near the shop in Shirakawa.

278
00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:41.195
Yes.

279
00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:43.395
And, this is the picture.

280
00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:48.095
This is...

281
00:14:50.595 --> 00:14:53.495
The woman in the pink shirt.

282
00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:56.695
Mitsuhiko, are you still at the shop in Shirakawa?

283
00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.995
Yes, I am.

284
00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:02.895
Because Mr. Mouri has started drinking and won't move.

285
00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:09.995
So, I'm told...

286
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.795
That drunkard!

287
00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:17.795
Where are you going, Ran?

288
00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:20.395
I'm going to grab him by the neck and bring him back!

289
00:15:20.395 --> 00:15:23.095
Oh, no. We be seeing bloody rain.

290
00:15:23.095 --> 00:15:24.495
We sure will.

291
00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:25.895
Miss.

292
00:15:25.895 --> 00:15:28.195
What're you going to do with that?

293
00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:29.395
This?

294
00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.795
I'm going to change it

295
00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:33.395
because this part is a bit soggy.

296
00:15:33.395 --> 00:15:34.595
The box back then...

297
00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:39.395
I feel really bad for the customers who have been looking forward to it.

298
00:15:39.395 --> 00:15:41.295
"Ogura"

299
00:15:42.195 --> 00:15:44.295
Hey! Will you show me that?

300
00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:49.595
So, this is the Bird of Kyoto that you took out from below

301
00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:51.695
to replenish the stock.

302
00:15:51.695 --> 00:15:53.095
On this side is the Bird of Kyoto that you're going to change

303
00:15:53.095 --> 00:15:55.795
because it got soggy with tears.

304
00:15:55.795 --> 00:16:00.095
And this is the Bird of Kyoto ogura flavor that was lined out in front.

305
00:16:00.095 --> 00:16:02.295
Isn't it a little smeared?

306
00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:06.795
I wonder if it got that way when the seal was pasted on.

307
00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:08.195
But, look,

308
00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:10.795
the seal of the one that you took out to replenish,

309
00:16:10.795 --> 00:16:12.995
isn't smeared.

310
00:16:12.995 --> 00:16:15.895
Conan, what's bothering you?

311
00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:21.095
Maybe I was grossly mistaken.

312
00:16:22.395 --> 00:16:24.695
Uncle Kogoro!

313
00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:28.195
Let's go back to where Conan and the others are, already.

314
00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:31.995
I keep telling you,

315
00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:34.595
what's the rush?

316
00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:38.795
It's no big deal of a case anyway, so...

317
00:16:38.795 --> 00:16:40.995
It's no big deal?

318
00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:43.795
Yes, that's right.

319
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.495
It's no big deal of a case!

320
00:16:47.395 --> 00:16:49.995
You've got a lot of nerve drinking

321
00:16:49.995 --> 00:16:52.695
in the midst of a case, don't you?

322
00:16:52.695 --> 00:16:54.495
No, wait...

323
00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:55.895
Ran, it's not what you think!

324
00:16:55.895 --> 00:16:57.395
I...

325
00:16:57.395 --> 00:16:58.895
The cherry blossoms are...

326
00:16:58.895 --> 00:17:01.695
The cherry blossoms are pretty! -Uncle Kogoro...

327
00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:03.995
That person...

328
00:17:04.995 --> 00:17:06.895
Excuse me.

329
00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:09.295
You've gone to all the shops, haven't you?

330
00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:12.095
To all the shops that carry the Bird of Kyoto.

331
00:17:13.095 --> 00:17:16.395
Why? Why?

332
00:17:16.395 --> 00:17:17.795
And in all the shops,

333
00:17:17.795 --> 00:17:20.995
the Bird of Kyoto chocolate flavor is gone.

334
00:17:24.195 --> 00:17:26.995
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri.

335
00:17:26.995 --> 00:17:28.895
Mr. Mouri...

336
00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:32.295
Huh? Mr. Mouri's not here yet?

337
00:17:32.295 --> 00:17:35.195
Pops says he'll be back soon.

338
00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:37.095
And, how was it?

339
00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:41.195
Just as Mr. Mouri had said on the phone,

340
00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:44.195
something strange was detected here.

341
00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:45.995
Could that by chance be...

342
00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:50.095
What? Yes, that's right!

343
00:17:50.095 --> 00:17:52.595
How'd you know?

344
00:17:52.595 --> 00:17:55.195
Well, Pops Mouri told me that maybe.

345
00:17:55.195 --> 00:17:56.895
Well, well,

346
00:17:56.895 --> 00:17:58.795
a great detective he is indeed.

347
00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:01.795
Mr. Mouri.

348
00:18:11.495 --> 00:18:14.495
What happened, Mr. Mouri?

349
00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:16.795
I happened to punish the drunkard a bit,

350
00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:18.395
and this is the outcome.

351
00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:20.295
Don't worry about it at all.

352
00:18:20.295 --> 00:18:21.995
A bit, huh?

353
00:18:23.195 --> 00:18:24.895
Well, I guess it serves him right.

354
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:28.695
Oh, by the way, where's Kurumazaki?

355
00:18:28.695 --> 00:18:32.695
He was being asked to do something by Pops Kogoro a while ago.

356
00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:38.795
Mr. Mouri, what did you ask Kurumazaki to do?

357
00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:41.095
More than that, Inspector Ayanokoji,

358
00:18:41.095 --> 00:18:42.895
did you check on it?

359
00:18:42.895 --> 00:18:44.895
The packages of Ogura flavored boxes

360
00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:46.495
that were line out in the shop.

361
00:18:46.495 --> 00:18:47.595
Yes.

362
00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:52.095
Rice oil was found around the ogura flavor seals.

363
00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:53.395
Rice oil?

364
00:18:53.395 --> 00:18:57.795
We use rice oil as a parting agent at our shop.

365
00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:03.095
Hey, what's a parting agent?

366
00:19:03.095 --> 00:19:04.495
It's oil that is brushed onto the mold

367
00:19:04.495 --> 00:19:06.895
before that batter is poured into the mold

368
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.895
so that it comes off easily after it's cooked.

369
00:19:08.895 --> 00:19:13.795
But why would that be on the ogura seals?

370
00:19:13.795 --> 00:19:15.995
It wasn't on the seals.

371
00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:18.295
It was put on, deliberately.

372
00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:20.995
Before the ogura seals were pasted on.

373
00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:22.795
40 boxes of Ogura flavor,

374
00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.295
40 boxes of Maccha flavor

375
00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:26.395
and 40 boxes of chocolate flavor are here.

376
00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:28.195
Okay, thank you.

377
00:19:28.195 --> 00:19:30.795
Shall we line them up then?

378
00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:36.995
First, 10 boxes of each flavor are lined out.

379
00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:37.995
Which means

380
00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:41.195
all the needs to be rigged are the 10 chocolate flavor boxes.

381
00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:43.995
Holding cotton with rice oil soaked on it in the palm of the hand,

382
00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:47.695
the chocolate seal is traced and peeled off.

383
00:19:47.695 --> 00:19:50.695
Then, a new ogura seal is pasted on.

384
00:19:50.695 --> 00:19:52.595
Two people work on the 10 boxes.

385
00:19:52.595 --> 00:19:55.195
The first boxes of ogura that are lined out

386
00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.095
are put in the drawer for replenishment

387
00:19:57.095 --> 00:20:00.495
and the ogura boxes that have been re-sealed are moved over.

388
00:20:00.495 --> 00:20:02.395
In other words, in this shop...

389
00:20:02.395 --> 00:20:03.995
Rather,

390
00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.795
in all the 5 shops,

391
00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:08.095
there were no chocolate flavors to begin with.

392
00:20:10.995 --> 00:20:12.795
Detective Mouri!

393
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.495
Officer Kurumazaki!

394
00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:17.095
Just as Detective Mouri had said,

395
00:20:17.095 --> 00:20:19.295
in the workshop refrigerator of Umehara,

396
00:20:19.295 --> 00:20:21.795
the chocolates that were scheduled to be used today

397
00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:23.795
were left as is!

398
00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:26.195
In other words,

399
00:20:26.195 --> 00:20:29.595
no chocolate-flavored ones were made to begin with today.

400
00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.595
The only ones who can do something like this...

401
00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:35.195
are the sweets craftsmen!

402
00:20:38.995 --> 00:20:40.795
Why did you do something like this?

403
00:20:42.795 --> 00:20:47.795
The previous president really hated the maccha flavor.

404
00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:50.695
The more so with chocolate flavor.

405
00:20:50.695 --> 00:20:52.195
You do something like this just for that reason?

406
00:20:52.195 --> 00:20:54.695
It's not just for a reason like that!

407
00:20:54.695 --> 00:20:57.195
It's nothing like that.

408
00:20:57.195 --> 00:21:00.095
That's the very reason why we didn't want to sell

409
00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:03.495
the chocolate flavor on the former president's memorial day.

410
00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.795
But...

411
00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:07.395
we had no idea that it would turn out to be something so serious.

412
00:21:07.395 --> 00:21:10.095
We're very sorry.

413
00:22:40.595 --> 00:22:42.095
Are you sure it's okay?

414
00:22:42.095 --> 00:22:43.895
You don't want to file charges.

415
00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.995
The former president left behind

416
00:22:45.995 --> 00:22:48.495
the skills of those craftsmen to me.

417
00:22:48.495 --> 00:22:49.695
I see.

418
00:22:49.695 --> 00:22:53.095
So, what's going to happen to the chocolate flavor?

419
00:22:53.095 --> 00:22:54.695
I won't be selling maccha and chocolate

420
00:22:54.695 --> 00:22:57.095
on the memorial day of the former president.

421
00:22:57.095 --> 00:23:00.095
Until the craftsmen come out from their side and allow it.

422
00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:06.295
But I got to like the Bird of Kyoto from the maccha flavor.

423
00:23:06.295 --> 00:23:07.895
Thank you.

424
00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:12.695
Huh? By the way, where's Mitsuhiko?

425
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:14.895
Hey, everybody!

426
00:23:14.895 --> 00:23:16.195
Mitsuhiko!

427
00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:18.495
What're you doing?

428
00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:20.095
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:21.795
Well, you see...

430
00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:25.995
Why? Why?

431
00:23:25.995 --> 00:23:27.995
And in all the shops,

432
00:23:27.995 --> 00:23:31.995
the Bird of Kyoto chocolate flavor is gone.

433
00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:34.795
Right!

434
00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:37.095
There are no chocolate flavors anywhere!

435
00:23:37.095 --> 00:23:38.495
Huh?

436
00:23:38.495 --> 00:23:40.695
This is the third shop.

437
00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:42.695
I've searched so hard and yet...

438
00:23:42.695 --> 00:23:44.895
Why aren't there any anywhere?

439
00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:48.995
She's just like Ran, no?

440
00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:54.295
"Next Episode"

441
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:57.595
I wonder where Kengo disappeared to though.

442
00:23:57.595 --> 00:24:00.095
Okay, shall we all go then?

443
00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:10.295
Ridiculous! It can't be.

444
00:24:10.295 --> 00:24:12.295
He couldn't be dead.

445
00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:16.195
Hey! What do you mean by he couldn't be dead?

446
00:24:16.195 --> 00:24:17.795
Next Conan,

447
00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:20.695
"A Rose in a Vineyard".

448
00:24:37.295 --> 00:24:39.495
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:39.495 --> 00:24:41.995
"Type of grape".

450
00:24:41.995 --> 00:24:43.395
The movie will start today!

451
00:24:43.395 --> 00:24:44.995
The Sleeping Kogoro is the star of the movie!

452
00:24:44.995 --> 00:24:46.395
You never learn.
