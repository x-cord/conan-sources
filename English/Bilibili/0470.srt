1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,399
Disguise!

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,399
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,799
The mystery of the mysterious locked room.

4
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,299
The truth behind the fourth painting!

5
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,399
What will become of the confrontation with Thief Kid?

6
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:10,699
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,299
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:14,199
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,419
"Blue Storm", the fourth of a set of paintings

10
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:03,019
drawn by a famous painter named Mr. Takeyori Oikawa

11
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,919
is sought after by Thief Kid.

12
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,419
We are invited to the Oikawa residence,

13
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,319
but the painting that is in the atelier

14
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,619
where the surveillance camera is set up disappeared just like that.

15
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:17,819
And Mr. Oikawa's father-in-law,

16
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,119
a famed landscape painter named Mr. Haruhito Kanbara,

17
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,619
is found dead in that room.

18
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,719
"Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 2)"

19
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,119
It's certain that Thief Kid is the one who killed Mr. Kanbara, right?

20
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:40,219
We still can't come to any conclusion,

21
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,619
but he's certainly a prime suspect.

22
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:45,219
Mr. Oikawa, are you going to paint it again?

23
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,019
The last of the flower, bird, wind, moon, the "Blue Storm".

24
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,219
Well, of course...

25
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,719
I'm not going to paint another one.

26
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,319
Forever.

27
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,419
So I'd like to plead with Thief Kid.

28
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,519
Give me back the "Blue Storm" that you stole tonight,

29
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,819
along with my father-in-law's life.

30
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,119
Hey.

31
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:09,219
When the Inspector Megure and the others arrived here,

32
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,419
did you notice anything strange?

33
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,419
Something strange?

34
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,519
Come to think of it,

35
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,719
one of the staff fell ill and was carried away from the crowd.

36
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,019
I'm sure it was somebody from Nichiuri TV.

37
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,219
I see.

38
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:26,019
That's where he switched with one of the four.

39
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,719
Then, did you see any suspicious looking bags?

40
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,919
Something big enough to fit a person into.

41
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,119
No, I didn't.

42
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,519
If you do find anything, will you secretly call my cell phone?

43
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,319
Yeah, but why do you want me to contact you?

44
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,219
Because Mr. Mouri said that Thief Kid may be disguised

45
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,019
as a member of the police.

46
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,219
Are you serious?

47
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,019
If my cell phone rings and I whisper it to Mr. Mouri,

48
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,619
Thief Kid won't suspect anything, will he?

49
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:52,719
I see.

50
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,219
Mr. Kanbara's condition before he went into the atelier?

51
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,219
Detective Mouri wants to know about it?

52
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,219
Yes, he wants to know if Mr. Kanbara really went into the atelier

53
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,519
to protect the painting himself.

54
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,519
No. While Mr. Oikawa was checking the painting,

55
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,319
Mr. Kanbara was standing in front of us all the while.

56
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,119
He went in after Mr. Oikawa finished checking and opened the door.

57
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:18,619
After that, they were both in the atelier for 1 to 2 minutes.

58
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:21,019
He said that he was going to protect the painting at that time.

59
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,519
Of course, we stopped Mr. Kanbara from going into the atelier,

60
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,719
but Mr. Oikawa said that it would only take a short while.

61
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:31,519
We had no idea Mr. Kanbara was going to confine himself to the atelier.

62
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,519
However, after the blackout,

63
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,819
we really didn't expect the culprit to be hiding in the attic,

64
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:38,419
ready to steal the painting and kill Mr. Kanbara.

65
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,219
Did you notice anything different about Mr. Oikawa

66
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,919
who came out leaving Mr. Kanbara inside?

67
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,919
For example, blood on his clothes or something?

68
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,119
No, Mr. Oikawa didn't have blood anywhere on him.

69
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:54,019
But he could've committed the murder wearing his clothes inside out.

70
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:55,619
That's not possible either.

71
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:59,519
Inspector Nakamori checked Mr. Oikawa's clothes right away, too.

72
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,819
Blood was found on the outside of his jacket

73
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,419
and there was no blood on the back of his jacket or below it.

74
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,919
Besides, the blood that was found on his shirt got on him

75
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,419
when he went inside in the dark along with the inspector and the others.

76
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,719
He groped for Mr. Kanbara and coincidentally found him.

77
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:18,919
He then carried Mr. Kanbara up.

78
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,719
But I wonder if it was really a coincidence?

79
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,619
You came in with the inspector, didn't you?

80
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:30,219
There's no way he would found Mr. Kanbara in the dark

81
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:32,919
without using light and stab him in the neck.

82
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,019
He couldn't have done all that in such a short time.

83
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,019
By the way,

84
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:45,319
the door that Mr. Oikawa was pounding on during the blackout

85
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,119
is the door on that side, right?

86
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:51,219
Leaving Mr. Kanbara behind, he came out of this door

87
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:54,019
and yet why did he pound on the other door?

88
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,419
He was probably on his way to get the inspector

89
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,119
to help get Mr. Kanbara out when the blackout occurred.

90
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:06,519
The inspector was in the room over that side.

91
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,719
Come to think of it,

92
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:10,419
while Mr. Oikawa was checking his painting,

93
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,019
the inspector was talking to him through the door over that side.

94
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,719
Yeah, they were talking.

95
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,519
He opened the door slightly and asked me to go check

96
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,619
if the police really turned the surveillance camera off.

97
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:26,019
He told me to knock once if it was still on.

98
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,419
I knocked twice, the signal for it being off.

99
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,919
Signal? I wonder why he didn't ask you to directly come tell him about it?

100
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,619
Probably because he didn't want me to see the painting

101
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,219
that was still incomplete through the opening of the door.

102
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,919
Did the forensic officers say anything?

103
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,719
Yeah, they said that there were two things that bothered them.

104
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,919
There was a strange trace of blood found on Mr. Kanbara's sweater,

105
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,819
and an oval shaped mark was found at the base of his left thumb.

106
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,719
As for the blood,

107
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,319
it probably got on because his left arm was bent in front of his chest

108
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,219
when he was stabbed in the neck.

109
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:04,919
But as for the oval shaped trace, they don't know what it is.

110
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,319
Maybe that's...

111
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,619
Conan, quit going here and there!

112
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:10,819
We're going home.

113
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,219
But Thief Kid isn't caught yet!

114
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,119
That's a job for the police.

115
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,819
It's already bed time for children, isn't it?

116
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,919
That's enough.

117
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,919
If the culprit is Thief Kid,

118
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,019
he would've escaped using a hand glider,

119
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:29,119
so there's no way we can cordon off the area.

120
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,219
That's right.

121
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,719
The most we can do is figure out his escape route.

122
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,019
But don't you think it's funny?

123
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,719
The Riot Task Force officers have this place surrounded

124
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:40,519
and yet no one has seen anybody flee.

125
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,919
That's because they didn't put any spotlight at the windows.

126
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,019
Yes, but...

127
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,819
But Thief Kid's hand glider is white.

128
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,519
It couldn't have disappeared by a spell or something,

129
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,419
so it's strange that no one saw it.

130
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,819
He's right. Thief Kid is a magician.

131
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,119
Unlike a witches' spell, magic has to be set up beforehand, right, Conan?

132
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,619
-That's why... -Wait! Please don't get him involved, okay?

133
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:02,619
Okay.

134
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:08,219
If he did disappear by magic, we don't know what trick he used.

135
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,519
As to that, I've figured out something that might be a hint.

136
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,419
May I try an experiment?

137
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,119
It requires a newspaper and an empty glass cup.

138
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:23,019
I put the newspaper over this cup.

139
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,719
Then I lift it up carefully.

140
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,619
I put it on the middle of the desk.

141
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:36,419
And...

142
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,719
The cup disappears and is gone.

143
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:45,019
But that's just plain magic.

144
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,319
You probably just dropped the cup on your lap after holding it,

145
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,419
and just crushed the newspaper that was shaped like the cup.

146
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,819
I did this magic in my younger days

147
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,919
at a year-end party of the 1st section.

148
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,719
Father told me about it.

149
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,119
He said it was a wet blanket.

150
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,319
Oh, is that so?

151
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,419
That's not the issue here!

152
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,619
What does that magic have to do with what happened here?

153
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,219
So you see,

154
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,819
what I mean is, I think this is how Thief Kid disappeared.

155
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,219
I'm sorry!

156
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,919
Don't worry about it.

157
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,319
It's cheap stuff that I got as a wedding gift 40 years ago.

158
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,119
I had no idea...

159
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,519
Don't touch them so carelessly!

160
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,119
Cracked pieces like these may look like they're not there but actually are.

161
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,319
Okay.

162
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,419
Excuse me. Where is your wife?

163
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,719
She passed away five years ago.

164
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,119
It was right after I had finished drawing the third painting

165
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,519
of the flower, bird, wind and the moon, "Pure White".

166
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,919
My wife was badly wounded by a tornado

167
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,319
when she travelled abroad 15 years ago.

168
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:46,619
She had been bedridden with a coma since.

169
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,719
15 years ago, you also announced the first of the set

170
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:53,119
of flower, bird, wind and moon, the "Red Lotus".

171
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:57,719
Yes. It was a year after my wife's accident.

172
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:03,019
I painted that piece with all my might to make money for hospital bills.

173
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,719
It was highly evaluated and I became a full-fledged painter.

174
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:09,519
Until then, I was making a living teaching art class.

175
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,819
Excuse me.

176
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,419
I'm sorry, it's a call from my younger brother.

177
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,219
Go ahead.

178
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:19,919
Keep looking, there should be more.

179
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,019
-I don't see any more... -Would you like to use some light?

180
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,319
It'll be easier to find the pieces since they will glitter.

181
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,719
What?

182
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,919
Detective Mouri?

183
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,819
Yes. He was asking if there was anything else

184
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,819
that came falling from the window of the atelier.

185
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:44,019
All we found were two paint brush stands

186
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,319
and a whole lot of paint brushes.

187
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,319
Come to think of it,

188
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,819
I did find this fishing line.

189
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,419
There's a lake where you can fish near here,

190
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,619
so I'm sure that someone who came fishing dropped it.

191
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,019
It's approximately seven meters in length.

192
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,719
There is a loop on one end

193
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:06,219
and on the other end, there is a fish hook that's bent out of shape.

194
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:09,619
No doubt about it, the culprit used this.

195
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:13,619
If so, I'm sure that it should be somewhere here.

196
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,719
There it is!

197
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,319
It's this stone with a hole on it.

198
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,519
It's you, sonny.

199
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,419
The big suspicious bag that you were talking about was found.

200
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:32,519
Really?

201
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,919
Yes. It was found near the broadcast van of Nichiuri TV.

202
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,319
Officer Chiba is fast asleep inside.

203
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,119
Officer Chiba won't get up?

204
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,119
No, we're trying to get him out of the bag right now,

205
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,019
but the zipper is broken and won't come down below his neck.

206
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,919
I got it! I'll relay the message to Mr. Mouri.

207
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,419
Conan, Ran was looking for you.

208
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,919
Officer Takagi.

209
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,519
Officer Chiba who's at the villa is Thief Kid.

210
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,519
What?

211
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,119
They just found the real Officer Chiba.

212
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,219
I have to tell everyone!

213
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,519
Wait. Before that...

214
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,619
Huh?

215
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:05,819
Will you please look for the stolen painting

216
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,319
that is still somewhere in this villa, Officer Takagi?

217
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,919
The "Blue Storm".

218
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,928
"Blue Storm" is still here in this villa?

219
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,428
But wasn't the painting stolen by Thief Kid?

220
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:25,928
It hasn't been stolen, that's why I want you to look for it.

221
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:28,428
I know that you can find it, Officer Takagi.

222
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,328
Yeah.

223
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,128
Pops, this way. Over here!

224
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,328
Gosh.

225
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,428
Hey, we're going home.

226
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:40,128
Thief Kid already escaped.

227
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,328
Wait.

228
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:55,628
Conan, let's leave the rest up to the police.

229
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,728
No, there's no need to leave it up to them

230
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:00,028
-because I've already figured it out. -Huh?

231
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:02,328
Ran, please call for Inspector Megure.

232
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,428
Take a good look.

233
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,428
This is the true identity of the "Blue Storm".

234
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,728
A fishing line.

235
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:20,328
This is just a cloth covering the fishing line.

236
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:23,928
It's the same magic as the one Officer Takagi performed.

237
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,128
If you see a cup-shaped newspaper,

238
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:28,928
you'd most naturally think that a cup is there.

239
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,328
Likewise, if you cover the easel with a cloth that is pulled taut,

240
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,428
it's natural to think that a painting is underneath the cloth.

241
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:37,828
This is a simple trick used to fool spectators.

242
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:41,628
First, a loop is made at one end of the fishing line.

243
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:44,028
Then you pull the line over to the door.

244
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:48,028
You lock the door after hooking the line onto the bolt of the door.

245
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,228
The fishing line is pulled right above the easel

246
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:54,728
and set to pass between the brush stands and the paint brushes.

247
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:56,928
The paint stands were used to make up for the difference in height,

248
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,628
so that the line would become horizontal.

249
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:04,128
And then, on the fish hook that is put on the other end of the line,

250
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:09,528
a stone with a hole in it is hooked onto it and left to hang outside.

251
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,928
After the fishing line is pulled taut, a cloth is placed over the easel

252
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:15,628
and the "Blue Storm" before it is publicly announced is ready.

253
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:20,628
All there's left to do is to break down the door during the blackout.

254
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,728
Go ahead and try it.

255
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,728
Yes, sir.

256
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,928
One, two, three!

257
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,328
When the door opens,

258
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:30,528
the line will be pulled by the weight of the stone that is hooked onto it.

259
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:33,928
If the edge of the cloth hooks onto the place where the loop is tied,

260
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:36,428
the cloth will flip over making it cover one side of the easel.

261
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,028
The loop will then flip over

262
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:41,428
and the brush stands that are stacked together will push the window open.

263
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:42,828
The brush stands and paint brushes

264
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,928
would go falling out the window together with the fishing line and stone,

265
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:49,828
and fall to the feet of the people on guard right below.

266
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:53,328
If the brush stands and the paint brushes are toppled near the window

267
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:55,428
as soon as people come in after breaking the door down,

268
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,328
it'll look as if someone had dropped the paint brushes and scattered them,

269
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,728
then stole the painting and fled.

270
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:03,528
But when and who could've rigged something like this up?

271
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,628
It was all done when Mr. Oikawa went to check his painting

272
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:08,028
and asked to have the surveillance camera turned off.

273
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,028
What?

274
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,128
Then, don't tell me that...

275
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:11,228
That's right.

276
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:14,628
The one who deceived everyone into thinking that the painting was stolen

277
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:18,328
and the one who killed Mr. Kanbara

278
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:22,228
is you, Mr. Oikawa.

279
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,528
As proof of this,

280
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:27,828
you opened the door slightly when you went in to check your painting

281
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:30,028
and talked to one of the Riot Task Force officers.

282
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:33,728
You went out of your way to ask him not to look inside the room,

283
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:38,028
because you wouldn't have been able to hook the line around the bolt.

284
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:41,828
Mr. Mouri, just what're you talking about?

285
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:44,228
I said that because I didn't want anyone to see my painting

286
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:46,728
until it is completed.

287
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:50,728
Besides, my father-in-law came into the atelier on his own.

288
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,828
Why would I kill my father-in-law

289
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,128
who said he'd guard the painting himself?

290
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:57,928
No, you just made that story up.

291
00:15:57,928 --> 00:16:02,028
You kept avoiding Mr. Kanbara who insisted to talk to you.

292
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,628
You worked it out so that he would come to the atelier on his own

293
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:07,828
by saying that you two could talk there.

294
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:10,528
When Mr. Kanbara came to the atelier,

295
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,228
you passed him out with a stun gun.

296
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,828
You waited for the timer to go off causing the blackout.

297
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,528
You were waiting for the time for the lights to go out

298
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:23,028
just as you went to call Inspector Nakamori.

299
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:26,728
You entered the room from behind Inspector Nakamori

300
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:29,428
and ran swiftly up to Mr. Kanbara who was passed out.

301
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:31,628
Then you stabbed him in the neck with a knife.

302
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:33,328
This is what actually happened.

303
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,428
Too bad, that's impossible.

304
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:42,428
I can't see in the dark and I had no light with me.

305
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:46,028
Yes, you can.

306
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:47,928
Even without light.

307
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,628
So long as you have a cell phone with you.

308
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:07,028
You put the phone on top of Mr. Kanbara and ring the phone in the dark.

309
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:11,928
It would flash so you can verify where he is immediately.

310
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:13,828
If you had the sound turned off,

311
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,128
Inspector Nakamori and the others who broke the door down

312
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:19,928
would be distracted by the paint brush stands above everything.

313
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:21,428
Mr. Oikawa.

314
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:25,128
If I remember correctly, you had two cell phones, didn't you?

315
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,728
The white one for private use and the black one for work.

316
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,028
The white one is apparently for private use

317
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:35,528
because you said the blood got on when you tried to call a family member.

318
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:36,928
Despite this,

319
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:41,828
you answered the black phone when you got a call from your younger brother.

320
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:46,428
Is the white cell phone with blood on it really yours?

321
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:49,028
I'm sure that you've already deleted all the data in it,

322
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:51,628
but the police can still check on it, you know.

323
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,728
They can find out who the cell phone belonged to

324
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:57,028
and who picked the call up during the blackout.

325
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:02,328
Just as you deduced, that's my father-in-law's cell phone.

326
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:06,928
I used it to verify the location of that old ogre in the dark.

327
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,028
-Ogre? -He's indeed an ogre.

328
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:12,628
He tried to force me to draw a painting that relates to the wind

329
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,028
that had caused the death of my wife.

330
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,528
You did mention that your wife died because of a tornado.

331
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,328
Why did you decide to draw a four-part painting

332
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:22,028
of flower, bird, wind and the moon then?

333
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,228
Did you know?

334
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,128
There are other words such as snow, moon and flower

335
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:28,028
that describe the beauty of nature?

336
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:31,028
Right, the first painting was a red lotus lower,

337
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,428
the second was the golden moon,

338
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:37,028
and the third was of a Japanese crane standing on snowy ground.

339
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,628
I didn't mean to paint the pure white crane, but rather, I drew the snow.

340
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:43,628
Actually, the painting was finished then.

341
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,128
But father-in-law...

342
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:48,028
He told the rich man who bought "Red Lotus" and "Golden Moon"

343
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,228
that if he bought "Pure White" for a higher price,

344
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:52,128
he would sell him the next piece, "Blue Storm", too.

345
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:56,028
He lied saying that it was a set of four, the flower, bird, wind and moon.

346
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,128
Even though it was to make money for my wife's hospital bills,

347
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:01,928
it was just too much for me.

348
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:03,428
Do you think that I could paint "Blue Storm"

349
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:07,628
after my wife died and I have lost my purpose?

350
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:11,328
After a lot of thinking, I finally thought up this trick.

351
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,928
But he said he would go through with his own plan if I did the trick.

352
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:17,328
-Plan? -He was going to disclose everything!

353
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,328
That the "Blue Storm" never existed

354
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:22,928
and that the warning from Thief Kid was also something I made up!

355
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,128
Not even considering the fact that if he did so,

356
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,328
my name as a painter would be soiled

357
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:29,228
and I would lose my entire career!

358
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,228
You're wrong.

359
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:33,928
I think when Mr. Kanbara said he had something in mind,

360
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,728
he meant this.

361
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:36,728
Officer Takagi.

362
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:38,228
That thing you're holding is...

363
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,828
Don't tell me that's...

364
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,928
"Blue Storm", the first wind of summer that blows across the green leaves.

365
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,428
Unlike the other three paintings,

366
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:47,528
this was drawn by the master of landscape painter,

367
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:49,728
Haruhito Kanbara.

368
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:50,828
No way!

369
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,928
His hand was hurt, so he couldn't have drawn it.

370
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:55,228
You didn't know, did you?

371
00:19:55,228 --> 00:20:00,428
The trace of the palette that was found on Mr. Kanbara's left thumb.

372
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:03,628
A paint brush with teeth marks on it was also found

373
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,028
in the storeroom of Mr. Kanbara's room where the painting was stored.

374
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:08,528
I think that Mr. Kanbara was painting the picture

375
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,228
by holding the paint brush in his mouth.

376
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:13,128
He did so in order to match your way of painting.

377
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,628
Why didn't he tell me then?

378
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,228
He couldn't.

379
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,528
Even if he were able to draw it,

380
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,628
it was still only a copy of your style.

381
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:26,128
If anybody found out, it would indeed unmistakably soil your name.

382
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,128
No.

383
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,428
I...

384
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:34,828
Mr. Oikawa.

385
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:38,228
It's slightly roughly drawn since he used his mouth,

386
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:41,728
but as for me, I like that "Blue Storm", too.

387
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:44,428
Just like the other three paintings you drew,

388
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:47,628
the feeling of wanting to help somebody really shows.

389
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:21,428
Officer Takagi?

390
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:22,728
Yeah.

391
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:25,728
Are you thinking of spreading your wings and flying out of there?

392
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:28,328
Or am I just imagining things?

393
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:29,828
How did you find out?

394
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:31,728
By elimination.

395
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:35,228
You couldn't have known about the magic performance

396
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,328
that Inspector Megure put on at the year-end party.

397
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:39,628
Inspector Megure was there,

398
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:43,028
and Officer Sato learned about it from her father.

399
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,528
Officer Chiba who was found in the bag is also not Thief Kid.

400
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:50,528
It's unthinkable that you would leave the bag in such a conspicuous place.

401
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:55,128
The zipper didn't open from neck down in order to hide the physique.

402
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:59,428
In other words, they can see a sleeping Officer Chiba,

403
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:01,228
but it was actually Officer Takagi.

404
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:04,928
It was a trick to escape during the commotion when things came to light.

405
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:06,528
But I appreciate what you did.

406
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:07,928
Thanks to your magic,

407
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,228
I was able to figure out the trick of this case.

408
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:14,628
Well, magic is my specialty after all.

409
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,628
But...

410
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:20,728
do me a favour and let me go this time.

411
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:23,028
I just came to clear my name.

412
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,928
After all, I'm completely white this time.

413
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,428
Just like the girl's underwear.

414
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:27,628
Conan?

415
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,328
Hey, it's about time we...

416
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,328
No...

417
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:37,128
Take this!

418
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:41,428
Why you...

419
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:45,728
Thief Kid!

420
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:48,028
Thief Kid was disguised as Officer Takagi.

421
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,428
Strange.

422
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,228
The ball that I kicked in the smoke,

423
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:52,428
it should've hit him.

424
00:23:52,428 --> 00:23:54,028
What's this? What's this?

425
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:56,328
Dad, your pants are...

426
00:23:57,628 --> 00:24:01,028
That hurts.

427
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:02,728
That brat...

428
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:06,528
"Next Episode"

429
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,628
The car...

430
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,728
Don't stop the car!

431
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,528
Keep going the way you are!

432
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,128
Ran, what about that side?

433
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:16,328
This side is no good either.

434
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,828
Oh, no! Inspector Megure!

435
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,428
Get away! Hurry!

436
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,628
Stop without stopping.

437
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:25,628
That's it!

438
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:34,428
Next Conan, "Rental Car Goes Out of Control"

439
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:52,028
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:54,428
"Expressway information"

441
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,228
-In the next episode... -Dad's got to keep going!

442
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,628
Where's he going? To a hot spring or something?

443
00:24:57,628 --> 00:24:59,328
-Wrong. -It's so obvious.
