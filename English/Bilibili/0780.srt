1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,040
As I was warning FBI agent Jodie

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,140
that member of the Organization, Bourbon alias Tohru Amuro,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,740
who was searching around about Rikumichi Kusuda,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,140
we were informed that her friend, Ms. Natsuko Shibuya,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,140
was pushed down some stairs.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,440
We rushed over to the crime scene

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,940
only to find out that she wasn't attacked at the stairs

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,540
but rather at the elementary school where she worked.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,140
Three suspects were also summoned to come.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
And, furthermore...

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,240
She asked me to solve a stalker problem for her you see.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,740
Bourbon?

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,540
And are those two over there English teachers?

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,140
No. They are FBI agents

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,240
and are cooperating with us with the investigation.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,440
Oh.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,640
The FBI?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,640
In other words, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,440
I see a lot about you on TV or in the movies.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,640
Their investigators show up at crime scenes to steal all the credit,

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,740
smugly interfere with the investigation,

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,740
offend the local police and annoy the viewer.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,540
What?

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,340
I'm not referring to any of you, though!

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,140
-I just happened to see what I talked of. -This guy...

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,740
This guy tried to kill Akai.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,640
Camel.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,740
Cool it.

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,440
You don't want him to find out that

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,440
the FBI knows that he's a member of the Black Organization, do you?

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,140
Okay.

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,940
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,240
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,940
Although Amuro's remark is of concern,

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,740
solving the test answer sheet comes first!

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,540
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:49,336
"The Scarlet Pursuit"

40
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,336
Like I said a moment ago.

41
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:55,036
I was really in the PE equipment room

42
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:59,136
organizing things until after 8:30 pm.

43
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:00,636
"Yoshiharu Sugamoto (30)" -Since it's late,

44
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:05,736
I came to this teachers room to get her so we can go home together,

45
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,236
but she wasn't here.

46
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:10,836
Did you tell Ms. Shibuya that you were going to walk her home?

47
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:11,936
Oh, no.

48
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,936
I just thought that she'd feel safer if a guy was with her

49
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,036
walking the streets at night.

50
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,936
Come to think of it,

51
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:21,436
you confessed your love to Ms. Shibuya some time ago

52
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:24,736
and seem to have been brushed off then, no?

53
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:27,136
Did she tell you about it?

54
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:30,836
No. I heard about it from the other teachers.

55
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,936
Back when I visited here

56
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:37,536
after Ms. Shibuya asked me to investigate on a stalker for her.

57
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:41,336
That's why you were on my blacklist.

58
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:44,636
Don't tell me you were the one who was stalking Natsuko?

59
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,036
No, it's the other way around!

60
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,536
I was the one protecting her from the dangerous guys.

61
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:50,936
Protecting her?

62
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:51,936
Yes.

63
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:54,436
I guarded her almost every day

64
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:57,436
to see that she got home safely, you see.

65
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:59,436
But actually, I followed her

66
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:05,736
without her knowing and quietly watched over her.

67
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:10,336
Sometimes she would sense my presence and look around.

68
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,836
It was cute.

69
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:15,936
I would really get the feeling of having to protect her.

70
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:18,836
That's what you call a stalker!

71
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:22,236
Don't tell me that she accused you of that and you got angry...

72
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:24,736
No way!

73
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:28,636
It's true she really wasn't here after 8:30 pm!

74
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:33,436
Besides, already graded the test sheets were in her bag, right?

75
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:36,436
Since I'm a teacher just like her,

76
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,036
I would know better than to take home something like that!

77
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:41,536
Test papers?

78
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,736
"Akiyo Ueno (39)" -When I came here to see her last night,

79
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,536
she was busily grading papers.

80
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:51,736
I'll bet she just let my words go by.

81
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,036
I see.

82
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,936
By the way, you mentioned that

83
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:59,436
you came to see Ms. Shibuya to ask her not to seduce your son.

84
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:01,036
But what grade is your son in?

85
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:05,536
I think he's in first grade just like Conan.

86
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:10,836
Because Natsuko told me that she was the homeroom teacher of class 1-C.

87
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,236
In love with his homeroom teacher in the first grade.

88
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,536
How cute!

89
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:19,236
Cut out the gibberish!

90
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,636
Gibberish?

91
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:25,636
Because he's still mentally immature and at a sensitive age,

92
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,036
I warned her to act more modestly.

93
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:33,636
And my son is in the fifth grade, not the first!

94
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:34,636
-What? -What?

95
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:37,936
You mean he's in love with a teacher from another grade?

96
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:41,836
Ms. Shibuya is fluent in English

97
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,936
because she studied abroad for quite a while.

98
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,836
Therefore, she taught English to the upper grades too.

99
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,236
I see.

100
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:51,636
He's just like my husband I divorced!

101
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:54,936
He went head over heels over a cosmopolitan girl that he met at a cabaret.

102
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,936
After dished out money for her, he was abandoned by her.

103
00:06:56,936 --> 00:07:02,136
That's why I don't want my son to end up like him!

104
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:07,436
Still everyone around him is trying to drag him down.

105
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,836
Drag him down?

106
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:12,336
I'm sorry, will somebody lend me a handkerchief?

107
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:15,736
I forgot it in the cab on my way here.

108
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,336
If you don't mind using mine, here.

109
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:19,436
Thank you.

110
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:21,136
A cab,

111
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,036
which means you don't have a car?

112
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:26,936
I sold it to pay for the debts of my husband!

113
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:30,536
Although I still renew my driver's license.

114
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,736
It was stolen?

115
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,636
You mean the car you owned?

116
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,736
Yeah.

117
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,336
When I was ready to go the company this morning,

118
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:40,336
"Fujiyuki Kandachi (41)" -I found that my garage had been broken into

119
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,136
and my car was gone.

120
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,536
Did you report the car theft?

121
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,136
I did, right away!

122
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:49,736
So, I had to take the train to work and come here by bus.

123
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,536
I also end up being a suspect for a murder case.

124
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:53,936
Talk about bummers.

125
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:56,836
Natsuko's still alive, you know.

126
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,536
Hold on. You can't smoke here!

127
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:00,936
Oh, okay.

128
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:01,936
If I remember correctly,

129
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:05,036
you said you came here last night a little before 9 pm?

130
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:07,336
Yeah. Like I said before,

131
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:11,036
when I came here the school building was dark and the gate was closed.

132
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,936
She was probably already carried away

133
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:17,936
by that stalker teacher or that old lady, though.

134
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:22,436
It's also thinkable that you carried Ms. Shibuya away

135
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,336
after Mrs. Ueno went home and before Mr. Sugamoto arrived.

136
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,036
Oh, I guess so.

137
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:32,336
Anyway, I came here as promised but that teacher wasn't here.

138
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:36,836
Then, you're saying you promised to see Ms. Shibuya at around 9 pm?

139
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,136
Yeah.

140
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:44,036
But we found an unsent text mail in Ms. Shibuya's cell phone that said,

141
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,936
"The time promised is 20:30, but are you coming?"

142
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:49,236
Wasn't this mail supposed to be sent to you?

143
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,936
How should I know?

144
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:52,036
Since you're asking me that,

145
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:54,336
it didn't have the sender she was addressing it to, did it?

146
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,736
Maybe she was going to send it to that old lady,

147
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:01,736
who came in as she was writing it?

148
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:04,836
Well, even if that mail was meant to be sent to me that is...

149
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,736
Maybe she was all confused

150
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:09,736
looking at additions and subtractions that she made a mistake!

151
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:12,636
After all since it seems that she was grading the test papers.

152
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:19,236
Are these the test papers in question?

153
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:20,336
Yes.

154
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,536
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:24,236
The actual test papers are with the forensics right now

156
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:27,236
so all we have now are those photos.

157
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:29,636
But even if the problems are simple,

158
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,736
if there are this many figures lined out,

159
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,936
it's understandable that she'd get confused, right?

160
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:35,736
See?

161
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:38,736
But, what Natsuko was saying was true then.

162
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,236
-What? -See.

163
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:42,836
The illustration on the top right.

164
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:47,736
In the States, when 100 is scored, we write "Excellent",

165
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,736
but she said that in Japan, a flower circle is drawn.

166
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:51,836
Oh.

167
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:52,936
Is that all?

168
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:56,436
-What? -Is that all, FBI?

169
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,036
What do you mean is that all?

170
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:00,736
How about you, German descent?

171
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:03,136
I'm asking you is that all the information

172
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,836
you can come up with from this photo?

173
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:14,236
It seems that in Japan they mark the correct answers with a circle.

174
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:18,636
The score on the very top test paper is all correct.

175
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:25,536
It seems that we were the only ones who could decipher it after all!

176
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,236
-"We"? -"We"?

177
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:29,836
Right?

178
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,636
Conan Edogawa?

179
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:33,736
What're you talking about?

180
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:37,236
After you looked at the photos, you were staring at him.

181
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,336
The perpetrator.

182
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:40,836
What? Then...

183
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:43,136
Have you figured it out who the perpetrator is?

184
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,936
Yes. More or less.

185
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,736
But the mystery's finally been solved.

186
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:51,536
I was wondering all this time.

187
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,936
Why she asked me, a detective,

188
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,836
to investigate on a stalker

189
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:00,636
despite having an FBI friend like you?

190
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:02,636
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

191
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,736
Are you calling me unreliable?

192
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:07,336
Maybe she found it hard to ask us?

193
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:10,836
After all, we're here on a sightseeing tour.

194
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,236
I see. You're on a sightseeing tour.

195
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:14,436
If you don't have visas,

196
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:18,636
I'm sure your duration of stay is almost up?

197
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,536
If you had your fill of touring,

198
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:23,436
I hope you'd hurry and get out of here.

199
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,736
From my Japan.

200
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,736
Can I have a word with you, Zero.

201
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,236
I mean Amuro. Give me a sec.

202
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:41,936
Well...

203
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,636
Amuro,

204
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,536
you're the enemies, right?

205
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,536
With the bad guys.

206
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,836
Zero.

207
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:06,336
My nickname when I was a child was really that.

208
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:11,236
It seems that you've got me wrong a bit.

209
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,736
Got you wrong?

210
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,764
Shall we start solving the puzzle then?

211
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:34,264
First of all, please take a good look at the photos of the test papers

212
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:37,264
you saw a while ago.

213
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,164
Don't you notice something?

214
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:43,364
I've got him wrong?

215
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:47,664
His insight at seeing through the truth of a case in an instant.

216
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:51,364
That action of his in the Bell Tree Express of not killing Haibara.

217
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:55,964
His attitude of reacting to the word "Zero".

218
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:02,264
And now I'm more convinced

219
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,264
by his remark to the FBI agents a while ago.

220
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,564
I hope you'd hurry and get out of here.

221
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:10,464
From my Japan.

222
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,864
That conviction of his!

223
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,064
"Zero" is a code name meaning,

224
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:19,264
"Remain a non-existing organization".

225
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:24,164
The organization that exists to maintain the peace and order of Japan.

226
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:26,964
It's a common name given to the security police.

227
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:28,264
If he's from the security police

228
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:30,064
and infiltrating the Organization,

229
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,464
I thought that we could avoid the worse

230
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:35,064
if I explained our situation but...

231
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,564
If that's not the case...

232
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:40,264
This plan that I've thought carefully over for some time.

233
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,364
And? How about it, Mr. Akai?

234
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:49,964
Sink or swim, this is a great gamble.

235
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,764
Would you like to go for it?

236
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,964
Of course.

237
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,664
We'll be exposed!

238
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:00,464
Hold it. Cool it.

239
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,664
It hasn't been exposed yet.

240
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:06,364
There's just one piece of information he doesn't know of yet.

241
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,764
I'm sure that he'll conjure up something to get a hold of it.

242
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,864
But, what on earth could it be?

243
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,864
I give up, Amuro.

244
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,364
Tell me won't you?

245
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:25,364
What is strange about this test paper?

246
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,464
Please look at it closely!

247
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,564
Look at the answers on the topmost test paper

248
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:33,764
and the answers on the paper hidden below it.

249
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:36,064
For example this "4+5"

250
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,964
the answer is the same "9"

251
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,164
and yet the sheet on top is marked with a circle

252
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,564
and the one below is marked with a check mark.

253
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:44,164
Besides, this test sheet of a student named Fumihiko Hirai

254
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,564
is marked everywhere with check marks

255
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:48,764
and yet has a flower circle and a score of 100 on it.

256
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,764
Don't you think it's strange?

257
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,364
True.

258
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:54,864
Wait a second.

259
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:55,964
Hold it...

260
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:59,464
It's impossible that the FBI and Bourbon, a member of the Organization,

261
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:03,164
would run into each other coincidentally at the crime scene to begin with.

262
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:06,364
The clincher was, if I remember correctly...

263
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:09,364
Ms. Jodie.

264
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:15,564
What?

265
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:19,064
Why did you call Ms. Shibuya last night?

266
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:21,664
Because I was had promised to go drinking with her.

267
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:23,464
Who invited who?

268
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,464
She texted me to go.

269
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,864
But, it's strange

270
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:29,764
because Natsuko said she didn't remember texting me about it.

271
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:33,564
Well, it seems that mail was in her cell phone,

272
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,664
and she's a bit of a scatterbrain anyway so...

273
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,864
Your cell phone needed to be recharged, right?

274
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:41,564
So Agent Camel, you lent her your cell phone, right?

275
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,164
Yeah.

276
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:45,164
I recharge it every night,

277
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:46,664
but since I use it so frequently,

278
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:49,764
at about sundown it runs out of battery.

279
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,664
Bummers. Maybe...

280
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:53,764
Maybe what?

281
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,764
Right, Agent Jodie Starling?

282
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:57,764
-What? -What?

283
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:00,164
I wish you would listen to what I'm saying.

284
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,164
After all, I'm trying to find the perpetrator

285
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:05,864
that put your friend through all this.

286
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:07,964
Right.

287
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:10,464
In Japan circles are used to mark the correct answers

288
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:13,064
and check marks are used to mark wrong answers.

289
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:14,964
But in the States,

290
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:17,464
correct answers are marked with check marks!

291
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,264
-What? -What?

292
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,864
That's correct, isn't it, Agent Jodie?

293
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:25,964
Yes. The check marks don't mean the answers are wrong.

294
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:29,764
In Japan you also put check marks on mark sheets, don't you?

295
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:31,164
It's the same.

296
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:34,164
But why is there a circle around the wrong answer?

297
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:39,064
That circle means to recheck the answer because it's wrong.

298
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,364
Well, it really depends on the teacher though,

299
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,764
whether the wrong answer would be marked with a circle.

300
00:16:43,764 --> 00:16:46,664
Which means that the test papers below

301
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:49,864
were graded by Natsuko who came back from the States

302
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:54,964
and the ones on top were graded by the perpetrator who's a Japanese?

303
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,064
Yes.

304
00:16:56,064 --> 00:17:00,264
Besides, don't you think the circles of the papers on the top

305
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:03,164
are pretty distorted and sticking out of the paper?

306
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:05,764
Yeah but why?

307
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:09,764
Well, it could be that the perpetrator is quite clumsy

308
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:14,964
or the perpetrator was trying to hide something red using the red pen.

309
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:17,164
-Blood stains! -I see!

310
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,664
When the perpetrator struck her here,

311
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,464
blood splattered on the test papers that she hadn't corrected yet.

312
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:25,064
So in order to hide it,

313
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:27,764
the perpetrator traced the blood stains with a red pen to grade the papers.

314
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:30,264
That's why the circles are distorted!

315
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:31,364
Correct.

316
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:36,064
The question is who of the three did that.

317
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:40,264
And? I hope you already know who it is.

318
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:41,464
Of course!

319
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,864
It's easy, right, Conan?

320
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,064
What? Oh. Yep!

321
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,564
It's the flower circle!

322
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:51,164
I figured it out as soon as I saw the photo of the flower circle!

323
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:53,264
I figured out who drew it!

324
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,964
-Flower circle? -Flower circle?

325
00:17:54,964 --> 00:18:01,564
Yep! Compare the flower circles that Ms. Shibuya and the perpetrator drew!

326
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:04,364
The swirls are drawn in differently, see?

327
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,264
You're right!

328
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:09,464
The perpetrator drawn it counter clockwise.

329
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,764
It's usually drawn clockwise, isn't it?

330
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:13,064
Yeah.

331
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:17,264
Which means that the perpetrator isn't Mr. Sugamoto

332
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,364
who wiped his perspiration with a handkerchief using his right hand

333
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:22,764
neither was it Mrs. Ueno who took Mr. Camel's handkerchief

334
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:24,764
using her right hand.

335
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:29,164
Mr. Kandachi used his left hand to light his lighter.

336
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:31,364
So, it makes him the perpetrator, right?

337
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:36,164
I see.

338
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:40,564
A left-hander would draw the swirl of the flower circle counter clockwise.

339
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:41,764
Oh, no.

340
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:43,564
It's true that I'm left-handed

341
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:46,564
but I draw my flower circles from the center!

342
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:49,164
I didn't draw those.

343
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,464
No.

344
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,264
As to both of the flower circles,

345
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,564
the pressure of the pen tapered towards the center.

346
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:57,864
So, that's proof that it was drawn from the outside in.

347
00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,064
Besides, didn't you said that

348
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:02,164
she was grading papers

349
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:05,364
and figures were flying through her head

350
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:07,264
so she got confused as to the time.

351
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,264
Elementary school teachers teach other subjects too

352
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:12,164
and yet, how did you know

353
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:15,764
that she was grading the arithmetic test?

354
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:18,464
Come on, give me a good excuse.

355
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:19,964
If you have any other answer besides,

356
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:22,364
"I saw it at the crime site" that is.

357
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:29,964
She was laughing.

358
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:32,664
When I shouted that she graded the paper incorrectly,

359
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:34,564
she laughed by saying it just a habit of hers

360
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,664
after returning from the States.

361
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:37,964
Is that why you...

362
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,364
I didn't know that

363
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:43,164
the way they graded papers in Japan and the States was different!

364
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:46,064
It's true that Natsuko is also to blame

365
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,464
for not grading the papers Japanese style

366
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:49,264
but you could've figured it out

367
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:50,864
if you took a good look at the answer sheet, no?

368
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,264
I was outraged and couldn't think that far.

369
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:55,764
Then what about your car being stolen?

370
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:57,364
It's a lie.

371
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,464
I didn't want her hair or what not's being in the car

372
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:02,364
so I had a friend keep it for me.

373
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,264
Excuse me!

374
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,364
The hospital just called.

375
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,364
Ms. Shibuya took a turn for the worse

376
00:20:08,364 --> 00:20:10,164
and she's in critical condition.

377
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:13,564
Natsuko?

378
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:15,964
"Haido Central Hospital"

379
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,864
What did you come for?

380
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,464
You've got no business here anymore, do you?

381
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:37,764
She's my client.

382
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:40,664
Besides...

383
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:45,864
I thought that you'd carelessly make a slip of a tongue.

384
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:49,864
Natsuko. Please.

385
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,664
Don't die!

386
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:53,864
Natsuko!

387
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:58,864
Oh, Jodie. You came all the way out here to see me.

388
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,064
Yes...

389
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:03,464
But, it's amazing you knew that I regained consciousness.

390
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:04,564
Huh?

391
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:07,364
As to what happened this time, I'm to blame too,

392
00:21:07,364 --> 00:21:08,964
so I feel quite uncomfortable.

393
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:12,264
I told them not to let the school know about it yet.

394
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:13,964
This is bad.

395
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,464
Ms. Jodie!

396
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:16,864
Where's Agent Camel now?

397
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:19,364
I think he's by the car?

398
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:41,964
"Haido Central Hospital"

399
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,064
Rikumichi Kusuda?

400
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:46,264
I don't know a guy like that.

401
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,664
He's a guy who used to be hospitalized here,

402
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:53,164
stopped his car nearby and went missing.

403
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,764
I hear that there was a gun involved or something.

404
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:58,364
Haven't you heard anything about it from your buddies?

405
00:22:58,364 --> 00:22:59,464
Nope.

406
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,164
Oh, I see!

407
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:03,464
I guess it's information that's not passed down

408
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:06,664
to a low-ranking agent like you.

409
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:08,164
Just what are you talking about?

410
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:10,664
We always share common information...

411
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,064
Camel!

412
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:13,764
Just what're you doing?

413
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:15,764
Stay with me, will you?

414
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:24,764
I hope you didn't tell him about Kusuda?

415
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,364
Of course not.

416
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,964
I wouldn't dare say that the guy shot himself to death in the car.

417
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:33,464
Over my dead body.

418
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:34,864
I see.

419
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,064
Thank you.

420
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:39,964
Well, it's an incident that occurred before I was dispatched to Japan,

421
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:42,964
so I just heard about it from Mr. Akai.

422
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:46,464
Jodie?

423
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:48,964
Where are you?

424
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,164
Jodie?

425
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:55,264
"Next Episode" -The skill to change the tone of voice

426
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:58,464
and amazing disguising technique.

427
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,964
A woman posses a combination of both.

428
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:07,664
He seems to have shot himself to death.

429
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:12,364
I see, so that's the story.

430
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,264
Next Conan, "The Scarlet Interplay"

431
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,764
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:43,264
"Rikumichi Kusuda"

433
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,964
That hint bothers me.

434
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:46,464
Camel, isn't your mouth torn?

435
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,164
Oh, no
