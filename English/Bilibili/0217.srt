1
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:21,032
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:22,932
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:24,532
Show time again for the Metropolitan Police Department.

4
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:26,532
One mistake after the other is made in this eerie case.

5
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,132
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:30,032
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,232
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,491
Hello? It's me.

9
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,491
I'm sorry, just a while ago.

10
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,191
I guess the battery of my cell phone ran out on me.

11
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,891
Yes, that's right.

12
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,891
I got off the car and am calling from a phone booth now.

13
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:19,691
I should be there in another 30 minutes.

14
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,391
Okay then, I'll see you later.

15
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:49,091
"Inspector Megure's Sealed Secret (Part 1)"

16
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:53,091
"Haido Department Store"

17
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:56,191
Look... What do you think of this?

18
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,991
You're going to give it as a gift to Mr. Kyogoku, aren't you?

19
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:00,391
Don't you think it's a bit too cute?

20
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:02,691
You think so?

21
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:08,291
I think he'd look better in a simple sweater like this.

22
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,191
No, it has to be hand-knitted!

23
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,191
What do you mean it has to be hand-knitted?

24
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:15,591
Oh, no.

25
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:18,291
Sonoko.

26
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:25,891
Come on, I just thought that a hand-knitted sweater would be warmer.

27
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:27,691
Sonoko, don't tell me that you...

28
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:32,691
Well, I kind of wrote in the last letter to him that...

29
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:36,491
"I'm knitting a sweater for someone that I care for."

30
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,491
But, I didn't think that knitting a sweater took so much patience.

31
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:41,991
I see.

32
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:43,791
So, you're planning to buy a readymade, hand-knitted sweater,

33
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,891
and give it to him, making him think that you knitted it for him.

34
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,391
Well, I have no other choice.

35
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,391
I can't back off now, can I?

36
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,991
Well, all right. I give you credit for your courage

37
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:56,591
of telling the person that you like how you feel about him,

38
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,691
so I won't say a word about the sweater.

39
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,391
What? I still haven't told Makoto how I feel about him yet.

40
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:04,991
What? But didn't you write him a letter?

41
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,791
That you're knitting it for the one you care for.

42
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:13,691
Maybe he'll take it to be that you have another boyfriend.

43
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,691
That's just it. That's the point.

44
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,191
What?

45
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,691
If he thinks so, that'll make him feel a bit flustered, won't it?

46
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:24,991
Just as he's feeling that way, he receives this parcel.

47
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:28,491
He will think, "What's this? A parcel from Sonoko?"

48
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:33,091
And he opens the parcel slowly...

49
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:36,991
It was actually a sweater I was making for you.

50
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,391
This is my "Love, love strategy."

51
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:46,591
I won't pity you if you get dumped.

52
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:50,991
Makoto is so reticent that unless I do something like this,

53
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,191
I'll never find out how he feels about me.

54
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:57,691
Although I know he is always worried about me,

55
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:01,691
but I'll need a lot of courage to ask him directly how he feels about me.

56
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,691
Well, Sonoko, but...

57
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:07,291
Ran, how about you?

58
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,091
Do you know how Shinichi feels about you?

59
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,991
What? Well...

60
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,391
See...

61
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,591
You want to know, don't you? You want to ask him, don't you?

62
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,991
Well...

63
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:24,591
I guess as a childhood friend,

64
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,991
if I said I didn't care at all, it would be a lie.

65
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,591
But...

66
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:33,391
But! But...

67
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,891
I want to ask him, and yet I don't.

68
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:40,191
That's how I feel right now.

69
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:44,191
I hope that's not what you're thinking dream lover?

70
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,691
I... I am thinking no such thing!

71
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,991
Excuse me.

72
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:53,691
May I go over to Pops who is waiting in the parking lot?

73
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:57,891
Sure, then can you tell Dad head to the spaghetti shop

74
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,291
behind the department store and wait for us there?

75
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,191
Hey... How about this one here?

76
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:07,091
I feel like I listened to girl's talk that I wasn't supposed to listen to.

77
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,691
Oh, no. What is that? Talk about dorky!

78
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:12,191
Right?

79
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,391
Gosh!

80
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,491
I wonder why girls like to waste their time

81
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:22,391
on things like shopping and talking on the phone?

82
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,691
That's right.

83
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,691
Look at those legs of hers.

84
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:36,391
Moreover, look at that super mini skirt, despite this cold weather.

85
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,191
What?

86
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,691
A ball pen is on the ground.

87
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,691
Maybe that woman who just came out dropped it?

88
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,391
We've got to go give it back to her!

89
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:47,291
Excuse me, miss.

90
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,291
You dropped this.

91
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,891
Get him!

92
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:11,191
Hold it... Give me a break!

93
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,591
You were after a serial culprit who goes after women

94
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,691
and beating them with an object.

95
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:23,991
Right, that's why Officer Sato dressed up like that.

96
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:29,191
But, the height of the culprit was publicly announced as being about 150cm.

97
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:34,191
You can tell that I'm not the man just by looking.

98
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:38,891
Well, the way you approached Officer Sato was so...

99
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,391
It's not what you could call all that normal.

100
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,391
I felt a bit of danger, you see.

101
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,291
How rude!

102
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,791
We've got a bit of a problem here, though.

103
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,591
Yes, the only thing the three women victims have in common

104
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:56,191
is that they were dressed flashily when they were attacked.

105
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:59,891
That's about all we know.

106
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:03,591
The place of attack is also scattered here and there.

107
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:07,691
Will you show me the picture of the girls again?

108
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:08,691
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,291
The first victim was Ms. Ryoko Mizutani.

110
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:18,191
One night, two weeks ago, she was hit from behind

111
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:20,391
while she was waiting for the light to turn green.

112
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,791
Therefore, she got off her car to complain,

113
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,991
but beaten with a metal bat.

114
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:29,391
The next one who was attacked was Ms. Hitomi Endo.

115
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,891
Late at night, 10 days ago,

116
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,191
she was struck with a metal bat

117
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:35,691
as she came out of the restroom of the park.

118
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:39,291
And she's Michiko Ishiguro, who was beaten last night.

119
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,891
She seems to have been struck

120
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,891
right after she came out of the phone booth.

121
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,691
Don't tell me that it was that phone booth...

122
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:50,991
Yes, that phone booth that we got a hold of you at.

123
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,691
Fortunately, all three are in satisfactory condition,

124
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,691
but the only thing common we can find

125
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,991
is that they were dressed quite flashily.

126
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:03,391
They say they have no memory of anyone having a grudge against them either.

127
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:06,691
Well, Mr. Mouri, any inspiration?

128
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,391
Well, if I had to come up with something...

129
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,691
If you were to come up with something...

130
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:16,491
All three are mixed-race and were raised in the jungle.

131
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:25,991
Well, it's hard to think that these three are ordinary Japanese.

132
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:27,691
How cute!

133
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,891
Their skin is super dark!

134
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:33,391
The one in the middle is ultra-dark!

135
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,191
They're called "Mountain witch girls",

136
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,291
girls wearing this kind of make-up are very popular now.

137
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,891
What? "Mountain witch"?

138
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:43,291
No way. Don't tell me you don't know about them?

139
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,291
Don't be ridiculous! "Mountain witch", right?

140
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,691
Of course I know about them!

141
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,691
What? Where's Ran?

142
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,691
She said she had to go to the restroom,

143
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,391
and ask me wait for her at the spaghetti shop.

144
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:01,091
But if the culprit is indiscriminately attacking those type of girls,

145
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:02,891
where do we start looking for him?

146
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:06,691
Right, we haven't had this kind of case before either.

147
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,891
No, there was a similar case in the past.

148
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:13,591
A series of high school girls were hit-and-run.

149
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:16,191
Very abhorrent case.

150
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,591
That was way before I became a police officer...

151
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:23,191
Let's go back and investigate!

152
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,391
Yes, sir!

153
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,391
I'll act as decoy once again.

154
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,591
No! No more decoy!

155
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:31,491
-What? -Let's go back and check

156
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,891
if there are no other things in common with the victims once again.

157
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,291
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

158
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,891
See you, Mr. Mouri. Sorry for the mistake.

159
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:40,691
No problem.

160
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:43,891
Hello?

161
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,391
Ran.

162
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:49,691
What? You don't know where the exit is?

163
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,791
And where are you now?

164
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,891
What? The basement parking lot?

165
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:57,291
I don't believe it. How bad you can get at directions?

166
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,391
Sonoko, isn't that ring, necklace and bracelet the same ones

167
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,391
that the girls in the picture were wearing?

168
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,891
-What? -Where did you buy it?

169
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:10,891
I didn't buy it, it was given to me

170
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,891
at the department store we just went to.

171
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,491
Something about a "Millennium Sale",

172
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,991
when I showed my receipt at the exit,

173
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:20,391
I can choose any item for every 10,000 yen worth of shopping.

174
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,091
Hey, how about it?

175
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,391
They're wearing them!

176
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,691
Although they're only wearing one each,

177
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,591
they're the same accessories as those that Sonoko has!

178
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,691
Which means that the three girls...

179
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,391
They were customers at the same department store!

180
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,691
Hey, Sonoko.

181
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:38,391
What's the matter? Please answer me.

182
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:40,191
Sonoko...

183
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,391
Ran!

184
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,491
Hey, Ran! What's wrong?

185
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:58,391
-Ran, what's up? Answer me! -Dad...

186
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,291
What? A blood splattered woman is lying on the ground

187
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,191
of the basement parking lot?

188
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,080
The victim is Tae Aizawa, 20 years old.

189
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,980
She used to be a salesclerk at this department store,

190
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,580
but quit a year ago.

191
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,580
She seems to have been presently unemployed.

192
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,980
He finally kills at the fourth attempt.

193
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Then, this was also committed by the same person.

194
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,280
Yes.

195
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,780
Since the characteristic of the culprit has not been made public,

196
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,280
and this is the basement parking of the department store in question,

197
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,480
so there's probably no doubt that it's the same person.

198
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,180
Then this could be the doings of someone

199
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,580
who has a grudge against the department store.

200
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,080
Tae...

201
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,780
Tae!

202
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,280
-Who is he? -He is her boyfriend

203
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,280
and was supposed to meet her in the department store.

204
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,080
"Noriyuki Shirakawa (24), Cook" -Something about his father

205
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,780
being the owner of the department store

206
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,980
and that he was going to introduce her to him today,

207
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,780
at the restaurant he is working as a cook at.

208
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,480
Who is that woman?

209
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,980
A waitress at the restaurant he works I hear.

210
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,780
"Yuri Konno (24), Waitress" -Her name is Yuri Konno.

211
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
She was his classmate in university,

212
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,480
and she used to give him advice when he needed it.

213
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,880
Advice?

214
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,280
Mr. Shirakawa's father seems to have been against him

215
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,380
going out with Ms. Aizawa.

216
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,980
Ran, didn't you see anyone suspicious

217
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,480
before you found the dead body?

218
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
There was no such person!

219
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,980
The only person I passed by was a security guard.

220
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,480
A security guard?

221
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,580
Yes, at the entrance of this parking lot.

222
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,780
A man somewhere in his forties, I think.

223
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,680
That's me!

224
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,980
"Yoshio Sadakane (43), Security Guard" -I just happened to leave my post

225
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,680
"Yoshio Sadakane (43), Security Guard" -to go to the men's room.

226
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,880
The culprit probably entered the parking lot during that time.

227
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,180
I'll bet you're the one who did it?

228
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,580
Dad!

229
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,480
I hear you working as a security guard

230
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,880
for a rival department store until six months ago.

231
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,080
"Haruyoshi Shirakawa (53)" -Don't tell me that

232
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,480
"Haido department store's owner" -they asked you to do this for them

233
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,280
in order to give us a bad reputation?

234
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,180
No way.

235
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Well, Noriyuki, I guess this is a good opportunity for you to go

236
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,980
and find yourself a new girlfriend!

237
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,580
Next time, go find yourself a nice girl

238
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
who has no blemishes to her name!

239
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Dad!

240
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,480
Noriyuki.

241
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,280
What did he mean by a girl with no blemishes to her name?

242
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,580
I think he's talking about the traffic accident

243
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,880
she caused a year ago in the parking lot.

244
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,580
Traffic accident?

245
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,980
Yes, she ran over a little boy here,

246
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,280
that's why she was fired.

247
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I heard about it from Yumi in the transportation section.

248
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,280
A boy who was waiting for his mother in this parking lot,

249
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,380
ran out from behind a car and got run over.

250
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,880
Being in a parking lot, the car wasn't going fast,

251
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,380
but the boy got hit in the wrong place and died.

252
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,980
I think the boy's name was Akira Sakurai.

253
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
I see.

254
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,880
By the way, Noriyuki,

255
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,580
do you happen to know how tall your father is?

256
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,580
A little more than 150 cm, I think.

257
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,480
And how about you?

258
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
173 cm.

259
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,280
I'm 144 cm.

260
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm 167 cm.

261
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,280
That makes the owner a possible suspect.

262
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,580
Yes.

263
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,880
He was capable of knowing that she'd be coming here too.

264
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,280
Excuse me, did your father come to the restaurant

265
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,880
where you were supposed to be meeting each other?

266
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,580
No, since he didn't show up at the promised time,

267
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,580
I had her go check on him to the parking lot.

268
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,280
I see.

269
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,480
Don't tell me that you're suspecting my father of having killed her?

270
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh, no. Since a woman who was previously attacked mentioned

271
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,580
the culprit being about 150 cm, we just asked to be sure.

272
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,380
A woman who was previously attacked...

273
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,880
Then, is this the doing of that serial culprit after all?

274
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,580
Well...

275
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,280
What are you guys doing anyway?

276
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,380
You even know the height of the culprit,

277
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,880
and how come you can't arrest him?

278
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,080
If you had only nabbed the culprit,

279
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,480
Tae wouldn't have had to die!

280
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,180
Calm down, Noriyuki.

281
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,880
You police are to blame for Tae's death!

282
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,180
You police are no good!

283
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,580
Cut it out, Noriyuki!

284
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,480
No good...

285
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,880
You police are no good!

286
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,380
Why are you so surprised?

287
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm saying I'll be the decoy.

288
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,280
It doesn't work out like in the movies, does it?

289
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Inspector Megure!

290
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,080
-Inspector! -Are you all right?

291
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,480
Nothing, it's nothing.

292
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,880
I'm sorry, inspector.

293
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,280
Noriyuki's just a bit upset.

294
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,280
No problem. He's absolutely right.

295
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,180
Could we go over that side and cool off a bit?

296
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,880
All right.

297
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,980
I guess I'll get back to work then.

298
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Thank you very much.

299
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,480
Well, did all the three women say that

300
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
the culprit was about 150 cm?

301
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,180
No, the ones who said so,

302
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,580
were the first and third women that were attacked.

303
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,280
The second woman

304
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
was suddenly struck from behind

305
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,880
and was passed out till a passer-by found her,

306
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,180
so she didn't get to see the culprit.

307
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,580
But, there is no mistake that the culprit is about 150 cm.

308
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,980
When we had them come to the station on a later date,

309
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,680
they both said that the culprit was just about their height.

310
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,780
How tall are the two girls?

311
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:13,580
Well, the first one is 151 cm and the third one 153 cm.

312
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,080
We measured them when they came to headquarters

313
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
so there's no mistake about it.

314
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,780
Hey!

315
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't go talking about things you don't have to children!

316
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,880
Hey, Ran! You really saw no one suspicious?

318
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,180
No, I didn't.

319
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,980
I was just walking around here for a while looking for the exit,

320
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,880
but isn't there something strange, though?

321
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,380
What's strange?

322
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,180
That woman.

323
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,080
You think so too, Ran?

324
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,680
Right? There's something strange,

325
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
but I can't really say what it is.

326
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,580
There's something awfully strange about this woman.

327
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,980
Awfully strange?

328
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,580
Wasn't there something strange of

329
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,580
how the second woman who was attacked was dressed too?

330
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,280
This woman was attacked when she came out of the restroom

331
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,080
in the park after midnight, right?

332
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,480
That's right.

333
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,380
That's the picture that we took

334
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,280
when we went to the scene of the crime.

335
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,080
See. The restroom in the back.

336
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,080
If a passer-by found her, it means that she was alone, right?

337
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,080
But, she's wearing a man's coat!

338
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,580
That's my coat, I put it over her

339
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,780
because she looked so cold.

340
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,280
Then why was she at the park at night dressed so lightly?

341
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,880
True.

342
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,180
She said nothing about her jacket being taken away or anything either.

343
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,580
Come to think of it,

344
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,780
she's been in a state of confusion ever since the incident,

345
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,780
and we haven't been able to really get anything out of her yet.

346
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,280
You fool!

347
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,980
Young women nowadays to dress lightly!

348
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,980
But, she was wearing a no sleeve outfit.

349
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,580
She was dressed too light for the weather.

350
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,580
Maybe she was in a warm place to begin with,

351
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,380
and planning to go right back after go to the restroom?

352
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380
A warm place?

353
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,980
Yes, for example,

354
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,580
like in a car or something.

355
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
A car?

356
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,580
Come to think of it, the first and third victims

357
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,980
were attacked when they got off the car.

358
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,880
And this fourth incident happened in a parking lot.

359
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,280
Cars are involved in all the cases!

360
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,980
Okay, Officer Takagi,

361
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,980
go check and confirm it with the second victim!

362
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,480
Yes, sir!

363
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,980
That sort of clears the suspicion off the owner, doesn't it?

364
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,980
No, we can't be so sure yet.

365
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
"Kiyonaga Matsumoto (54)" -Thanks for good work as usual,

366
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,280
"Superintendent" -renowned detective!

367
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,880
Superintendent Matsumoto!

368
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,280
Thank you for coming all this way!

369
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,380
Hey, Megure. The press is out there making a fuss

370
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,180
about this being the beginning of a series of indiscriminate murders.

371
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,280
Call it a day for now and come back again tomorrow!

372
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,580
But...

373
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,280
Let's do that, Inspector Megure.

374
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,180
We've already gotten to the point of knowing that

375
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,580
all the victims were probably riding a car.

376
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,580
If need be, I'll wear the make-up like them,

377
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,180
ride a car and try again.

378
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,280
I've already told you that I will not be using decoys anymore!

379
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,280
Superintendent. Please let me stay and investigate a bit further!

380
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I know I'm close to getting somewhere!

381
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,580
Besides, I have this feeling that the culprit is still somewhere nearby.

382
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,780
Well...

383
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,780
Inspector Megure.

384
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,480
Don't tell me that

385
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,880
you're not dragging the you know what case inside of you yet?

386
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,480
That case that you sealed up inside that hat of yours.

387
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,480
No, I would never.

388
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,280
Really? Excuse me for the stupid question.

389
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,480
"Next Episode" -Here goes!

390
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,980
What? These shoes are too big for her.

391
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,280
Wait!

392
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,980
She wouldn't wear those shoes with that fashion of hers.

393
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,480
If so, don't tell me that the culprit is...

394
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,880
Hey, isn't anyone around?

395
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,580
Next Conan,

396
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,280
"Inspector Megure's Sealed Secret (Part 2)"

397
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:30,998
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:30,998 --> 00:24:33,398
"Thick, high soled-boots"

399
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:34,698
Tune in to the next episode, the secret of the hat!

400
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:35,898
I guess this'll be a "hat" case.

401
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:38,298
Inspector Megure, you mean a "hot" case, right?
