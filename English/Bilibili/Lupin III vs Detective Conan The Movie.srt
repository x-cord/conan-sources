Inspector, all vehicles are in position!

14
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,990
Strike Team, what's the situation inside?

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,360
Just like what you've expected,

16
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,660
the security system has been destroyed.

17
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,330
Where's the diamond?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,230
It's gone. The protective case is broken.

19
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,700
This is the B team.

20
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,870
Target is not found on the first floor
of the emergency staircase.

21
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,710
We are getting ready to head up.

22
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,900
No need to lower down your voice.

23
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,040
Do your best to force the target to move upwards.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,050
Roger that.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,550
Okay. Let's go through our operation plan again.

26
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,350
No matter where he flies off from,

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,290
our four jet streams

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,650
will blow him into the Tsukishima River.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,020
Then, we'll scoop him up like

30
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,080
the Goldfish Scooping Game.

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,530
Today, he won't get away from me.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,960
Will it be so easy to blow him into the water?

33
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,630
He might counterattack us with his Card Gun.

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,430
Although his ammunition is tough,
they are still poker cards.

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,940
They'll be affected by the jet streams.

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,310
He likes to spread out his cape, use it as a hang-glider

37
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,070
and shoot out poker cards.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,170
Because he likes to act cool,

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,210
wind will become Kiddo's weakness.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:42,050
Kiddo!

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,060
Inspector!

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,990
Here you are, Kiddo.

43
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,320
Get into position!

44
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,120
Yes, Inspector!

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,270
I have the diamond now.

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,270
Who is that person?

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,340
Operation Kiddo Arrest commences now!

48
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,350
Start your turbines right now.

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,090
Kiddo is heading towards the left.

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,390
Team 2 and team 4, execute plan B.

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,330
We got him.

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,600
Serve you right, Kiddo.

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,940
You were so frightened that you forgot to show your hang-glider?

54
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,810
He's 50 meters away from Tsukishima River.

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,210
Arrest Team at Tsukishima River, raise the net!

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,930
Kiddo has fired a gun!

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,630
Kiddo fired a gun?

58
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,070
Kiddo has escaped with a Yakata Boat.

59
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,910
He's moving upstream along Tsukishima River!

60
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,410
Where's the helicopter?

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,950
We didn't prepare any helicopters for this operation.

62
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,040
-Kiddo fired a gun?
-We have coastguards on the boats.

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,450
This is such a hindrance!

64
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,960
This huge net is in the way!

65
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,990
We can't chase after him!

66
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,300
Kiddo, stop right there!

67
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,550
I won't let you get away!

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,930
Looks like he won't be defeated so easily.

I see.

72
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,000
You should've said that from the very start.

73
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,810
Lupin III.

74
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,080
(Lupin the 3rd VS Detective Conan
The Movie)

75
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,220
This man is Lupin III.

76
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,020
His footsteps can be found all over the world.

77
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,160
He never gives up a target.

78
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,100
He's the elusive master thief.

79
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,800
His partner is Daisuke Jigen.

80
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,000
A professional shooter who can
pull out his gun and shoot in 0.3 seconds.

81
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,440
He's a loyal and calm

82
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
(Don't call me Papa!)
-sharpshooter.

83

An expert who has mastered Iaido

85
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,820
and can cut everything into half.

86
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,940
He can be a dangerous man when provoked.

87
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,680
Last but not least,

88
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,760
the mysterious lady, Fujiko Mine.

89
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,890
Even Lupin is not sure

90
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
whether she's a female thief or a lady spy.

91
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,660
He's always in trouble because of her.

92
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,530
So, why does he let her tag along?

93
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,140
That is because cute ladies are Lupin's weakness.

94
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,200
So it seems.

95
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,010
This boy is a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,650
While on a date with his childhood friend and classmate,
Ran Mouri, at an amusement park,

97
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,090
he witnessed a suspicious transaction
between some scary-looking men in black.

98
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,260
He was so focused on the transaction

99
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,030
that he failed to notice one of their partners
sneaking up on him from behind.

100
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,670
He was forced to swallow poison by that man.

101
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,900
When he woke up,

102
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,670
it was so shocking,

103
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,370
his body had shrunk.

104
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,410
So,

105
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,240
if they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

106
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,400
not only his life would be in danger,

107
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
the people around him would be at risk too.

108
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,180
Thus, Shinichi Kudo decided to hide his identity

109
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,150
and named himself Conan Edogawa.

110
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,050
He moved in with his girlfriend, Ran, and her father

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,150
who is a detective.

112
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,760
Forget it then. I'll ask Kiddo for help.

113
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,490
Kiddo?

114
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,630
Kaito Kiddo. Have you not heard of him before?

115
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,790
He's no one.

116
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,460
Although he's known as the Moonlight Magician,

117
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,800
he's still a young high schooler.

118
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,360
My cup of tea.

119
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,170
Where is he? Which high school is he in?

120
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,040
Tell me, Lupin.

121
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,110
I've fulfilled your request

122
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,550
by committing the crime in Kiddo's name.

123
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,860
Good evening, Lupin.

124
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,450
You had made such a showy appearance.

125
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,360
Since you had seen it, let's cut to the chase.

126
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,030
Deactivate the bomb now.

127
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,090
About that,

128
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,160
I can't do it.

129
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,330
What do you mean?

130
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,570
Will you really follow my order for that woman?

131
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm not sure if I can trust you or not.

132
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,210
So, it was a test.

133
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,610
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,480
A man recommended you to me.

135
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,110
According to him, you are the only one

136
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,550
who can steal the Cherry Sapphire.

137
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,020
Thank you for the compliment.

138
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,690
Did I pass the test?

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,090
Of course.

140
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,530
Contact me again after you've gotten the Cherry Sapphire.

141
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,130
Only then will I deactivate the bomb on her.

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,560
Another thing.

143
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,200
It'll be a waste of time for you to trace this number.

144
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,680
Looks like it.

145
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,300
Let me ask. Where does the signal come from right now?

146
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,940
It came from the deep mountains of China just now.

147
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,750
Now, it's coming from the satellite above America.

148
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,320
I don't want to play anymore.

149
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,980
I'll admit this.

150
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,550
You are an opponent I should take seriously.

151
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,820
I'll never forget

152
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,420
that my opponent is Lupin III, too.

153
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,080
It was perfectly cut in half.

154
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
What kind of a weapon could do that?

155
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,620
Even the bulletproof carbon fiber inside was...

156
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,220
How terrifying.

157
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,130
Looks like this one

158
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,330
-suits you better.
-Why did he put so much effort

159
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,960
into stealing it

160
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,830
and then, throwing it into someone's bucket?

161
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,760
I don't get it.

162
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,360
In the end, he just wanted to create a scene?

163
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,270
They even laid down such a huge net

164
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,680
and came back

165
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,940
-Conan is staring at the TV.
-with three little fish.

166
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,040
He looks so dispirited.

167
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,680
I'm always saying this.

168
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,810
He shouldn't act on his own.

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,350
He lost to the man named Goemon, right?

170
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,720
It's all over the internet.

171
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,420
It's said that Lupin III is in Japan now.

172
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,650
Goemon is Lupin's accomplice, right?

173
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,850
So, they are in the same area as we are?

174
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,060
It's time for your long-awaited quiz.

175
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,890
Will it be a foolish quiz again?

176
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm not in the mood.

177
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,500
No one is looking forward to it.

178
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,510
All of you should do something about that.

179
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,540
It doesn't feel right without it.

180
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,270
I really look forward to it.

181
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,370
Will I be able to guess it?

182
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,610
-The change is too obvious.
-I love quiz!

183
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,740
I love bad jokes.

184
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,610
I even prepared a whiteboard today.

185
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,590
I've been waiting for it!

186
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,130
You are the best, Professor!

187
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,560
Look over here!

188
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,790
I'm looking at you.

189
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,030
-Among these four types of beans,
(1. Soybean 2. Red Bean 3. Broad Bean 4. Snow Pea)

190
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,530
-which one is Lupin's favorite?
(1. Soybean 2. Red Bean 3. Broad Bean 4. Snow Pea)

191
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,240
-Can you guess?
(1. Soybean 2. Red Bean 3. Broad Bean 4. Snow Pea)

192
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,070
(1. Soybean 2. Red Bean 3. Broad Bean 4. Snow Pea)

193
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,670
I'll give you five minutes to think.

194
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,930
(Five Minutes Later)

195
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,070
Do you have the answer?

196
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,870
That was fast.

197
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,610
They are all the same after you eat them.

198
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,410
Genta.

199
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,650
We need to consider the properties of the beans, right?

200
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,650
The answer is broad bean.

201
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,920
Why's that?

202
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,690
Besides broad bean, the other beans are all alkaline.

203
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,090
Only broad bean is acidic, right?

204
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Acidic?

205
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,890
So?

206
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,990
I got it.

207
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,800
Lupin

208
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,700
-III!   -III!
(III and acidic have similar pronunciation in Japanese.)

209
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,470
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

210
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,370
Is this a provocation?

211
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,280
This morning, the famous Italian idol,

212
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,370
Emilio Baretti, has arrived in Japan.

213
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,380
His footsteps can be found all over the world.

214
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,350
I thought I wouldn't see him again.

215
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,420
Amazing!

216
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,350
Emilio is going to hold a concert in Japan,

217
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,290
Conan.

218
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,020
Prince of Music, Emilio Baretti.

219
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,290
He's very famous in Japan too.

220
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,890
My brother is finally here.

221
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,800
Who's your brother?

222
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you see that?

223
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,060
Yes.

224
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,800
Shocking, right?

225
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,270
Yes.

226
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,130
Is she his manager?

227
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,140
Such a beautiful lady, right?

228
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,640
You are right!

229
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,480
Although they are still young, boys will still be boys.

230
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,640
They are losing their mind over a beautiful woman.

231
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,980
No comment.

232
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,650
That's our live broadcast from Haneda Airport.

233
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,060
An extraordinary artist has arrived.

234
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,600
I didn't see it wrongly.

235
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,430
The person I saw just now is Daisuke Jigen.

236
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,340
Even Conan is...

237
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,140
Wait. What?

238
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,180
It's not like that.

239
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,640
He's the worst.

240
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,840
I can't believe that.

241
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,740
Come on.

242
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,510
You were looking at her!

243
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,640
I was not!

244
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,250
This is the diamond that he has mistakenly stolen.

245
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,450
And these are the bullets from the crane he shot at.

246
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,650
Mistakenly stolen? Is that possible?

247
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,230
It was Lupin's doing.

248
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,700
From disguising as Kiddo

249
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,070
and stealing a diamond he's not interested in
to him throwing it into a fisherman's bucket,

250
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,440
we can be sure

251
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,970
that he was challenging us.

252
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,430
Challenging us.

253
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,180
I'm just kidding. That was not his plan.

254
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,010
He was just fooling around like usual,

255
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,550
Inspector Zenigata?

256
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,210
His target this time

257
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,380
-is the well-known Cherry Sapphire.
-He's from the ICPO...

258
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,390
You know him right, Takagi?

259
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,550
The only inspector

260
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,060
in the ICPO who is solely in charge of arresting Lupin III.

261
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,720
Hello, I am Zenigata.

262
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,560
Inspector.

263
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,330
Does Lupin always fool around like that?

264
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,300
Yes.

265
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,600
You should just treat this incident as a normal occurrence.

266
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,500
How do you determine

267
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,770
that the Cherry Sapphire is his real target?

268
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,640
That's right. Maybe he's just fooling around again.

269
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,810
He sent me a mail.

270
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,740
He sent you a mail?

271
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,910
Yes. But I can't reply to it.

272
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,180
They are pen pals?

273
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,690
Do you want to see it?

274
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,090
-I do.
-I do.

275
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,950
Please control yourself.

276
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,790
Inspector Megure.

277
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,120
Can I borrow someone from here?

278
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,820
I don't mind, but I don't know if they'll be fit for the job.

279
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,060
Fit for the job?

280
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,160
Are you saying that we can join the operation to arrest Lupin?

281
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,100
This is supposed to be Division 2's mission.

282
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,270
Inspector Nakamori is still in suspension.

283
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,110
It's because of the mess he had caused in Tsukishima.

284
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,800
Then...

285
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,710
As an exception, someone from Division 1...

286
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,050
Me!

287
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,410
Me, too!

288
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,890
I never thought

289
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,690
that I would be lucky enough to participate in
the operation to arrest Lupin.

290
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,090
Lupin III is Detective Sato's first love.

291
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,150
Takagi.

292
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,600
I see. That's why you were the first to raise your hand.

293
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,860
That's not the reason.

294
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,330
I didn't volunteer for this out of selfish gain.

295
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,390
It doesn't matter.

296
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm sure you don't want your first love

297
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,980
to be arrested by other people.

298
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,270
I'll look forward to your performance.

299
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,970
Inspector Zenigata,

300
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,570
I will do my best.

301
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,750
I'm in love with Lupin as well in a way.

302
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,890
This is so funny. How could someone park his car here?

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,330
I'll teach him a lesson about the consequences
of provoking the Traffic Division.

304
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,800
Why can't we verify his plate number?

305
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,570
Looks like it's not a simple fake license plate.

306
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,440
Maybe the car belongs to a criminal organization.

307
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,310
It has a suspicious aura.

308
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,570
I don't think people say that anymore.

309
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,700
Really?

310
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,970
You parked your car here?

311
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,490
Yes.

312
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,060
-It is Interpol's official car.
(Visit the Traffic Division on 2F!)

313
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,190
-Our Traffic Division doesn't care about that.
(Visit the Traffic Division on 2F!)

314
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,090
-I'm sure this is Miyamoto and Miike's doing.
(Visit the Traffic Division on 2F!)

315
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,200
-I'll go to the Traffic Division now!
-(Visit the Traffic Division on 2F!)

316
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,700
-Looks like I've been fined.
-(Visit the Traffic Division on 2F!)

317
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,630
Sonoko.

318
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,670
Hello. What is it?

319
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,930
-The TV? Right now?
-Welcome to Japan.

320
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,740
-Do you like any Japanese food?
-Yes. I'm watching it.

321
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,570
Natto.

322
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,270
Let's meet him after school tomorrow.

323
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,970
Yes. Emilio. In the flesh.

324
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,650
I know which hotel he's staying at.

325
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,120
Really?

326
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,780
How did you find that out?

327
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,260
I just made a good use of the intelligence network
of my family's company.

328
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,690
It was a piece of cake.

329
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,530
Really? But isn't that personal information?

330
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,500
No problem. Okay. I'll meet you there.

331
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,170
Okay. See you tomorrow.

332
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,700
The manager looks really pretty.

333
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,040
What are you talking about?

334
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,770
I can't believe Sonoko.

335
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,610
We could have discussed homework tomorrow.

336
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,310
You found a way to meet Emilio?

337
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,210
I can't believe you.

338
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,880
Such a beauty!

339
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,980
He's on the same level as Genta and the others.

340
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,910
I'm coming with you, too!

341
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,930
Is that really necessary?

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,990
He often escapes in a helicopter.

343
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,730
So, we are going to shoot it down?

344
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,800
Is this really okay?

345
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,210
Maybe we should move it...

346
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,880
I think it's better to keep it here.

347
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,420
The more times we relocate it,

348
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,480
the more chances for Lupin to steal it.

349
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,210
You are good.

350
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,090
Both of you. Follow me to the vault.

351
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,990
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

352
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,080
I'll come with you.

353
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,790
This is the vault?

354
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,630
Have you contacted the owner of the sapphire?

355
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,530
Yes.

356
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,130
We had suggested him to relocate it elsewhere.

357
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,940
But Mr. Eishin Wakagomo...

358
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,240
There's no need to do that.

359
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,180
I trust our police.

360
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,740
Looks like you are well-trusted.

361
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,650
We have to arrest him!

362
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,880
Leave it to us.

363
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,180
Am I right, Detective Sato?

364
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,120
Calm down.

365
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,990
All of you!

366
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,420
Let's be united and do our best together!

367
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,590
-Yes!
-Yes!

368
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,160
This is so embarrassing. Please calm down.

369
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,620
Five more minutes until Lupin's

370
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,630
showtime.

371
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,930
All streets are in lockdown.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
No vehicles will be allowed to pass from now on.

373
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,400
All of you should change
your communication frequency to channel B

374
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,700
except the security personnel inside the bank.

375
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,010
Has Lupin ever been unpunctual before?

376
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,180
No.

377
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,450
In other words, there's only one minute left.

378
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,250
He must be nearby then.

379
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,090
Yes.

380
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,220
He might have disguised himself
as someone else to enter this place.

381
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,890
Who?

382
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,160
Detective Sato, don't do this!

383
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,130
Don't move. I'll shoot.

384
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,100
He won't disguise himself as a human.

385
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,970
He can disguise himself as non-human things?

386
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,700
He can do that?

387
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,610
For instance, that vault door might be him in disguise.

388
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,150
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,420
I just wanted to ease the tension here.

390
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,050
I wanted to see if I could make you laugh.

391
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,360
It's already after 1 pm.

392
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,800
Nothing happened.

393
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,030
Has he changed his plan because the security is too tight?

394
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,400
He'll never give up on a target.

395
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,140
That's Lupin III.

396
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,510
So, Lupin

397
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,570
is already inside the vault?

398
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,810
It's showed in movies.

399
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,410
The story where the thieves dig a tunnel underneath the vault

400
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,010
and transport everything out.

401
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,050
Any CCTV cameras inside?

402
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,180
Privacy is important for Kashi Bank.

403
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,260
As a precaution, open the vault.

404
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,640
Looks like there's no underground tunnel.

405
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,970
I'm so relieved.

406
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,030
But,

407
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,870
maybe the Cherry Sapphire has already been...

408
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,670
Are you saying that it might have been stolen?

409
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,770
How is that possible?

410
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,540
It can't be!

411
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,640
You have both of the keys?

412
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,150
Yes. Mr. Eishin had entrusted them to me.

413
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,760
It's still here. The Cherry Sapphire is safe.

414
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,440
Three minutes have passed.

415
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,870
Could it be

416
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,580
that all of your watches are three minutes ahead?

417
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,680
It's one o'clock right now.

418
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,650
I see now. You did it at that time.

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,310
You disguised as Takagi

420
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,510
and adjusted the time on our watches to three minutes later.

421
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,020
That is correct!

422
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,820
The time is just right.

423
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,760
I'll take this, Old Man.

424
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,200
You need to recharge yourself sometimes.

425
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,940
Goodbye, my first love.

426
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,580
It's so painful.

427
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,850
It's going to be broken.

428
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,680
Luckily, you are always very punctual.

429
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,760
You should be happy to be arrested by a cute lady.

430
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,020
Old Man, you are so cunning.

431
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,830
You know that I won't fight against a woman.

432
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,990
Let me rewind the time back to three minutes earlier.

433
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,360
Lupin III

434
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,930
is arrested

435
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,410
at 1:02 for theft.

436
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,380
Well done.

437
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,240
It's such a waste for you to be just a detective.

438
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,980
Sorry for ruining your good mood.

439
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,810
What are you going to do? I won't hesitate to shoot if you move.

440
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,880
Lupin. She's a mean character.

441
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I pasted a silver sticker on the back of your watch.

442
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,990
Is it still there?

443
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,400
Sticker? It's still here. This is...

444
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,930
The Shocky-Shock Sticker that I've invented.

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,630
It's a little bit stronger than a stun gun.

446
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,110
I'm sorry, Miss.

447
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,370
You can take this back.

448
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,040
Stop right there!

449
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,310
Are you for real, Old Man?

450
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,940
I'll shock you again then.

451
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,650
I'm sorry, Miss.

452
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,490
You are caught up in it, too.

453
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,290
You scoundrel!

454
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,990
Old Man, do you really think you are a zombie?

455
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,860
I don't want to hurt her by shocking you both again.

456
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,730
Goodbye.

457
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,100
Lupin.

458
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,260
You're so scary.

459
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,180
It's Lupin! He's in the vault!

460
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,410
-He has disguised himself as Inspector Zenigata.
(Authorized Personnel Only)

461
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,180
It's Lupin!

462
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,660
-There he is!   -Get him!
-Catch him!

463
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,290
Strike Team!

464
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
Charge!

465
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,770
Yes. Go on in.

466
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,730
I'm not him!

467
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,530
This is so painful! Stop!

468
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,330
Lupin has showed up at the bank!

469
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,870
Lupin...

470
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,640
It's Lupin!

471
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,150
He's the real Lupin!

472
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,590
We've caught the third Lupin.

473
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,320
The fourth Lupin is sitting outside of a tobacco store.

474
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,750
I think he's the fake one.

475
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,690
-I'm from the TV station!
-I can't pull it off.

476
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,820
Central Command.

477
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,560
-Is there a way for us to distinguish him?
-You look very suspicious.

478
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,100
I've found Lupin in Beika Park.

479
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,500
It is attached to me.

480
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,570
They are chasing after someone near Beika Station's north exit!

481
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,580
I don't have any mask left.

482
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,810
Lupin has entered Beika Street.

483
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,870
Send someone to the south entrance!

484
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,780
Sorry for interrupting your shopping time.

485
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,580
Is your business doing well?

486
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,590
What are you...

487
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,610
Is your knife sharp?

488
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,290
You are too slow. I'm talking about the fish.

489
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,590
Take this! Squid! Octopus! Ink!

490
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,460
-Please stand back.   -It's dangerous here.
-It's a terrifying world, right?

491
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,000
-A fiendish is on the run!
-You are so kind.

492
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,470
Would you like to meet my granddaughter?

493
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,630
I have no time to waste.

494
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,870
Darn it!

495
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,880
We are playing right into his hands!

496
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,280
What should we do?

497
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,320
Call for more reinforcements?

498
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,540
We'll do the opposite.

499
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,380
Call it off.

500
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,390
He has already escaped.

501
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,510
Where are you going?

502
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,560
My watch is fried.

503
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,590
I happen to like this watch.

504
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,830
What?

505
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,400
We lost sight of Lupin.

506
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,370
Being a thief is all about legwork.

507
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,940
I'm really addicted to the fun of being chased.

508
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,420
I can't believe that.

509
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,660
If you are not going to use a car or a helicopter,

510
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,020
you'll have to come to Beika Station.

511
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,460
But the police can put the station on lockdown at once.

512
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,290
Moreover, the distance between the bank and the subway station

513
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,670
is too far.

514
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,740
That was what I thought.

515
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,510
But after checking the locations of
the air vents and construction access doors...

516
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,300
Impressive, Miss.

517
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,810
I'm going to fall in love with you.

518
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,920
But you should let me go.

519
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,350
I need this.

520
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,050
Don't go.

521
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,680
We'll play together when you are feeling better.

522
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,030
That tunnel ahead should be connected to the electric company.

523
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,380
-What's wrong?
-Someone is on the railroad 100 meters away from Beika Station.

524
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,320
-Did we go over that person?   - I can't believe this.
-I think we've hit someone.

525
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,800
Are you okay, Detective Sato?

526
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,090
Takagi.

527
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,030
Luckily, I made it in time.

528
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,500
Please. Don't be so reckless.

529
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,300
You sound so arrogant.

530
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,570
I'm not the one who had been subdued by Lupin.

531
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,340
Yes. I'm sorry. I was too careless.

532
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,320
I can't believe you.

533
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,560
I won't leave your side ever again.

534
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,420
Really?

535
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,190
Handcuffs?

536
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,360
You are Lupin, right?

537
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,300
Takagi won't be like this.

538
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,130
You saw right through me.

539
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,470
Stop right there, Lupin!

540
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,580
What's wrong?

541
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,510
Did you hear Detective Sato's voice just now?

542
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,580
You must have heard it wrongly.

543
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,790
I'm sorry that my father is tagging along too.

544
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,850
It's okay.

545
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,890
I'll feel creeped out if he's tagging along to meet Emilio,

546
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,590
but he's here for the manager, right?

547
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,630
It'll be hard not to fall for her.

548
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
We are here.

549
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,600
-Princess Ran.
(Sakurasaku Hotel)

550
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,470
-Don't call me that.
(Sakurasaku Hotel)

551
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,380
(Sakurasaku Hotel)

552
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,460
So nostalgic.

553
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,200
Actually, it hasn't been that long.

554
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,110
You are right.

555
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,340
Wait here. I'll get the manager.

556
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,710
You'll go and get her?

557
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,710
I'm the one who perfectly solved the attempted murder
of the princess of Vespania Kingdom,

558
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,080
the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

559
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,090
Uncle, what are you doing?

560
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,150
I'm sure my assistant has made an appointment.

561
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,250
Assistant?

562
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,880
What is he doing?

563
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,050
As if it would mean something to them.

564
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,290
But looks like it works.

565
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,930
I'll take it.

566
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,700
Detective Mouri, let's talk elsewhere.

567
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,600
This way please.

568
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,800
Okay.

569
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,770
What is going on?

570
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
What is going on?

571
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,270
What is going on?

572
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,040
What is going on?

573
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,940
Let's go.

574
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,410
Okay.

575
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,380
Wait for me.

576
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
I don't care about Interpol.

577
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,150
A violation is still a violation.

578
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,490
No matter who he is, he still has to pay for the tow-away fee.

579
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,720
It's the country's important source of income.

580
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,780
He should fetch the car himself.

581
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,690
I might put a dent on the car.

582
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,930
The key is inside the car, right?

583
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,660
I heard that it's in the visor.

584
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,830
Does he think this is Europe?

585
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,300
Senpai, Detective Takagi is in the backseat.

586
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,030
What? How did that happen?

587
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,630
What are you doing here?

588
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,370
I'm all tied up.

589
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,110
Everyone is waiting for you in the conference room.

590
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,410
Sorry for making them wait.

591
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,150
I feel bad.

592
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,190
Go left after you exit from the elevator.

593
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,160
Okay.

594
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,530
This is the one.

595
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,530
So nostalgic.

596
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,460
Excuse me.

597
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,760
Dad, you need to knock first.

598
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,240
What's the result?

599
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,530
Nothing.

600
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,370
Inspector Shiratori?

601
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,940
Mouri?

602
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,880
Inspector. Why are you here?

603
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,970
Hello.

604
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,280
Is he here?

605
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,380
Inspector Megure, who are they?

606
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,650
Don't worry. He is...

607
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,690
The greatest detective in Japan,

608
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,780
Kogoro Mouri, at your service.

609
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,950
Hello, Miss.

610
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,290
H-Hello.

611
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,890
What?

612
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,790
Sorry for that.

613
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,960
I am his daughter, Ran Mouri.

614
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,370
I am his assistant, Sonoko Suzuki.

615
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,800
You can just call me Sonoko.

616
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,630
They are all the same.

617
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,400
Since Inspector Megure and the others are here, it means...

618
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,870
I get it now. The receptionist who knows Uncle Mouri

619
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,440
brought us here because he mistakenly
thinks that he's here for the case.

620
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,370
Did something happen?

621
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,920
Not here.

622
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,950
Inspector Megure.

623
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,820
Takagi is found unharmed.

624
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,320
But the Cherry Sapphire...

625
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,490
Lupin?

626
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,940
Lupin.

627
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,570
Fujiko.

628
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,440
I was worried about you.

629
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,070
Are you okay?

630
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,670
I'm fine. But I was terrified.

631
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,810
They've put such an ugly necklace on you.

632
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,420
You have really bad taste.

633
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,190
Let's get this over with.

634
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,360
Give it to Fujiko.

635
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,020
You are so impatient.

636
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,720
You don't like to chat?

637
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,900
Why are you like this?

638
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,700
I won't pull out a gun.

639
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,570
Can't you read the situation? I can't believe this.

640
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,610
Forget about the box.

641
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,400
I just want the Cherry Sapphire inside.

642
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,470
I can't believe you. Why are you doing this?

643
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,640
Looks like there's no trick.

644
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,250
I'm sorry.

645
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,310
You are indeed working together.

646
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,380
It looks real, right?

647
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,920
But it's fake. One more thing.

648
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,230
I'm sorry, but I can't hand this to you.

649
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,290
Okay?

650
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,030
Drop your weapons.

651
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,040
That's Fujiko for you.

652
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,570
I really want to say that.

653
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,110
But you've made a mistake this time.

654
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,640
What do you mean?

655
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,380
No matter what it looks like, it's a real bomb.

656
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,810
You are lying to me.

657
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,940
How could you trick a weak woman? How terrible!

658
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,950
Take it since you want it so much.

659
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,010
What are we going to do next?

660
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,660
You want to see my head being blown off from my body?

661
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,530
Although my taste is being judged,

662
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,130
this is considered a done deal.

663
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,100
I will deactivate the bomb

664
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,070
as soon as my safety is secure.

665
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,670
Of course. If I find out that it's a counterfeit...

666
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,370
Don't worry. It's a real one.

667
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,910
What else?

668
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,970
Don't tell me that this is another test.

669
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,990
No. This is the last one.

670
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,480
You can have that SUV.

671
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,050
The coat inside is a present for you.

672
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,180
Thank you.

673
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,990
I think we won't

674
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,590
see each other again.

675
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,100
(1F Exit of Sakurasaku Hotel)

676
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
He is the promoter of the concert in Japan,

677
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,700
Mr. Carnevale Luciano.

678
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,640
Hello.

679
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,570
And she is...

680
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,080
I am Claudia Belucci.

681
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,210
I am Emilio's manager.

682
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,350
I know that.

683
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,010
We are all gathered here because...

684
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:15,950
Inspector.

685
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,550
Is it fine to just disclose it?

686
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,990
Although Mr. Mouri looks like this,

687
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,920
you can trust him.

688
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,820
The first sentence is unnecessary.

689
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,260
I believe that I can be useful to you.

690
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,460
Well,

691
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,770
this morning, I received this letter addressed to Emilio.

692
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,570
This is...

693
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,210
This is...

694
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,750
What is

695
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,910
written on it?

696
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,960
You had created such a suspense.

697
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,750
But it turns out you can't read it at all.

698
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,730
That's typical of him.

699
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,530
They are newspaper cut-outs. Is it written in Italian?

700
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,810
Cancel the concert at once. Or else,

701
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,610
Emilio will die.

702
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,240
I can't believe this!

703
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,970
A threat letter?

704
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,710
He will die?

705
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,150
Who else has touched this letter?

706
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,190
I didn't touch it.

707
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,690
Emilio and I have touched it.

708
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,990
If we find fingerprints that are not yours,

709
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,860
those must be the culprit's fingerprints.

710
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,760
If the culprit left his fingerprints on the threat letter,

711
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,670
it would be easy for us.

712
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,760
Let's cancel it.

713
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,560
I don't want to die!

714
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,230
We can just cancel the concert, right?

715
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,040
Calm down, Emilio.

716
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,480
We can't just cancel it so easily.

717
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,850
We've invested a lot of money into this concert in Japan.

718
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,480
We even rushed Touto Stadium to complete their reconstruction.

719
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,950
Moreover, all of the tickets are sold out.

720
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,490
We can't just cancel it now.

721
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,490
You know that, right?

722
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,820
Please, Lupin.

723
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,890
Or else, this necklace will explode.

724
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,570
Take this job if you love me.

725
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,870
Enough. Stop mocking me.

726
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,500
I know that I brought this on myself.

727
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,240
No. What I'm angry about is what you said next.

728
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,880
Forget it then. I'll ask Kiddo for help.

729
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,810
That was because...

730
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,120
Do you really understand?

731
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,090
Understand what?

732
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,120
There's only one person in this world

733
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,520
who can protect you.

734
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,030
Who is it?

735
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,390
Lupin.

736
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,760
That's right! Let's go on a recline!

737
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,890
No.

738
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,260
Why?

739
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,310
Run away now. Or else...

740
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,640
Wouldn't it be great if I could go to the afterlife

741
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,440
with you?

742
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,210
That man.

743
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,050
How dare he tricked me.

744
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,420
I'll make him pay.

745
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,920
Fujiko, give me back my clothes.

746
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,890
Are you sure we should deactivate it?

747
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,070
If we kill that woman,

748
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,840
Lupin will be hot on our tails.

749
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,670
We can't let that happen now.

750
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,510
For my country, I have to get it.

751
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Mr. Emilio's stay in this hotel

752
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,390
is not announced to public.

753
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,020
Only the staff of the concert and some of the hotel personnel

754
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,990
know about this.

755
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,390
But we can't eliminate the possibility of outsiders, too.

756
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,260
His hardcore fans will do everything they can

757
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,300
to find out where he stays.

758
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,900
Although this might be a prank,

759
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,000
I'll send some undercover police to guard your safety.

760
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,240
We'll observe first.

761
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,940
I know who's the culprit.

762
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,880
Really, Mouri?

763
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,710
Yes. The person who sent the threat letter is

764
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,720
Lupin III.

765
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,010
Lupin?

766
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,110
Lupin?

767
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,920
Are you for real?

768
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,720
He's the thief

769
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,420
who had disrupted the city two days ago.

770
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,760
He put in so much effort to steal the jewel

771
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,260
and threw it away after that.

772
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,960
It was probably not good enough for him.

773
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,330
Just now, you received a call about

774
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,930
another jewel being stolen by Lupin, right? Shiratori.

775
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,670
What happened to him? He's so sharp today.

776
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,310
We did receive a report just now.

777
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,840
How is that related to this threat letter?

778
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,650
The reason Lupin

779
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,560
stole the precious jewel and wanted
the concert to be canceled is...

780
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,090
What's the reason?

781
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,320
Claudia-san.

782
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,320
He wants to

783
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,800
give that jewel to you when you are down.

784
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,270
Give her the jewel?

785
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,970
That's right! He's trying to pursue you!

786
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,530
It's too dangerous here. Please stay with me for your safety.

787
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,780
Emilio.

788
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,840
Don't worry. I won't leave my room.

789
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,990
I haven't gotten his signature.

790
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,490
Let's go back, Sonoko.

791
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,520
Now is not the time to ask for his signature.

792
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,830
Conan, let's go.

793
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,390
Okay.

794
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,900
What about your father?

795
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,020
It'll be impossible to move him when he's like that.

796
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,970
You are right.

797
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,130
Anyway, I'll send someone to guard this floor.

798
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,730
I think they'll be fine.

799
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,710
They already have a reliable bodyguard.

800
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,340
How do you know, little boy?

801
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,180
I saw him on TV.

802
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,340
Conan.

803
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,650
Coming.

804
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,410
A reliable bodyguard?

805
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,180
I heard that with his military education,
he tripled the military power of a country.

806
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,490
He's an instructor with charisma.

807
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,390
Papa is so amazing.

808
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,390
We'll get going now.

809
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,800
There's a dessert cafe downstairs, right?

810
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,890
Yes. You have a sharp eye.

811
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,800
We should visit it before we go back.

812
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,800
Sure.

813
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,350
I think it's above the lobby.

814
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,110
Yes.

815
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,420
Huh? Where's Conan?

816
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,490
Hurry up! Or we'll leave you behind, you brat!

817
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,120
Please don't leave me behind.

818
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,930
Let's have fun together.

819
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,400
Wait, but...

820
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,340
You look so handsome, brat.

821
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,270
Sonoko, that's not it.

822
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,170
This is a miracle!

823
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,770
Sonoko!

824
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,740
(Smoking Area)

825
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,950
Wait for a moment.

826
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,090
I'm in

827
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,560
the embrace of Emilio now.

828
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,260
And we are running together.

829
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,600
Wait. Please wait.

830
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,500
Stop right now.

831
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,700
I'm sorry.

832
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,310
Listen to me, Sonoko. Think about it carefully.

833
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,510
Aren't you going to check on me first?

834
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,670
We have to go back.

835
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,840
He can't leave this place.

836
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,650
Why?

837
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,380
What do you mean why? He received a threat letter.

838
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,550
If something happens to Emilio...

839
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,820
It's obviously just a prank.

840
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,260
How can you be so sure?

841
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,660
The letter stated that he'll die.

842
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,860
I didn't see it.

843
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,260
Stop fooling around.

844
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,420
You defeated the strongest guards in the Vespania Kingdom, right?

845
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,900
Don't exaggerate.

846
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,910
At any rate, no one within this 10 km can defeat you.

847
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,370
Sonoko.

848
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,340
There! Let's go there!

849
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,140
Okay! We can go anywhere you want.

850
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,510
We'll definitely

851
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,550
get lectured for this!

852
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,340
Do you want to pollute your clean lungs?

853
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,770
This is the only place where you can
smoke and drink at the same time in this hotel.

854
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,480
Fine. You win, great detective.

855
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,850
Excuse me, this place is...

856
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,110
I'm here to get my Papa.

857
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,660
I see. Do you want a glass of juice?

858
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,590
Give me a cup of ice coffee.

859
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,420
Right away.

860
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,200
What is it?

861
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,830
You are not the only one who drinks ice coffee

862
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,490
throughout the four seasons.

863
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,900
Why are you in this city?

864
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,940
You are back to being Shinichi Kudo.

865
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,130
Sorry for the wait.

866
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,670
Please try out this lemon pie too.

867
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,340
Thank you.

868
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,210
Looks like it's quite hard for you too.

869
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,220
Scoundrel.

870
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,520
Your pet phrase is "scoundrel"?

871
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,890
Another phrase is, "I need to use the toilet".

872
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,390
Why do you have a memo of me?

873
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,290
If you go to the toilet so often at this young age,

874
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,530
you should get it checked out.

875
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,070
You know that's not the reason.

876
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,000
Do you get it now?

877
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,900
Adults are scary.

878
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,130
You are threatening me.

879
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,370
Don't worry.

880
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,210
Everything will be peaceful as long as you stay out of it.

881
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,220
Don't you have this in your memo?

882
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,350
Threatening me will only spur me on.

883
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,610
You are so annoying.

884
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,460
I'll take the pie.

885
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,490
You called me "Papa" just now, right?

886
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,720
You are so slow.

887
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,370
It's me.

888
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,730
What is it, Ran-neechan?

889
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,130
Emilio is gone?

890
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,290
You are with Emilio?

891
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,440
Why aren't you with him?

892
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,340
Sonoko is with me too.

893
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,000
Everyone is looking for him.

894
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,940
We'll go back after we visit the tower.
Tell my father and the others...

895
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,910
Okay. I'll be keeping this for you.

896
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,850
No. Give it back to me.

897
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,040
Wait...

898
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,980
Looks like you are having fun.

899
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,590
Okay. I got it.

900
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,620
The call that you were on...

901
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,720
This is delicious.

902
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,190
Looks like they are with Emilio.

903
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,170
I think so.

904
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,760
Where are they?

905
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,070
I don't know.

906
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,200
Now is the time to talk like an adult.

907
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,260
I have to go now.

908
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,700
Fine.

909
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,940
I'll tear this memo to pieces.

910
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,510
Look. I throw it away.

911
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,840
You should stick close to Papa, right?

912
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,350
It's going up so quickly!

913
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,820
This is amazing.

914
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,860
Can we really do this?

915
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,420
What was the bodyguard doing?

916
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,190
It's pointless to play the blaming game now.

917
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,500
Let's start with the places nearby.

918
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,470
The police have left, right?

919
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,060
Yes, but that detective is still here.

920
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,610
Has he left to search for him?

921
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,510
Yes.

922
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,740
What a useless bodyguard!

923
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,280
Sorry about that,

924
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,810
but I'll have to leave after this is done.

925
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,090
If it's in the hotel, it'll be around here.

926
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,670
What a beautiful sunset!

927
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,340
With a handsome man!

928
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,800
Ran. You look so scary.

929
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,470
This won't do. Everyone looks suspicious.

930
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,650
Let's go back.

931
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,120
Although it's not that possible,

932
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,420
I should check here too.

933
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,740
Even the shoes are altered.

934
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,280
It's me.

935
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,720
You are right. It's not in the hotel.

936
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,120
I think it's hidden in the concert's equipment.

937
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,530
What are you doing?

938
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,230
You have to ask?

939
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,360
Didn't I tell you to go to the tower first?

940
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,570
I want to go with Papa.

941
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,800
You liar.

942
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,940
Will the bodyguard be in charge of the spare key?

943
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,410
I didn't steal anything. The police have no reason to arrest me.

944
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,750
Having a gun with you will be a good enough reason.

945
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,220
Since I'm your Papa, let me give you a piece of advice.

946
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:10,230
This has nothing to do with you.
How about you turn a blind eye to this?

947
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,430
Answer me.

948
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,530
No.

949
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,530
Onee-san.

950
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,370
What is it, little boy?

951
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,770
Do you have any newspapers in Italian?

952
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,940
I'm sorry. We only provide newspapers in English here.

953
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:28,940
Do you need it now?

954
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,980
No. It's okay. Thank you.

955
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,750
Excuse me.

956
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,090
What is it, darling?

957
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,760
-I need to go there.
(Men's Restroom)

958
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,960
-Go ahead.
(Men's Restroom)

959
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,670
You are slow to call.

960
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,970
What do you mean?

961
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,970
Yes.

962
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,940
I've heard about Lupin's theft.

963
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,840
He stole the Cherry Sapphire

964
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,640
that was originally kept in the vault
of Kashi Bank, a bank in Touto.

965
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,580
Anything special about that jewel?

966
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,120
No. It's nothing special.

967
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,210
I can't find any clues on the internet, either.

968
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,480
But Lupin went as far as sending an advanced notice.

969
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,180
I got it. It's about the owner of the jewel.

970
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,830
Bingo.

971
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,200
Finally, you've caught up to Kojima and the others.

972
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,860
Caught up? Don't tell me that they are investigating it, too?

973
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,070
They are very serious about it. More than ever.

974
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,040
They've been investigating all
the vacant buildings, bushes, and basements

975
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,040
in the city since this morning.

976
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,340
Are they trying to locate Lupin's secret hideout?

977
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,610
If they could find it, we wouldn't need the police.

978
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,840
They found it.

979
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,780
Really?

980
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,410
The owner of Cherry Sapphire, Eishin Wakagomo.

981
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,860
Will someone rich enough to rent a vault

982
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,090
live in an abandoned repair shop?

983
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,660
Furthermore, the shutters at the entrance were recently renewed.

984
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,200
They are already so far into it?

985
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,400
The professor is excited, too.

986
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,370
Professor.

987
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,840
I can't stop them by myself.

988
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,070
This is too dangerous.

989
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,170
Don't let them leave the house before I get there!

990
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,580
This is too much.

991
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,350
After we capture Lupin, let's travel to Hawaii!

992
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,880
-Great!
-Great!

993
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:15,920
Impossible.

994
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,550
We'll be featured on TV, right?

995
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,080
What is it?

996
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,350
I forgot to tell you what I needed you to search for me.

997
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,660
Emilio's manager and promoter.

998
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,960
Okay.

999
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,060
Okay. I'll check on it.

1000
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,100
What are you planning...

1001
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,730
How rude!

1002
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,700
Have you found him?

1003
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,540
No.

1004
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,670
Has he gone down?

1005
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,370
He pretended to enter the restroom.

1006
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,680
And I didn't take my eyes off the restroom after that.

1007
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,720
He had planned to ditch us since the beginning.

1008
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,770
Why?

1009
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,880
I don't know. But we have to find him first.

1010
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:49,820
Okay.

1011
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,050
(Do Not Enter)

1012
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,090
Was it really Emilio?

1013
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,290
What?

1014
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,330
He's not here.

1015
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,330
I'm sure it was him.

1016
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,530
Will he come here all by himself?

1017
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,430
You saw Emilio?

1018
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,900
Who are you?

1019
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,030
I'm a member of his Japan Tour staff.

1020
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,130
It was really him.

1021
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,730
You are so cute.

1022
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,180
After hearing that, I went to take an autograph board.

1023
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,940
During working hours?

1024
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,480
Miss.

1025
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,510
You can't enter!

1026
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,550
Get the chief.

1027
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,920
You are so slow.

1028
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:29,990
I'm sorry.

1029
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,360
I need to buy a ticket.

1030
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:32,860
Here you go.

1031
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,800
You are so kind.

1032
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:36,030
Don't mock me.

1033
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,690
What are you doing, Emilio?

1034
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,660
Ran-san.

1035
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,350
You can't come here.

1036
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,620
Please. Stop fooling around.

1037
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,560
Don't come here!

1038
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,190
Tell me. Why are you doing this?

1039
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,000
I hate the concert.

1040
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,570
Is that so? You are exhausted.

1041
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,840
It's okay. You can take a good rest.

1042
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,680
Impossible!

1043
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,620
As long as I'm alive, the concert won't be canceled.

1044
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,550
How is this possible?

1045
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,490
This is not right.

1046
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,790
How can a concert be more important than a person's life?

1047
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,760
If they are not willing to cancel it,

1048
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,430
I'll...

1049
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,600
Anyway, I beg you. Please come back here!

1050
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,710
We are the only ones here.

1051
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,280
We are the only ones who will go up at this time.

1052
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,050
Are they still up there?

1053
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,450
They didn't tell me that they'd gone down.

1054
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,350
Do you have

1055
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,610
a secret hideout in this city?

1056
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,780
Don't think that I'll answer you just because you talk like a kid.

1057
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,020
You do have a hideout.

1058
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,060
How do you come to that conclusion?

1059
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,790
You can't do this.

1060
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,470
Please. Tell me

1061
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,500
about everything.

1062
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,100
I...

1063
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,040
Emilio.

1064
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,860
Hold on to me!

1065
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,730
Ran-san, I...

1066
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,570
I'm fine.

1067
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,770
Can you reach there with your feet?

1068
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,940
Yes.

1069
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,850
Ran!

1070
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,890
Sonoko.

1071
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,860
Don't make such a pathetic sound.

1072
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,520
Ran Mouri is an incredible person.

1073
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,860
I'll pull you up in one go!

1074
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,000
Ready...

1075
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,710
No!

1076
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,050
It's dangerous.

1077
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,220
Sonoko?

1078
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:50,990
Ran!

1079
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,460
Uncle, can you open up a hole here?

1080
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,120
The lady who is hanging here?

1081
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,830
Yes.

1082
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,600
How thick is this?

1083
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:59,570
Two 10mm glass panels.

1084
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,430
How big do you want it to be?

1085
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,400
Big enough for me to fit.

1086
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,800
It'll take 12 shots.

1087
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,820
Ran, don't let go of Emilio's hand!

1088
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,790
I'm going to slap him

1089
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,320
for putting my best friend through this.

1090
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,920
Who does he think he is?

1091
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:26,760
I'm going to beat him into a pulp!

1092
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,200
Sonoko.

1093
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:30,930
Is this enough?

1094
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,100
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

1095
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,240
Wait...

1096
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:41,780
I think I'm out of strength.

1097
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,640
Ran!

1098
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,710
Ran!

1099
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,010
Ran-neechan!

1100
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,440
Brat!

1101
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,850
Conan-kun.

1102
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,500
Thank you, Conan-kun.

1103
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,400
You are amazing!

1104
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,030
You are amazing, brat!

1105
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,510
I'll give you a hug later!

1106
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,310
I'll pass.

1107
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,250
Sir, what are you doing?

1108
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,050
What am I doing?

1109
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,310
Saving someone's life.

1110
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,450
They are fine. Don't worry.

1111
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,360
Not only you put yourself in danger,

1112
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,300
you even dragged other people into it.

1113
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,340
Do you know how serious this is?

1114
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,200
Please think about it carefully.

1115
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:54,210
Are you willing to help us?

1116
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:59,790
Don't worry. I won't cancel the concert.

1117
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,320
That's good.

1118
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:06,750
The idol working for you is such a showoff.

1119
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,430
If he attracts too much attention,

1120
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,160
I'm afraid that it'll obstruct our transaction.

1121
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,400
Did you call just to talk about this?

1122
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,840
It is an unnecessary risk.

1123
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,610
Yes. Let's stick to the time and place we said earlier.

1124
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,410
Does Claudia-san know about it, too?

1125
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,510
Yes.

1126
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,410
She's willing to help him despite knowing it since the beginning.

1127
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,950
A secret transaction of what?

1128
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,320
I don't know.

1129
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,630
While we are doing our live performance on the stage,

1130
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,570
I'm sure that during that time...

1131
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,000
It happened after Luciano became the promoter, right?

1132
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,060
Yes.

1133
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,440
And then, everything changed.

1134
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,540
No matter it's the song, the stage

1135
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,370
or the attitude of the TV stations towards us.

1136
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,540
At first, they wouldn't even listen to our demo tapes.

1137
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,320
But the one who has changed the most

1138
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,350
is Claudia.

1139
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,310
She's happier than anyone else.

1140
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,490
She loves my songs more than anyone.

1141
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,420
You thought that the transaction will fall through

1142
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,720
if the live concert is canceled.

1143
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,460
I'm really sorry.

1144
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,990
I didn't mean to jump down.

1145
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,590
I had misunderstood you.

1146
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,430
I'm sorry for hitting you.

1147
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,440
I understand.

1148
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:26,100
You were mad because you cared about me.

1149
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,710
I'm sorry that I forgot to give this back to you.

1150
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,080
Yeah.

1151
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,880
Dad.

1152
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,880
Hello?

1153
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,350
Yes. I know.

1154
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,640
He's with me now.

1155
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,060
Don't shout so loudly.

1156
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,220
Look at this piece of paper.

1157
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,590
I found it in your room.

1158
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,890
Why would it be in my room?

1159
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,730
Don't try to hide it.

1160
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,100
There's no Italian newspaper in that hotel.

1161
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,470
Claudia-san could read the content of the letter

1162
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,600
without any difficulties.

1163
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,610
So, it means

1164
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,740
that this "K" is not from the letter.

1165
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,080
You are right.

1166
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,210
If it fell out when the letter was opened,

1167
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,450
everyone would notice it.

1168
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,450
There are faint cutting marks on the table.

1169
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,960
You used a cutter to cut them out, right?

1170
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,650
We don't typically use the letter "K" in the Italian language.

1171
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,890
I can destroy the evidence,

1172
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,900
right?

1173
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:26,090
Luxury hotels won't throw away the trash so quickly.

1174
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,400
When you go back, you have to hide
the cutter and the newspaper.

1175
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,600
I even threw away the glue.

1176
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,840
Police in Japan are very good in their job.

1177
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,780
You were acting like this at the tower, too.

1178
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,580
Who are you?

1179
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,050
Conan Edogawa.

1180
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,140
I'm a detective.

1181
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,150
Is that your catchphrase?

1182
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,650
I'll copy it.

1183
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,490
You are really amazing.

1184
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,420
A lot of your fans are waiting for you.

1185
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,760
Make the live concert a success.

1186
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,830
I'll stop the transaction.

1187
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,430
And I'll arrest all of the bad guys.

1188
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,200
I've been searching a long time for you.

1189
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,240
How can you be out here at this time?

1190
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,980
Do you know how worried I was?

1191
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,750
Do you know how much trouble you had caused?

1192
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,560
Thank you.

1193
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,120
I don't know what would happen if it weren't for you, Mr. Mouri.

1194
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,420
Don't mention it.

1195
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,360
Tracking people down is a basic requirement in this line of job.

1196
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,590
Emilio.

1197
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,660
Not everyone will be able to put up with your antics...

1198
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,670
I'm sorry.

1199
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:39,030
I'm too excited to be in Japan.

1200
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,370
I'm reflecting on myself.

1201
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,710
Forgive me, Claudia.

1202
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,240
I'll do my best in the concert.
I'll prove that I'm being serious.

1203
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,980
I'll give you the best performance, Luciano.

1204
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,620
I'm going to the staff room.

1205
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,920
You have a stage rehearsal tomorrow.

1206
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,160
I want to apologize to the staff for my action first.

1207
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,090
Yes. You should do that.

1208
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,910
Mr. Mouri.

1209
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,110
What did you say to Emilio?

1210
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,480
Just some common knowledge on how to be an adult.

1211
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,550
It's me.

1212
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,450
You better abandon your hideout.

1213
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,020
Those friends of that brat

1214
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,220
might be knocking on your door soon.

1215
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:39,230
How should I handle that when it happens?

1216
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,600
Their phones are all turned off.

1217
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,930
Are they there?

1218
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,530
They said that they would sleep earlier for the big day tomorrow.

1219
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,600
Professor is soundly asleep.

1220
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,640
Don't tell me that...

1221
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,080
Yes. You are right.

1222
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,410
That brat is pointing his finger at me.

1223
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,610
Don't tell me that...

1224
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,880
Yes.

1225
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,890
(It's your responsibility!)

1226
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,920
We really admire you.

1227
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:04,820
Welcome to Japan.

1228
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,260
I'm so touched.

1229
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,200
Here's a gift for you.

1230
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,490
Please accept it.

1231
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,700
It's delicious.

1232
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,600
We didn't add anything weird inside.

1233
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,400
Don't be shy.

1234
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,340
Thank you for your kindness.

1235
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,900
Listen. We'll follow the plan.

1236
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,310
When he falls asleep...

1237
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,640
We'll tie him up.

1238
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,870
We'll tie him up tightly.

1239
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,150
Then, we'll...

1240
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,510
(The Outstanding Detective Boys!)
(Special Edition: Lupin Was Arrested)

1241
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,710
(Inspector Zenigata is shocked. "I admit defeat.")

1242
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,820
Let me give you some tea.

1243
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,460
They are asleep?

1244
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,030
They didn't suspect anything.

1245
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,670
Why did I have to hide?

1246
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,640
Don't drink anything from a stranger.

1247
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,940
You call yourself detectives?

1248
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,010
Let's check their personal belongings now.

1249
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,010
Are you going to strip a little girl?

1250
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,110
Don't make it sound so despicable.

1251
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,010
Fujiko.

1252
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,380
It's a pity. But this is it.

1253
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,160
Thanks to you, the bodyguard has been fired.

1254
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,530
There's no need for me to hang out with you anymore.

1255
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,360
Bye.

1256
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,230
You are going to do terrible things to my friends!

1257
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,460
Let's see how long you can cry.

1258
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,910
Don't think that I'll fall for you every time.

1259
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,200
I am an adult.

1260
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,480
A thief!

1261
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:31,640
Hey!

1262
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,210
Don't shout that! I'll unconsciously react to it!

1263
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,150
Look at this.

1264
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,820
The information about Luciano is here.

1265
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:38,720
Are you listening to me?

1266
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,650
The Italian Mafia?

1267
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,950
According to the information from the HQ,

1268
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:46,260
they are going to make a huge transaction in Japan.

1269
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,820
And this is related to Lupin?

1270
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,870
I think so.

1271
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:53,030
It's rare to hear Inspector Zenigata being so unsure.

1272
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,500
Is something bothering you?

1273
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,440
This sounds too petty for him.

1274
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,870
Does he want the jewel?

1275
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,240
Or does he want to ruin this transaction?

1276
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,710
This is not his usual modus operandi, right?

1277
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,410
He is not the type of target that he'll be interested in.

1278
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,080
He has a type?

1279
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,620
How's your case?

1280
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,250
I've done investigating it.

1281
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,380
But it's pointless.

1282
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,050
Pointless?

1283
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,720
They are not going to file a report.

1284
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,850
Something is not right since the beginning.

1285
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,300
Why will someone take the initiative to call the police

1286
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,560
when they'll be doing an illegal transaction?

1287
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,200
Someone among them is trying to rebel.

1288
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,870
Let's investigate.

1289
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,070
What are those? Toys?

1290
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,270
Everything here is not ordinary.

1291
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,810
They are the works of a brilliant man.

1292
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,610
He must not be a good man

1293
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,590
to give these things to kids.

1294
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,420
Fujiko, what are you doing?

1295
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,350
Fleeing at night?

1296
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,330
What am I doing? I'm going to take them down.

1297
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,990
You are so vicious.

1298
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,030
It's too dangerous to go alone.

1299
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,960
Did I say I would be going alone?

1300
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,970
More friends?

1301
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,060
It's set.

1302
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,730
Where are your friends from?

1303
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,770
Everywhere.

1304
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,470
It'll be the beginning of another world war.

1305
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,070
Don't worry. I won't ruin your plan.

1306
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,710
Besides, I've told my friends.

1307
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,270
Only normal weapons are allowed.

1308
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,550
How can we not worry?

1309
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,060
Have you found out who he really is?

1310
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,850
I said that I wouldn't ruin your plan.

1311
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,690
Fujiko!

1312
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,290
Put the kids into the car.

1313
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,800
I'll take them back.

1314
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,260
You are going somewhere else?

1315
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:33,560
I can't possibly hide in such a dirty place.

1316
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,130
I'm just here to get the weapons.

1317
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,660
We'll do this then.

1318
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,910
We'll steal the thing as you wish.

1319
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,380
During the live concert?

1320
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,500
Yes.

1321
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,570
After relaying this to Zenigata and the police,

1322
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,170
you should stay out of this.

1323
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,050
This is as far as your detective work can go.

1324
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,310
This is my second advice.

1325
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,290
There won't be a third time.

1326
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,150
I said that I'll stop the transaction.

1327
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,490
I promised him that.

1328
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,030
Relay this to Lupin.

1329
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,210
Goodnight.

1330
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,640
Fujiko Mine.

1331
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,750
How should I deal with these kids?

1332
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,820
They might catch a cold if I leave them outside, right?

1333
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,090
So, let's have a deal.

1334
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,260
Will you promise to come with me?

1335
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,610
(Emilio's Japan Tour's Concert!)

1336
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,640
(Vespania Kingdom's ore is stolen?)

1337
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,880
Prince of Music, Emilio Baretti!

1338
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,940
Finally, we can hear his singing voice today.

1339
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,020
Okay.

1340
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,420
Okay. Next, let's interview his fans
who have been lining up since last night.

1341
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,860
They chose such a crowded place

1342
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,230
for their transaction.

1343
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,200
They are smart.

1344
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,760
When the concert starts,

1345
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,500
everyone's attention will be concentrated on the stage.

1346
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:18,470
I heard that Luciano

1347
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,940
had requested for the stadium to be reconstructed.

1348
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,810
The resting room of the music band

1349
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,940
and the lift under the stage

1350
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,380
will be empty when the concert starts.

1351
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,150
How about hacking into the stadium's CCTV system?

1352
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,780
I've had it covered.

1353
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,050
Do you know how dangerous it was?

1354
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,860
If they weren't sleeping pills, you would've died!

1355
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:39,860
I can't believe you.

1356
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,790
How could you leave me behind?

1357
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,030
Professor!

1358
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,200
I'm sorry.

1359
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:47,200
I'll think of a way to find Haibara.

1360
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,670
Okay.

1361
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,970
You are all grounded!

1362
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,070
Okay.

1363
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,740
We were right.

1364
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,710
We won't let him stop us.

1365
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,080
Haibara has successfully infiltrated the enemy's camp.

1366
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,580
Conan will be shocked.

1367
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,320
We'll depart as soon as we get the green light from Haibara.

1368
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,250
-Okay!
-Okay!

1369
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,680
I can't believe them.

1370
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,520
Hello?

1371
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,490
I'm fine.

1372
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,560
It's very comfortable here.

1373
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,630
Yes. I won't tell them about the real location.

1374
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,870
I'm sorry. They won't listen to...

1375
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,170
What? Are you talking to that boy?

1376
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,610
Let me talk to him.

1377
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,940
Long time no see since our last meeting in the submarine...

1378
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:31,500
He hung up.

1379
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,070
Why?

1380
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,780
The past is too painful for him.

1381
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,340
What? I didn't do anything bad.

1382
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,110
What are you doing?

1383
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:40,820
You are so cute.

1384
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,150
Even your breasts have shrunk?

1385
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,390
Or were they already like that when you were still Sherry?

1386
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,450
You know that's impossible.

1387
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,290
I used to have...

1388
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:53,430
No. I can't fall into her trap.

1389
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,930
How about you work with me to complete that drug?

1390
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,470
The APTX of your dream.

1391
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,210
What are you going to do with it?

1392
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,180
Of course, I'll first make myself younger.

1393
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,780
Eternal youth is every woman's dream.

1394
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,850
It'll be hot-selling and I'll earn a lot.

1395
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,290
What a disappointment!

1396
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,730
I didn't create the drug with this in mind,

1397
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,420
You weren't like this in the past, right?

1398
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,970
You did as you please

1399
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:27,000
and wrapped all the men around your little finger
with your feminine charm.

1400
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,400
You marched forward with courage
until you got what you wanted.

1401
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,410
A female thief who never looked back.

1402
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,840
When a woman starts worrying about her youth,

1403
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,370
it'll be the end for her.

1404
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,910
Right, Fujiko Mine?

1405
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,450
Yes.

1406
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,690
It's too soft here.

1407
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,420
More mist in front!

1408
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:48,620
Okay!

1409
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:50,790
This is great.

1410
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,920
That staff are more united as usual.

1411
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,730
Everyone is affected by Emilio's spirit.

1412
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,660
After this, we'll go back to Europe

1413
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,260
to get some rest.

1414
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,800
Are you going to do the transaction in this room?

1415
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,770
What is it?

1416
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,440
Are you suddenly interested in it?

1417
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:14,680
Or is it because of the useless sense of justice again?

1418
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,250
Mr. Mouri.

1419
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,120
I'm sorry

1420
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,920
for troubling such a busy detective like you.

1421
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,150
Don't worry about it.

1422
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,960
I choose which case to take on based on
my personal sense of value.

1423
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,530
The concert will take place tomorrow.

1424
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,070
I'm sure you can't sleep tonight.

1425
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:34,800
This is now out of my hand.

1426
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,270
I just need to have some drinks and sleep.

1427
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,900
Thanks to a reliable bodyguard that I have now.

1428
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,340
Just leave this to me, Claudia-san.

1429
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,040
Claudia?

1430
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,010
I said it wrongly.

1431
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,040
I will do my best to protect Emilio.

1432
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,590
Claudia-san.

1433
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,590
Ran-san.

1434
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,560
You are still worried?

1435
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,060
Yes.

1436
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,590
I won't be able to stop worrying until the seats

1437
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,960
are full of audience.

1438
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,940
The tickets are all sold out.

1439
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,340
Even now, I'll still dream about

1440
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,000
an empty stadium.

1441
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,310
And I'm the only one running around.

1442
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,900
Running around?

1443
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,640
I'll sit on every seat

1444
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,480
and pretend that I'm the audience.

1445
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,450
Because I don't want to let Emilio know.

1446
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,250
It's just a dream.

1447
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,550
It used to be a reality.

1448
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,250
Look.

1449
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:33,790
She's distributing the feedback forms and
the advertisements about the next concert on each seat.

1450
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,330
That used to be my job.

1451
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,630
He had performed in a place that could hold less than 30 people.

1452
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,070
It must be hard, right?

1453
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:44,900
It was.

1454
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,540
Because I didn't have the money.

1455
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,310
I felt bad for being so useless.

1456
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:54,510
I couldn't do anything for Emilio.

1457
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,950
Claudia-san.

1458
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,580
Welcome.

1459
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,510
Everything is still the same.

1460
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,280
Everything that you asked for is ready.

1461
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,850
Including an unused Walther?

1462
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,550
The grip and the spring of the trigger are all custom-made.

1463
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:37,920
It's very light.

1464
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,060
You are still as good as usual.

1465
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,620
Your pay is in that case.

1466
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,130
About the pay,

1467
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,330
you should talk to the client inside first.

1468
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,170
I see. No wonder I didn't notice anything.

1469
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,640
I'm not a monster.

1470
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,010
Why are you still in Japan?

1471
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,250
You already have the sapphire, don't you?

1472
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,620
You are indeed King. You know everything.

1473
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,050
Your every move

1474
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,890
is broadcasted all over the world beyond this industry.

1475
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,190
Why are you here?

1476
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,900
A first-class ticket back to Naples.

1477
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,430
Can you take this and go back?

1478
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,700
Is this a prank show?

1479
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,260
There are no cameras.

1480
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,570
You should stay out of Luciano's business.

1481
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,570
I know this is against the rule.

1482
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,080
But I have no choice.

1483
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,840
I don't want to ruin our friendship.

1484
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,980
Because of a woman?

1485
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,050
A boy.

1486
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,120
Did you screw up?

1487
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,520
It's not like what you think it is.

1488
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,160
Even if it's true,

1489
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,920
I won't call it a "screw up".

1490
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,760
Of course you won't do this for free.

1491
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,060
What is this?

1492
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,660
Yoko Okino's untouched photos.

1493
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,670
What...

1494
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,200
Plus

1495
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:58,700
Fujiko's naked photos.

1496
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,570
Good.

1497
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,910
Everyone, let's start!

1498
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,310
I have to use the toilet.

1499
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,620

We didn't even see you entering the underground parking lot.

1533
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,140
We've been fooled.

1534
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,080
There's a road right beside here.

1535
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,340
Wait.

1536
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,220
What about the CCTV cameras of the outdoor parking lot?

1537
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,120
That place...

1538
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,490
No. I can barely see your car.

1539
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,860
If we check the recorded footage,

1540
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:01,190
we may find out where he went.

1541
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,860
At that time,

1542
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,090
the cars that had passed that place...

1543
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,200
That is

1544
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,900
Conan?

1545
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,030
What?

1546
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,440
He's not picking up.

1547
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,770
Is he always like this?

1548
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,050
He's more excited than usual.

1549
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:27,250
Am I the only one who feels that way?

1550
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,350
Where are you going?

1551
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:33,490
Use science and technology to track him down.

1552
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,460
Meanwhile,

1553
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:38,160
I'll track him down with my intuition.

1554
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,770
Really? Looks like he had found out a long time ago.

1555
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,470
Emilio trusts you a lot.

1556
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:55,380
He hopes that you won't hold the candle to the devil anymore.

1557
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,110
-Let me take a look.
(Reimbursement Form)

1558
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,820
-Twenty radishes, a box of cabbage.
(Accounting Department)

1559
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,380
He even broke the cashier.

1560
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,180
Hello?

1561
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,530
What do you need from the foolish Takagi
who is suspended and being asked to take care of

1562
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,590
the reimbursement forms because
he failed miserably during the operation to arrest Lupin?

1563
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,930
Of course, I'm already done with my letter of repentance.

1564
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,270
What are you talking about?

1565
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,140
Is Detective Takagi there?

1566
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,330
It's you.

1567
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,500
What is it?

1568
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,080
A new batch of reimbursement forms is here.

1569
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,750
I'm sorry. I'll leave the rest to you!

1570
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:27,910
Wait!

1571
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,110
You can't do this.

1572
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,350
We can only count on Detective Takagi at times like this.

1573
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,050
Only he will believe us.

1574
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,350
I can't believe Ai-chan.

1575
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,190
How could she tell us the fake location?

1576
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,730
Maybe she had to

1577
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,130
tell us the fake location because she was threatened.

1578
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,860
Let's go and save her!

1579
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:47,400
Conan said that he'd find a way.

1580
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,470
Let's meet up with Detective Takagi first.

1581
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,200
Let's arrest them all!

1582
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:53,140
Yes!

1583
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,740
What is it?

1584
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:00,750
You are using my laptop.

1585
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,810
Giving fake information to your companions?

1586
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,220
I can't put them in danger.

1587
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,650
It means that you are good at betrayal?

1588
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,350
Just like how you betrayed your previous organization.

1589
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,390
But, don't worry about it.

1590
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,660
Betrayal is a woman's accessory.

1591
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,190
You are going out?

1592
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,670
You can go back now.

1593
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,670
As a female thief who wraps men around her little finger,

1594
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,470
I can't forgive men who tricked me.

1595
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:28,840
Do you want to tag along?

1596
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,440
It'll be dangerous.

1597
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:34,780
(Old Haneda Airport Maintenance Facility)

1598
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,420
This is our first time meeting each other.

1599
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,420
Nice to meet you, Mr. Luciano.

1600
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:45,020
I am Alan Smithee.

1601
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,490
Alan Smithee?

1602
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,260
That is his transaction partner?

1603
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,060
Luciano had only mentioned it once.

1604
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:54,530
Did he tell you about the location?

1605
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:00,070
He had never once revealed it to me.

1606
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,980
I see.

1607
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,750
You managed to bring it here in the disguise of an equipment.

1608
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:10,270
And we didn't pass this through Japan's customs.

1609
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:13,250
Even if they check the equipment now,

1610
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,520
they won't find anything suspicious about it.

1611
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,230
This is...

1612
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:23,690
keyboard?

1613
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,090
What you want is

1614
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,360
this one.

1615
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,300
You can do whatever you want with it.

1616
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:34,000
I have the promised good, too.

1617
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:40,010
This is the Cherry Sapphire I promised you.

1618
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,850
Sapphire?

1619
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,940
Why are you giving me that?

1620
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:44,580
Are you joking?

1621
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:45,790
What are you talking about?

1622
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,620
I can't believe you.

1623
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,590
You are hiding in such a secluded place.

1624
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,720
It took me a lot of effort to find you.

1625
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,530
What?

1626
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,610
I once told you that

1627
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,310
I'll arrest you the next time I see you.

1628
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,480
How arrogant!

1629
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,820
Didn't Papa tell you to stop playing as a detective?

1630
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:25,950
I can't believe it.

1631
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,660
You betrayed me.

1632
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:29,960
You fired me.

1633
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,870
A special last chance for you.

1634
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:36,270
I can let you go if you stop now.

1635
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,460
Scoundrel.

1636
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,770
I won't let you go so easily.

1637
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,240
You've never fired a gun, right?

1638
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,810
Unfortunately for you,

1639
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,110
I had plenty of training in Hawaii's shooting range.

1640
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,670
How dare you tricked me.

1641
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,450
What is that jewel supposed to mean?

1642
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,150
Looks like we've been set up.

1643
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,720
Do you know Kein Gejidasu?

1644
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,020
Kein? Who is he?

1645
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,720
I don't know him.

1646
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,300
My mistake.

1647
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,530
Kein Gejidasu.

1648
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,870
Have you figured it out, Detective Otaku?

1649
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:12,770
Good job at locating this place.

1650
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,310
Do you want to know how?

1651
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:15,810
Later.

1652
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,610
It doesn't matter. Kill them all.

1653
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,950
It's your turn.

1654
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:29,750
Secret skill! Cyclone Return!

1655
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:36,020
Goemon, you are making it even more dangerous.

1656
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,090
This skill has not matured enough yet.

1657
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:39,200
Don't reflect now.

1658
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,030
You are in the way!

1659
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,610
I've cut down petty things.

1660
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,190
You are in my way!

1661
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,960
Lupin! I'll arrest you!

1662
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,690
The brake is not working!

1663
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:14,020
-Don't move.
-This is the end!

1664
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,470
More reinforcements?

1665
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:21,830
You are amazing, Jigen. Your shooting skills have improved.

1666
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,140
It was not me.

1667
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,250
Not me, either.

1668
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:27,840
I've figured as much. Who was it then?

1669
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,240
Freeze.

1670
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,050
I got you, Lupin.

1671
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,960
I'm with the FBI, Jodie Starling.

1672
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,620
You better give up.

1673
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:44,600
Gunfight at Haneda Airport?

1674
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,430
Speaking of the old maintenance facility,

1675
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,160
it's an airstrip for private jets, too.

1676
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,170
Are they planning to fly away?

1677
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:53,540
Area A, B and C are all clear.

1678
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:57,570
He's our opponent. Don't let your guard down.

1679
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:01,110
Why is the FBI here, too?

1680
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,480
I contacted them.

1681
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:07,780
I won't barge into such a dangerous area without a plan.

1682
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,050
Darn it, I don't have a clear shot.

1683
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,960
He purposely stands in front of me.

1684
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:15,290
We had once caused a scene in Japan.

1685
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,420
It's a good deal to hand you, an international fugitive,

1686
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,990
over to Japan's police and have them owe us a favor.

1687
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:25,510
Jodie, cuff him.

1688
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:26,400
Got you.

1689
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,770
Don't do anything funny.

1690
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,040
Okay.

1691
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:31,710
Wait.

1692
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:34,150
Don't touch him carelessly.

1693
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,410
You don't know what mechanism he has on his body.

1694
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:39,110
You brat.

1695
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,920
Put your hands behind your head and kneel down.

1696
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:43,920
Okay.

1697
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:48,300
Let's put him to sleep first.

1698
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,930
What an annoying brat.

1699
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,070
You!

1700
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:09,910
Stop!

1701
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,590
Go ahead and shoot me.

1702
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:19,420
But, even if my brain splatters to the ground,

1703
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:23,160
I'll still pull the trigger.

1704
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,170
Please give me the case.

1705
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,170
Take it.

1706
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,530
Don't make a move.

1707
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,670
Can you stay away from me?

1708
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,680
Don't force me to shoot this kid!

1709
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:42,480
Okay. Calm down, everyone.

1710
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,910
This is a great chance, right? Brat.

1711
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,590
Alan-san, we agreed on the payment.

1712
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,750
Money for the goods.

1713
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,060
Pilot, can you hear me?

1714
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:56,720
Yes.

1715
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,460
Start the engine. Get ready to take off.

1716
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,160
Roger that.

1717
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,260
Take the case. The money is inside.

1718
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,360
Bring the car here.

1719
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,600
Yes, sir.

1720
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,540
I'm Sato. I'll reach there in three minutes.

1721
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:13,100
Please open the gate.

1722
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,410
What are you doing, Takagi?

1723
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,310
This is bad.

1724
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,650
Professor, you can't lose.

1725
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,420
They are going to overtake us!

1726
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,890
We have Detective Takagi with us!

1727
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:23,820
Let's go.

1728
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:24,880
No. This...

1729
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,190
This is bad.

1730
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,660
Please make way.

1731
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,330
Where's your car?

1732
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,500
We didn't drive a car here

1733
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,160
because we needed to be stealthy.

1734
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,360
We've already contacted the helicopter.

1735
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,310
He'll get away.

1736
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:46,250
They are targeting us, right?

1737
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,180
Put down the gun. They won't shoot.

1738
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,050
Drive.

1739
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,410
Just take off. Ignore the control tower.

1740
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,030
My beloved Alfa Romeo.

1741
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,990
What should we do? Chase after them on foot?

1742
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,050
Even if you ask me...

1743
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,290
Lupin.

1744
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,900
Fujiko.

1745
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:05,590
Who is she?

1746
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:06,660
Fujiko Mine.

1747
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:10,400
Bust 99, waist 55, hip, 88.

1748
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:13,960
She's one of the international fugitives too.

1749
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,310
Is it over?

1750
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:20,080
No. We are just getting started.

1751
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,050
Lupin and FBI.

1752
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,030
Both of them ceased fire because of you.

1753
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,360
Brat, who are you?

1754
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,740
Why am I the one who's holding the handles?

1755
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,610
Do you want to be in charge of the shooting?

1756
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,480
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

1757
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,410
Wait, Fujiko.

1758
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,150
The brat is on the plane too.

1759
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,650
Who cares?

1760
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,980
If you plan to shoot him down too,

1761
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,990
I'll let go of my hands now.

1762
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:06,760
Will you share the secret of the drug with me?

1763
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,790
Okay.

1764
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:11,360
I won't use this then.

1765
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,570
You just threw it away.

1766
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,930
Let's use these. Speed up.

1767
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:16,730
Change the gear!

1768
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,440
Oh my.

1769
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:21,170
Sherry. Don't tell me that...

1770
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,870
I used to ride a Harley, too.

1771
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,810
Any problem?

1772
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,440
Keep an eye on that boy.

1773
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,510
Okay.

1774
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,080
Okay. Take off now.

1775
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,850
The control tower is babbling away.

1776
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,650
GB27, stop the plane right now!

1777
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,160
A plane is approaching the airstrip.

1778
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:43,760
-JNA301, do not land first!
-GB27!

1779
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,900
Are you thinking about...

1780
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:53,870
I'll stop it even if I have to crash into it.

1781
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,170
I shouldn't have followed her.

1782
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,280
V1 (Take-Off Decision Speed).

1783
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,280
Take off.

1784
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:06,120
Get ready to jump.

1785
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,630
Gear up.

1786
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:27,400
Gear up.

1787
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,800
JNA pilot, can you hear me?

1788
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:33,480
Don't change your course. We'll change ours.

1789
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,920
Send an ambulance to the old maintenance facility at once.

1790
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:45,550
We have a lot of casualties.

1791
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,630
Why won't you allow us to go in?

1792
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,190
Looks like we can't do anything about it.

1793
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,100
We have a detective here.

1794
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,690
Please don't shout.

1795
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:56,140
-Scold them, Takagi.
-Thank goodness you are fine, Ai-chan.

1796
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,830
-How can I...
-Show them your badge!

1797
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:01,640
Are you saying that Conan is up there?

1798
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:07,900
So painful. Does he know how to fly a plane?

1799
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:11,780
That's right. I almost fell off.

1800
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:12,680
What?

1801
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:21,020
You tricked all of us, brat.

1802
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,230
Such an elaborate strategy.

1803
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,860
What is your plan?

1804
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,590
What?

1805
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,830
Stop acting dumb.

1806
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:32,200
No one was dead from that crazy gunfight.

1807
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:37,080
You deployed the FBI too, right?

1808
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,610
You took into account the power balance

1809
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,150
and made sure that no shots are fatal.

1810
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,010
How troublesome!

1811
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,680
If you had let them killed each other,

1812
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,850
the case would be solved.

1813
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,590
That was your plan, right?

1814
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:53,290
Yes. Everything was going so smoothly.

1815
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,330
Do you want me to take care of the ending, too?

1816
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,960
Don't hate me

1817
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,160
if your dream doesn't come true.

1818
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:03,790
Finally, we got it. Captain.

1819
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:04,840
Yes.

1820
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:07,810
Now, Gillanba can continue to fight.

1821
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:23,580
You have such a hard skull.

1822
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,120
Idiot!

1823
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,700
Give up. This is his fate.

1824
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,450
I don't consider this as getting even.

1825
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,850
Okay now. I can smell the ocean.

1826
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,790
I wouldn't be surprised if we crashed.

1827
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,690
We have to thank the pilot.

1828
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:06,090
You managed to stabilize the plane in this condition.

1829
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,160
Let me take over now.

1830
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,760
The throttle is okay.

1831
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:15,500
It'll be hard to control the tail.

1832
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:17,770
I got it. Brat.

1833
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,350
Oil pressure is zero.

1834
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:22,080
This plane has a sub system, right?

1835
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,280
I'm surprised.

1836
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:27,520
Who are you?

1837
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:29,580
Stop talking.

1838
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:30,920
Shinichi Kudo.

1839
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,550
A high-school detective.

1840
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,550
A high schooler?

1841
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:43,440
Your future is limitless.

1842
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:49,510
My country has many young men, too.

1843
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:52,510
His country

1844
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,850
is being treated as a colony by his neighboring country

1845
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,750
with overwhelming military force.

1846
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:01,460
What's his real name?

1847
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,920
Alan Smithee is just an alias, right?

1848
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,190
It doesn't matter.

1849
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,050
Just think of him as Alan Smithee.

1850
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,930
Shoot it down?

1851
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,490
It's a demand from Gillanba's ambassador.

1852
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:13,360
Like I said,

1853
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,270
that boy is on the plane, too!

1854
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,970
Please connect me to Superintendent Matsumoto!

1855
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,240
I plan to fly to Hachijo Island.

1856
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:27,650
How about you go back to Haneda and turn yourself in?
The FBI is there too.

1857
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,050
Nonsense.

1858
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:33,320
If you shoot me, the plane will crash.

1859
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,620
I can handle it myself.

1860
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:36,590
It's not that easy.

1861
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,350
Even I am piloting this plane with my seat belt on.

1862
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:41,420
Hurry up and fix the communication panel and radar.

1863
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,490
Okay.

1864
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,060
After I fix them,

1865
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:47,620
are you going to contact Vespania?

1866
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:52,270
That sounds interesting.

1867
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:54,130
When did you find out?

1868
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:57,770
I figured it out quite early on that the transaction would

1869
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,110
involve the Vespanian ore.

1870
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,450
And Daisuke Jigen was holding dowsing rods

1871
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,920
in the hotel.

1872
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:06,520
He planned to use them to locate

1873
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:08,280
the Vespanian ore, right?

1874
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,120
He showed it to me in Vespania before.

1875
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:13,090
He really likes to show off.

1876
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,430
You can't be sure that it is
the Vespanian ore just with that, right?

1877
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,730
When they

1878
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:19,660
opened the case,

1879
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:22,400
you did a test to confirm it, right?

1880
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,030
Who did it? And how?

1881
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,840
Jigen was blasting the microwave towards it.

1882
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,440
And it turned dark although the quantity was small.

1883
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:33,640
Do you want to hear from the start?

1884
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,480
Sure.

1885
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:38,550
This might be your last deduction.

1886
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,050
It's not a deduction at all.

1887
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,150
It was just a child's play.

1888
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,720
The one who kept the Cherry Sapphire in the bank

1889
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,760
was Eishin Wakagomo.

1890
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,920
And for the person who was mentioned
during the transaction just now...

1891
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,800
Do you know Kein Gejidasu?

1892
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,200
Kein? Who is he?

1893
01:32:57,410 --> 01:33:00,200
Eishin Wakagomo is Goemon Ishikawa's anagram.

1894
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,900
And Kein Gejidasu is Daisuke Jigen's anagram.

1895
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:07,640
You could've done better.

1896
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,410
The people who figured Eishin Wakagomo out

1897
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,320
were the Detective Boys.

1898
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:15,080
That's why they confidently barged into your secret hideout.

1899
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,920
What a mean critique.

1900
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:20,690
Jigen and Goemon really put a lot of effort into it.

1901
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,850
So, it means that

1902
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:27,490
you purposely stole the Cherry Sapphire from Goemon.

1903
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:28,300
And then,

1904
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:31,170
Daisuke Jigen who disguised as Kein Gejidasu

1905
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,170
proposed a transaction to Alan on one condition,

1906
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,500
the Cherry Sapphire.

1907
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,440
He even recommended

1908
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:40,140
Lupin III as the best man for the job.

1909
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,980
So, it means that your target

1910
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,110
was never the Cherry Sapphire.

1911
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:45,520
Your target was Alan

1912
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:49,890
who was trying to procure the stolen Vespanian ore.

1913
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:53,890
You wanted to find out who he would buy the ore from

1914
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,060
and steal it back.

1915
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:01,130
If that Cherry Sapphire is yours,

1916
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,330
I'm sure there'll be a tracker on it.

1917
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,770
So, I tracked its radio wave

1918
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,740
to find the location of the transaction.

1919
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,780
By the way, Fujiko Mine didn't work with you

1920
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:13,310
because of the ore, right?

1921
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:17,880
The news about the stolen ore was even posted online.

1922
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,080
Idiot.

1923
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,090
Who will want to

1924
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,150
locate an ore that has no value?

1925
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:28,060
But, you did try to get it back.

1926
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:29,560
Why?

1927
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,600
Who knows? Stop with the guessing game.

1928
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,830
It's because

1929
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:41,170
the Vespanian ore was something that
Queen Sakura had protected at the cost of her life.

1930
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,270
I'm sure the daughter of Queen Sakura

1931
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:48,800
has asked you to do this, right?

1932
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,940
If you could find out earlier that
Luciano was the one who stole the ore,

1933
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,820
you wouldn't have to

1934
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:56,520
cause a scene in Japan, right?

1935
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:00,090
I did it on purpose

1936
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,220
in order to meet the arrogant detective in Japan.

1937
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:07,660
Whatever.

1938
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,870
Okay. You can use it now.

1939
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:11,910
Thank you.

1940
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,270
This is common, right?

1941
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:18,070
Being silenced with death because you know too much.

1942
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:21,170
Image is very important in this world.

1943
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,510
Lupin III would save someone?

1944
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:27,750
You should only joke after you've turned on
the safety lock of the Walther.

1945
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:29,050
What a silly joke.

1946
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:34,730
Eagle one to HQ.

1947
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,530
Please confirm the last code, 1027.

1948
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,330
Last code confirmed.

1949
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:42,260
You have the permission to release the missile.

1950
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:45,310
I repeat, you have the permission to release the missile.

1951
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:47,530
Are you sure the Vespania Kingdom hired you?

1952
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,380
If we can't retrieve the goods...

1953
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:52,610
If that's the case...

1954
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,410
we have to destroy it before it leaves Japan.

1955
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,780
You should've predicted this.

1956
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:00,220
I didn't expect you!

1957
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,590
You disguised as Kiddo.

1958
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,680
How could I sit back and do nothing?

1959
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,350
Don't you have a sense of humor?

1960
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,730
Incoming!

1961
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,060
Full throttle!

1962
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:13,400
We have chaff flares.

1963
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:14,530
Fire!

1964
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,600
This is Gillanba plane!

1965
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:21,540
Calling to Eagle 1 that is attacking us right now!

1966
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:25,080
The target has fired off chaff flares.

1967
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:26,440
Target not hit.

1968
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:30,810
This is a demand from Vespania and Gillanba.

1969
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,910
Use the AAM-5 (Air-to-Air Missile).

1970
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:33,780
Understood.

1971
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:36,190
The next one shot is crucial.

1972
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,990
We can't defend ourselves now.

1973
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,020
That's Cherry Sapphire.

1974
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,830
I carved it out from a stone.

1975
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,020
This...

1976
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:49,430
Don't tell me that the rock you are talking about...

1977
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,030
Yes. It's the same one that was in Fujiko's hand.

1978
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:54,200
That's a Vespanian ore too.

1979
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,640
We have a high-voltage panel in the cargo.

1980
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:58,580
I got it.

1981
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:01,170
Not only it's an invisible shield,

1982
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,080
under high voltage,

1983
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,620
it can disable all electronics.

1984
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:08,680
If it falls into the hands of a military-based country,
the whole world...

1985
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,250
The balance of military power will crumble.

1986
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,620
Is that the one?

1987
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,330
(Danger
High Voltage)

1988
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,060
What's wrong, brat?

1989
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:27,110
Do it now!

1990
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:28,100
This is bad.

1991
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:34,470
They are locking on us!

1992
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,850
Ascend and let it fall!

1993
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,180
That's what you want?

1994
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,960
Hold on, brat!

1995
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,630
Just a little bit more.

1996
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,300
I only have...

1997
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,540
Now!

1998
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:12,880
one chance!

1999
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:25,220
I can't control my jet!

2000
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,430
What's happening?

2001
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,600
Abort mission.

2002
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,760
Eagle 1, do you hear me?

2003
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,100
Abort mission.

2004
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:36,200
There's a civilian on board. Abort mission!

2005
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:40,510
Eagle copy.

2006
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:44,610
But the target is plummeting together with a mysterious light.

2007
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,400
A boat?

2008
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:07,640
This is Eagle 1.

2009
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:09,940
I've spotted a parachute.

2010
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,840
Point 0925. Parachute confirmed.

2011
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:19,120
We are exposed.

2012
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,310
They won't attack us anymore.

2013
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:24,590
It'll be the Marines next, right?

2014
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,460
Together with the FBI.

2015
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:29,050
I didn't go that far.

2016
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,260
No. I can't trust you.

2017
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,460
-Go down, you brat.
-It's painful. Don't do that.

2018
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:34,800
Stop it. My arm is still in pain.

2019
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:36,300
-You are like a squid.
-I'm in pain!

2020
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:55,550
-Encore!
-Emilio!

2021
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,560
Did you see it?

2022
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:59,860
Yes. You are amazing.

2023
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,660
After this,

2024
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,890
will you continue to watch by my side?

2025
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,770
Go back out there.

2026
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:12,330
You belong out there.

2027
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,340
Let's go!

2028
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:22,180
Okay. Really? Great.

2029
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:29,310
Inspector. Thank you for letting me stay until the end.

2030
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:33,150
What are you talking about?

2031
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,090
What?

2032
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,330
In the end, everything has been swallowed by the ocean.

2033
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,330
I hate this kind of ending.

2034
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,130
It feels so bad. You are wearing a cunning smile.

2035
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:50,110
You have the same expression, too.

2036
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:52,240
It'll feel weird when you

2037
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:55,010
do something good for others.

2038
01:40:55,080 --> 01:41:00,110
It's like your heart is being pried open by a thief.

2039
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,450
Idiot.

2040
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:08,520
This submarine...

2041
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,690
Bringing back bad memories?

2042
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,100
How are you lately, little boy?

2043
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:21,440
Did something happen between the two of you?

2044
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,640
I hate narrow space.

2045
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,180
Me, too.

2046
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:28,780
You are indeed tough.

2047
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:31,150
Haibara? You are here, too?

2048
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,950
What does that mean?

2049
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:35,990
If it weren't for me, you would've been
burnt to crisp at Haneda Airport.

2050
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:37,120
That's right.

2051
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:40,320
If she didn't say yes to my request,
I would have fired a rocket at you.

2052
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:41,420
Request?

2053
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,690
What are you talking about?

2054
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,360
Are you going to betray me?

2055
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:49,560
Betrayal is a woman's accessory.

2056
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:50,500
Right?

2057
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:57,810

Thank you, Conan Edogawa.

2067
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:15,960
Although there were a lot of twists and turns,

2068
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:19,100
he still has so many supportive fans.

2069
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:20,470
He'll be fine.

2070
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,210
What are Lupin and the others doing now?

2071
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:26,980
I wouldn't know.

2072
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,010
They must be

2073
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,980
targeting another country's treasure.

2074
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,920
I am a thief.

2075
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:41,120
He's so naive.

2076
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,190
Since I'm here in Japan,

2077
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:46,200
I won't go back empty-handed.

2078
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,930
What is this? Where's the treasure?

2079
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:53,940
The best defense is offense, Kaito Kiddo.

2080
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,470
I'll arrest you, Lupin!

2081
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,440
Is this for real?

2082
01:46:58,510 --> 01:46:59,910
He's running away! Chase after him!

2083
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:01,280
You won't get away!

2084
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:02,610
I didn't steal it!

2085
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,280
Believe me, Old Man!

2086
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:06,680
As if I'll do that!

2087
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:08,520
Darn it!

2088
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:10,650
You better watch out, Kiddo!

2089
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,160
If this is the case...
