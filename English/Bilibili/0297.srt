1
00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:02.824
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:04.524
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:06.024
The truth in this difficult case becomes clear.

4
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.124
Kisaki and Kujo clash in court!

5
00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.724
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:11.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.824
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:44.837
The hot springs.

9
00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.537
I haven't been to one for so long

10
00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:50.937
and the autumn colors must be lovely this time of year.

11
00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:52.237
Yes, that's right!

12
00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:57.037
I think this open air bath would be great!

13
00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:59.937
They say the water here is good for the complexion!

14
00:01:59.937 --> 00:02:05.037
Mom, you need to take off from work once in a while and relax.

15
00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.037
You're right.

16
00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:08.237
Ms. Kuriyama.

17
00:02:08.237 --> 00:02:11.537
How's my schedule for next month?

18
00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:15.237
The conclusion of the trial you're working on now

19
00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:17.137
is slated for next week,

20
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.437
so all you have to do is decide whether you want to take the "duty case".

21
00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:22.237
Oh, that's right. I've forgotten about that.

22
00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:24.037
Can you get me the files on that?

23
00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:25.137
Okay.

24
00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:29.037
What's a "duty case"?

25
00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:31.537
Well... when a person is financially

26
00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:33.837
or otherwise unable to hire a lawyer,

27
00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:36.637
the court appoints one,

28
00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:38.437
but if no one will take the case,

29
00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:41.637
then they'll decide on a "duty" public defender to take the case.

30
00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:43.237
I see.

31
00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:45.237
-Here it is. -Thank you.

32
00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:49.437
I've just taken a fast look

33
00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:52.537
but I don't understand why no one would take this case.

34
00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:56.237
I think this case is defendable.

35
00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:58.937
I guess it's because of the prosecutor

36
00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:00.237
Who would that be?

37
00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:04.037
Ms. Kujo's the prosecutor on this case.

38
00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:08.737
I see.

39
00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:11.137
So it's the prosecution office's Madonna.

40
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:18.437
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 1)"

41
00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:19.937
What are you going to do?

42
00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:23.137
Shall I tell them you're busy and turn them down?

43
00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.737
Excuse me, Ms. Kisaki.

44
00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:29.437
What is the case about?

45
00:03:29.437 --> 00:03:32.037
It happened about a month ago,

46
00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:34.437
an office in a building in Haido was broken into

47
00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:37.437
and the company president was found dead.

48
00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:40.737
From the fingerprints and evidence found in the room,

49
00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:44.837
the defendant, a confirmed criminal with a record, became the suspect.

50
00:03:44.837 --> 00:03:49.537
It sounds like an open and shut case.

51
00:03:49.537 --> 00:03:50.937
Yes, it does.

52
00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:52.937
The defendant has confessed that he broke in

53
00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:54.637
thinking the office was empty

54
00:03:54.637 --> 00:03:59.037
but when the victim found him and they struggled, he hit him.

55
00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:01.937
The problem is the charge on the indictment.

56
00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.537
What's the charge?

57
00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:07.237
He's being indicted for burglary and murder.

58
00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:08.537
Murder?

59
00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:12.237
But this case sounds more like accidental death, doesn't it?

60
00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:13.537
Yes.

61
00:04:13.537 --> 00:04:15.337
I don't think Prosecutor Kujo

62
00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:18.337
would make a mistake as big as this.

63
00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:20.937
Ms. Kuriyama,

64
00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:23.237
I have the prosecutor's report and the deposition

65
00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:25.037
but the crime scene investigation report isn't here,

66
00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:26.737
could you have them send it up?

67
00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:29.237
And I'll need the coroner's report too.

68
00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:30.537
Okay.

69
00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:32.637
Mom.

70
00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:35.237
Sorry, Ran. As you can see,

71
00:04:35.237 --> 00:04:37.437
I won't be able to go to the hot springs with you, maybe another time.

72
00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:38.837
Good grief.

73
00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:42.937
"Tokyo Prison"

74
00:04:42.937 --> 00:04:44.937
Let me ask you one more time.

75
00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:46.737
On the night of the crime,

76
00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:48.137
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -you entered the Otsu Realty Office

77
00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.437
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -on the second floor of the Nomoto Building

78
00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:52.437
by breaking the window.

79
00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:54.337
You searched the office

80
00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:57.637
and then tried to open the safe in the president's office.

81
00:04:57.637 --> 00:05:01.137
But the president, Mr. Otsu, unexpectedly returned to the office,

82
00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:03.737
he saw you

83
00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.637
and you two fought.

84
00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:13.237
You then hit the victim on the head with an ashtray

85
00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:16.237
causing his death.

86
00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:18.437
Is that correct?

87
00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:19.837
Yeah.

88
00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:22.637
What happened to the money that was in the safe?

89
00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:23.937
How should I know?

90
00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:25.637
But according to the employees' statements,

91
00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:30.137
they had just closed a deal and there was 12 million yen in the safe

92
00:05:30.137 --> 00:05:32.037
but it disappeared.

93
00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:35.037
The prosecutor is saying that

94
00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:38.037
you took the money after killing Mr. Otsu

95
00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:41.137
It wasn't me! I'm telling you the truth!

96
00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:44.637
It's true, no money was found in your apartment

97
00:05:44.637 --> 00:05:48.137
but your fingerprints were on the safe

98
00:05:48.137 --> 00:05:51.137
so I don't blame the prosecution for suspecting you, don't you agree?

99
00:05:51.137 --> 00:05:54.537
I really didn't take the money and about that person...

100
00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:56.137
"That person"?

101
00:05:56.137 --> 00:05:58.537
Did you know the victim?

102
00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:10.737
How many times did you hit the victim on the head?

103
00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.037
I don't remember.

104
00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.937
Once? Twice?

105
00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:16.437
I don't remember.

106
00:06:16.437 --> 00:06:20.137
He surprised me when he walked in, my mind went blank.

107
00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:21.937
The coroner's report said

108
00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:25.537
the victim received three blows to the head.

109
00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:29.837
The third blow was the one that killed him.

110
00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:31.637
Striking him once, is understandable

111
00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:33.337
but since there was a second and then a third,

112
00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:36.437
could show intent to commit murder.

113
00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:38.737
I honestly don't remember.

114
00:06:38.737 --> 00:06:40.337
I see.

115
00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:42.537
Well, I'm on your side

116
00:06:42.537 --> 00:06:44.637
so I want you to tell me the truth,

117
00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:49.137
even if it's detrimental to your case, all right?

118
00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:50.937
I just want to make absolutely sure,

119
00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:54.637
are you positive you had no intention of killing the victim?

120
00:06:54.637 --> 00:06:56.237
I'm positive.

121
00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:57.437
All right.

122
00:06:57.437 --> 00:07:01.537
We'll argue our case on that point alone in court.

123
00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:03.537
Thank you.

124
00:07:03.537 --> 00:07:05.737
"Tokyo Courthouse" -The defendant Takashi Inoue,

125
00:07:05.737 --> 00:07:08.137
at approximately 20:30 on the evening of the incident,

126
00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:10.237
broke the window to the Otsu Realty Office

127
00:07:10.237 --> 00:07:12.637
on the second floor of the Nomoto Building

128
00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:15.237
located at 2-9 Haido-cho Sanchome.

129
00:07:15.237 --> 00:07:17.837
While he was ransacking the president, Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu's office,

130
00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:22.337
the victim, Mr. Otsu, returned and saw him.

131
00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:24.237
The defendant then used the weapon he had

132
00:07:24.237 --> 00:07:25.637
to threaten the victim

133
00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:28.637
and forced the victim to open the safe in the office.

134
00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:31.737
The defendant then struck the victim three times

135
00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:35.437
on the back of the head causing the victim's death.

136
00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:39.537
The defendant then escaped with the 12 million yen in cash

137
00:07:39.537 --> 00:07:41.237
which was in the safe.

138
00:07:41.237 --> 00:07:44.437
According to penal code 240,

139
00:07:44.437 --> 00:07:46.337
the prosecution asks the defendant to be sentenced to life imprisonment

140
00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:50.137
for burglary and murder.

141
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.537
Does the defendant have anything to say

142
00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:54.737
regarding the charges the prosecution has just stated?

143
00:07:54.737 --> 00:07:56.737
Do you wish to deny the charges?

144
00:07:56.737 --> 00:08:00.437
I just broke in to rob the place,

145
00:08:00.437 --> 00:08:02.037
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

146
00:08:02.037 --> 00:08:03.537
Your honor!

147
00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:05.537
The defense may speak.

148
00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:08.637
The indictment states my client is guilty of burglary and murder

149
00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:10.537
but my client would like to plead not guilty

150
00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:13.237
to the charge of murder.

151
00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.937
So you're pleading not guilty to burglary and murder, is that correct?

152
00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:18.437
Correct. The defense asks the defendant be charged

153
00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:23.337
under penal code 205, accidental death.

154
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:27.237
The defense is challenging the prosecution's indictment,

155
00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:28.737
do you have anything to say?

156
00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:31.237
Yes, I do.

157
00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:35.137
Could the defendant tell me why he broke into the victim's office?

158
00:08:35.137 --> 00:08:40.037
Well, I was looking for someplace to broke into

159
00:08:40.037 --> 00:08:42.337
and it just caught my eye, that's all.

160
00:08:42.337 --> 00:08:46.137
Then you are claiming it was mere coincidence

161
00:08:46.137 --> 00:08:50.437
that you broke into the victim's office

162
00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:53.237
and that you held no grudge toward Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu, is that correct?

163
00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:54.237
Right.

164
00:08:54.237 --> 00:08:57.937
I wonder what she's trying to get at.

165
00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:02.437
Your honor. The prosecution's line of questioning is unclear!

166
00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:03.937
All right then.

167
00:09:03.937 --> 00:09:07.837
Does the defendant know a woman named Noriko Endo?

168
00:09:09.337 --> 00:09:10.937
Well?

169
00:09:10.937 --> 00:09:14.537
Don't tell me you've forgotten your only daughter's name?

170
00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:17.537
Only daughter?

171
00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:18.837
Here it is!

172
00:09:18.837 --> 00:09:21.937
When he divorced his wife 20 years ago,

173
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:24.337
his daughter was 8 years old.

174
00:09:24.337 --> 00:09:27.337
I wonder what that has to do with the case though.

175
00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:29.237
Aren't you going to answer me?

176
00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:30.937
Objection!

177
00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:35.037
The prosecution is merely trying to confuse the defendant

178
00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:39.637
by mentioning a family member's name!

179
00:09:39.637 --> 00:09:43.737
Does this daughter have anything to do with the case?

180
00:09:43.737 --> 00:09:44.837
Yes.

181
00:09:44.837 --> 00:09:47.337
Noriko Endo runs a pub in another building

182
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.537
the victim's company manages

183
00:09:50.537 --> 00:09:52.837
and there are rumors that she and the victim, Toshiyuki Otsu,

184
00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:56.537
were involved in a personal relationship.

185
00:09:56.537 --> 00:09:59.037
So you are claiming the defendant had a premeditated motive

186
00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:01.437
for breaking into the victim's office, is that correct?

187
00:10:01.437 --> 00:10:02.837
Yes.

188
00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:04.737
We have proof that the defendant held a grudge

189
00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.637
against the victim over his daughter

190
00:10:07.637 --> 00:10:11.437
You're wrong! I don't even know the creep!

191
00:10:11.437 --> 00:10:14.337
Would you like to ask her yourself then?

192
00:10:14.337 --> 00:10:16.837
She's in the gallery,

193
00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:19.537
we can have her take the witness stand if you'd like.

194
00:10:22.637 --> 00:10:24.937
"Noriko Endo (28)" -Dad.

195
00:10:26.037 --> 00:10:27.337
Noriko.

196
00:10:30.637 --> 00:10:34.137
So that's the ace that the Madonna had up her sleeve.

197
00:10:34.137 --> 00:10:35.637
We are prepared to call Ms. Endo

198
00:10:35.637 --> 00:10:38.737
to the witness stand if necessary.

199
00:10:51.637 --> 00:10:55.437
So what the prosecutor said was true?

200
00:10:55.437 --> 00:10:59.837
Yes, that man tricked me.

201
00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:03.037
He told me he'd let me have my own business,

202
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.337
then he used me.

203
00:11:05.337 --> 00:11:07.637
When did you start communicating with your father?

204
00:11:07.637 --> 00:11:11.437
We met two years ago when mother died after an illness,

205
00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:16.137
he'd drop in to my pub every now and then to see me.

206
00:11:16.137 --> 00:11:19.337
And you told him about Mr. Otsu?

207
00:11:20.737 --> 00:11:24.537
He said he'd get him to pay me consolation money.

208
00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:27.737
This case isn't looking too good.

209
00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:28.837
What do you mean?

210
00:11:28.837 --> 00:11:33.437
Well, if you had a motive and struck the victim three times,

211
00:11:33.437 --> 00:11:37.537
no one would believe you didn't mean to kill him.

212
00:11:37.537 --> 00:11:38.937
I see.

213
00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:42.137
One last question and I'd like you to give me an honest answer.

214
00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:46.737
Do you think your father killed Toshiyuki Otsu?

215
00:11:46.737 --> 00:11:49.837
No! He may be a good for nothing thief

216
00:11:49.837 --> 00:11:52.837
but he's not capable of murder!

217
00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.937
I see.

218
00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:59.137
She's going to have it hard this time.

219
00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:18.688
Good grief, dad.

220
00:12:18.688 --> 00:12:20.488
Sleeping again?

221
00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:25.188
I always close my eyes when I'm thinking!

222
00:12:25.188 --> 00:12:27.088
Who says I was sleeping?

223
00:12:27.088 --> 00:12:28.088
I see.

224
00:12:28.088 --> 00:12:32.588
So you must've thought of something that would help mom then!

225
00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:36.688
Well, you see...

226
00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:40.588
It's her fault for taking a case like this in the first place!

227
00:12:40.588 --> 00:12:43.188
The defendant had a motive for committing murder.

228
00:12:43.188 --> 00:12:47.188
Moreover, he left his fingerprints all over the safe's dial.

229
00:12:47.188 --> 00:12:50.088
How in the world can she think she can get him off?

230
00:12:50.088 --> 00:12:54.888
I wonder why his fingerprints were only on the safe's dial though.

231
00:12:54.888 --> 00:12:58.688
Easy, he probably wore gloves when he broke in.

232
00:12:58.688 --> 00:13:04.688
But he couldn't turn the dial with them on so he took them off!

233
00:13:04.688 --> 00:13:06.188
That's when the victim came in,

234
00:13:06.188 --> 00:13:07.388
he hit him over the head with the ashtray.

235
00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:08.388
If that's how it went,

236
00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:11.488
then there should've been fingerprints on the ashtray.

237
00:13:11.488 --> 00:13:14.888
I guess, since he took his gloves off.

238
00:13:14.888 --> 00:13:18.188
But they didn't find any.

239
00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:21.488
Well, he probably wiped them off, that's why!

240
00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:22.588
Give those to me!

241
00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:26.088
Read this part carefully!

242
00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:28.488
It says that there were traces that

243
00:13:28.488 --> 00:13:31.088
it'd been wiped with a cloth containing oil!

244
00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:34.988
Then why didn't he wipe the safe at the same time too?

245
00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:38.188
Well, that's because he'd just killed someone,

246
00:13:38.188 --> 00:13:40.688
he panicked and forgot, he just ran out of there.

247
00:13:40.688 --> 00:13:42.288
I see.

248
00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:45.488
So when did he take the money from the safe?

249
00:13:45.488 --> 00:13:48.988
Well, after he killed the victim, he opened the safe one more time.

250
00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:51.788
But you just said he panicked and ran out of there

251
00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:53.188
Well...

252
00:13:53.188 --> 00:13:56.088
It just doesn't make any sense.

253
00:13:56.088 --> 00:13:57.188
You're stupid!

254
00:13:57.188 --> 00:14:00.688
Criminals aren't logical, that's why!

255
00:14:00.688 --> 00:14:03.488
What's that supposed to mean? You're just making excuses!

256
00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:06.688
Shut up! Kids should mind their own business!

257
00:14:06.688 --> 00:14:09.988
Wait a minute dad, where're you going?

258
00:14:09.988 --> 00:14:12.288
Play "pachinko".

259
00:14:12.288 --> 00:14:13.888
Good grief!

260
00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:17.688
"Things found at the crime scene"

261
00:14:17.688 --> 00:14:18.888
"Glass Ashtray, a pair of army cotton gloves"

262
00:14:18.888 --> 00:14:20.688
"screw for eyeglasses, golf ball"

263
00:14:38.988 --> 00:14:39.988
Oh, Kogoro...

264
00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:41.588
Oh, it's you.

265
00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:43.688
What are you doing here?

266
00:14:43.688 --> 00:14:45.988
I just...

267
00:14:45.988 --> 00:14:49.188
He wanted to see if there was anything he could help you with

268
00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.088
so he came to check the scene of the crime.

269
00:14:51.088 --> 00:14:52.788
Shut up you little brat!

270
00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:54.588
For a famous private detective,

271
00:14:54.588 --> 00:14:56.188
you sure have a lot of free time, don't you?

272
00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:57.688
What did you say?

273
00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.588
Did you come to check the scene too?

274
00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:04.888
That's right. I just got permission from the superintendent.

275
00:15:06.988 --> 00:15:08.988
"Takuya Akiyama (56), Superintendent" -Sorry to keep you waiting.

276
00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:10.688
Follow me, it's this way.

277
00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:16.488
Were you the first one to discover the body?

278
00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:17.988
That's right, kid.

279
00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:21.088
Could you tell me about it in detail?

280
00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:24.488
At about 9 that night,

281
00:15:24.488 --> 00:15:28.288
I was watching a baseball game on TV.

282
00:15:31.988 --> 00:15:33.288
Why Mr. Arima?

283
00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:36.488
Did you see the president?

284
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:41.488
No, nobody was in the office when I made my rounds at 8 pm.

285
00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:42.788
That's strange.

286
00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:44.688
When he left my place a little while ago,

287
00:15:44.688 --> 00:15:46.988
he said he was coming back here.

288
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:49.788
Then he must've come in through the emergency exit.

289
00:15:49.788 --> 00:15:52.788
But his office door's locked

290
00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:55.388
and I called but there was no answer.

291
00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:58.388
Maybe he's at the back, in his office.

292
00:15:58.388 --> 00:16:01.188
He forgot his glasses, so I came to give them to him.

293
00:16:01.188 --> 00:16:04.388
I hate to ask but can you come with me and open the door?

294
00:16:04.388 --> 00:16:05.888
Sure.

295
00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:11.988
Mr. Arima is Mr. Otsu's son-in-law, isn't he?

296
00:16:11.988 --> 00:16:16.088
Yes, he runs an Italian restaurant in the neighborhood.

297
00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:19.488
And this door was locked, you say?

298
00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:23.688
Yes. I used this spare key to get in.

299
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:34.688
It doesn't look like he's here after all.

300
00:16:37.488 --> 00:16:39.688
Father, are you in there?

301
00:16:39.688 --> 00:16:42.588
It's me, Masahiko.

302
00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:44.588
That's strange.

303
00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:46.388
What's this? There's somebody inside!

304
00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:52.888
This is bad!

305
00:16:52.888 --> 00:16:54.088
What is it?

306
00:16:54.088 --> 00:16:56.388
Somebody's getting beaten up in there!

307
00:16:56.388 --> 00:16:58.288
What?

308
00:16:58.288 --> 00:17:00.188
The key! Open this door!

309
00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:02.688
Only Mr. Otsu has the key to this office!

310
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.788
Darn it! Get out of the way!

311
00:17:08.588 --> 00:17:09.688
Father!

312
00:17:11.088 --> 00:17:13.788
Father, please hang in there!

313
00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:15.888
Mr. Akiyama, call an ambulance!

314
00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.088
Oh, right!

315
00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:26.888
Is that the office where it happened?

316
00:17:26.888 --> 00:17:29.888
Yes.

317
00:17:29.888 --> 00:17:32.988
Hey, this door's locked.

318
00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:36.188
Mr. Arima has the key to that room.

319
00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:38.188
There he is!

320
00:17:38.188 --> 00:17:41.788
Mr. Arima, this is Ms. Kisaki,

321
00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:43.488
the lawyer I told you about on the telephone.

322
00:17:43.488 --> 00:17:45.788
And I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

323
00:17:45.788 --> 00:17:48.388
"Masahiko Arima (35)" -You're that famous detective!

324
00:17:48.388 --> 00:17:50.088
Yes, I suppose so.

325
00:17:50.088 --> 00:17:52.988
Mr. Arima, I'm sorry we had to bother you at work.

326
00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:56.488
We'd like to take a look around your father-in-law's office.

327
00:17:56.488 --> 00:17:59.488
Isn't anybody using this office?

328
00:17:59.488 --> 00:18:00.488
No.

329
00:18:00.488 --> 00:18:03.688
The police said we could

330
00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:07.188
but since father was killed in here so tragically,

331
00:18:07.188 --> 00:18:10.688
I haven't decided what to do with it yet.

332
00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:14.388
Go ahead, I've left it exactly as the police left it.

333
00:18:14.388 --> 00:18:15.388
Thank you.

334
00:18:27.988 --> 00:18:29.488
By the way, Mr. Arima,

335
00:18:29.488 --> 00:18:32.588
where was the victim's body lying?

336
00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:35.988
Let's see, right about here in front of the safe,

337
00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:38.888
he was lying clutching his head.

338
00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:40.988
I see.

339
00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:43.288
I've got it!

340
00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.988
What do you mean?

341
00:18:44.988 --> 00:18:50.188
I bet Mr. Otsu caught Inoue trying to open the safe.

342
00:18:50.188 --> 00:18:52.688
The defendant confessed to that in the very beginning

343
00:18:52.688 --> 00:18:54.388
What's important is what happened after.

344
00:18:54.388 --> 00:18:57.688
Inoue was hiding a knife or something,

345
00:18:57.688 --> 00:19:01.388
he threatened the victim and forced him to open the safe.

346
00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:04.588
When the safe was opened,

347
00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:07.788
he hit the victim with the ashtray from behind.

348
00:19:07.788 --> 00:19:10.888
You're not implying the defendant was lying, are you?

349
00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:13.788
Well, I guess you could say I am.

350
00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:15.088
How can you expect to defend a client

351
00:19:15.088 --> 00:19:18.288
if you don't believe him!

352
00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:19.988
You can say what you want

353
00:19:19.988 --> 00:19:23.088
but that "Madonna" is going to fry you in court!

354
00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:24.188
What's that?

355
00:19:27.588 --> 00:19:28.888
Wait a minute.

356
00:19:28.888 --> 00:19:30.088
It can't be...

357
00:19:31.388 --> 00:19:35.788
Hey, is that the window you saw the killer through, sir?

358
00:19:35.788 --> 00:19:37.888
-That's right. -I see.

359
00:19:44.488 --> 00:19:47.688
Hey, Conan! What're you up to?

360
00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:49.088
Pops Kogoro,

361
00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:51.888
could you stand in front of the safe one more time for me?

362
00:19:51.888 --> 00:19:55.088
Gosh. Now what?

363
00:19:56.888 --> 00:19:58.288
Here?

364
00:19:58.288 --> 00:20:00.388
Hold it right there!

365
00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:04.588
I knew it!

366
00:20:04.588 --> 00:20:05.588
I don't get it.

367
00:20:05.588 --> 00:20:10.588
The partition is blocking the way, I can't see you from here!

368
00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:11.988
What did you say?

369
00:20:11.988 --> 00:20:14.388
Mr. Akiyama, what is the meaning of this?

370
00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:18.188
Well, I wasn't looking over there.

371
00:20:18.188 --> 00:20:19.688
I was only looking at the person's shadow reflected

372
00:20:19.688 --> 00:20:21.288
on this wall over here.

373
00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:24.088
Did you say the reflection on the wall?

374
00:20:24.088 --> 00:20:27.588
Yes. There weren't any lights on in the room that night

375
00:20:27.588 --> 00:20:31.288
and the neon lights from outside the window came in.

376
00:20:31.288 --> 00:20:33.688
That's how I saw the killer's shadow.

377
00:20:33.688 --> 00:20:38.688
He hit Mr. Otsu over and over again.

378
00:20:38.688 --> 00:20:42.488
Besides, I heard Mr. Otsu fall after that,

379
00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:44.588
I'm positive about that!

380
00:20:44.588 --> 00:20:46.388
Let me clarify one point,

381
00:20:46.388 --> 00:20:50.888
you didn't actually see the defendant strike the victim, did you?

382
00:20:50.888 --> 00:20:52.488
But Ms. Kisaki

383
00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:55.288
I don't see how much difference it makes.

384
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:57.688
The defendant himself has confessed to hitting my father-in-law, right?

385
00:20:57.688 --> 00:20:59.188
That's where you're wrong Mr. Arima.

386
00:20:59.188 --> 00:21:01.888
There's a big difference in actually seeing the beating

387
00:21:01.888 --> 00:21:05.088
and seeing the shadow of someone being beaten!

388
00:21:05.088 --> 00:21:09.188
Besides, until the defendant is found guilty in court,

389
00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:13.088
he is presumed innocent!

390
00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:17.488
Unfortunately, most people forget that fact.

391
00:21:17.488 --> 00:21:19.488
I'm sorry then.

392
00:21:19.488 --> 00:21:20.888
Excuse me, sir

393
00:21:20.888 --> 00:21:21.888
What is it?

394
00:21:21.888 --> 00:21:24.688
This clock isn't working.

395
00:21:24.688 --> 00:21:30.288
The late president won that in a golf tournament

396
00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:32.088
he just left it there for decoration,

397
00:21:32.088 --> 00:21:35.388
he never used it.

398
00:21:35.388 --> 00:21:37.588
Mr. Arima, I need to ask you.

399
00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:39.688
Yes, what is it?

400
00:21:39.688 --> 00:21:42.688
Was there anyone besides the victim

401
00:21:42.688 --> 00:21:45.888
who knew the combination to the safe?

402
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:47.888
No, he was the only one.

403
00:21:47.888 --> 00:21:50.188
He was a man one operation,

404
00:21:50.188 --> 00:21:53.388
he didn't even tell the accountant.

405
00:21:53.388 --> 00:21:58.688
Watch it! Stop wandering around!

406
00:21:58.688 --> 00:22:00.388
What's this?

407
00:22:00.388 --> 00:22:02.688
That's it, I've got it now!

408
00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:05.388
I've solved the mystery behind this case.

409
00:22:05.388 --> 00:22:07.088
The silhouette of something being hit

410
00:22:07.088 --> 00:22:09.788
that Mr. Akiyama said he saw

411
00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:12.388
and the sound of something falling,

412
00:22:12.388 --> 00:22:15.688
everything can be this trick will explain everything

413
00:22:15.688 --> 00:22:18.888
and the only one who could've have set it up is

414
00:22:18.888 --> 00:22:20.788
that person!

415
00:23:49.788 --> 00:23:52.388
"Next Episode" -This restaurant looks fancy

416
00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:53.888
but the pasta isn't very good, right?

417
00:23:53.888 --> 00:23:55.088
You're right.

418
00:23:55.088 --> 00:23:57.688
The olive oil is a little heavy.

419
00:24:00.588 --> 00:24:01.588
What is this?

420
00:24:01.588 --> 00:24:05.388
I set things up just like Pops Kogoro told me to.

421
00:24:05.388 --> 00:24:07.188
Set things up?

422
00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:09.088
Are you saying he knows who the murderer is?

423
00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:13.988
Yes, he said he'd explain everything in court.

424
00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:15.388
Next Conan,

425
00:24:15.388 --> 00:24:19.788
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 2)"

426
00:24:20.215 --> 00:24:22.715
Next Conan Hint:

427
00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:24.715
"Glasses"

428
00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:27.215
-Next episode, let's put an end to this case! -Dad, help mom.

429
00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:29.315
Ms. Kujo, the prosecutor, is so pretty!
