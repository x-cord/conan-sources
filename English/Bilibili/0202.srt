1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,540
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
A quiet village is in an uproar.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,940
Like the case, the bus is also out of control.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,899
Ran, Mr. Mouri and I are being rocked in a nostalgic bonnet bus

9
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,399
on our way to Kagekuwa Village to do some hiking.

10
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,899
But a murder takes place on the bus we're on.

11
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,899
The victim is Deputy Mayor Okumura who is the leader of the group

12
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,199
against using the bonnet bus to promote tourism

13
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,899
because it is a vital means of transportation for the villagers.

14
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:20,299
The police take Mr. Yabe, who is for promoting tourism,

15
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:22,099
into custody and things in the village begin to heat up.

16
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,199
To complicate matters,

17
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,499
a bus accident that happened seven years ago is involved in some way.

18
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,899
While that murder remains unsolved,

19
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,599
Mayor Funaki who is also for tourism promotion,

20
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,999
is attacked on the grounds of the shrine

21
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,999
and Ran is also in danger.

22
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,999
"The 10th Passenger (Part 2)"

23
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,799
-Ran! -Conan?

24
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,099
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

25
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,099
No, I'm fine, I just got run into someone.

26
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,499
Never mind me, I think there's somebody lying over there.

27
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,799
Mayor Funaki!

28
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,499
Stabbed once in the chest!

29
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,299
Death was almost instantaneous!

30
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,899
Ran, did you see the killer?

31
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:14,299
I don't know if it was the killer,

32
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:16,699
but I did see who rammed into.

33
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,099
Who is that person?

34
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,799
What does that person look like? Any outstanding features?

35
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,799
Well, actually...

36
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,099
It was Mr. Yabe, the head of the Youth Association.

37
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,599
What?

38
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:37,199
What? Mr. Yabe killed the mayor?

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,199
No, it's too early to tell...

40
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,299
Take me to his home!

41
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,599
"Patrolman Hitoshi Shinkai (28)" -I contacted the district station

42
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,099
and we'll have to wait until one of their investigators arrives.

43
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,499
Listen! Ran could have ended up like the mayor!

44
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,899
Now take me to his home right now!

45
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,499
Yes.

46
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,399
Yabe!

47
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,799
-Come out here! -Mr. Mouri! We don't have a warrant...

48
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,899
Darn it!

49
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,899
Yabe! Come on!

50
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,299
Darn! He got away!

51
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,299
The evening paper's still in the mail slot.

52
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,399
I don't think he came back here.

53
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,199
That means he called the mayor out

54
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,699
as soon as he was released and killed him!

55
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,599
And now he's on the run.

56
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,499
He planned this.

57
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,499
Mr. Mouri!

58
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,499
Listen! Have road blocks set up!

59
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:33,699
Yes, sir!

60
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,799
A bank passbook.

61
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,099
There's 200,000 yen being deposited every month starting two years ago.

62
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,099
But why is he using a bank

63
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,699
that is not even in the village.

64
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,199
I wonder if this money's...

65
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:05,199
The next day, the search for Mr. Yabe

66
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,399
was about to start.

67
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,899
"Shohei Hino (41), Detective" -Well, it looks like we're after prey.

68
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:13,299
Mr. Private Detective.

69
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,399
I don't want to work with you

70
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,999
but we can't let a dangerous man like him remain on the loose

71
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,499
so I'll join in the hunt.

72
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:23,099
The villagers are also joining the search

73
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,899
but the tension between the two factions was reaching its peak.

74
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,899
Did the killer count on the villagers to cause a commotion

75
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,899
or was he planning something else?

76
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,799
In the first place though, is the killer really Mr. Yabe?

77
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,399
If these murders were premeditated,

78
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,699
he'd have taken his passbook!

79
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,899
There are other things I don't understand.

80
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:50,299
The look of fear on the innkeeper's face when she dropped the food!

81
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,499
And the reason she was crying in front of the memorial tower.

82
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,899
And why was Ms. Toko watching her?

83
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,899
I'm pretty sure all of this has something to do

84
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,899
with the bus accident seven years ago!

85
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,899
Darn!

86
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,099
The one million yen the mayor promised to pay me is gone!

87
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,099
Yabe, you jerk! You won't get off!

88
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,999
Hello? Shinichi?

89
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,399
It seems you're involved in a big case there.

90
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,099
Yes, and I need you to look through some articles from seven years ago!

91
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,799
Sure, I can access the newspaper company's homepage for that information.

92
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,899
There he is! Over here!

93
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,599
Wait! You're not getting away!

94
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,899
Give my one million yen back!

95
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:51,499
Let's see. Seven years ago...

96
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,499
This is it!

97
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,699
"Bus Accident"

98
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,199
The bus falls off the cliff.

99
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,299
Two are killed. Eight people are injured.

100
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:05,499
Does it list the names of the deceased?

101
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:09,199
Yes, it's a local paper so they've listed all the names!

102
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,399
First, the ones with minor injuries...

103
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,199
I've got you, Yabe!

104
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,999
Don't fight it!

105
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,799
"Takuro Yabe (32)" -It wasn't me!

106
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,099
"Head of the Youth Association" -I didn't do anything!

107
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:26,399
You ran, that proves you're guilty!

108
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,399
Takuro Yabe, you're under arrest for suspicion of murder!

109
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:31,899
What did you say?

110
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,299
Deputy Mayor Okumura's name wasn't on it?

111
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:37,099
No, I don't see that name on the list.

112
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,299
Then, maybe Deputy Mayor Okumura...

113
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,599
Here're the names of the two men who were killed.

114
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,699
Yoichi Tezuka, 28 years old

115
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,399
and Kohei Moritsugu, 55 years old!

116
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,099
Dr. Agasa! I need you to locate

117
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,899
the relatives of those two men right away!

118
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,799
No! You're wrong!

119
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,699
When I got to the shrine, I heard the mayor scream

120
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,199
so I ran over to see what happened,

121
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,699
that's when your daughter came!

122
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,099
I knew that if I stayed there everyone would think I did it,

123
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,699
I got scared and when I tried to get away,

124
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,799
I bumped into your daughter.

125
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:14,099
Don't lie! Then tell us why you went there in the first place!

126
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,599
The mayor called me and told me to meet him there.

127
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,499
He called you?

128
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,099
Why would he want to meet you at such an isolated place?

129
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,199
Well, it's...

130
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,799
Listen carefully, you don't tell us anything

131
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,199
and yet you want us to believe you,

132
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,499
don't you think that's asking a little too much?

133
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,899
What is this?

134
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,399
It's a bank passbook we found at your place.

135
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,199
200,000 yen is being deposited every month for the past two years!

136
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:44,799
And you're using not the post office savings or the Farmer's union,

137
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,899
you're using a bank that's not in this village.

138
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,099
Which means, it's money

139
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,899
you don't want anyone in the village to know about, right?

140
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,799
I was leaking information!

141
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,799
Information?

142
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,799
Were you a spy? For the opposition?

143
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,799
Yes, deputy mayor, the man who died in the bus

144
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,699
was the leader of the opposition, he was paying me

145
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,599
and I've been telling him what Mayor Funaki was planning and his schedule.

146
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:15,199
But why was it so important that Mr. Okumura went to so much trouble?

147
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,199
If there was a new project in the works,

148
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,799
then the village funds would be paid

149
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,199
to companies Mr. Funaki favoured and naturally,

150
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:26,699
the companies the deputy mayor and people in the opposing faction

151
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,199
were connected with would be excluded,

152
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:31,799
that's why they had to crush the plans for the project before it started.

153
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,099
The mayor found out about it

154
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,499
and told you to meet him at the shrine, is that right?

155
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:37,999
Yes.

156
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,199
It seems when I was being questioned the first time,

157
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,499
he went into my home and found the passbook.

158
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:49,599
That means you killed Mr. Okumura so that you wouldn't be caught

159
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:53,099
and then you killed Mr. Funaki because you were!

160
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:55,199
No, that's not it!

161
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,599
I didn't do it!

163
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,099
Ma'am, would you mind explaining things to me?

164
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,599
What if these murders that are supposed to look like it has to do

165
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,899
with the fight between the two opposing factions in the village,

166
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,699
is really connected to the bus accident seven years ago?

167
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,499
The bus accident seven years ago?

168
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:21,799
That's impossible!

169
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,599
If that's the case, then Mr. Yabe's innocent!

170
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:28,799
Because on that day seven years ago, he was on that bus!

171
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,499
And Ms. Komai, so were you!

172
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,899
What in the world happened?

173
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,899
What happened on that bus?

174
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,099
All clear.

00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,599
That's the truth behind that accident seven years ago.

178
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,099
I knew it!

179
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,899
That's why Mayor Funaki was so afraid the truth would come out,

180
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,099
he offered to pay Kogoro all that money, so he could control the situation!

181
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,299
Hello?

182
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:20,599
I've located the relatives of the two bus accident victims!

183
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,799
It was on a follow-up article!

184
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,599
What was that? That person's...

185
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,699
I understand! Thank you!

186
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,499
Ms. Komai! If I want to take the bus at the same time of the accident,

187
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,499
what time does it leave the station?

188
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,499
If it's that bus, it's left already.

189
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:37,699
Oh, no!

190
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,199
Ms. Komai, I'm counting on you!

191
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,199
You've got to catch up with that bus!

192
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,199
I don't want that person to kill any more people!

193
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,599
Please, let us make it in time!

194
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,699
This can't be happening!

195
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,299
The brakes don't work!

196
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,499
What?

197
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:17,599
Are you kidding me?

198
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:21,199
That's ridiculous! It's all downhill from here!

199
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,388
What? Mr. Yabe killed them?

200
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:40,388
Yes, he's going to be transferred to the main precinct this afternoon.

201
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,888
Does that mean your job is...

202
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,888
It's over.

203
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,688
Not only did I lose out on the money,

204
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:49,288
I had to work for no pay on top of that.

205
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:52,288
Good grief, what a hiking trip this turned out to be!

206
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:57,388
Oh, my! I just realised, where did Conan go?

207
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,388
I see it! There it is!

208
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,988
Kajita, do something!

209
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:13,988
Engine brake! I'm already doing that!

210
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:16,688
The wire's cut from the emergency brake!

211
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:22,088
The bus's brakes aren't working!

212
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:24,988
Ms. Komai, by this car alongside the bus!

213
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:27,088
What're you going to do?

214
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:28,788
I'm going to get on the bus!

215
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:29,788
Wait, kid!

216
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,388
It's too dangerous! Don't do it!

217
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,088
This is just like what happened seven years ago.

218
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,288
What?

219
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,788
That's right, even the passengers are the same.

220
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:48,488
That's impossible. This is just coincidence, isn't it?

221
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:51,088
No! This is no coincidence!

222
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:53,588
Conan! When did you get on?

223
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:55,688
A certain person told me the story!

224
00:13:55,688 --> 00:14:00,388
Seven years ago, all of you were on this very bus!

225
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:02,688
Even Mayor Funaki who was killed

226
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:06,388
and Mr. Yabe who is suspected of killing him were on board,

227
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,388
a total of ten passengers!

228
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:11,988
You all remember what happened, don't you?

229
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,788
Ms. Komai, the innkeeper of Komai Inn

230
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:20,188
was the bus guide then.

231
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,488
Come on!

232
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,688
"Yoichi Tezuka (28), Passenger" -Come and drink with us!

233
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:27,988
"Kinu Komai (35), Bus Guide" -Somebody help me!

234
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,988
Don't be so unfriendly!

235
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:34,088
-Somebody stop him! Help! -Come on!

236
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,788
-Please help me! -You!

237
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:36,888
"Kohei Moritsugu (55), Passenger" -Stop that immediately!

238
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,788
She doesn't want to drink with you!

239
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:40,388
What'd you say?

240
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:43,288
I'm just trying to have some fun,

241
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,188
don't interrupt!

242
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,888
The two people that died in that accident

243
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,588
were the man who was bothering Ms. Komai

244
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,788
and the man who tried to save her

245
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:06,988
and miraculously, the eight villagers survived.

246
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:13,288
In the end, you all kept your silence!

247
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:17,088
And you made it appear the accident was caused by the two men fighting!

248
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:20,288
You people caused the death of one brave man

249
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:24,088
and you hid your guilt deep in your hearts.

250
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,388
After everything I've said, you should have come to realise

251
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:31,688
the two murders were committed by a member of that brave man's family,

252
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:34,288
one of Mr. Moritsugu's children,

253
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:36,088
the motive is revenge!

254
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,488
Isn't that right, Ms. Toko?

255
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,788
Natsume is your mother's maiden name, isn't it?

256
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,788
Your real name is Toko Moritsugu!

257
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,888
What? Ms. Toko is...

258
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:49,488
She is his daughter!

259
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:55,388
What did you say? The killer is on the bus?

260
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,788
And who is it?

261
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:01,788
I don't know! But the bus has no brakes

262
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:03,288
and it's out of control!

263
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,788
Hey! Call the main precinct!

264
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:06,788
Yes, sir!

265
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,988
And that kid is also on the bus.

266
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:12,988
What? How did Conan get on the bus?

267
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:19,688
Ms. Toko wanted to know how her father died

268
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,188
so she moved here and began investigating,

269
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,488
then she found out the truth!

270
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:27,088
She probably heard it from Mr. Kajita

271
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,688
who worked with her and befriended her, right?

272
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:35,588
Ironically, one of the men she wanted to take revenge on,

273
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:37,888
Mr. Yabe was arrested because he and the victim

274
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:40,888
were on opposing factions in the village dispute.

275
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:44,188
Ms. Toko knew all of you would be on this bus today

276
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:47,188
going shopping and running errands,

277
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:51,288
she meddled with the brakes, so you'd all be killed!

278
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:53,388
At the same spot seven years ago!

279
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,188
"Memorial Tower"

280
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,988
Isn't that right, Ms. Toko?

281
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,188
I don't believe it.

282
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,088
I don't know what you're talking about.

283
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:08,188
It's no use to pretending.

284
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:11,488
Why are you so calm then?

285
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,088
Because you're about to commit suicide, aren't you?

286
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:16,188
You're going to die along with everyone else.

287
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:30,488
Good grief! What a bothersome child!

288
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,088
Get off of this bus, Conan!

289
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,588
The bus will slow down on the next curve,

290
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,088
if you're careful, you'll just get a few bruises!

291
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:40,788
So are you admitting I'm right? You're behind all of this!

292
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,388
Yes! I confess!

293
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:46,488
I killed both Deputy Mayor Okumura and Mayor Funaki!

294
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:50,488
When the bus was crowded,

295
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:53,688
I put the poison in the deputy mayor's drink!

296
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:57,088
I waited in the dark and stabbed the mayor on the shrine grounds!

297
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,688
That's right! I came here to get revenge

298
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:05,688
on the people who were on this bus seven years ago!

299
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:08,288
My father was a very righteous man!

300
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,988
He only did what was natural,

301
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,988
when he saw someone in trouble, he went to help!

302
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:15,988
But that day...

303
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,988
if even one of you had backed him up!

304
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:25,188
Hurry! Conan, you've got to jump now!

305
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,788
It's too late.

306
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:28,788
Even if you let me go,

307
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:32,788
it still won't change the fact that you killed the wrong person!

308
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,188
What?

309
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:36,688
Deputy Mayor Okumura, the first victim,

310
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:41,188
wasn't on this bus seven years ago!

311
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:44,188
What did you say? That can't be!

312
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:47,088
As the bus guide, you've seen him every day

313
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,388
so you know what he always says...

314
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:53,788
This has been my seat for 40 years!

315
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,488
When someone has continued to say that

316
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:59,388
and if you were to ask him about that incident seven years ago.

317
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,688
You did ask him about it, didn't you?

318
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,588
Of course, I asked him personally!

319
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,488
Seven years ago?

320
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:10,488
No mistake, I was sitting right here in my own seat!

321
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,788
He was very clear about it!

322
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:16,588
But Deputy Mayor Okumura had a cold and his fever was very high that day,

323
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,588
so he was in bed!

324
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:21,888
His name wasn't in the newspaper either!

325
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:25,788
You're lying. I read the newspaper myself.

326
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,188
He was probably so convincing,

327
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:30,188
you just thought you saw his name listed.

328
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:33,488
But, then... who was the 10th passenger?

329
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:37,388
That person died two years ago from an illness.

330
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:41,088
So you see, Deputy Mayor Okumura had nothing to do

331
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,488
with your father's death!

332
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,788
That... That can't be.

333
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,988
You forgave Ms. Komai, didn't you?

334
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,188
Yes, she...

335
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:01,988
I'm sorry...

336
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:06,488
When I saw her like that,

337
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:09,888
I just couldn't bring myself to kill her.

338
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:11,988
She's not the only one,

339
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:14,388
I believe all the people who were on that bus that day

340
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:18,188
have been carrying a heavy burden in their hearts.

341
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,988
Please forgive us, Toko!

342
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:27,288
We were cowards!

343
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,688
Please accept our apologies...

344
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:38,788
If we crash at the same place,

345
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:42,688
then maybe Toko's father will forgive us and rest in peace.

346
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:45,488
No! Conan has nothing to do with this!

347
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:46,788
Do something!

348
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,088
There's nothing I can do.

349
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:49,588
I may be able to make the next curve

350
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:52,688
but there's no way I can make the curve at the scene of the accident.

351
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:54,688
Don't give up!

352
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,488
There's bound to be a way to stop this bus!

353
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:04,188
There's a ditch! Get your tires into the ditch!

354
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:10,788
It's no use! I can't keep the tires down!

355
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:12,988
That's it! The suspenders Dr. Agasa invented

356
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,688
they're stretchable and snap back to its original length!

357
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:16,988
"Elastic Suspenders"

358
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,988
Oh, no!

359
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:31,188
Darn it! Maybe it won't hold a 10-ton bus!

360
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,488
We've... stopped.

361
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:59,088
Conan, who are you anyway?

362
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:02,188
I'm just a busy body private detective!

363
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,788
Thank you, little private detective.

364
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:08,988
That's for making us worry!

365
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,988
It hurts!

366
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,988
The case is solved,

367
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:49,288
and the bonnet bus continues to run

368
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:52,188
carrying its passengers and the memories they keep inside.

369
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:56,088
Slowly, into the greenery!

370
00:23:58,588 --> 00:23:59,988
"Next Episode"

371
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,588
Chizuru?

372
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:03,688
Who were you arguing with?

373
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:05,488
It can't be!

374
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:06,688
Here goes!

375
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,688
I hate to say this,

376
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:17,188
but a lot of time has passed since the victim died.

377
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:19,388
No one has entered this room!

378
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:21,388
I'll testify to that!

379
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:23,388
Why?

380
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:24,788
Next Conan,

381
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:28,509
"The Black Wings Of Icarus (Part 1)"

382
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,948
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,848
"Lunch box"

384
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,148
The next episode is another original made for TV.

385
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:36,948
That means the culprit is also original.

386
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:38,148
Well... It is.
