1
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.199
I'm sorry, Yuika.

2
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.999
"Mihiro Kuze (26)" -About Mr. Monwaki...

3
00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.499
If I were more reliable,

4
00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.399
you guys didn't have to end up that way.

5
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:24.699
It's okay, Mihiro.

6
00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.999
Who cares about a guy who has to fool around with a friend of mine?

7
00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.199
"Yuka Shodo (26)" -Right now, I'm glad I split with a guy like him.

8
00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.199
Did you buy the clothes that you're going to be wearing tomorrow?

9
00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.099
Yep, I did!

10
00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.799
A cute Goth Lolita outfit!

11
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.999
I'm wearing it right now!

12
00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:44.499
You can look forward to seeing it tomorrow!

13
00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.899
Okay, I'll wait for you at the usual place then.

14
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.399
Okay.

15
00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.899
Yuika.

16
00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.299
We're best friends, right?

17
00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.499
What a stupid thing to say!

18
00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.999
Until death, of course!

19
00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.399
Yuika.

20
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.299
See you tomorrow, I'll be looking forward to seeing it!

21
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.799
Yes!

22
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.199
Until death... that is.

23
00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:28.099
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

24
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.499
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

25
00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.099
What is the black conspiracy

26
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.299
that is hidden behind The Goth Lolita outfit?

27
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.099
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.099
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.199
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:30.588
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 1)"

31
00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:34.988
Darn it.

32
00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:40.688
What cruse of fate has brought the famed Kogoro Mouri

33
00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:46.088
to shop along with two girls on my precious day off.

34
00:03:46.088 --> 00:03:48.388
It won't hurt to do so once in a while!

35
00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.388
Your eyes will enjoy

36
00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:53.788
all the nice looking young girls walking through town!

37
00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:55.888
Besides...

38
00:03:55.888 --> 00:03:57.188
You have all the time in the world

39
00:03:57.188 --> 00:03:59.288
because you had no incoming job anyway.

40
00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:01.288
Idiot! I had to organize the dramas

41
00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:03.488
I recorded on the DVD recorder.

42
00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:05.488
I had to also go check on the way the balls

43
00:04:05.488 --> 00:04:08.088
come out on the machine of a new panchinko shop that's opening too,

44
00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:10.388
and also...

45
00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:12.788
Today's the G1 horse race!

46
00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:14.988
That's the kind of stuff that people refer to

47
00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.788
as someone who has all the time in the world do!

48
00:04:17.788 --> 00:04:19.088
What?

49
00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:21.388
Dad, don't go wasting your money

50
00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:23.788
on stuff like pachinko and horse racing!

51
00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:26.388
Talk for yourself!

52
00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:29.288
You're going to get it if you buy super expensive clothes!

53
00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:30.688
Don't worry.

54
00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:33.888
I'm only buying cheap cute clothes!

55
00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.588
Right!

56
00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:38.688
I don't care what

57
00:04:38.688 --> 00:04:41.088
but show it to me before you buy it, now!

58
00:04:41.088 --> 00:04:42.688
What?

59
00:04:42.688 --> 00:04:45.688
Oh, no, I don't think so.

60
00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:48.288
What's this?

61
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.288
Are you saying that you're going to buy lewd clothes

62
00:04:50.288 --> 00:04:52.388
that you can't even show your parent?

63
00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:55.288
Like teeny-weeny T-shirts that show your belly

64
00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:58.788
or Chinese dresses that reveal most of your thighs?

65
00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:01.088
That's more your taste.

66
00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:02.888
You don't have to look at them

67
00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:05.088
because none of them are going to be sexy.

68
00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:07.088
Well, I think you'll be surprised either way

69
00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:08.888
if you see them anyway.

70
00:05:13.388 --> 00:05:14.988
Hello!

71
00:05:24.188 --> 00:05:28.488
What's that look about, that witch looking outfit...

72
00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:30.088
-Super cute! -Super cute!

73
00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:31.088
What?

74
00:05:31.088 --> 00:05:33.188
It's Goth Lolita, Goth Lolita!

75
00:05:33.188 --> 00:05:35.088
It's nice after all!

76
00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:37.188
Goth... Lolita?

77
00:05:37.188 --> 00:05:41.088
Gothic Lolita is a fashion in which black clothes

78
00:05:41.088 --> 00:05:43.488
that are worn by vampires and draculas that appear in Gothic novels

79
00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:47.488
or monster movies based on such things are worn.

80
00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:53.388
They also said on TV that these outfits are very womanly!

81
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.888
Just what kind of programs is he usually watching anyway?

82
00:05:58.888 --> 00:06:02.788
Well... it's the kind of fashion I think Ai would look good in.

83
00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:05.388
I hope you two aren't planning

84
00:06:05.388 --> 00:06:08.888
to buy that monster-like outfit too, are you?

85
00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:11.088
We're buying something that's cuter!

86
00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:13.688
Something like what a doll would wear.

87
00:06:13.688 --> 00:06:16.388
You mean, Lolita fashions then.

88
00:06:16.388 --> 00:06:19.788
I don't know about this Goth Lolita or Ghost Lotta thing,

89
00:06:19.788 --> 00:06:22.388
but I'm not ever letting you

90
00:06:22.388 --> 00:06:25.088
wear a Halloween outfit like fashion like that!

91
00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:45.588
Thank you for waiting.

92
00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:48.688
Uh... That customer that was here just now...

93
00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:52.688
I hope she didn't leave because I criticized her outfit.

94
00:06:52.688 --> 00:06:55.388
Oh, no. She said that

95
00:06:55.388 --> 00:06:58.088
the friend that she's waiting for hasn't come yet.

96
00:06:58.088 --> 00:07:00.988
So, she seems to have gone the restroom.

97
00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:04.188
The restroom is outside the shop, you see.

98
00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:05.488
I see.

99
00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:12.388
The lady who was wearing the Goth Lolita outfit

100
00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:15.188
hasn't come back yet.

101
00:07:15.188 --> 00:07:17.088
If she's waiting for someone,

102
00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:19.588
it'd be better if she's in her seat and yet...

103
00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:22.688
Women take their time in the restroom, so...

104
00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:28.188
Hello! For one?

105
00:07:28.188 --> 00:07:31.788
Oh, no. Didn't a girl in Goth Lolita outfit come?

106
00:07:31.788 --> 00:07:33.888
She's my friend.

107
00:07:33.888 --> 00:07:35.388
She's here.

108
00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.888
She's sing the restroom now, though.

109
00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:42.088
Oh my, I'm 10 minutes late.

110
00:07:42.088 --> 00:07:43.988
What did Mihiro order?

111
00:07:43.988 --> 00:07:45.288
Well, nothing yet,

112
00:07:45.288 --> 00:07:47.988
although she was looking through the menu.

113
00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:51.288
She said she'd order after her friend arrives.

114
00:07:51.288 --> 00:07:54.988
Okay then, I'll wait till Mihiro comes and then, place my order.

115
00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:57.088
Hey...

116
00:07:58.888 --> 00:08:00.988
I'm sorry!

117
00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:04.288
No problem. I'll clean it up.

118
00:08:04.288 --> 00:08:06.588
Really, I'm sorry.

119
00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:07.888
No problem.

120
00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:12.988
Well, I drank what I wanted to,

121
00:08:12.988 --> 00:08:15.388
so let's start off into town!

122
00:08:15.388 --> 00:08:17.788
We checked out the shops through and through already too!

123
00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:23.788
Okay, we're going, kid!

124
00:08:24.988 --> 00:08:26.188
Hey!

125
00:08:26.188 --> 00:08:27.888
Yep.

126
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:37.188
Hey...

127
00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:41.488
What's with everybody, wearing crazy clothes?

128
00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:43.588
Just as would be expected of Harajuku.

129
00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:46.488
Don't tell me that you guys are like these people.

130
00:08:46.488 --> 00:08:49.288
I mean, they're gone!

131
00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:52.588
Ran and Sonoko said that they're going shopping,

132
00:08:52.588 --> 00:08:55.288
so for us to browse around this area!

133
00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:57.888
Darn! Just what do they think they're doing?

134
00:08:57.888 --> 00:09:00.188
There's no reason for me to come along then!

135
00:09:00.188 --> 00:09:04.188
Rather, there is... You're probably here because...

136
00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:09.388
Just as I thought.

137
00:09:09.388 --> 00:09:11.488
They want you to carry their shopping bags.

138
00:09:12.588 --> 00:09:14.288
Next, this store!

139
00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:16.488
This is cute, isn't it?

140
00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:18.488
What's cute about it anyway?

141
00:09:18.488 --> 00:09:21.688
Hey, don't peek inside!

142
00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:23.888
Then, hold your own stuff!

143
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:33.988
Hey, oh no!

144
00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:36.088
Isn't this ice cream?

145
00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:42.588
What language?

146
00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.788
I'm not sure because it's too fast.

147
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:52.088
They're ice cream thieves!

148
00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:53.288
Thieves?

149
00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:54.988
No!

150
00:09:54.988 --> 00:09:59.088
It's used a lot abroad to steal things from Japanese people!

151
00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:01.688
When trying to wipe the ice cream off,

152
00:10:01.688 --> 00:10:03.288
in order to free your hands,

153
00:10:03.288 --> 00:10:05.888
you'll put the things that you're holding down, right?

154
00:10:05.888 --> 00:10:08.588
And while one is talking away in a foreign language,

155
00:10:08.588 --> 00:10:10.288
in order to distract the victim,

156
00:10:10.288 --> 00:10:12.188
his accomplice takes off

157
00:10:12.188 --> 00:10:14.888
after stealing the belongings of that tourist.

158
00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:20.188
Hey! Hold it!

159
00:10:20.188 --> 00:10:22.388
I mean, I saw it on TV.

160
00:10:23.888 --> 00:10:27.888
I wonder what kind of programs Conan is always watching!

161
00:10:27.888 --> 00:10:30.088
But, talk about bummers...

162
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.988
We can't shop with our clothes like this.

163
00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:36.988
Then, why don't you change into the clothes you bought?

164
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.088
I mean, you bought it already, so why not?

165
00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:48.888
Listen? Both of you! Don't you dare laugh, okay?

166
00:10:48.888 --> 00:10:50.888
Well, I know we'll be taken aback, though.

167
00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:57.888
There are so many customers before us.

168
00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:04.388
They seem to be here for the same purpose.

169
00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:06.188
Hey, you!

170
00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:09.288
Come out, already! Darn!

171
00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:11.788
What seems to be the matter?

172
00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:15.988
The person's been in here for over 30 minutes already!

173
00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:20.588
Maybe she's passed out from a heart stroke or something.

174
00:11:20.588 --> 00:11:23.688
-What? -In that case...

175
00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:24.888
Sonoko!

176
00:11:24.888 --> 00:11:27.188
I'll take a look from above.

177
00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:35.888
Hey, what's up?

178
00:11:35.888 --> 00:11:39.488
In... In the toilet... compartment...

179
00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:42.088
The Goth... Goth Lolita...

180
00:11:42.088 --> 00:11:43.588
Huh?

181
00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.188
Just what're you talking about?

182
00:11:54.888 --> 00:11:56.988
There are strangulation marks on the neck

183
00:11:56.988 --> 00:11:58.888
as well as "Yoshikawa Lines" showing that

184
00:11:58.888 --> 00:12:01.388
the victim scratched her neck in resistance.

185
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.288
Murder by strangulation...

186
00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:23.477
Gee, but what an outfit...

187
00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:25.777
The clothes that this victim is wearing.

188
00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.877
You mean this is the trend nowadays?

189
00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:31.177
No, it's called Goth Lolita fashion

190
00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:35.077
and has been around for some time already.

191
00:12:35.077 --> 00:12:38.677
I'm sorry I don't know anything about these trendy things.

192
00:12:38.677 --> 00:12:40.777
Oh, don't be.

193
00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:44.277
And? What about the identity of the victim?

194
00:12:44.277 --> 00:12:47.377
From the driver's license that she had on her,

195
00:12:47.377 --> 00:12:51.877
she's a resident of Haido cho named Ms. Mihiro Kuze.

196
00:12:52.977 --> 00:12:58.377
There are strangulation marks and Yoshikawa lines on her neck.

197
00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:01.277
No doubt this is murder by strangulation.

198
00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:03.277
Yoshikawa line?

199
00:13:03.277 --> 00:13:05.277
What's that?

200
00:13:05.277 --> 00:13:07.777
It's police jargon.

201
00:13:07.777 --> 00:13:09.877
When a person is strangled,

202
00:13:09.877 --> 00:13:12.577
they try to remove the string or rope that's around their neck

203
00:13:12.577 --> 00:13:15.477
with their hand because they can't breathe, right?

204
00:13:15.477 --> 00:13:17.077
Most times

205
00:13:17.077 --> 00:13:19.977
the nail marks of the person who is being strangled are left behind!

206
00:13:21.077 --> 00:13:23.777
This happens because the pain of being choked

207
00:13:23.777 --> 00:13:26.477
is much less tolerable than the pain of scratching!

208
00:13:26.477 --> 00:13:29.077
And the first person who took note of the fact

209
00:13:29.077 --> 00:13:31.777
that the scratch marks are evidence of someone

210
00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.977
who had been murdered by strangulation was

211
00:13:33.977 --> 00:13:37.177
a man called Mr. Youichi Yoshikawa who used to work as a forensic officer

212
00:13:37.177 --> 00:13:39.977
at the police department in the Taisho Era.

213
00:13:39.977 --> 00:13:45.377
Since then, the scratch marks are referred to as Yoshikawa marks!

214
00:13:45.377 --> 00:13:48.677
And you're going to say that you watched it on TV again?

215
00:13:49.777 --> 00:13:50.977
Yep.

216
00:13:50.977 --> 00:13:52.477
On what kind of program?

217
00:13:52.477 --> 00:13:55.277
The evening news.

218
00:13:57.177 --> 00:14:02.477
And? Is it true that you people saw this woman today?

219
00:14:02.477 --> 00:14:03.677
Yes.

220
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.077
I accompanied by daughter and her friend shopping today.

221
00:14:07.077 --> 00:14:11.477
They stopped by at a bookstore in Shinjuku before shopping,

222
00:14:11.477 --> 00:14:13.777
and checked inside the fashion magazine

223
00:14:13.777 --> 00:14:16.377
that they bought at a coffee shop that we stepped into.

224
00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:25.377
That's when this victim walked in!

225
00:14:25.377 --> 00:14:27.577
You mean a coffee shop in Shinjuku?

226
00:14:27.577 --> 00:14:29.077
Yes, sir.

227
00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:32.377
And when my daughter and her friend went into the restroom

228
00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:34.277
to change into the clothes that they bought in Shinjuku,

229
00:14:34.277 --> 00:14:37.477
they happened to run into her again!

230
00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:40.477
To this ruthlessly murder woman here...

231
00:14:40.477 --> 00:14:43.377
When the victim came to the coffee shop,

232
00:14:43.377 --> 00:14:45.677
wasn't she with someone?

233
00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:49.177
It seems she was waiting for a friend to come there.

234
00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:52.777
A woman wearing glasses who looked like she was an office worker.

235
00:14:52.777 --> 00:14:56.077
What time did the two come to the coffee shop?

236
00:14:56.077 --> 00:14:57.477
The woman dressed in Goth Lolita outfit

237
00:14:57.477 --> 00:14:59.277
came a little before 13:00.

238
00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:01.277
And the office lady looking person

239
00:15:01.277 --> 00:15:04.877
came 10 or 15 minutes afterwards.

240
00:15:04.877 --> 00:15:09.277
The estimated time of death was the one hour

241
00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:11.677
between 12:30 in the afternoon to 13:30?

242
00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:12.677
Yes, sir.

243
00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:15.277
Which means that there's a possibility that

244
00:15:15.277 --> 00:15:17.677
the office lady, after meeting the victim at the shop,

245
00:15:17.677 --> 00:15:20.477
brought her to the restroom here, in this park in Harajuku

246
00:15:20.477 --> 00:15:22.777
and killed her.

247
00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:25.777
But, how did she lock the door

248
00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:27.777
leaving the dead body on the toilet seat?

249
00:15:27.777 --> 00:15:29.577
After closing the door,

250
00:15:29.577 --> 00:15:32.377
she got on top of this bucket that was in the tool closet

251
00:15:32.377 --> 00:15:34.577
and used the handle of the brush inserting it from above the door

252
00:15:34.577 --> 00:15:36.577
and locked the door.

253
00:15:36.577 --> 00:15:39.877
After all, the lock for this door is a simple slide type.

254
00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:46.277
Is this restroom always so crowded?

255
00:15:46.277 --> 00:15:49.677
No, it gets crowded just around this time

256
00:15:49.677 --> 00:15:51.377
and it seems that by the time the girls got here,

257
00:15:51.377 --> 00:15:53.777
the toilet door was already locked,

258
00:15:53.777 --> 00:15:56.377
and the cell phone seems to have been ringing occasionally.

259
00:15:56.377 --> 00:15:59.077
-Cell phone? -Yes, sir.

260
00:15:59.077 --> 00:16:02.777
After checking the received calls history of the victim's cell phone,

261
00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:04.077
within the 2 hours that have gone by,

262
00:16:04.077 --> 00:16:07.977
it seems that someone has been calling this victim every 10 minutes.

263
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.077
Another call...

264
00:16:11.077 --> 00:16:13.777
It's the same number as the one in the received calls history!

265
00:16:15.677 --> 00:16:17.177
Hey, Miharu!

266
00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:18.577
Just what do you think you're doing?

267
00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.877
I've been waiting for you all this time at the coffee shop.

268
00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:22.477
Miharu?

269
00:16:22.477 --> 00:16:26.777
Well, I'm from the police.

270
00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:28.077
Police?

271
00:16:28.077 --> 00:16:30.377
Is something wrong with Mihiro?

272
00:16:30.377 --> 00:16:31.977
The thing is...

273
00:16:35.477 --> 00:16:37.677
No...

274
00:16:37.677 --> 00:16:40.077
Mihiro, why?

275
00:16:41.477 --> 00:16:43.077
There's no mistake that

276
00:16:43.077 --> 00:16:46.977
you were going to see Ms. Mihiro Kuze here today?

277
00:16:46.977 --> 00:16:48.677
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:48.677 --> 00:16:51.777
At a coffee shop in Shinjuku at 13:00.

279
00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:55.577
And you came to this park restroom in Harajuku

280
00:16:55.577 --> 00:16:58.677
after meeting her at the coffee shop?

281
00:16:58.677 --> 00:17:02.377
I haven't seen Mihiro at all today yet!

282
00:17:02.377 --> 00:17:05.877
Huh? But you both went to that shop?

283
00:17:05.877 --> 00:17:07.877
One came in after the other went out!

284
00:17:07.877 --> 00:17:10.077
About 10 minutes after the person wearing the Goth Lolita outfit

285
00:17:10.077 --> 00:17:12.777
went to use the restroom, she came.

286
00:17:12.777 --> 00:17:17.177
Then, Mihiro never came back from the restroom?

287
00:17:17.177 --> 00:17:19.777
No, sir! I had the person working here

288
00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:22.877
go check for her in the restroom,

289
00:17:22.877 --> 00:17:25.277
but there seems to have been no one there.

290
00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:29.077
That's why I kept calling Mihiro's cell phone every 10 minutes.

291
00:17:29.077 --> 00:17:31.677
But just couldn't seem to get through.

292
00:17:31.677 --> 00:17:34.077
And when I finally did get through...

293
00:17:34.077 --> 00:17:37.177
I answered the phone.

294
00:17:37.177 --> 00:17:38.677
Yes!

295
00:17:38.677 --> 00:17:42.777
But, why didn't you go check the restroom yourself?

296
00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:46.377
Because the restroom was outside the shop.

297
00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:50.877
I thought that it's not good to leave the shop

298
00:17:50.877 --> 00:17:52.577
before paying for something I ordered.

299
00:17:52.577 --> 00:17:54.477
Which means that you were in that coffee shop all the while,

300
00:17:54.477 --> 00:17:56.077
from the time you arrived there?

301
00:17:56.077 --> 00:18:00.277
Yes. I think the employee here can testify to that.

302
00:18:00.277 --> 00:18:04.677
I think it's only right to go take a look at the coffee shop then?

303
00:18:04.677 --> 00:18:08.277
I guess so, while your memories still fresh.

304
00:18:08.277 --> 00:18:11.677
Well, then, we'll head on for the shop,

305
00:18:11.677 --> 00:18:13.677
so Officer Takagi, you wait here!

306
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.577
If you come up with something, contact me!

307
00:18:15.577 --> 00:18:18.077
Yes, sir!

308
00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:20.277
What's the matter, Sonoko?

309
00:18:23.177 --> 00:18:27.077
Something just doesn't seem to feel right about her, don't you think?

310
00:18:27.077 --> 00:18:28.277
What about?

311
00:18:28.277 --> 00:18:31.077
Usually, when you wear Goth Lolita clothes,

312
00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:34.877
don't you manicure your nails black or white?

313
00:18:34.877 --> 00:18:38.877
She has nothing on her nails.

314
00:18:38.877 --> 00:18:40.877
Come to think of it, I don't think she had anything on

315
00:18:40.877 --> 00:18:44.177
from the time she came to the coffee shop.

316
00:18:44.177 --> 00:18:48.177
Didn't you find any fake nails on the floor of the toilet?

317
00:18:48.177 --> 00:18:51.577
No, nothing was found on the floor.

318
00:18:51.577 --> 00:18:55.577
Hey, what're you doing? Let's go!

319
00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:58.077
You guys are witnesses too, you know!

320
00:18:58.077 --> 00:18:59.577
Yep.

321
00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:05.377
Yes, she came!

322
00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:07.777
A little before 13:00...

323
00:19:07.777 --> 00:19:09.177
to this seat.

324
00:19:09.177 --> 00:19:12.977
Are you sure there's no mistake that it was her?

325
00:19:12.977 --> 00:19:15.177
Yes, I'm sure.

326
00:19:15.177 --> 00:19:18.077
She had a very small voice, though.

327
00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:19.677
Small voice?

328
00:19:19.677 --> 00:19:20.977
She asked me what time it was

329
00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:23.677
as soon as she got to her seat.

330
00:19:23.677 --> 00:19:26.877
I told her it was 12:56.

331
00:19:26.877 --> 00:19:30.577
Although the clock was right next to her seat.

332
00:19:30.577 --> 00:19:34.377
Is it true that she came to this shop

333
00:19:34.377 --> 00:19:38.177
about 10 minutes after this woman left for the restroom?

334
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.277
Yes.

335
00:19:39.277 --> 00:19:40.577
She said she was waiting for her friend

336
00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:43.277
who would be wearing Goth Lolita clothes.

337
00:19:45.577 --> 00:19:47.577
Oh my, I'm 10 minutes late.

338
00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:51.677
I think it was around 13:12.

339
00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:56.577
Was she at this seat all the while after that?

340
00:19:56.577 --> 00:20:00.477
Yes. It seemed she tried calling the woman

341
00:20:00.477 --> 00:20:02.977
who went to the restroom repeatedly though.

342
00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:07.077
If she's the culprit,

343
00:20:07.077 --> 00:20:09.077
she would've had to call the victim out to the park

344
00:20:09.077 --> 00:20:10.577
right after she went to the restroom,

345
00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:14.577
and come back after killing her.

346
00:20:14.577 --> 00:20:17.177
But from the shop to the restroom of the park,

347
00:20:17.177 --> 00:20:19.277
even if she were to use the train or a car,

348
00:20:19.277 --> 00:20:22.177
it would take at least 30 minutes to make a round trip.

349
00:20:24.477 --> 00:20:28.277
She couldn't have committed the crime.

350
00:20:28.277 --> 00:20:31.777
I'm sure she was cursed by a bad witch!

351
00:20:31.777 --> 00:20:33.677
What?

352
00:20:33.677 --> 00:20:36.477
Witch, Conan?

353
00:20:36.477 --> 00:20:39.077
Because the lady in Goth Lolita clothes

354
00:20:39.077 --> 00:20:42.377
looked normal in the picture of her driver's license,

355
00:20:42.377 --> 00:20:44.977
but when I saw her, she was wearing a dreadful look

356
00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:47.177
as if she were cursed or something!

357
00:20:47.177 --> 00:20:48.877
Idiot!

358
00:20:48.877 --> 00:20:50.677
When wearing Goth Lolita clothes,

359
00:20:50.677 --> 00:20:53.277
you make your skin look white by wearing pale coloured foundation

360
00:20:53.277 --> 00:20:56.977
and use mascara to make your eyes stand out!

361
00:20:56.977 --> 00:21:00.377
Right, right. Even if Sonoko or I were to do it,

362
00:21:00.377 --> 00:21:02.577
our make-up would look like that.

363
00:21:02.577 --> 00:21:04.877
If the same goes for the clothes,

364
00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:07.777
it'll be hard to tell one person from the other!

365
00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:16.577
Inspector, maybe this is...

366
00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:18.177
Yeah.

367
00:21:18.177 --> 00:21:22.077
I guess we'll have to check and see

368
00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:24.777
if the person who came to the shop was really Mihiro.

369
00:21:26.777 --> 00:21:28.277
A person dressed in Goth Lolita clothes

370
00:21:28.277 --> 00:21:32.377
was found dead in the restroom of a park.

371
00:21:32.377 --> 00:21:35.477
We were at this coffee shop in Shinjuku

372
00:21:35.477 --> 00:21:38.577
and witnessed the victim before she was killed.

373
00:21:41.277 --> 00:21:43.277
She sat down

374
00:21:43.277 --> 00:21:45.677
and went to the restroom right away.

375
00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:47.177
After about 10 minutes,

376
00:21:47.177 --> 00:21:49.677
the friend that she was waiting for appeared.

377
00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:54.477
After that, the woman in Goth Lolita clothes

378
00:21:54.477 --> 00:21:56.477
never came back to the shop.

379
00:22:00.177 --> 00:22:01.177
The victim is a person called

380
00:22:01.177 --> 00:22:04.477
Ms. Mihiro Kuze, a resident of Haido-cho.

381
00:22:04.477 --> 00:22:09.677
The one that was waiting for her was her friend, Ms. Yuika Shodo.

382
00:22:10.777 --> 00:22:13.077
Ms. Shodo was waiting for Mihiro all the while,

383
00:22:13.077 --> 00:22:15.377
but Mihiro never came back.

384
00:22:17.577 --> 00:22:18.677
From the park in Harajuku

385
00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:20.777
where the toilet that the body was found was,

386
00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:22.977
to this coffee shop in Shinjuku

387
00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:24.877
even if a car or train were used,

388
00:22:24.877 --> 00:22:27.077
it would take at least 30 minutes round trip.

389
00:22:28.577 --> 00:22:31.177
It would've been impossible for Ms. Shodo

390
00:22:31.177 --> 00:22:33.977
who was at the shop all the while, to commit the crime.

391
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:37.177
However, is it really so?

392
00:22:38.777 --> 00:22:43.577
I don't think we'll be able to close this case that easily!

393
00:24:07.377 --> 00:24:10.077
"Next Episode"

394
00:24:12.577 --> 00:24:14.977
So, you think it's strange after all?

395
00:24:14.977 --> 00:24:18.577
It isn't strange, but...

396
00:24:18.577 --> 00:24:22.477
But you were lucky that the glass cup cracked.

397
00:24:22.477 --> 00:24:24.877
Lucky?

398
00:24:28.577 --> 00:24:31.877
I won't let this case go to sleep, though.

399
00:24:31.877 --> 00:24:36.434
Next Conan, "Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 2)"

400
00:24:51.896 --> 00:24:54.096
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:54.096 --> 00:24:56.196
"Twins"

402
00:24:56.196 --> 00:24:59.596
Keep an eye on our fashion in the next episode.

403
00:24:59.596 --> 00:25:01.096
You're both in unison with each other!
