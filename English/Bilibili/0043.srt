1
00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:07.763
As times change, difficult cases
get more complicated!

2
00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:11.723
Today marks the 2nd year of
Conan! He gets into big trouble fast!

3
00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:14.103
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

4
00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:16.013
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

5
00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:18.353
His name? Detective Conan!

6
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.746
The Conan Edogawa Abduction Case.

7
00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:03.316
Conan-kun! Are you listening?!

8
00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:04.016
Eh?

9
00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:05.936
Don't give me, "Eh?!"

10
00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:09.726
It's been a long time since
your parents transferred overseas

11
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:13.226
and left you here!
Don't you miss them?

12
00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:14.436
Not really.

13
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:21.196
What lousy parents! They don't
show up even once, much less call!

14
00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:24.886
Not good! My lie's unraveling...

15
00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:30.996
Though they really are overseas
right now, so it's not exactly a lie...

16
00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:35.016
Wasn't it Professor Agasa
who brought him here?

17
00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:35.886
Yeah.

18
00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:41.006
Then shouldn't we at least ask
him how to contact his parents?

19
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.436
Y-You can't do that!

20
00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:44.296
Coming!

21
00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:48.516
Why not? Is contacting them
bad or something?

22
00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:54.726
N-Not good! I gotta act quick
or they'll find out I'm Kudo Shinichi!

23
00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:57.896
She's here, Conan-kun!

24
00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:01.526
Your mom!

25
00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:02.326
Eh?

26
00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:06.226
I'm so sorry, Conan-chan!
You must've been lonely all by yourself!

27
00:03:06.226 --> 00:03:08.156
But it's alright, now!

28
00:03:09.186 --> 00:03:11.496
Now let's go home!

29
00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:12.996
W-Who the heck are you?!

30
00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.686
Eh?! She's not your mom?!

31
00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:21.176
Dear me! He's just being sulky,
after being left alone all this time...

32
00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:28.346
My name is Edogawa Fumiyo.
Edogawa Conan's mother, in the flesh!

33
00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:32.686
N-No! Edogawa Conan
is an alias I invented!

34
00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:34.766
He can't possibly have parents!

35
00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:39.016
I appreciate everything!
I'll give you my thanks another day!

36
00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:40.806
Right! I look forward to it!

37
00:03:40.806 --> 00:03:42.236
Goodbye!

38
00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:46.156
Bye, Conan-kun! Send us
a letter when you get there!

39
00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:52.876
Miss! Don't forget your thanks!

40
00:03:57.056 --> 00:03:59.006
Bye-bye, Conan-kun...

41
00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:02.966
Who are you, lady?!

42
00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:07.516
I told you. I'm your mother!

43
00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:09.096
No! My mom is--

44
00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:10.806
Kudo Yukiko.

45
00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:17.386
Yes. Your mother was a beautiful
Japanese actress who enchanted men

46
00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:22.946
all over the world and won all the
major awards at the young age of 19.

47
00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:26.976
But she fell in love with
the young novelist Kudo Yusaku,

48
00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:30.686
married at 20, and then simply retired.

49
00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:35.016
She later had a son, but left
him behind to travel the world

50
00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:40.546
with Kudo Yusaku, now an
international-renowned mystery writer.

51
00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:45.926
Isn't that right,
Kudo Shinichi-kun, their son?

52
00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:52.886
Is she with those men in black
who shrunk me with their drug?!

53
00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.686
Hold it right there.

54
00:04:55.136 --> 00:05:01.726
Stay still, and I'll take you to
a nice place... A more fun place...

55
00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:07.636
Idiot! What're you doing?! Move!

56
00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:09.026
What do you think you're--

57
00:05:09.026 --> 00:05:11.696
Someone catch that kid!

58
00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:24.496
How? How did they find out who I am?!

59
00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:28.636
Was it because I used
the name "Kudo Shinichi"

60
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:30.966
during the karaoke murder case?!

61
00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:36.806
And then they heard from
somewhere that I was still alive...

62
00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:40.976
Dammit! I told the inspector
not to mention my name!

63
00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:47.406
I'm so stupid! It's all my fault!

64
00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:53.346
What now, Kudo Shinichi? Should
I go back and tell Ran everything?

65
00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:57.826
No, they'd be in danger
if I go back now...

66
00:05:58.226 --> 00:06:03.036
Dammit! What do I do?!

67
00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:05.966
What?! He got away?!

68
00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:12.426
Yes, I was careless. But it seems
the boy really is Kudo Shinichi...

69
00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:18.886
I see. To think he really did shrink...

70
00:06:18.886 --> 00:06:22.436
OK. Look for him. It'll be
a pain if he goes to the cops.

71
00:06:22.436 --> 00:06:23.686
But where?

72
00:06:23.686 --> 00:06:26.736
Don't worry. His next destination
will probably be "there"...

73
00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:28.516
Professor Agasa's House
Don't worry. His next destination
will probably be "there"...

74
00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:28.746
Don't worry. His next destination
will probably be "there"...

75
00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:32.436
Guess my only choice is
to talk with Prof. Agasa,

76
00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:34.616
since he knows the situation...

77
00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:39.726
But what's taking him so long?
Where is he wandering around now?!

78
00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.586
He's back!

79
00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:44.516
Professor!

80
00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:53.136
Sweet dreams, little boy.

81
00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:02.056
Where am I?!
Seems to be a kitchen, but...

82
00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:06.516
Dammit, my head's still swimming...

83
00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:09.596
I'm upstairs?!

84
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:14.866
I see. I was carried into this
old house while I was unconscious.

85
00:07:15.186 --> 00:07:17.496
Don't yell at me!
What? You still haven't killed him?!

86
00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:19.766
Don't yell at me!

87
00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:21.286
Those were the orders from above...

88
00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:26.296
It's that woman.
And is that a man in front of her?

89
00:07:27.686 --> 00:07:33.506
The organization wants him,
as an example of the drug's side-effects!

90
00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:36.966
Ah! So that's why she didn't kill me!

91
00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:38.926
Still, that man is--

92
00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.806
W-What?!

93
00:07:42.606 --> 00:07:46.846
Who is that masked man?!
Oh, crap! He's coming!

94
00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:50.516
Is he awake?!

95
00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:53.736
No, he's still drugged.

96
00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:58.846
Still, is that really high
school detective Kudo Shinichi?

97
00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.656
I still can't believe it myself.

98
00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:04.686
But the day Kudo Shinichi
went missing coincides

99
00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:08.126
with the day that boy
appeared at that agency,

100
00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:13.086
and all the crimes that happened
around him were solved easily.

101
00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:17.966
The only thing I can think of is
that the drug really did shrink him...

102
00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.076
Then shall I try it, too?

103
00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:23.096
Try?

104
00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:27.776
I have some of
their latest poison, too.

105
00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:35.066
If I make someone take it, we can
find out if it really shrinks people.

106
00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:37.786
But who do we give it to?

107
00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:41.516
The man we're
dealing with tomorrow.

108
00:08:41.516 --> 00:08:45.686
As soon as the deal is done,
we're supposed to get rid of him.

109
00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:47.796
It's the perfect chance to test the drug.

110
00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:52.216
What if we do find
out it shrinks people?

111
00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:56.506
For now, we'll just kill the
man we're dealing with, and then...

112
00:08:56.506 --> 00:08:58.466
...snuff out the kid.

113
00:08:58.466 --> 00:09:00.226
I just told you!

114
00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:06.936
Our orders are to take him back
so they can investigate its side-effects!

115
00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:09.186
They can't let
people know its secrets!

116
00:09:09.186 --> 00:09:10.316
But--!

117
00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.686
Enough!

118
00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:16.026
We're doing things my way.
Don't give me another corpse to carry!

119
00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:17.986
A-Alright...

120
00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:22.766
Anyway, did you tell the man
where tomorrow's deal is going down?

121
00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:25.266
Yes, using the usual method.

122
00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:29.346
The deal is at 1:00 pm.
Get sleep until then.

123
00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:38.636
Alright. They're both fast asleep...

124
00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:44.096
Yikes! He's sleeping with it on!
Talk about creepy!

125
00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:48.596
Anyway, I need to get these
ropes off and get outta here!

126
00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:50.846
A wine bottle!

127
00:09:50.846 --> 00:09:55.486
Alright! Wrap it in this mat and...

128
00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:59.056
Crap! Did they hear that?!

129
00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:03.996
Looks like I'm in the clear.
Okay! Now to use a shard to...

130
00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:10.226
Managed to get the rope off...

131
00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:13.556
...but how do I get
out of this upstairs room?

132
00:10:13.556 --> 00:10:17.126
Even with the snow,
it'd be too dangerous to jump out...

133
00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:20.596
Guess my only choice is
to hide in that fridge...

134
00:10:23.766 --> 00:10:25.056
What's that sound?

135
00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:29.726
Oh! That wine must
be dripping somewhere...

136
00:10:31.096 --> 00:10:32.516
W-What's this?!

137
00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:36.106
What? The kid's gone?!

138
00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:40.186
Yeah! He was gone when I got up!
He must've gone out the window!

139
00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:40.946
Damn him!

140
00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:49.266
He used the snow as a cushion
to get down! He's not getting away!

141
00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:52.936
What're you doing?!
Let's go find him!

142
00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:56.416
No, wait. He's still here...

143
00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:00.016
He's what?!

144
00:11:00.016 --> 00:11:03.566
He pretended to escape,
and is waiting for us to leave.

145
00:11:09.226 --> 00:11:10.516
There you are...

146
00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:13.936
Die!

147
00:11:26.344 --> 00:11:29.474
Oh, my. Your hunch was wrong.

148
00:11:29.474 --> 00:11:32.474
Well, he has no place to go anyway.

149
00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:36.224
After today's deal,
we'll find and eliminate him.

150
00:11:42.684 --> 00:11:44.624
I was sure I was a goner...

151
00:11:45.014 --> 00:11:49.974
Thank goodness I found this
storage area beneath the mat then...

152
00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:56.974
Alright! Guess I'll look for
that drug while I have the chance!

153
00:12:02.394 --> 00:12:04.724
Damn, can't find it...

154
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:10.614
Professor Agasa said we could
find a way to make me normal again

155
00:12:10.614 --> 00:12:12.574
if we figure out its composition...

156
00:12:13.224 --> 00:12:16.974
I guess he took
it all for today's deal...

157
00:12:19.144 --> 00:12:22.704
What's with this newspaper?
It has holes all over it...

158
00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:28.144
They must've cut out
letters to make a message

159
00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:30.674
for the guy they're dealing with...

160
00:12:31.224 --> 00:12:37.144
That's right! They said they're
going to kill that guy! This is bad!

161
00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:41.354
I hafta find out where the deal is,
stop the murder, and get the drug!

162
00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:48.644
Guessing the missing letters
gives I, Te, Ho, Be, Ru, and Ka.

163
00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:53.944
Rearranging them gives me "Beika Hotel"...

164
00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:55.574
The Beika Hotel!

165
00:12:56.394 --> 00:13:01.834
But it doesn't specify where in the hotel.
Are any other letters missing?

166
00:13:06.304 --> 00:13:09.304
No luck, none have been cut out...

167
00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:11.714
Cutter marks!

168
00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:17.224
Ah! It was the August
page above it that was cut!

169
00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:24.184
Which means the August day
above September 27th is... 30!

170
00:13:25.474 --> 00:13:29.234
"Beika Hotel 30!"
That's where their deal is going down!

171
00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:31.194
Beika Hotel

172
00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:34.264
But what does "Beika Hotel 30" mean?

173
00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:38.934
This hotel only has nineteen floors,
and there's no Room ♪30...

174
00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:41.664
♪ 19? One moment, please.

175
00:13:41.664 --> 00:13:45.954
That's it! It could be
a baggage number! Alright!

176
00:13:46.974 --> 00:13:48.114
Excuse me!

177
00:13:48.114 --> 00:13:48.894
Yes?

178
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:53.714
My daddy lost his number tag. It's ♪30...

179
00:13:53.714 --> 00:13:56.474
♪ 30?

180
00:13:56.474 --> 00:14:00.144
That's strange.
We only have up to ♪26...

181
00:14:01.434 --> 00:14:02.724
Huh? Little boy?

182
00:14:02.724 --> 00:14:05.934
Damn! Where is it?!

183
00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:10.234
Not good! It's already past noon!
And the deal is at 1:00!

184
00:14:10.234 --> 00:14:13.764
Oh no! I forgot my wallet in the car!

185
00:14:13.764 --> 00:14:14.864
Oh no.

186
00:14:14.864 --> 00:14:16.194
Where did we park again?

187
00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:18.284
♪42. Here's the key.

188
00:14:18.284 --> 00:14:19.994
Sorry! I'll be right back!

189
00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:21.934
T-The parking lot?

190
00:14:26.974 --> 00:14:32.754
This is the car parked on ♪30...
Could the deal be happening in here?!

191
00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:35.674
But there's no one inside...

192
00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.634
Hey! What're you doing?!

193
00:14:37.974 --> 00:14:39.954
What're you doing to our car?!

194
00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:43.144
Daddy! He must be a thief!

195
00:14:43.144 --> 00:14:47.104
No, it's not like that! I just
thought it was a cool car!

196
00:14:47.514 --> 00:14:50.564
These people seem
completely unrelated...

197
00:14:54.054 --> 00:14:56.524
Guess it's not here, either...

198
00:14:57.014 --> 00:14:59.614
Whoa, a huge man!

199
00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:05.034
What's he looking at?

200
00:15:05.934 --> 00:15:07.494
The parking space number?

201
00:15:11.554 --> 00:15:15.214
There's a small "1" written
in chalk next to the "30"!

202
00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:19.474
Ah! "301" must be
a room number at this hotel!

203
00:15:19.474 --> 00:15:23.424
And he's probably
the guy they're dealing with!

204
00:15:29.974 --> 00:15:31.204
The masked man!

205
00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:35.184
So this is where
they're making the deal!

206
00:15:39.054 --> 00:15:40.034
It's that woman!

207
00:15:41.144 --> 00:15:42.994
Oh, crap! I'm trapped!

208
00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:47.954
That masked man will kill me
for sure if he catches me again!

209
00:15:47.954 --> 00:15:52.224
What do I do?! What do I do?!
What do I do?!

210
00:15:53.394 --> 00:15:57.594
OK, Masao. The door locks by itself,
so you just need to close it!

211
00:15:57.894 --> 00:15:59.644
Well, be good while I'm gone!

212
00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:00.884
Have fun, Mommy!

213
00:16:01.264 --> 00:16:02.844
You're late.

214
00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:06.864
Uhh...

215
00:16:06.864 --> 00:16:07.764
B-Burglar!

216
00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:12.144
Shh! I'm not a bad guy!
I'm Space Detective Conan,

217
00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:15.654
I'm here to catch evil
aliens from Planet Ranpo!

218
00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:18.684
Liar! You're just a kid!

219
00:16:18.684 --> 00:16:22.934
I'm simply borrowing this
child's form to deceive my foes!

220
00:16:22.934 --> 00:16:24.894
Then show me your normal form!

221
00:16:24.894 --> 00:16:26.184
No, that's not--

222
00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:27.334
You are a burglar!

223
00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:27.874
Hold on!

224
00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:30.684
Just you wait! I'm gonna
call the cops on you!

225
00:16:30.684 --> 00:16:33.094
Stop that, Masao! Knock it off!

226
00:16:33.094 --> 00:16:34.624
T-That's my mommy's voice!

227
00:16:36.054 --> 00:16:39.594
I'm from Planet Ranpo!
I can use any voice at all!

228
00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:43.554
Wow! That's awesome!
You really are a space detective!

229
00:16:45.144 --> 00:16:47.474
Looks like I managed to
fool him with this voice changer...

230
00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:50.054
Hey! Is there any way I can help?!

231
00:16:50.054 --> 00:16:53.764
There sure is! For now,
I'd like to use your phone,

232
00:16:53.764 --> 00:16:55.444
and do you have any chewing gum?

233
00:16:55.444 --> 00:16:59.904
Yeah! I do! But what for?

234
00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:03.624
What?

235
00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:06.074
I've brought your food and wine!

236
00:17:06.074 --> 00:17:08.734
Eh? We didn't order any.

237
00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:10.934
Eh? But we got a call earlier...

238
00:17:10.934 --> 00:17:12.044
That's odd.

239
00:17:12.934 --> 00:17:16.224
It's fine. I am feeling hungry.
Have it brought in.

240
00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:17.004
But...

241
00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:19.464
Silence! Bring it in!

242
00:17:20.344 --> 00:17:22.644
Alright. Bring it in.

243
00:17:22.644 --> 00:17:23.804
Right...

244
00:17:25.434 --> 00:17:27.434
C'mon, pick up the pace!

245
00:17:27.434 --> 00:17:29.434
Now get lost!

246
00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:33.724
Gum in the lock?

247
00:17:41.264 --> 00:17:43.194
Well, let's start with a toast!

248
00:17:43.434 --> 00:17:47.154
Let me first introduce
our other guest...

249
00:17:47.514 --> 00:17:51.034
Other guest?! Don't tell me
that boy's under here!

250
00:17:52.974 --> 00:17:55.844
What? He's not here...

251
00:17:55.844 --> 00:18:01.444
The cart's a decoy.
He's really... inside this closet!

252
00:18:01.444 --> 00:18:03.294
Crap!

253
00:18:03.714 --> 00:18:04.574
Out.

254
00:18:04.574 --> 00:18:06.264
When did he get in there?!

255
00:18:06.804 --> 00:18:10.724
While we were talking
with the bellboy,

256
00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:14.764
he put gum in the door
to defeat the automatic lock.

257
00:18:14.764 --> 00:18:18.684
He then snuck in while
we were focused on the cart.

258
00:18:20.894 --> 00:18:23.654
Did you think
I'd fall for such a trick?

259
00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:27.974
Damn! My only choice
is my Anesthetic Watch Gun--

260
00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.114
It won't work!

261
00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:34.804
I had that interesting watch of
yours disabled after we caught you.

262
00:18:34.804 --> 00:18:35.454
What?!

263
00:18:35.844 --> 00:18:39.974
You'll regret the day
you underestimated me...

264
00:18:39.974 --> 00:18:42.884
...high school detective, Kudo Shinichi!

265
00:18:48.434 --> 00:18:49.514
A toy?

266
00:18:54.724 --> 00:18:57.474
You still can't tell? It's me!

267
00:18:57.474 --> 00:19:01.394
The world-famous
mystery writer, Kudo Yusaku!

268
00:19:01.394 --> 00:19:05.614
D-Dad?
Then don't tell me that lady is...

269
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:08.574
I'm sorry, Shin-chan!

270
00:19:08.574 --> 00:19:09.444
Mom!

271
00:19:10.014 --> 00:19:14.914
But the fact you couldn't tell means
I still have the skills as an actress!

272
00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:17.414
Which means that big guy is...

273
00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:19.044
Me!

274
00:19:19.044 --> 00:19:20.844
Professor Agasa!

275
00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:26.304
Don't be so mad!
We were worried too, you know!

276
00:19:26.304 --> 00:19:30.764
Yeah, Shin-chan! We stopped
by the house and you were gone!

277
00:19:30.764 --> 00:19:35.514
And then Prof. Agasa
told you about how I shrank,

278
00:19:35.514 --> 00:19:37.684
and then you cooked up this scheme?

279
00:19:37.934 --> 00:19:40.844
I tested your detective skills!

280
00:19:40.844 --> 00:19:46.474
And you successfully followed
all of our clues to make it this far!

281
00:19:46.474 --> 00:19:50.404
Everything was just as I had
calculated, until you were shot.

282
00:19:50.974 --> 00:19:54.974
So then you knew I was hiding
in that kitchen's storage area?!

283
00:19:54.974 --> 00:19:58.874
Of course! Well, you just
barely passed as a detective,

284
00:19:59.474 --> 00:20:03.474
but it's your own fault for
not realizing I was dressed as

285
00:20:03.474 --> 00:20:06.084
the Night Baron
character from my novels!

286
00:20:06.084 --> 00:20:10.464
You idiot! That was no time for that!
I thought I was about to die!

287
00:20:10.464 --> 00:20:15.804
Oh, is that so? Well, what do you
say we leave this dangerous country

288
00:20:15.804 --> 00:20:18.434
and live together leisurely overseas?

289
00:20:18.434 --> 00:20:19.564
Eh?

290
00:20:20.474 --> 00:20:21.974
That's right, Shin-chan!

291
00:20:21.974 --> 00:20:26.524
We did this so you would
realize the situation you're in!

292
00:20:26.524 --> 00:20:30.894
That's why I helped out
with their act, Shinichi-kun!

293
00:20:31.984 --> 00:20:38.324
I have friends in the Interpol.
I'll have 'em look into this organization.

294
00:20:38.514 --> 00:20:42.934
They'll get the drug at some point,
and you can be returned to normal.

295
00:20:44.304 --> 00:20:47.804
So let's put an end to this
dangerous detective game you're--

296
00:20:47.804 --> 00:20:49.134
Forget it!

297
00:20:49.134 --> 00:20:52.964
This is my case! I'll solve it!
You guys stay out of this!

298
00:20:52.964 --> 00:20:54.594
Shin-chan...

299
00:20:54.594 --> 00:20:58.974
Plus, I can't afford
to leave Japan yet.

300
00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:02.304
Shinichi!

301
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:05.644
It's all right.
Let's humor him for a while.

302
00:21:05.644 --> 00:21:07.144
Honey...

303
00:21:07.144 --> 00:21:10.404
But the instant things get dangerous,
we're taking you overseas.

304
00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:14.954
As it seems you have other
reasons for not wanting to leave...

305
00:21:17.394 --> 00:21:19.324
You're leaving your son with us again?!

306
00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:24.014
Yes, he insists on staying here...

307
00:21:24.014 --> 00:21:26.294
Still, Miss...

308
00:21:26.724 --> 00:21:30.004
Here is his upbringing expense.

309
00:21:30.344 --> 00:21:33.054
Use however much of it you like.

310
00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:36.094
10 million yen!

311
00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:40.344
Of course! I'd be delighted
to take care of your adorable

312
00:21:40.344 --> 00:21:42.514
and well-behaved son!

313
00:21:44.144 --> 00:21:45.534
Oh, and Ran-san.

314
00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:46.014
Yes?

315
00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:51.524
Please take care of him for me.
It seems he likes you.

316
00:21:51.524 --> 00:21:53.484
Oh! Really, Conan-kun?

317
00:21:53.644 --> 00:21:55.144
Yeah...

318
00:21:55.144 --> 00:21:56.594
Why you--

319
00:23:32.304 --> 00:23:34.974
That sure was fun!

320
00:23:34.974 --> 00:23:38.594
Dropping my manuscripts and
escaping to Japan was worth it!

321
00:23:38.594 --> 00:23:40.924
But will Shin-chan be all right?

322
00:23:40.924 --> 00:23:44.474
Don't worry. He'll admit
defeat sooner or later.

323
00:23:44.474 --> 00:23:47.394
Hey! What do you say
to a trip around the world?!

324
00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:48.604
Oh, that sounds great!

325
00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:49.724
There he is!

326
00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:55.274
It's the foreign magazine editors!
How'd they find me?!

327
00:23:55.274 --> 00:23:57.224
We got a call from your son!

328
00:23:57.224 --> 00:23:59.514
Now finish the last 308 pages!

329
00:23:59.514 --> 00:24:00.774
Screw that! I'm first!

330
00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:02.494
He stopped our presses!

331
00:24:02.494 --> 00:24:03.804
He got us good.

332
00:24:03.804 --> 00:24:05.644
Why that little--!

333
00:24:15.464 --> 00:24:16.964
W-What was that?!

334
00:24:19.974 --> 00:24:24.554
Looks like we can assume
dynamite was planted in this room.

335
00:24:25.054 --> 00:24:26.474
An act of tears?

336
00:24:26.474 --> 00:24:31.064
T-This knife!
Ryoji was behind this!

337
00:24:34.484 --> 00:24:35.944
You're the killer!

338
00:24:36.664 --> 00:24:38.294
On the next Conan--

339
00:24:38.294 --> 00:24:40.934
"The Three Hotta Siblings Murder Case."

340
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:01.061
Next Conan's Hint:

341
00:25:01.061 --> 00:25:01.062
Next Conan's Hint:
Fertilizer.

342
00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:02.937
Fertilizer.
