1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,640
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,440
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,240
Today, we must all change our way of thinking.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,740
What should be on, isn't?

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
His name is Detective Conan.

9
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,790
"A Mysterious Gunshot Echo In The Darkness"

10
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,090
So many handsome actors star in those Monday night mystery shows.

11
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,490
I'm so excited, I wonder what kind of stories we'll get to hear.

12
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,690
Good grief.

13
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,590
Just because our client's the president of some company produces movies,

14
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,590
this kid insisted on tagging along.

15
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,290
I think I already told you

16
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,490
but my job is to protect the client's mother!

17
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,690
I know that.

18
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,090
But she was injured when she was attacked 3 days ago, wasn't she?

19
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,890
Is being the president of a finance company such a dangerous job?

20
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,190
Well, I've heard she can be pretty vicious.

21
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,890
So that means she's got a lot of enemies, right?

22
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,090
I guess you could say that.

23
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,490
Yes?

24
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,990
My name is Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private investigator.

25
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,590
I have a 7'o clock appointment to see Ms. Etsuko Furukawa.

26
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,290
Yes, you're expected.

27
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,290
I'll unlock the gate now. Please come in.

28
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,190
This way.

29
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,390
Conan, we're going.

30
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,190
Okay!

31
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,090
Please have some coffee...

32
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,190
I'm terribly sorry about this, Ms. Furukawa is usually punctual.

33
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,790
No, don't be bothered.

34
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,890
-Excuse me. -Yes?

35
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,290
If it's alright with you, while we're waiting,

36
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,790
could we watch the television?

37
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,790
I'm sorry. That TV's been on the brink since this morning.

38
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,590
Nothing shows on the screen.

39
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,490
I see.

40
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,990
Idiot, you have some nerve asking like that.

41
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,190
Well...

42
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,590
Excuse me, Miss.

43
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,490
But the window on the far left on the 2nd floor facing the street was open.

44
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,890
That room belongs to the owner of this place,

45
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,190
Mrs. Katsue Furukawa, president of the Furukawa Finance.

46
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,690
Pardon me for asking, but who are you?

47
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,190
Kohji Furukawa.

48
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,890
I'm her son.

49
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,790
"Kohji Furukawa (22)" -That window is always open at this time of day

50
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,690
to air out the room.

51
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,890
Isn't that right, Azusa?

52
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,890
Yes.

53
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,890
You're that detective my sister hired, aren't you?

54
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,790
I pity you.

55
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,890
She's just going to use you.

56
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,590
You say use me?

57
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,990
I'm sure that's her now.

58
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,590
Yes?

59
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,190
"Etsuko Furukawa (40), Eldest Daughter TV Producer" -It's me, Etsuko.

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,790
I'm late. Hurry & let me in.

61
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,590
Yes, right away.

62
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,690
Mr. Mouri, I'm terribly sorry.

63
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,690
I had some last minute businesss to take care of.

64
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,990
Kohji?

65
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,290
Hi, sis, long time no see.

66
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,690
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,290
Didn't mom ban you from this house the last time you were here?

68
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,090
Shut up, this is my house.

69
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,890
And by the way, what's with that watch?

70
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,090
You said digitals were cheap stuff

71
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,290
and you wouldn't be caught dead with one.

72
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,990
Oh, I get it!

73
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,390
You had to pawn that Swiss watch you were so proud of

74
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,090
to pay for your debts.

75
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,390
That's none of your business!

76
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,790
By the way, Kohji,

77
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,590
I'll bet you're here to get mom to pay off your debts again, aren't you?

78
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,690
Shut up!

79
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,590
And what about you sis, hiring a private detective to butter mom up?

80
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,090
-It's so obvious. -How dare you!

81
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,690
Things seem pretty messy around here.

82
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,690
Sort of.

83
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,090
Ms. Etsuko's company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

84
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,290
And it seems Mr. Kohji has a lot of gambling debts

85
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,290
and some mobsters are after him.

86
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,690
But their mother Katsue has a lot of money.

87
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,990
Unfortunately, Mrs. Furukawa never lends money to those

88
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,590
she feels cannot repay her, regardless if they're her children.

89
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,390
In the past though, she did lend Kohji a lot of money

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,590
but it got out of hand

91
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,690
so she finally banned him from the house.

92
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,190
Azusa, what is wrong with you?

93
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,290
Yes, what is it?

94
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,290
What are you telling them?

95
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,890
I'm going to get mother!

96
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,990
She's alseep in her room, isn't she?

97
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,290
-Yes, she is. -Hey, Azusa!

98
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,690
Instead of doing everything my sister tells you,

99
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,890
you should go out with me sometime!

100
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,990
If I ask, I can get mom to forget

101
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,090
about all the money you owe her.

102
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,790
Kohji, if you have nothing better to do,

103
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,890
why don't you go out and buy something to give mom?

104
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,690
Let's go, Azusa.

105
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,690
Yes.

106
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,690
Darn.

107
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,390
About Azusa's debts...

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:35,290
Oh, I heard she made a stain on mom's Persian rug today.

109
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,090
Just for that, she's not getting a bonus this year.

110
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,490
And since that wasn't enough,

111
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,190
my mom made her write an IOU for the rest.

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,790
It's happened several times before,

113
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,490
One of these days, I'm sure she's going to blow up.

114
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,790
Oh, well, I guess I'll go and buy mom a little something.

115
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,890
I just hate taking sis's advice though.

116
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,990
What's with this family?

117
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,590
Mother.

118
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,190
Mother, wake up.

119
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,890
That's odd.

120
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,290
She usually gets up right away.

121
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,790
It's locked.

122
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,790
Maybe she took some of the sleeping pills the doctor prescribed

123
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,790
and fell asleep.

124
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,490
But it's still so early.

125
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,090
-And it certainly is hot. -It is?

126
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,890
I'm sweating.

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,590
Oh, my goodness.

128
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,790
What was that sound?

129
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,890
Mother! Mother!

130
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,490
Mother, open this door!

131
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,690
Is something wrong?

132
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,690
Mr. Mouri, something's wrong.

133
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,290
It came from mom's room.

134
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,290
Sis!

135
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,590
Didn't you hear a weird sound from mom's room?

136
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,090
I heard a gunshot in mom's room!

137
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,490
It's locked. Do you have a spare key?

138
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,190
The key was a special order item

139
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,990
and my mom has the only one.

140
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,990
There's no other choice, we've got to break the door down.

141
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,290
Right.

142
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,290
One, two!

143
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,190
One, two...

144
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,590
It's so dark, you can't see a thing.

145
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,290
Where's the light switch?

146
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,290
On the wall to your left.

147
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,090
Mother?

148
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,190
-Mother! -You mustn't go in there!

149
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,390
But...

150
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,690
This is a murder. We have to preserve the crime scene.

151
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,090
Mother...

152
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,990
-Ran, call the police. -Alright.

153
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,690
She's been shot in the forehead.

154
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,590
She died instantaneously.

155
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,090
There're no signs of a struggle.

156
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,590
Footprints lead to the window.

157
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,690
The killer must've used that ladder.

158
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,890
But the position of the body.

159
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,890
Why you! How many times do I have to repeat myself?

160
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,590
I'm sorry!

161
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,990
Come on and get out of here!

162
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,490
The victim is Katsue Furukawa,

163
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,190
64 years old, president of a finance company.

164
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,290
The footprints around the body

165
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,790
match those we found around the ladder outside.

166
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,090
I see.

167
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,290
The victim was attacked just 3 days earlier.

168
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,090
Maybe it was the same assailant.

169
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,690
Oh, officer.

170
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,890
If someone you didn't know came in through the window,

171
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,290
wouldn't you run for the door?

172
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,790
You little brat! I told you to stay out of this!

173
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,790
No, Conan's right.

174
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,690
Since the body was near the window,

175
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,990
we can assume the victim noticed the intruder

176
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,690
and approached the window.

177
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,390
Which means the intruder was probably someone the victim knew.

178
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,190
Let's question everyone who was in the house when the murder occurred.

179
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,190
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,790
About when you discovered the body,

181
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,290
Ms. Etsuko Furukawa and Ms. Azusa Machida,

182
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,290
you two went to the victim's room on the 2nd floor to wake her up,

183
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,390
and heard the gunshot.

184
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,890
So Mr. Mouri and Mr. Kohji Furukawa

185
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,490
broke the door down and then discovered the body.

186
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,190
Am I correct so far?

187
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,190
Yes.

188
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,390
When you heard the gunshot, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?

189
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,690
I'm very certain it was when Ms. Etsuko bent down

190
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,790
to pick up the handkerchief she dropped, that's when we heard the gunshot.

191
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,890
What about after the gunshot?

192
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,590
No, nothing.

193
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,390
Inspector, just a moment!

194
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,790
How long are you going to keep us here?

195
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,990
That's right!

196
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,490
It's obvious she was killed by the same person who attacked her 3 days ago.

197
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,290
Put out an all points bulletin, do something.

198
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,990
That's already been taken care of.

199
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,890
However, judging from the position of the body,

200
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,690
there's a good chance she knew her killer!

201
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,790
She knew the killer?

202
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,590
Are we suspects?

203
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,290
I left this morning and haven't been in mom's room!

204
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,790
Inspector Megure.

205
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,190
Thank you.

206
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,590
Azusa Machida.

207
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,090
Yes.

208
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,690
It seems the victim treated you quite badly.

209
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,590
According to your neighbor, you were complaining about it this evening.

210
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,490
You said, "I'll get back at her for this!"

211
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,790
I...

212
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,390
Azusa, you didn't...

213
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,290
You finally lost your temper, right?

214
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,590
No, you're wrong. I didn't do it!

215
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,690
It's true, I did say that,

216
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,990
but let me explain.

217
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,990
I spilled some tea in the madam's room this evening.

218
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,290
I wiped everything that got wet.

219
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,590
The clock, the remote control for the television, even the rug!

220
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,490
But madam insisted I stained the rug

221
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,890
and she said she wasn't going to give me a bonus this year.

222
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,090
Then on top of that, she made me write an IOU.

223
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,490
And that's why I said what I did.

224
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,290
But like I said before, when the gunshot went off,

225
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,990
I was outside the door with Ms. Etsuko.

226
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,790
Is that correct?

227
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,490
Yes.

228
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,190
Which means you two have an alibi...

229
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,890
And Mr. Furukawa, where were you then?

230
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,390
That's a good question.

231
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,190
Kohji, as soon as your sister and Azusa went upstairs,

232
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,990
you left the living room.

233
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,190
After the gunshot, you took some time before joining us upstairs.

234
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,590
-Didn't you? -Hold on just one minute.

235
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,190
I didn't kill her.

236
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,390
Then where were you?

237
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,290
I was going to go buy mom a gift.

238
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,990
And just as I was going out the gate,

239
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,890
I heard a strange sound so I rushed back.

240
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,290
Which means you have no alibi.

241
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,090
That's...

242
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,290
Why don't we just talk about this a little more?

243
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,590
The way things stand now,

244
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,390
Kohji does seem the most suspicious.

245
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,790
But something just doesn't seem right.

246
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,090
Alright.

247
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,690
-Please go and... -Mr. Tome!

248
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,290
Hey, there you are, kid!

249
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,490
Are you here to help that famous detective again?

250
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,690
Yeah, sort of.

251
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,090
He told me to ask you if there was a cassette radio

252
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,490
or something with a timer in the room.

253
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,190
I get it, if you set the timer, you can pre-set the gunshot, right?

254
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,890
Unfortunately, we didn't find anything like that,

255
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,990
the TV's an old model and it doesn't have a timer either.

256
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,490
I was wrong.

257
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,190
Thank you, Mr. Tome.

258
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,490
Okay.

259
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,890
Good hunting, little detective!

260
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,790
I was so sure there was a trick behind t that gunshot.

261
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,590
A blue-white light?

262
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,590
What nonsense are you talking about?

263
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,090
It's true!

264
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,690
Just before the gunshot, I happened to look up at mom's room.

265
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,290
And her room was lit up with a blue-white Iight

266
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,590
but it got dark right after that again.

267
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,390
You've got to believe me!

268
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,490
A blue-white light?

269
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,890
But Mr. Tome just told me...

270
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,390
What's going on here?

271
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,390
I've got it.

272
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,890
You can do it that way.

273
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,790
That's why that thing was there.

274
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,790
Hello.

275
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,890
Yes. Is it?

276
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,790
Thank you very much.

277
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,690
I knew it.

278
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,890
You're smart to pick up on that, kid.

279
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,690
That struck me as strange, too.

280
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,790
Now I have got all the evidence.

281
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,890
That person is the killer!

282
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,262
Hey, Conan!

283
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:14,462
Good grief, where's this solid proof you were talking about?

284
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,562
Here it comes.

285
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:21,862
It's happening again.

286
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,662
I'm counting on you, Pops.

287
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:27,262
Mouri!

288
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,762
Is it true that you know who the killer is?

289
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,062
Hey, Mouri...

290
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,162
I know that look!

291
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:37,062
Yes, Inspector Megure, I've figured everything out.

292
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,062
Have everyone come here to this room, please.

293
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,162
You've got it!

294
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:44,962
So everyone's present?

295
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:48,462
First of all, Inspector Megure, judging from the position of the body,

296
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:52,762
you've deducted the victim knew the killer, didn't you?

297
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:55,962
But when we broke the door down and entered the room,

298
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:58,762
the lights were all off.

299
00:15:58,762 --> 00:15:59,762
What?

300
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:03,962
Then how did the victim see the killer's face?

301
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:07,362
Wait, you mean...

302
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:08,562
That's right.

303
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,562
Mrs. Furukawa was killed earlier in the day

304
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:13,762
while there was still sunlight.

305
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:15,862
Are you sure?

306
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:19,762
But what about the gunshot we all heard?

307
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:25,062
That gunshot was staged by the killer to be used as an alibi.

308
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:27,262
The killer took the remote control for the television

309
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:31,662
and switched it on later to play the television.

310
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:33,462
But Mouri,

311
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:36,962
doesn't that mean the killer had to have prior knowledge

312
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,262
of the exact time the gunshot would be heard on television?

313
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:42,262
How could anyone...

314
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,562
Sis.

315
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:50,062
That's right, there's only one person here

316
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:51,462
who would know the exact time

317
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:54,262
a gunshot would be heard on the television.

318
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,862
The gunshot was heard at about 7:30.

319
00:16:56,862 --> 00:17:00,762
7:29 and 32 seconds to be exact.

320
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:04,662
It's the exact time a gun is shot

321
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:07,462
in a show Ms. Furukawa's company produces.

322
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:12,262
Yes, Ms. Etsuko Furukawa, you are the murderer!

323
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:18,062
The crime probably took place like this.

324
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,162
In the evening,

325
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:22,962
Ms. Furukawa climbed in through the window.

326
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:26,062
Her mother sees her and goes to the window.

327
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,762
And is shot by a gun with a silencer.

328
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:35,762
Ms. Furukawa then changed her clothes

329
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,662
and came to meet with us, acting as if nothing had happened.

330
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,062
Then calculating the time,

331
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,162
she took Azusa, who would act as her witness, upstairs

332
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:49,462
and deliberately dropped her handkerchief.

333
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:52,462
Then pretends to pick it up as she presses the remote control button.

334
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:58,262
Did I made any mistakes anywhere?

335
00:17:58,262 --> 00:17:59,562
I see.

336
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:04,162
So the blue-white light Kohji was talking about was from the television.

337
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:06,962
If even a second was off

338
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,462
from the timing of switching the remote control on,

339
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:13,062
other noises would have been heard and the trick wouldn't have worked.

340
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:17,862
That's why you wore a digital watch today, isn't that right?

341
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:21,862
And it was also you who broke the TV in living room, wasn't it?

342
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:25,062
When the gunshot was heard upstairs, it would've been suspicious

343
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,462
if the same sound came from the television downstairs, wouldn't it?

344
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:30,962
Can... can you prove any of this?

345
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:33,262
Do you have any proof I did it?

346
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,162
Of course, I do!

347
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:38,962
When the body was found, you pretended to cry and crouched down.

348
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:40,862
When no one was looking, you took the remote control out,

349
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,762
then slid it on the rug

350
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:46,462
and returned it under the table, didn't you?

351
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,862
But you put a little too much strength into it,

352
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,762
it was supposed to look Iike it fell from the table.

353
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:55,762
But it slid under the legs instead.

354
00:18:56,062 --> 00:19:00,062
Your fingerprints were on that remote control.

355
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,462
Of course, they would be!

356
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:05,962
I go in and out of this room practically every day!

357
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:11,562
But earlier you said you left the room this morning and never returned.

358
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,862
I was talking about today.

359
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,962
But I was in here yesterday and the day before, too.

360
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:18,062
Oh, really?

361
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,362
By the way, Azusa.

362
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,562
Yes?

363
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:26,562
What did you do with the remote control when you spilled the tea?

364
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:29,762
I told you, the tea spilled on it,

365
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:31,862
so I wiped it clean.

366
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:36,362
You're lying! I bet you forgot to wipe it!

367
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:41,862
I did not forgot! I wiped it absolutely clean!

368
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:46,462
That's enough, this argument is getting us nowhere.

369
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:49,962
Tome, please explain to everyone!

370
00:19:49,962 --> 00:19:51,662
Yes, sir.

371
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:54,562
Can I begin?

372
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,362
Anytime.

373
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,862
We found two sets of fingerprints

374
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:04,162
on the remote control found on the scene.

375
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,462
One, the left hand print of Ms. Etsuko Furukawa,

376
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,262
including the thumb to baby finger and palm print.

377
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:12,662
Second, the left hand print of Ms. Azusa Machida

378
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,762
including the thumb to baby finger and palm print.

379
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:16,462
See, what did I tell you?

380
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,862
Your prints are on it, too.

381
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,862
But, I...

382
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:23,862
Is that all, Mr. Tome?

383
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,162
That's all.

384
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:27,462
Then that settles it.

385
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,562
What do you mean by that?

386
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,462
Azusa didn't forget to wipe the remote control.

387
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:34,762
But just now...

388
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:36,562
Something was missing!

389
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,962
If she had forgotten to wipe the remote control,

390
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,562
something else had to be on it.

391
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:44,462
Katsue Furukawa's fingerprints, it was her room

392
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:46,362
and since she's always handling the remote control,

393
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,862
her prints should have been on it.

394
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:04,262
It was all her fault...

395
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,662
She knew I was having financial problems

396
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:10,962
but she wouldn't lend me a single cent.

397
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:15,262
Yet she'd pay off all of Kohji's gambling debts.

398
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:17,362
It was always that way!

399
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:19,562
It was always Kohji this, Kohji that.

400
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:23,362
She pampered him because she gave birth to him in her later years.

401
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:25,162
Kohji was everything.

402
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,862
Sis.

403
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,662
Ms. Furukawa.

404
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,862
It's not that I don't understand how you feel.

405
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:35,162
I do, but think about it,

406
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:38,062
you've just committed a murder!

407
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,862
You've killed your own mother!

408
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:46,762
I want you to think deeply about what you did.

409
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:25,662
There, that should do it.

410
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,262
It works.

411
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,362
Thank you so much.

412
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:31,762
It was nothing.

413
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:34,762
He may not flook it but Mr. Takagi's a video freak.

414
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:38,862
He s goes to rent videos every night, he's addicted...

415
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:44,362
Gunshots!

416
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:46,962
Look out!

417
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:51,162
I've got a case to solve.

418
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:55,362
Somebody tell him it's already over.

419
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,562
"Next Episode" -You've...

420
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:01,762
You've got to be kidding!

421
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,962
I'm not going to bathe with Conan, no way!

422
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:09,862
Something's come over Ran.

423
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,862
I wonder if she suspects who I really am?

424
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:18,662
Genta, what's wrong?

425
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:23,962
Next Conan,

426
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,883
"Perilous Return - Detectives in the Cave"

427
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,680
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,780
"Stray Bullet"

429
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,980
The next episode is the part of a special series.

430
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,280
Watch all the episodes and maybe you'll meet "you know who".
