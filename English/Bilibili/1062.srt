1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,205
There it is!

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,991
What is this?

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,109
There's no number plate.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,111
It could be dumped here illegally.

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,415
It is expensive to dispose of
abandoned cars these days.

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,516
Goodness.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,719
It would be dangerous
if some kids got inside!

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,221
It's so thoughtless of them!

9
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,200
But you're kids too...

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,025
Let's restart the game.

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,927
The weather report said there would be rain

12
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,129
in the evening, right?

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,230
Yeah...

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,901
What's wrong?

15
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,104
( Tamaki Onda (38) )
Is that a voice recorder?

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,606
( Tamaki Onda (38) )
Looks like it.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,216
Take this! It's an explosive Kojima Shoot!

18
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,119
Here comes a perfect block!

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,120
Look out!

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,722
Look out, lady!

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,424
What did you say?

22
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,725
Be careful.

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,226
What was that?

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,229
You were the one who didn't look around.

25
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,431
Hey!

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,903
It really is useless.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,404
Pardon?

28
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,506
It's just that I...

29
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,810
It's a bad habit of mine.

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,711
I tend to lose my temper.

31
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,213
Sorry about that.

32
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,316
I'm sorry, too.

33
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,826
You're amazing!

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,631
I used to play football at university, you know.

35
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,732
Here I go!

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,612
It looks like a heavy storm is coming.

37
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,714
Should we stop now?

38
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,716
I think that's a good idea.

39
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,319
Is it that time already?

40
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,321
She's late.

41
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,922
Are you waiting for someone?

42
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,923
Sorry?

43
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,625
Well, yes.

44
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,427
I'll stay here for a bit,

45
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,529
but you should all go home.

46
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,632
You wouldn't want to get wet and catch a cold.

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,201
Take care!

48
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,403
- Bye-bye!
- See you tomorrow!

49
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,832
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

50
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,600
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,302
Guided by the falling rain,

52
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,404
doubt grows over whether it's an accident.

53
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,906
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,807
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,010
His name is Detective Conan!

56
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:45,018
"Rain and the Spiral of Malice"

57
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,522
Today's weather makes yesterday's rain
seem like a dream.

58
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,124
And now for the news.

59
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,428
(A body inside an abandoned car by the Shiki River)
Early this morning, the body of a woman was found

60
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,031
inside an abandoned car by the Shiki River.

61
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,232
Based on the personal belongings found,

62
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,902
the body is identified
as 38-year-old Tamaki Onda,

63
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,705
who is the president of
a nearby design company.

64
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,210
- Conan.
- Conan!

65
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,112
You guys are here too.

66
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,314
I was shocked
when I watched it on TV.

67
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,418
Miss Tamaki was the lady
we met yesterday, right?

68
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,719
What's going on?

69
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,822
Why was she in that car?

70
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,725
You knew the late Tamaki Onda?

71
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,627
Is that true, you guys?

72
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:32,532
Yeah, we were practising our football
with her yesterday.

73
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,500
She was really good!

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,803
Did you know what time it was?

75
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,304
We were with her for about an hour

76
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,807
sometime after 3 pm. Right?

77
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,810
Right. And it rained

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,611
not even 30 minutes after that.

79
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,014
When was the estimated time of death?

80
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,317
I mean...

81
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,319
Uncle Kogoro told me to ask that

82
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,321
when he saw the news.

83
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,424
We're still waiting for the autopsy results
to know for sure,

84
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,928
but it was probably between midnight and 2 am.

85
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,229
You don't know why she died?

86
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,330
Well...

87
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,932
We found a bruise on her head

88
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,802
and a few on her body,

89
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,804
but since the body was soaked in water,

90
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,608
we're not sure which one killed her.

91
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,609
What about her personal belongings

92
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,010
or other things in the car?

93
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,115
Precious things such as her phone and wallet
were still on her...

94
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,516
That's it.

95
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,018
Do you remember seeing this?

96
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,820
Tamaki Onda had this in her hand

97
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,623
when she was found.

98
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,926
An earring. And only one of a pair.

99
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,929
She didn't wear it yesterday?

100
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,631
She didn't.

101
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,600
At least, she wasn't wearing that one.

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,502
Could it be the culprit's earring?

103
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,504
Was that lady murdered?

104
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,805
No way!

105
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,508
No, we can't conclude that just yet.

106
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,309
Even if she didn't wear those earrings,

107
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,111
it could be one of a pair she owned

108
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,313
that fell in the area.

109
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,415
Did you find any fingerprints?

110
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,416
She was holding that earring,

111
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,219
so we could only find her fingerprints.

112
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,350
That's what forensics told me.

113
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,324
Is that everything from the scene?

114
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,427
Was there a voice recorder?

115
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,328
A voice recorder?

116
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,130
She had one that looked like this.

117
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,832
Could you show me?

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,402
We didn't find any.

119
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,404
Perhaps it fell somewhere.

120
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,806
Thank you.

121
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,708
Oh, man. There aren't any witnesses.

122
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,910
Not even one?

123
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,013
There was heavy rain last night.

124
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,116
Nobody was walking outdoors.

125
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,318
Could it have been an accident after all?

126
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,021
It's very likely.

127
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,723
The problem lies in what she was doing

128
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,126
after we said goodbye to her.

129
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,828
Isn't it better to investigate it

130
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,530
both as an incident and as an accident,
just in case?

131
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,403
I think that's what Uncle Kogoro would've said.

132
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,807
You're right. As expected of Detective Mouri.

133
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,709
Let's get started right away.

134
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,611
I hope you guys
in the Youth Detective Squad

135
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,913
don't get in the way, okay?

136
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,615
Okay!

137
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,419
(Cheetah Delivery Service)

138
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,523
What's the matter?

139
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,201
This must be it.

140
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,404
(Cheetah Delivery Service)

141
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,610
You're completely useless!

142
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,582
How long will it take for you
to know what to do?

143
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,582
Just be grateful that we hired you at all

144
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,518
after getting out of prison, you scum!

145
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,619
Excuse me?

146
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,418
Did I say something wrong?

147
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:43,222
Don't you know your position here?

148
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,725
What's the matter?

149
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,227
Do you have a problem with anything?

150
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,532
That's enough.

151
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,001
We're the police.

152
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,103
Officer Takagi!

153
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,905
You guys...

154
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,850
Why are you here?

155
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,150
(Metropolitan Police Department)

156
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,809
(Metropolitan Police Department)
The fingerprints matched?

157
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,214
Yes, his fingerprints matched
the ones we found

158
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,517
on the glasses the late Onda was wearing.

159
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,219
So there was a previous record.

160
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,320
That's right.

161
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,822
Ryuji Koyabu, 32 years old.

162
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,724
He was arrested a year ago

163
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,690
for causing serious injury during a fight.

164
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,927
( Ryuji Koyabu (32) )
for causing serious injury during a fight.

165
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,150
( Ryuji Koyabu (32) )
He was in prison until last month.

166
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,000
He was in prison until last month.

167
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,233
Then that means it was a crime.

168
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,601
Did he kill that lady

169
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,204
and pushed her into the abandoned car?

170
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,807
How cruel. That's so pitiful.

171
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,710
No, about that...

172
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,414
He was out on delivery
between 12 and 2 am,

173
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,115
which was the estimated time of death.

174
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,918
It was supported by a witness's account.

175
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,321
In other words, he has an alibi.

176
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,822
That's it.

177
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,426
Hello?

178
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,727
It's Chiba.

179
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,330
I visited Onda's company office

180
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,732
and found something unbelievable.

181
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,104
That should be enough gravel.

182
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,850
Try placing the mannequin child.

183
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,809
Okay.

184
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,111
You must be Yurina Shirosaki.

185
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,213
Police?

186
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,615
Yes.

187
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,516
(Metropolitan Police Department,
Beika Police Station)

188
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,519
Is this your earring?

189
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,722
( Yurina Shirosaki (25) )
It's not.

190
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,620
( Yurina Shirosaki (25) )

191
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,228
That's strange.

192
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,530
A witness testified that you wore this

193
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,600
during a company presentation yesterday.

194
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,900
It must've been a mistake!

195
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,205
Did she have an alibi too?

196
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,807
Yes. At the estimated time of death,

197
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,110
she said she was conducting a project

198
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,212
at the shopping district.

199
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,713
If this were a crime,

200
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,017
both are likely to have been the culprit.

201
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,718
We're at a loss.

202
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,321
If both of them have alibis...

203
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,623
In that case, you should inspect it again.

204
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,025
Teacher!

205
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,426
Let's go right away!

206
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,828
You're right... But come on...

207
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,231
We can't exactly have you come along.

208
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,901
But since we were the last ones
to see her alive,

209
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,603
there might be something that only we'd notice.

210
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,204
You're right.

211
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,007
You may have a point.

212
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,809
All right!

213
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,915
(Pickup Counter)

214
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:28,600
We started by
reconsidering Ryuji Koyabu's alibi.

215
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,423
As I said before,

216
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,924
he was here at that time.

217
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm sure of it.

218
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,928
What was the exact time?

219
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,230
Well...

220
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,533
He clocked in at 12:35 am,

221
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,003
and he finished loading
and unloading at 1:05 am.

222
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,105
Did he go out at any point?

223
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,606
That wouldn't have been possible.

224
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,108
Everyone in the group was together

225
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,710
while loading and unloading.

226
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,714
Did you notice anything
that was out of the ordinary?

227
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,116
Come to think of it...

228
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:01,320
He came in later than usual by 30 minutes.

229
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,422
Does that usually happen?

230
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,624
No, that was the first time.

231
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,129
We went on the delivery route

232
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,431
and decided to
visit every delivery centre

233
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,900
that he stopped by.

234
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,903
He indeed came in late

235
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,007
by 30 minutes at several centres.

236
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,110
The first place he was recorded to
have been late was here

237
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,812
at the West Beika delivery centre.

238
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,615
And the delivery centre before that

239
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,717
was the one in North Beika,

240
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,920
which was close to
the riverbed where it happened.

241
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,725
In other words, there was a 30-minute interval
between the two.

242
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,828
And that was when something
related to the incident occurred.

243
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,829
Right.

244
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,333
Let's look into the security cameras in the area.

245
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,003
In that case, shouldn't we
visit the local police stations?

246
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,405
We can ask about any changes that happened.

247
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,007
We'll do that on our own.

248
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,209
However...

249
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,816
There aren't any security cameras.

250
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,118
There's nothing over here either.

251
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,419
Or here.

252
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,626
It's useless, huh...

253
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,931
Hello?

254
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,902
A minor collision?

255
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,804
It happened last night at 11:30 pm.

256
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,608
But it wasn't caused
by Koyabu's delivery truck

257
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,311
so it may be unrelated to the incident.

258
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,612
What?

259
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,014
The driving recorder?

260
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,415
Conan!

261
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,518
Yes. Try looking at
the driving recorder of the vehicle

262
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,920
that caused the accident.

263
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,122
There could be something.

264
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,723
Look!

265
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,301
Madam!

266
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,804
What's with the earring on the dog's collar?

267
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,608
She picked it up on a bench next to
the riverbed yesterday.

268
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,609
I put it on her collar

269
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,712
so that its owner would notice.

270
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,014
She's such a good dog.

271
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,516
Did you see anything else?

272
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,419
Maybe a brooch like this one?

273
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,922
I didn't see anything like that.

274
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,624
Could it be...

275
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,602
Those two are definitely hiding something.

276
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,205
Takagi, Chiba.

277
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,908
Is it true that Detective Mouri
has found a hint

278
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,010
that could lead to solving this case?

279
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,511
Yes, Inspector.

280
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,913
First, take a look at this.

281
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,618
It's driving recorder footage from two cars

282
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,520
that caused a minor collision last night.

283
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,722
Here.

284
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,223
Take a look, sir.

285
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,329
What's this?

286
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,800
This is from the other car,

287
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,803
filmed ten minutes later.

288
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,409
Was it going in circles?

289
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,311
But why on earth...

290
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,913
Why is that?

291
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,517
Koyabu, do you mind explaining the reason?

292
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,121
If only the rain...

293
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,823
If only the rain wasn't so heavy,

294
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,525
I could've avoided it!

295
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,429
Be careful!

296
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,832
I genuinely thought I had run over her.

297
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,000
And then...

298
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,311
Take me to the hospital.

299
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,313
Take me there, now.

300
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,515
I had a previous record,

301
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,017
so I thought that rather than
being taken to the police station,

302
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,320
it would be better to
rush her to a hospital somewhere.

303
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,521
But suddenly...

304
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,523
That's why it's useless!

305
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,326
I could've started again if I did it wrong.

306
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,828
I could've done it over and over!

307
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,229
I was shocked.

308
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,100
I thought perhaps that she knew me.

309
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,401
After being released from prison,

310
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,805
I thought I could start over.

311
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,207
But I was threatened by some of my old friends

312
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,508
and stole valuable things

313
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,311
from inside some parcels.

314
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,013
I had no other choice!

315
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,816
Turn back.

316
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,519
She told me to turn back

317
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,122
because she had lost something important to her.

318
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,226
I thought she wanted to
go to the police station.

319
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,028
When we got there,

320
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,131
I meant to stop her from exiting the truck.

321
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,411
Despite asking to go to the hospital,

322
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,313
she seemed to be moving fine,

323
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,014
so I thought there wouldn't be a problem.

324
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,720
After that, the rain got heavier,

325
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,322
so I became worried.

326
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,124
But when morning came...

327
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,836
Why?

328
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,029
Now, Yurina Shirosaki.

329
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:16,902
Didn't you meet Tamaki Onda yesterday?

330
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,164
We found the other half of your earrings.

331
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,836
Your fingerprints were on it.

332
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,836
She criticised my presentation.

333
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:32,818
She envied me for my talent.

334
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,921
That's why she stole my design

335
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,023
and claimed it was her own.

336
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,926
It's happening again.

337
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,128
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't come up with this.

338
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,631
You're such an idiot!

339
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,801
You're right.
I'm an idiot for showing it to you.

340
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,503
I'm going home,
so give me my tablet back!

341
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,805
What was that?

342
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,807
Who do you think you're talking to?

343
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,608
Let go of the tablet!

344
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,711
The design on that tablet
is not for you to see!

345
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,013
Let go of it!

346
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,714
What are you saying?

347
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,816
Let go of it!

348
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,919
You... You!

349
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,423
It's all your fault!

350
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,200
But it was raining heavily,

351
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,402
so I got worried...

352
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,307
I went back after some time,

353
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,908
but nobody was there.

354
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,611
I thought it wouldn't be a serious matter,

355
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
just something related to work.

356
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,115
But why...

357
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,117
It could be that just before that,

358
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,119
Onda thought that
she had to go to the hospital

359
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,123
because of the pain and bleeding
from her injury.

360
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,726
She could have walked unsteadily to a road

361
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,630
and met with Koyabu's vehicle.

362
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,732
I wouldn't have known.

363
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,300
Me neither.

364
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,204
But if she hadn't said
those horrible things in the first place...

365
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,306
I don't think that's the case.

366
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,210
I see!

367
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,614
That lady was talking about herself!

368
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,717
It really is useless.

369
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,218
Pardon?

370
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,220
It's just that I...

371
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,124
I wouldn't have thought...

372
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,826
Officer Takagi.

373
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,530
Have you found Miss Tamaki's voice recorder
since then?

374
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,331
No, we still haven't.

375
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,100
A voice recorder?

376
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,902
I heard about it from a co-worker

377
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,004
who had known Onda for a long time.

378
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,406
She always used a small voice recorder

379
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,509
in place of a personal notebook.

380
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,912
We still haven't found it.

381
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,614
By the way, the other earring was found

382
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,016
in Miss Tamaki's hand.

383
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:49,321
Could the voice recorder be
in your handbag, then?

384
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,523
That... That can't be.

385
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,205
As expected of you, Conan!

386
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,211
Yurina will be coming soon.

387
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,715
But maybe I should stay silent about it.

388
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,519
Until she recognises her mistake and fixes it,

389
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,323
I'll trust Yurina.

390
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,624
She knew?

391
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,127
What do you mean by that?

392
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,030
The co-worker said this.

393
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,400
Tamaki thought of you as her successor.

394
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,804
She could've been strict
with you because of that.

395
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,607
No way. Tamaki...

396
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,812
But I did it too.

397
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:51,516
I stole an anonymous design off the Internet.

398
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,123
So, when I saw her...

399
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,226
She was probably slipping in
and out of consciousness

400
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,030
and didn't recognise who you were.

401
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,132
After that, she got into the abandoned car

402
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,180
to shelter herself from the rain.

403
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,904
Then,

404
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,307
she lost consciousness.

405
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,012
The truth captured
by the recording devices.

406
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,116
It was a spiral of negativity
without killing intent

407
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,218
that led to her death.

408
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,523
But still, you were both worried about her

409
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,226
after leaving her alone.

410
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:38,530
If you had looked for her
or turned back then,

411
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,900
she could've been saved instead.

412
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,505
It's unfortunate.

413
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,127
Afterwards,

414
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,730
the cause of Tamaki Onda's death
was established.

415
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,132
The wound from the hit,

416
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,901
the wound from the vehicle bumping into her,

417
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,803
and the fact that
she was left alone for a long time,

418
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,105
resulted in death from blood loss.

419
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,609
Neither wound was fatal on its own.

420
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,112
As for how the trial
will decide the punishment

421
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,815
for the two who injured her,

422
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,217
that will be another story.

423
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,719
Yeah!

424
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,026
(Next Episode)
So, what business

425
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,520
does a chick appraiser like you have with me?

426
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,731
To tell the truth,

427
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,201
it seems that my life is in danger.

428
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,504
Do you have an idea why?

429
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,706
No, I don't.

430
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:05,410
But that's why I wanted you
to investigate first.

431
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,513
Look out!

432
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,916
Next Conan,

433
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,020
"The Chick Appraiser in Danger"

434
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,305
Next Conan Hint:

435
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,806
"A hand"

436
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,408
Super Elegant Pass!

437
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,509
Hyper Ultra Hand!

438
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,711
You're not supposed to use your hands.
