1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,124
Mr. Mouri, it was raining really bad this morning,

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,424
but didn't you get wet?

3
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:07,124
No.

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:08,324
I see.

5
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:11,624
But what a large vineyard you have.

6
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:15,224
Is this vineyard all for your winery, Yurika?

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,524
Yes, I inherited it from my late father.

8
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:24,724
And I am now co-managing the Suwayama Winery

9
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:28,224
together with my husband who was studying agriculture

10
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:30,924
and friend, Mr. Mizumachi.

11
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:32,124
I see.

12
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:35,624
"Yurika Suwayama (28)" -I'm not too good about vineyards and all,

13
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:38,124
"Joint manager of a winery" -so I depend on the two, you see.

14
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:42,024
I'm looking forward to seeing the wine!

15
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:44,724
Don't over drink, Pops.

16
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:47,624
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

17
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,524
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

18
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:51,224
An incident occurs at the winery.

19
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:53,124
An alibi trick at the vineyard.

20
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,724
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:56,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,324
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,645
"A Rose in a Vineyard".

24
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,445
This is very elegant tasting wine!

25
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,545
To comment that this wine is elegant...

26
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,945
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?

27
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:12,045
Well, I guess so

28
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:15,645
because I'm quite picky when it comes to wine.

29
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,545
You just said what came to mind at random, right?

30
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:22,145
"Akihiro Yamaguchi (41)" -I run several restaurants in Tokyo.

31
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,745
"Restaurant manager" -My name is Akihiro Yamaguchi.

32
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:27,345
I am in love with Suwayama wine.

33
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:30,345
So, I'm scheduled to sign a contract with them today.

34
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,645
I see!

35
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:36,645
It's true that this wine is different from other wines.

36
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:41,245
On top of that, the owner, Yurika, also a very beautiful lady.

37
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:43,445
I'm sorry, Mr. Yamaguchi.

38
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:44,745
What seems to be the matter?

39
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:49,645
I can't seem to find Kengo who has the contract.

40
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,045
I think we'll find it right away though.

41
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,545
Again?

42
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:56,445
Yes. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,345
Her husband, Kengo,

44
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:02,845
is a professor type and not easy to get along with,

45
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,845
and is also too absorbed in making wine.

46
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,745
When I saw him previously...

47
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,045
"Kengo Suwayama (33), Yurika's husband" -I'm not going to sign a contract

48
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,445
"An agriculturist" -that's bound to lower the taste of Suwayama wine!

49
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,045
Well, I guess it's his adherence to his ways that makes this Suwayama wine.

50
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:23,145
But, the contract this time is not a bad one.

51
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,345
I feel sorry for Yurika.

52
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,745
Mr. Mizumachi.

53
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:30,745
"Tomoaki Mizumachi (34), Joint owner of the winery" -Did you see Kengo?

54
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,945
No. I haven't seen him since I saw him this morning.

55
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,245
"Shuji Takashina (28), Employee at the winery" -Maybe he's hiding

56
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,445
because he doesn't want to see Mr. Yamaguchi?

57
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,445
Maybe he's not convinced after all.

58
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,245
Don't worry, Yurika.

59
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,945
Although he hasn't shown up,

60
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:47,345
it seems Kengo has come to agree with the contract.

61
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:48,345
Huh?

62
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,445
See, take a look at this.

63
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:52,545
I found it on the desk of the barn.

64
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:55,945
So Kengo signed the contract already!

65
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,745
I'm happy for you.

66
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:00,845
Mr. Yamaguchi, the contract's been found.

67
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,645
This completes the contract!

68
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:08,345
I'm counting on you, Mr. Yamaguchi.

69
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:10,445
Yurika, Mr. Mizumachi,

70
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,045
we're going to be partners from now on,

71
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,045
so please discuss what you have to anytime with me.

72
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,445
We will.

73
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,945
I wonder where Kengo disappeared to though.

74
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:24,145
I will go look for Kengo at the barn on the south vineyard.

75
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:26,045
Mr. Mizumachi,

76
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:27,345
could you take Mr. Mouri and his party

77
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:30,345
on a tour of our vineyard for me in the meantime?

78
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:35,445
In the vineyard to the south over there is the Cabernet Sauvignon

79
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:39,245
and in the vineyard to the north, are the Pinot Noir grapes.

80
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,645
The south is of red clay soil,

81
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,245
whereas the north is of sand and gravel soil.

82
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:46,545
Although in the same vineyard, the type of soil is different.

83
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:50,545
So, we are growing different types of grapes that match the soil.

84
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:52,245
Is that how it works?

85
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:55,645
There's a fog over the vineyard and it looks beautiful.

86
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:58,945
That's not fog, but natural insecticide.

87
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,645
It is sprayed every day between the hours of 13:00 to 16:00.

88
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,645
It's about ending time now.

89
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:07,745
You're also growing roses?

90
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:10,745
No, these roses aren't for viewing

91
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,845
but rather to keep pests away.

92
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:16,845
Of course, it's not that the roses keep the pests away, though.

93
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:20,545
The roses are weaker than the grapes when it comes to pests and illnesses.

94
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:23,045
So, they wither before the grapes.

95
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:24,945
When the roses wither,

96
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:28,045
it means that danger is closing in on the vineyards, then.

97
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:33,045
Hey, do you grow different types of roses, depending on the vineyard?

98
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:35,245
No, they're the same type.

99
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:38,145
But, the colors of the roses are different.

100
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:41,845
That's not because the type of roses is different.

101
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:43,945
Hey, Yurika!

102
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:48,045
Did you find your husband?

103
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:49,745
No.

104
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,245
Since he's nowhere in sight,

105
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,545
I was thinking of going to look for him

106
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,245
in the barrel cellar that's in the north vineyard from now.

107
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,445
Barrel cellar?

108
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:01,845
Yes, wine that is ageing before bottling is there.

109
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:04,245
When you say ageing, does that mean

110
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,445
that you get to drink wine that is not aged?

111
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,545
I would really like to go there with you!

112
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,745
At all costs, Yurika!

113
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:13,645
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

114
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,845
Okay, shall we all go then?

115
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,245
Thank you!

116
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:41,445
This is...

117
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:51,245
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,945
This is homicide.

119
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,545
After tying his arms and legs,

120
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,545
his neck was hung using this stake.

121
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,745
Ridiculous! It can't be.

122
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,545
He couldn't be dead.

123
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:08,045
Hey! What do you mean by he couldn't be dead?

124
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,645
Detective Momoi!

125
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:22,445
The estimated time of death of the victim has been determined.

126
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:25,245
"Detective Momoi (32)" -It was around 13:30 to 14:30 today.

127
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:26,645
"of Yamanashi Prefectural Police Department" -I see.

128
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:29,245
What were you doing at that time?

129
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:32,245
I was working alone at the barn in the south vineyard

130
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,245
under order of Yurika.

131
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,645
Which means that

132
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:40,745
there is no one who can verify your alibi for you?

133
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:42,445
Hey, please wait!

134
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:46,245
I was asked by Yurika to confine Kengo in here and that's all I did!

135
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,945
I did tie him, but I didn't kill him!

136
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,145
Please believe me!

137
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,445
I didn't ask him to do such a thing!

138
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,445
Why you... Yurika...

139
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:55,445
Yurika.

140
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:58,645
Will you please give me your alibi during that time while we're at it?

141
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:03,145
I, Kogoro Mouri will guarantee Yurika's alibi!

142
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:04,545
Today at 13:30,

143
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,445
she came to pick us up at the station.

144
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,945
And we arrived at the winery about 14:30.

145
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,045
After that, Yurika was with us right through.

146
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,845
I see.

147
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:21,245
Come to think of it, at about 15:30,

148
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:25,245
I headed for the barn in the south vineyard to search for Kengo.

149
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,545
Well, that has nothing to do with the time of death,

150
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:30,145
so that's no problem.

151
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:34,145
And we met Yurika again

152
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:35,945
at around a bit pass 16:00.

153
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:38,045
At this barrel cellar in the north vineyard,

154
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:42,045
we found the corpse at 16:30.

155
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:43,545
I see.

156
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:45,945
And, you two from around 13:00 till now

157
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:50,145
were in the winery facility? Is that correct?

158
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,745
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,745
I...

160
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,945
Early this morning, in the rain,

161
00:09:55,945 --> 00:10:00,345
I saw Kengo and Mr. Mizumachi walking towards the barrel cellar.

162
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:03,545
By the way,

163
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:06,445
how many of you have the key to the barrel cellar?

164
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:09,345
Me, Mr. Mizumachi and Kengo.

165
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:11,845
And, Yurika also has one.

166
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,645
The victim's key was in his pocket.

167
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:16,845
And,

168
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,245
the lock of the barrel cellar was locked.

169
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,545
In other words, the culprit is someone who has the key

170
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:27,945
and moreover, has no alibi during the time of the death of the victim.

171
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,845
Officer,

172
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:32,145
I really can't understand.

173
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,345
Hey, you!

174
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:35,845
Why did the culprit go out of the way

175
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,445
to take Kengo's body over to the wall?

176
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:41,045
Huh, take the corpse over?

177
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,345
Yep. Because take a look at that.

178
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,245
The two black lines

179
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,045
are traces of shoe marks scraping along the floor, right?

180
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:52,345
It's true that it matches the toes of the victim.

181
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,545
If the tip of his shoes were scraped,

182
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:57,545
that means that Kengo was lying face down.

183
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:01,845
Besides, those lines are almost in one straight line, aren't they?

184
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,345
Which means that he didn't put up a fight.

185
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:08,245
In other words, it means that he was already dead by then.

186
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:09,745
I see.

187
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:13,445
That's why such strange marks are left on his neck.

188
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:16,245
The traces of the strangulation mark

189
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:19,645
lead from the bottom of his throat to the base of his neck.

190
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,245
Means that the corpse was lying on his stomach

191
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:25,845
and the culprit strangled the victim from behind.

192
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,145
I see.

193
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,845
But why did the culprit after killing the victim,

194
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:33,045
hang him from the wall?

195
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,845
Huh? Why is the way the rope is tied different?

196
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:41,945
This knot is just a plain square knot,

197
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:44,145
but the rope that tied Kengo's arm and legs

198
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:45,945
are two half hitched.

199
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,545
Two half hitches?

200
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:52,445
I saw Mr. Mizumachi tying a string in the vineyard a while ago.

201
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,745
Two half hitch tying is difficult to loosen,

202
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,245
so it is used in agriculture

203
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:59,845
and is a special way of making a knot.

204
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,545
True! The knots are different.

205
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:04,845
It's strange.

206
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,045
Why did the culprit tie a square knot

207
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:11,245
that may loosen up only on this side?

208
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,145
If Mr. Mizumachi were the culprit,

209
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:16,045
he would probably tie it so that the rope used as the murder weapon

210
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,445
would not loosen up.

211
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,345
Maybe the person who tied his arms and legs

212
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:23,645
and the person who tied the rope around his neck

213
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,245
are different people?

214
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,245
But, the only person here that doesn't have an alibi

215
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,345
is Mr. Mizumachi alone.

216
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:30,645
Exactly.

217
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:33,245
Everyone except Mr. Mizumachi has an alibi.

218
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,545
Oh no, there's mud on!

219
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,845
I love these shoes and yet...

220
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,345
I see.

221
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,445
Mud!

222
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,645
I see.

223
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:57,145
That person created an alibi with this!

224
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,795
Are you all right, Yurika?

225
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,895
I'm sure that Mr. Mizumachi did what he did

226
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,495
through his consideration for me.

227
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,895
Shipping out 800 bottles a year,

228
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,295
you must be kidding!

229
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:22,895
We could never make that amount with our vineyard alone!

230
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,695
If we stop organic farming,

231
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,095
we could yield more grapes.

232
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,495
And if that's not enough,

233
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:31,395
we can buy grapes from other vineyards.

234
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,195
If we stop organic farming

235
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,795
or mix different grapes with ours,

236
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,695
the quality of Suwayama wine will deteriorate!

237
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,195
Management is tough,

238
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,595
so we've got no choice.

239
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,895
We're getting nowhere!

240
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:50,495
I'm sure that in order to settle the contract today, he...

241
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,195
So, the motive's been determined.

242
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:55,595
He has no alibi when the crime was committed,

243
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:59,095
so I guess there's no doubt that Mizumachi is the culprit.

244
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,195
Excuse me...

245
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:14,695
Detective Momoi.

246
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,995
Please don't arrest Mr. Mizumachi just yet.

247
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:18,995
Huh?

248
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,595
Why?

249
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,795
I've figured out everything just now.

250
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:26,395
I've been mistaken.

251
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,295
The culprit is not Mr. Mizumachi,

252
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,195
but another person.

253
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,595
Don't tell me that this is the famous...

254
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,795
The one who almost 100% solves all cases,

255
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,695
the Sleeping Kogoro?

256
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:40,695
Mr. Mouri, who on earth is the culprit?

257
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:43,495
There was a pitfall to this case.

258
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,295
A pitfall?

259
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:50,595
The victim was killed between 13:30 and 14:30.

260
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,995
The people with alibis during this time

261
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:56,195
are inevitably knocked off the list of suspects.

262
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,095
Yes, that's the procedure of investigation.

263
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,995
But, even if the culprit is not there,

264
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:06,795
if it were possible to kill the victim at a convenient time, what then?

265
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:10,295
After Mr. Mizumachi tied the victim up

266
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:13,295
and confined him in the barrel cellar,

267
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:16,895
the culprit went there in turn

268
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,395
and rigged a certain trick on the victim

269
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,495
and killed him.

270
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:23,595
Detective Momoi.

271
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:28,295
I would like you to help me to make explaining this easier.

272
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,595
Yes, sir.

273
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,795
I would like to replay

274
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,595
the circumstances that the victim was under before he died.

275
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,495
First, please lay on your stomach on the floor.

276
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:38,795
Like this?

277
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:41,495
Please imagine that your arms and legs are tied,

278
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,495
and lurch your back far behind.

279
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,995
This position is tough!

280
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,595
The greatest mystery

281
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:54,495
were the number of strangulation marks that were found on the victim.

282
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,595
The reason for that is this.

283
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:02,795
The culprit lurched the body of the victim backwards,

284
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,695
and tied his neck and ankles with one rope.

285
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:07,695
Huh?

286
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:12,095
Then the victim in order not to choke his own neck,

287
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,495
has to keep on lurching his body backwards.

288
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,095
As a result,

289
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,795
a lot of strangulation marks were left on his neck.

290
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,295
Oh, no!

291
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:23,395
The knot of the rope that was hooked onto the stake on the wall,

292
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:26,795
and the knot of the rope that was tied to his arms and legs

293
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,795
were different because of this.

294
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,295
I see!

295
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:35,395
The bruise of him being choked from behind was left

296
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,695
because the rope that was tied to the victim's legs

297
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:40,195
was pulling his neck.

298
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:42,395
But, why did the culprit carry out such a trick?

299
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,695
As I have mentioned earlier,

300
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:46,895
it was to establish an alibi.

301
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,395
Doing it this way,

302
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:52,995
the culprit could buy time until the victim gets exhausted and dies.

303
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,095
What a ruthless thing to do just to establish an alibi.

304
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:59,595
After establishing an alibi during the time of the death of the victim,

305
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:03,095
the culprit returns to the barrel cellar again

306
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:06,295
and unties the rope that was tied around the neck and the ankles

307
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,795
in order to hide evidence of the trick.

308
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:13,195
Finally, the corpse was hung by the wall.

309
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:16,895
The only person who could've done this is...

310
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:18,095
Yurika,

311
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:21,695
you're the one who killed Kengo!

312
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,595
Don't be ridiculous!

313
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,495
You left the winery at around 15:30

314
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,695
saying that you were going to look for the victim, didn't you?

315
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:36,295
Back then, I went to the barn in the south vineyard.

316
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,495
I didn't come to this barrel cellar.

317
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:41,095
No, that's a lie.

318
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:44,995
Today you didn't go to the south vineyard, not even once.

319
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:45,995
Huh?

320
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:49,695
Cabernet Sauvignon grapes that favor red clay soil

321
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:53,295
is grown in the south vineyard.

322
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,095
The soil of the south vineyard

323
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:58,895
was muddy rain in the morning.

324
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,795
Damp red clay soil sticks easily,

325
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,395
so on Mr. Mizumachi's shoes

326
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:06,095
who was working in the barn of the south vineyard,

327
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:09,595
red clay soil unique to the south vineyard was found.

328
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:15,095
On the other hand, no red soil was found on your shoes or hem.

329
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,395
That's...

330
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,795
That's not proof of anything!

331
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:22,295
Mizumachi's the one who killed my husband!

332
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:24,395
No, it's not.

333
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:28,195
It's true that Mr. Mizumachi confined Kengo here.

334
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,595
But, he didn't kill him.

335
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:32,295
How can you be so sure?

336
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,095
I sure can!

337
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:38,895
Because Mr. Mizumachi never came back to this barrel cellar.

338
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:41,295
How do you know?

339
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:46,395
The victim died between 13:30 and 14:30.

340
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:51,495
Mr. Mizumachi from 15:30 was walking through the vineyard with us.

341
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:56,095
So, the only time he could've rigged something up

342
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:59,795
would've been limited to between 13:30 to 15:30!

343
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,295
But just at that time...

344
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:05,595
Yes, between 13:00 to 16:00,

345
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,795
in the north vineyard where the barrel cellar is,

346
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:11,195
a natural pesticide, wood vinegar was bring sprayed.

347
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,495
Conan!

348
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:13,595
Yes.

349
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:16,495
Wood vinegar is an acid liquid that is made from

350
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,295
the ashes of wood that is burned.

351
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,695
This is blue on the litmus paper.

352
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,895
If the color turns to pink, it is acidy.

353
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,095
There's no change!

354
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:29,795
There isn't any acidy wood vinegar on Mr. Mizumachi's clothes.

355
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,495
True! Which means that...

356
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:33,695
That's right,

357
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:38,595
it means that he didn't go to the north vineyard at that time.

358
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,395
But, Yurika,

359
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:43,495
you have wood vinegar on your body.

360
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,595
Where do you have such proof?

361
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:48,295
Your rose hair clip.

362
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:50,695
Hair clip?

363
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:53,095
It was a pretty silver color in the day time,

364
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,395
but now it's oxidized and blackened.

365
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:01,995
Silver craft turns black when sprinkled with acid liquid!

366
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,995
This is blackened

367
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,095
because when I went to look for Kengo in the barn,

368
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,095
I was sprayed with wood vinegar at the south vineyard!

369
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,595
That's not possible.

370
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,795
Look at the roses outside.

371
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:17,195
The same type of roses are grown

372
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,795
and yet, the roses that are planted in the south vineyard...

373
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,495
are yellow.

374
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,595
The colors of the roses are different

375
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:27,895
because what was sprinkled on the vineyards was different.

376
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,795
"Wood vinegar" -In the north vineyard, acid wood vinegar was sprayed.

377
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,495
"Alkaline Bourdeaux" -While in the south vineyard,

378
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,895
alkaline Bourdeaux mixture was sprayed.

379
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,995
Like the litmus paper,

380
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:40,995
yellow roses turn up with a reddish tint

381
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:44,395
when constantly in contact with acid liquid.

382
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:51,095
If you were really walking through the south vineyard,

383
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:54,495
your silver hair clip wouldn't be discolored.

384
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:59,195
What's this?

385
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:02,795
To think that something like this would serve as proof...

386
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:07,095
Yes, that's right. I killed Kengo.

387
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:08,195
Yurika...

388
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:12,295
Yurika, you did something like this to sign a contract with the restaurant?

389
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,495
I didn't do it just for the money.

390
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:16,295
Kengo's to blame!

391
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,895
I understand, Yurika.

392
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:26,695
Let's get a divorce.

393
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:30,995
If the quality of Suwayama wine is going to deteriorate,

394
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,995
I'm leaving.

395
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:34,395
Why?

396
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:38,695
You don't have any understanding whatsoever about wine.

397
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:42,695
It was my mistake for marrying a woman like you.

398
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:49,195
I couldn't forgive him

399
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:51,095
after he despised me

400
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:53,495
and the nerve of him to choose wine instead of me.

401
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,295
Who cares what kind of grapes are used!

402
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:59,595
Who cares about wine!

403
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:26,095
"Mouri Detective Agency"

404
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:29,995
You already drank all the wine

405
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,695
they gave you as a token of their thanks, Dad?

406
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:36,195
That's the vintage wine that Mr. Yamaguchi was complimenting, right?

407
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:39,095
Then, if we let it age for several years...

408
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:41,195
It would've gotten more delicious.

409
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:44,095
No more wine for me.

410
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:49,395
No matter how long Pops ages,

411
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,595
he'll never mature.

412
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,995
"Next Episode" -Oh, you're all here?

413
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,995
Who's that beauty?

414
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,495
If so, the one who vandalized the garden is...

415
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,495
Do you have any idea of someone

416
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,395
who would want to harass this district center?

417
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:06,695
One person, I guess.

418
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:11,095
What's wrong?

419
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:14,495
It looks like that petal is not from the flowers of this garden.

420
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,995
Maybe...

421
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:17,495
Next Conan,

422
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:19,795
"Flower Garden Vandalism Conspiracy".

423
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:39,495
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:41,595
"Brick".

425
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,595
Dad, don't get drunk and go inside the flower garden!

426
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,095
Huh? I'm the star in the next episode?

427
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:46,795
Just what're you talking about?
