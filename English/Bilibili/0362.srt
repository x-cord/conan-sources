1
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.140
Today's problem is a ghost scare.

2
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.740
Shine the light on unseen feelings

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
to resolve the ghost scare at school.

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.840
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.925 --> 00:02:00.225
Due to the off-season ghost scare at Teitan High school,

8
00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:03.825
Ran begs Pops to solve the mystery of the scare,

9
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.025
but he refuses, saying that it is nonsense.

10
00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.825
Therefore, out of my consideration for Ran whom I know hates ghosts,

11
00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.525
I decide to participate in solving the mystery.

12
00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.325
After school, when we were checking out the school building,

13
00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:18.725
we find a desk that is very inappropriately on the campus grounds.

14
00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:27.025
My grudge has not yet vanished.

15
00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:34.725
"Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 2)"

16
00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:38.225
"Principal's office" -I was on campus in the rain?

17
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.825
I haven't gone outside at all today.

18
00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:40.925
What?

19
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:45.825
Besides, I was at a faculty meeting while it was raining.

20
00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:49.325
We were discussing the ghost scare.

21
00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:51.225
By the way, Dr. Araide.

22
00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:54.125
Thanks to the health exercise you taught me,

23
00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:57.625
my back pains have gotten a lot better.

24
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:58.925
I see.

25
00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:00.825
Hey, what on earth is going on?

26
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:02.525
Don't tell me that the upper classman is lying.

27
00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:04.525
No way!

28
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:07.325
She probably mistook someone for him.

29
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.825
Hey.

30
00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:10.425
Why don't you ask Kazumi's friend

31
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:13.025
who is resting in the infirmary, then?

32
00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.725
The ground is visible from the infirmary because it's right in front,

33
00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:18.325
so he may have seen somebody, right?

34
00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:20.925
"Infirmary" -No, beats me.

35
00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:25.225
After I left you guys, I was asleep in this bed here.

36
00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:26.425
Besides...

37
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:28.725
Take a look.

38
00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:30.725
Even if you were to look outside,

39
00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:33.925
it's virtually impossible to see anything on campus from this floor, right?

40
00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:36.925
What kind of garden was the principal thinking of making anyway?

41
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:40.225
So, even if someone suspicious was to be loitering on the ground,

42
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:42.125
I don't think I would've noticed.

43
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.925
By the way, where's the nurse?

44
00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:49.125
She left for the day saying she was going to driving school.

45
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.825
She told me to hurry on home and go to bed

46
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:54.725
because my house is really close to school.

47
00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:57.425
After the wailing in the storeroom of the gym,

48
00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:58.725
is the grudge filled library,

49
00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:02.525
the cursed stairs, and now the chair and desk on campus.

50
00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:04.825
Poor Hosaka.

51
00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:09.325
I heard that you were childhood friends with Hosaka.

52
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:10.425
Yeah.

53
00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:12.225
I was with him from elementary to Jr. high,

54
00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:15.525
but after we entered high school, I hardly got to see him

55
00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:17.025
because I got into an accident riding my motorbike

56
00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:18.325
as soon as I entered high school,

57
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.525
and was hospitalized for nearly half a year.

58
00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:24.225
Then, you didn't know that he fell down the stairs.

59
00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:26.225
No, not until I was discharged from the hospital

60
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:27.825
and came back to school.

61
00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:32.025
And? Was there anybody who was all worked up over this ghost bit?

62
00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:35.325
Those guys who're making a big thing of this ghost scare

63
00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:36.625
are the very ones who probably made this all up

64
00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:39.025
and are having their thrills laughing inside, right?

65
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:41.625
What? You mean me?

66
00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:43.025
It's possible.

67
00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:45.925
One other person I can think of that was making a fuss over it is

68
00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:48.325
the guy confined in the art room all alone drawing pictures.

69
00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:49.725
Don't you think he's suspicious?

70
00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:54.225
Even the guy we just saw in the infirmary is just as suspicious.

71
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:58.225
Because the storeroom where the desk was is near the infirmary.

72
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.725
Moreover, if you use this slated drain board,

73
00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:05.225
you can go directly out to the campus.

74
00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.625
Then, the suspicious ones are those two?

75
00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.325
Not really. There's one more person.

76
00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.425
Kazumi is also to be suspected.

77
00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:14.125
What? Why?

78
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.025
Well, if she went to the restroom,

79
00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.825
it means she left the library, doesn't it?

80
00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:20.225
I guess so.

81
00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:23.225
Now that you mentioned it, I wonder why she came

82
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:26.325
when we were checking the storeroom of the gym?

83
00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:28.225
It must've been by chance and besides,

84
00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:30.125
if she did play such a prank,

85
00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.625
wouldn't she have left for home?

86
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:33.825
Not really.

87
00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:37.825
Before I went out to campus to go to the desk with Dr. Araide,

88
00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:40.025
just a while ago, I went to the shoes box to get my shoes

89
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:43.825
but despite the doorway and the school building being wet with rain,

90
00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:45.725
I saw no footprints.

91
00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:48.625
Which means that the person making up the ghost scare is...

92
00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.425
Still in the school building somewhere.

93
00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:52.625
Yes.

94
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:56.925
If the same person is making up all four ghost scares,

95
00:05:56.925 --> 00:05:58.325
it's extremely likely that this person

96
00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.025
knows about the student called Hosaka

97
00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:02.225
who accidentally died two years ago,

98
00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:05.725
as well as know a lot about the scene of the accident.

99
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:09.325
Hardly no one passes through this corridor after school,

100
00:06:09.325 --> 00:06:10.825
and moreover, if the teachers were all gathered

101
00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:13.625
in the teacher's room having a conference...

102
00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:15.425
Whether it be from the infirmary on the first floor,

103
00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:17.325
the art room on the second floor

104
00:06:17.325 --> 00:06:19.325
or from the third floor library,

105
00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:22.425
the person could secretly without being seen by anyone

106
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:26.425
carry the desk and chair out to campus. It's not impossible.

107
00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:30.525
The problem is, how were the desk and chair placed there

108
00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:33.825
without leaving any footprints behind, and for what purpose.

109
00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.325
There must be something involved.

110
00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:38.125
A reason for causing the ghost scare.

111
00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:43.925
Huh?

112
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:47.125
I wonder what this is on top of the drain board.

113
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:49.225
It looks like traces of someone having splashed water.

114
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:50.525
I wonder if there were water traces like this

115
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:53.125
when we passed here a while ago?

116
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.725
Don't tell me that...

117
00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.225
Conan!

118
00:06:58.225 --> 00:06:59.725
If that's the case,

119
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.025
the traces of it should be somewhere on the campus.

120
00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.025
I found it! This is it!

121
00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:12.025
You're not supposed to go outside with slippers.

122
00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:15.325
To think that I didn't notice how such an easy trick was carried out...

123
00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:19.525
But this trick can be carried out by any of the three.

124
00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:23.125
In order to get the evidence, although it's a bit reckless...

125
00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.925
Ran.

126
00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:27.825
Will you all wait for me in front of the art room?

127
00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:31.425
I've figured out a way to find out who is doing all this.

128
00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:32.825
What?

129
00:07:32.825 --> 00:07:34.525
"Art room"

130
00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:36.025
He's late!

131
00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:37.425
How long does he intend to keep us waiting?

132
00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:38.625
Oh, there he is!

133
00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:42.225
What'd you do?

134
00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:43.725
Oh, some things.

135
00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:46.625
I hope we're really going to be able to figure things out here

136
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:49.025
about the culprit of the ghost scare.

137
00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.725
Hey, you glasses kid...

138
00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.425
Hey! I thought I told you not to come inside!

139
00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:58.625
Are you getting ready to go home?

140
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.525
Getting ready to go home?

141
00:08:00.525 --> 00:08:03.825
Yeah, I have everything here so that I can go home right away.

142
00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:05.625
Hey there! Sorry to intrude on you.

143
00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:08.325
Seko? What brings you here?

144
00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.425
This brat told me that if I come here,

145
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:15.625
I'll get to see who the one that's causing the ghost scare is,

146
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.125
so I came.

147
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.525
He said that it may take a while,

148
00:08:19.525 --> 00:08:22.625
so I gathered my stuff before coming.

149
00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:24.025
Oh, my.

150
00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.325
Same here.

151
00:08:25.325 --> 00:08:27.925
Kazumi?

152
00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:30.325
Your umbrella's all muddy.

153
00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:31.925
Right.

154
00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.525
I was watching the weather forecast this morning

155
00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:35.525
and in my rush, I picked an old umbrella

156
00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:37.925
that I used to use when I was a child.

157
00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:41.725
Hey, stop dusting mud off here!

158
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.525
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:45.725
So? Did you figure out who the culprit is?

160
00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.925
Nope. It seems the show's going to start now.

161
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:50.825
Hey. Are sure everything's going to work out, Conan?

162
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.325
No doubt about it.

163
00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:59.625
That one's the culprit.

164
00:09:07.388 --> 00:09:08.488
"Art room"

165
00:09:08.488 --> 00:09:09.788
And?

166
00:09:09.788 --> 00:09:12.888
Where's the one who caused this ghost scare?

167
00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:15.288
You said that we'd all find out if we came here, right?

168
00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.188
-Conan. -Yes.

169
00:09:17.188 --> 00:09:21.088
That ghost scare is rumored to be the doings of the spirit of the person

170
00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:24.688
called Hosaka who fell off the stairs two years ago and died, right?

171
00:09:24.688 --> 00:09:26.688
Yes.

172
00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:30.488
The stairs is the one near the art room.

173
00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:34.488
If so, let's just wait forever very quietly.

174
00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:36.088
Wait for what?

175
00:09:36.088 --> 00:09:37.388
What else...

176
00:09:37.388 --> 00:09:42.688
but for the ghost of Mr. Hosaka to come dripping wet down the stairs.

177
00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:44.888
Hey!

178
00:09:44.888 --> 00:09:46.688
It hurts!

179
00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:51.388
Listen, we're trying to find the bad one

180
00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:54.688
who's trying to make everything look like the doings of the ghost.

181
00:09:54.688 --> 00:09:58.188
Mouri. Sorry, but I think I'll head for home.

182
00:09:58.188 --> 00:09:59.688
I guess I will, too.

183
00:10:00.688 --> 00:10:02.188
I'm leaving, too.

184
00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.988
I can't possibly concentrate on drawing with you guys around.

185
00:10:06.588 --> 00:10:08.688
It's only starting to get interesting now.

186
00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:09.988
Thanks to the glasses kid,

187
00:10:09.988 --> 00:10:11.388
I can't seem to come up with any inspiration.

188
00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:13.188
The fun of it all is disappearing, so I guess...

189
00:10:15.188 --> 00:10:16.588
Sonoko?

190
00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:24.888
Sonoko!

191
00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:26.688
Did the usual come?

192
00:10:26.688 --> 00:10:28.188
The usual?

193
00:10:28.188 --> 00:10:30.288
Sonoko is just like my father,

194
00:10:30.288 --> 00:10:32.688
doing that when she figures out a case.

195
00:10:32.688 --> 00:10:35.788
No. The way she fell just now was not normal.

196
00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:37.688
Let me check her.

197
00:10:37.688 --> 00:10:38.888
Oh, no!

198
00:10:40.988 --> 00:10:42.488
Don't touch me, okay?

199
00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:44.188
Huh?

200
00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:46.688
Because I, deduction queen Sonoko,

201
00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.088
is about to start a deduction show now.

202
00:10:49.088 --> 00:10:50.388
So, it came after all.

203
00:10:50.388 --> 00:10:52.488
Yes, I've figured it out

204
00:10:52.488 --> 00:10:54.988
the identity of the one who started all this ghost scare

205
00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.988
while sneaking and hiding behind the scenes.

206
00:10:57.988 --> 00:11:01.488
As for you, I think you need to hide a bit of something.

207
00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:02.888
What?

208
00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:05.388
Talk about showing it all!

209
00:11:05.388 --> 00:11:07.888
Sonoko, your panty's showing!

210
00:11:08.988 --> 00:11:10.988
Oh, my! I'm sorry!

211
00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:12.288
Since I've figured out the truth,

212
00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:14.488
I seem to have gone weak and relaxed a bit too much.

213
00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:15.488
Gosh.

214
00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:19.588
Because it turned out to such a simple trick.

215
00:11:19.588 --> 00:11:20.788
Simple?

216
00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:22.488
Then, you've figured it out?

217
00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:24.888
The mystery of the desk and chair put out on campus

218
00:11:24.888 --> 00:11:26.788
without leaving any footprints.

219
00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:31.388
The piece of paper on the desk was not wet at all.

220
00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:33.788
Right, that piece of paper.

221
00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:35.988
I was thrown off by the paper that wasn't wet at all

222
00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:38.688
and had completely forgotten about something.

223
00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:41.888
Even if the desk and chair were carried out while it was raining,

224
00:11:41.888 --> 00:11:45.388
the footprints would be erased by the rain.

225
00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:48.588
The footprints may disappear,

226
00:11:48.588 --> 00:11:51.888
but won't the piece of paper on the desk also get wet?

227
00:11:51.888 --> 00:11:54.988
If you don't want to get wet, what would you do, Ran?

228
00:11:54.988 --> 00:11:58.188
Well, I'll wait somewhere until it stops raining.

229
00:11:58.188 --> 00:12:00.588
Or wear a raincoat.

230
00:12:00.588 --> 00:12:02.188
Or...

231
00:12:03.788 --> 00:12:04.988
You mean...

232
00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:06.188
Right.

233
00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:08.888
All the culprit did was cover the paper,

234
00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:10.788
so that it wouldn't get wet,

235
00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:13.788
using an umbrella with a long string attached to it.

236
00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:15.188
After it stops raining,

237
00:12:15.188 --> 00:12:16.488
the string attached to the umbrella is pulled

238
00:12:16.488 --> 00:12:18.488
and the umbrella is retrieved to the school building.

239
00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.888
This way, no footprints are left behind on the wet, muddy campus

240
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:24.188
and the piece of paper is still dry.

241
00:12:24.188 --> 00:12:26.888
The traces were clearly left behind on campus.

242
00:12:26.888 --> 00:12:30.788
The traces of the tip of the frame of the umbrella touching the ground

243
00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:33.688
when the string was pulled to take the umbrella in.

244
00:12:33.688 --> 00:12:35.488
On the drain board that is placed from the campus grounds

245
00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.088
to the entrance of the school building,

246
00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:39.288
there were traces of water being splattered.

247
00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:40.788
This serves as yet another evidence.

248
00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:42.388
The water that was splattered there was from the umbrella

249
00:12:42.388 --> 00:12:44.788
that was retrieved and shook to shake off excess water.

250
00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:48.888
But that's not enough to shake off all the rain water.

251
00:12:48.888 --> 00:12:52.788
The more time passes, the more water sinks in.

252
00:12:52.788 --> 00:12:55.588
Then, the person who caused the ghost scare was...

253
00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:58.388
-Could it possibly be... -Yes, that's right.

254
00:12:58.388 --> 00:13:00.188
The culprit is the one who owns the umbrella

255
00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:02.388
that has rain water flowing out of it.

256
00:13:02.388 --> 00:13:05.388
You, Kunishige Seko!

257
00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:07.288
You were sleeping in the infirmary

258
00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:09.088
saying that you weren't feeling good

259
00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:12.388
just to carry out this trick.

260
00:13:12.388 --> 00:13:15.288
The weather forecast said that there would be a shower

261
00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:17.388
from around noon to sundown,

262
00:13:17.388 --> 00:13:19.788
but you didn't know exactly what time it would be.

263
00:13:19.788 --> 00:13:22.588
You carried the desk and chair that were in the storeroom of the gym

264
00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:25.588
out to the campus grounds secretly,

265
00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:27.488
covered the desk with an umbrella with string attached to it

266
00:13:27.488 --> 00:13:29.688
and went back to the infirmary for the time being.

267
00:13:29.688 --> 00:13:31.688
All you had to do now is wait for it to stop raining

268
00:13:31.688 --> 00:13:35.088
pull the string and retrieve the umbrella.

269
00:13:35.088 --> 00:13:39.688
But, what if someone saw the umbrella on the desk?

270
00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:41.788
The campus ground cannot be seen from the first floor

271
00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:43.888
because the trees are in the way,

272
00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:45.688
and if viewed from the 2nd and 3rd floor,

273
00:13:45.688 --> 00:13:46.988
it would just look as if someone is standing in place

274
00:13:46.988 --> 00:13:49.588
in the rain with an umbrella.

275
00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:53.088
Then, do you mean that the principal I saw was...

276
00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:56.188
You just made a mistake because the color of the umbrella

277
00:13:56.188 --> 00:13:57.788
was the same as the one the principal who used to go out

278
00:13:57.788 --> 00:13:59.488
into the grounds everyday had.

279
00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:02.088
Hey. You're going to call me the culprit

280
00:14:02.088 --> 00:14:03.588
just because my umbrella was wet?

281
00:14:03.588 --> 00:14:05.288
Since my umbrella was really dirty,

282
00:14:05.288 --> 00:14:09.388
I washed it off at the faucet just a while ago, that's why it was wet.

283
00:14:09.388 --> 00:14:11.188
Besides, if it's a trick like that,

284
00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:14.388
Monobe and Tsukamoto could've done it too, right?

285
00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:16.788
No, you're the one.

286
00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:19.788
It's interesting that if you are the one,

287
00:14:19.788 --> 00:14:22.788
the answers to all the other ghost scares fall into place.

288
00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:25.588
The library of grudge, the cursed stairs,

289
00:14:25.588 --> 00:14:26.988
and the wailing in the storeroom of the gym,

290
00:14:26.988 --> 00:14:29.388
that is, the three ghostly phenomenon!

291
00:14:29.388 --> 00:14:31.588
First for the library of grudge,

292
00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:32.988
where the four books that Hosaka had borrowed,

293
00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:35.388
being left out without being put away for 4 consecutive days.

294
00:14:35.388 --> 00:14:38.788
But, isn't that something that anybody could've done?

295
00:14:38.788 --> 00:14:40.488
If you look at the library card,

296
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:42.988
you can get the names of the people who borrowed the book in the past.

297
00:14:42.988 --> 00:14:46.188
Do you remember the title of the four books?

298
00:14:46.188 --> 00:14:47.888
The title?

299
00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:49.988
I think it was electric, something...

300
00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:52.088
"Theory of Telecommunication".

301
00:14:52.088 --> 00:14:54.288
"Report of the Destruction of Tropical Rainforests".

302
00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:56.088
"The History of the University System".

303
00:14:56.088 --> 00:14:58.288
"Analysis of Rock Destruction Sound".

304
00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:01.488
No ordinary person could search and find these four books

305
00:15:01.488 --> 00:15:03.588
that virtually no one would bother to touch at all.

306
00:15:03.588 --> 00:15:05.388
But, you, Mr. Seko, was his childhood friend

307
00:15:05.388 --> 00:15:08.988
and knew his hobbies very well.

308
00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:11.788
Then, what about the cursed stairs?

309
00:15:11.788 --> 00:15:14.688
So you're saying Seko is responsible

310
00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:16.488
for the bottom of the stairs being wet?

311
00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:21.288
Yes. Isn't there a hole there where the extinguisher is kept?

312
00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:24.288
Mr. Seko probably got ice ready

313
00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:26.588
and hid it behind the fire extinguisher after school.

314
00:15:26.588 --> 00:15:27.988
The following morning,

315
00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:30.788
he wanted someone to find the water soaked floor

316
00:15:30.788 --> 00:15:33.588
because of the melted ice, which he prepared during the night.

317
00:15:33.588 --> 00:15:37.788
That's why you put wax on the floor right below the dent, right?

318
00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:40.188
You used the wax as a water repellent,

319
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:42.988
so that it wouldn't look as if water flowed out from the dent.

320
00:15:42.988 --> 00:15:44.188
Mr. Seko, whose house is near the school

321
00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:46.988
is the only one who could've done something like this.

322
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.388
I see.

323
00:15:48.388 --> 00:15:52.088
He went home to get the ice after school.

324
00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:53.688
But, why?

325
00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:55.588
Why would you, who used to be Hosaka's childhood friend

326
00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:57.688
do something like this?

327
00:15:57.688 --> 00:16:00.088
Depending on your answer, you're going to get it!

328
00:16:00.088 --> 00:16:01.588
The whole thing probably started

329
00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:03.488
with the wailing in the storeroom of the gym.

330
00:16:04.688 --> 00:16:06.088
The wailing that the students

331
00:16:06.088 --> 00:16:09.588
who came for early morning practice heard

332
00:16:09.588 --> 00:16:11.988
was Mr. Seko's voice.

333
00:16:11.988 --> 00:16:15.188
If Mr. Seko's ping-pong club also had early morning practice that day,

334
00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:17.788
it's natural that he would be in the storeroom of the gym.

335
00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:21.488
Maybe he noticed Mr. Hosaka's desk and chair for the first time that day,

336
00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:23.988
it's not strange to think that

337
00:16:23.988 --> 00:16:26.788
Mr. Hosaka's death was no accident.

338
00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:28.188
Yeah, that's right.

339
00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:30.388
It dawned on me right away

340
00:16:30.388 --> 00:16:32.188
that Hosaka was bullied and killed

341
00:16:32.188 --> 00:16:34.588
while I was in the hospital!

342
00:16:35.688 --> 00:16:37.688
You mentioned just a while ago,

343
00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:38.788
that I knew what kind of books he would borrow

344
00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:41.988
because I was his childhood friend, right?

345
00:16:41.988 --> 00:16:43.988
Actually, that's not it.

346
00:16:43.988 --> 00:16:47.088
Those four books were the books that Hosaka brought with him

347
00:16:47.088 --> 00:16:49.388
when he came to visit me everyday at the hospital.

348
00:16:49.388 --> 00:16:52.088
In order to cheer me up,

349
00:16:52.088 --> 00:16:56.688
he told me about the funny and interesting stories he made up

350
00:16:56.688 --> 00:16:58.488
after reading those books.

351
00:16:58.488 --> 00:17:00.688
But he suddenly stopped coming.

352
00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:03.288
I thought that maybe he found a girl he liked or something.

353
00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:05.488
I didn't think he had died of an accident.

354
00:17:05.488 --> 00:17:06.588
After being discharged from the hospital,

355
00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:07.688
I investigated on his accident,

356
00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:10.888
but all I found out was that he fell from the stairs.

357
00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:13.988
That is, until I found his desk with his signature

358
00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:16.588
on it in the storeroom of the gym!

359
00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:18.688
That's why I wanted to find

360
00:17:18.688 --> 00:17:21.188
the one who hid his desk into the storeroom.

361
00:17:21.188 --> 00:17:26.088
I wanted to find the one who pushed him off the stairs!

362
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.788
Wrong.

363
00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:30.788
Hosaka didn't fall off the stairs, nor was he bullied.

364
00:17:30.788 --> 00:17:32.088
I'm to blame!

365
00:17:32.088 --> 00:17:33.488
What?

366
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:34.988
That day, early in the morning,

367
00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:39.388
two stone statues were scheduled to be delivered to school.

368
00:17:39.388 --> 00:17:42.688
Both Hosaka and I were weekly monitors that day,

369
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:44.688
so we secretly carried the two statues

370
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:46.388
to the art room early in the morning.

371
00:17:46.388 --> 00:17:48.988
We were planning to place the statues by the door

372
00:17:48.988 --> 00:17:50.788
to surprise the art teacher.

373
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:55.288
But because we were rushing to set up the statues

374
00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:56.788
before the teacher arrives,

375
00:17:56.788 --> 00:17:59.488
we went past the 2nd floor art room to the 3rd floor.

376
00:17:59.488 --> 00:18:01.588
Since Hosaka told me this, I rushed to turn back

377
00:18:01.588 --> 00:18:03.388
and tripped.

378
00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:14.188
Hosaka tried to protect me from falling

379
00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:16.688
and was crushed by me and the statue.

380
00:18:16.688 --> 00:18:18.588
That's why Hosaka wasn't being bullied.

381
00:18:18.588 --> 00:18:20.288
That's a lie!

382
00:18:20.288 --> 00:18:23.288
Then, why was his desk put in a dimly lit place like that

383
00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:25.188
and covered with dust?

384
00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:28.288
-No matter how you look at it... -We didn't want to erase the signs

385
00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:32.588
that Hosaka was coming to the same school as we were.

386
00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:35.188
His signature was written in pencil,

387
00:18:35.188 --> 00:18:37.588
so if left as it would've rubbed off eventually, right?

388
00:18:37.588 --> 00:18:38.988
After the accident,

389
00:18:38.988 --> 00:18:41.688
the drawings of the faces of all his classmates

390
00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:44.688
was found in his notebook, so we got sad

391
00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:47.188
and asked the teacher a favor.

392
00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:49.288
That is, to put his desk out in one of the classrooms

393
00:18:49.288 --> 00:18:51.688
on the day of our graduation,

394
00:18:51.688 --> 00:18:54.988
so that he can graduate together with us.

395
00:18:54.988 --> 00:18:57.788
At first, the teacher gave a sour look,

396
00:18:57.788 --> 00:18:59.488
but we asked the teacher to let us

397
00:18:59.488 --> 00:19:00.888
keep the desk and chair in the storeroom of the gym

398
00:19:00.888 --> 00:19:03.688
after the class collected enough money to buy them.

399
00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:06.388
We should've told you about it too,

400
00:19:06.388 --> 00:19:08.888
but we found out that you were childhood friends with Hosaka

401
00:19:08.888 --> 00:19:12.388
only after the ghost scare.

402
00:19:12.388 --> 00:19:13.588
I see.

403
00:19:13.588 --> 00:19:16.288
That's why you were at the storeroom back then.

404
00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.288
Yes.

405
00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:22.388
I thought maybe Seko might be where Hosaka's desk was.

406
00:19:22.388 --> 00:19:24.688
Then...

407
00:19:24.688 --> 00:19:28.788
he wasn't bullied or had a grudge on anybody.

408
00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:29.988
No.

409
00:19:29.988 --> 00:19:32.488
If anybody, I'm the only one he'd have a grudge against.

410
00:19:32.488 --> 00:19:35.288
After all, I'm the one who thought up that stupid prank, too.

411
00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:36.888
No.

412
00:19:36.888 --> 00:19:39.788
I'm sure he holds no grudge against you.

413
00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:43.688
Well, I was the first one to be called to the site of the accident.

414
00:19:43.688 --> 00:19:47.388
Back then, he kept mumbling.

415
00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:49.488
That maybe the teacher will be even more surprised

416
00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:52.088
if he fell to the ground as is.

417
00:19:53.588 --> 00:19:55.388
Just as expected of him.

418
00:21:25.488 --> 00:21:27.188
Just as expected of you, Sonoko!

419
00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:31.088
Your deduction was superb as always.

420
00:21:31.088 --> 00:21:33.288
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:35.388
I don't remember, though, like always.

422
00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:39.588
But what a surprise it was to hear that Dr. Araide

423
00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:42.788
heard the last words spoken by that student.

424
00:21:42.788 --> 00:21:44.188
Oh, well...

425
00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:47.588
The truth is, he was in no condition to talk at all.

426
00:21:47.588 --> 00:21:49.988
But I figured at that time, it was best to say so,

427
00:21:49.988 --> 00:21:52.688
to make those seniors feel relieved.

428
00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:54.188
I couldn't help lying.

429
00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:55.788
I see.

430
00:21:55.788 --> 00:21:58.888
Dr. Araide, you're really so kind.

431
00:21:58.888 --> 00:21:59.888
Huh?

432
00:21:59.888 --> 00:22:03.088
Well, what a relief that there were no ghosts.

433
00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:05.988
Yes! I won't have to worry about being monitor next week anymore!

434
00:22:05.988 --> 00:22:08.988
Okay! Maybe I'll go talk to the newspaper club about my deduction

435
00:22:08.988 --> 00:22:11.488
-and give them a scoop article! -I think you shouldn't do anything.

436
00:22:11.488 --> 00:22:13.888
There'll be no ghost scares anymore.

437
00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:16.888
Besides, rumors vanish with time.

438
00:22:20.888 --> 00:22:24.288
I'm sorry. I've got an important phone call.

439
00:22:24.288 --> 00:22:26.288
We'll be on our way then.

440
00:22:26.288 --> 00:22:28.688
Goodbye, Dr. Araide!

441
00:22:30.988 --> 00:22:32.688
Hello?

442
00:22:32.688 --> 00:22:34.788
Yes, Araide here.

443
00:22:37.388 --> 00:22:39.788
Really? I'm happy for you

444
00:22:39.788 --> 00:22:41.188
that you got yourself smoothly into school

445
00:22:41.188 --> 00:22:43.288
without anyone being suspicious.

446
00:22:43.288 --> 00:22:45.388
Yes, thanks to you.

447
00:22:45.388 --> 00:22:47.588
Since you told me

448
00:22:47.588 --> 00:22:51.688
how the imposter was going around in school.

449
00:22:51.688 --> 00:22:54.788
Then, this is the last time I'll be calling you.

450
00:22:54.788 --> 00:22:57.588
Forget me completely.

451
00:22:57.588 --> 00:23:00.188
Wait! There's one thing I'd like to ask you.

452
00:23:00.188 --> 00:23:03.788
The person who was disguised as me...

453
00:23:03.788 --> 00:23:07.388
Dr. Araide, you sure are a push-over like always.

454
00:23:07.388 --> 00:23:08.788
Was that person really...

455
00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:13.788
Before that worried teacher decides to lug me off to the hospital.

456
00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:17.288
Thanks to the health exercise you taught me,

457
00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:20.288
my back pains have gotten a lot better.

458
00:23:20.288 --> 00:23:21.788
Was that person really...

459
00:23:21.788 --> 00:23:24.688
Dr. Araide, you're really so kind.

460
00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:28.888
A bad person?

461
00:23:31.088 --> 00:23:34.088
Every time I get in touch with the students or teachers at school,

462
00:23:34.088 --> 00:23:35.788
he just doesn't seem to be a bad person.

463
00:23:35.788 --> 00:23:36.888
What a fool!

464
00:23:36.888 --> 00:23:38.788
A person who can smile when killing someone

465
00:23:38.788 --> 00:23:40.988
can never be a good person!

466
00:23:44.888 --> 00:23:48.188
Yes. All that woman did was trace your personality

467
00:23:48.188 --> 00:23:50.788
in order to become your imposter.

468
00:23:50.788 --> 00:23:52.588
And she did so frighteningly accurately.

469
00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:56.488
That's all.

470
00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:03.188
"Next Episode"

471
00:24:19.288 --> 00:24:23.288
No, there's got to be a way.

472
00:24:24.288 --> 00:24:29.488
Next Conan, "City Crows"

473
00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:32.715
Next Conan's Hint:

474
00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:34.115
"Lottery"

475
00:24:34.115 --> 00:24:35.315
City crows resemble...

476
00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:36.815
-Information society. -Why do you say that?

477
00:24:36.815 --> 00:24:38.615
Problems of scattered trash are resolved by the net.

478
00:24:38.615 --> 00:24:39.561
I see.
