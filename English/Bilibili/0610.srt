00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,440
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,440
Stay away!

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,340
Hey! Why is that dog glowing?

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,540
It's a demon dog!

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,740
Demon dogs really do exists!

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
It's just "phosphorus".

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,940
Phosphorus has the property

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,440
to emit a bluish-white glow upon exposure to oxygen, you know.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,040
They just painted the dog with it to make it glow

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,240
and frighten people.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,940
Geez, don't go spoil the ending for us like that.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,740
But since Sherlock Holmes' "The Hound of the Baskervilles"

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,540
is so well known, I thought you knew that.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,740
Now look here. Unlike Conan and Shinichi,

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,940
we aren't Sherlock Holmes' geeks.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,640
Now that we know the demon dog's a fake,

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,940
I guess I'll watch another channel.

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,940
In that case,

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,740
how about joining us on a real demon dog hunt?

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,940
Hattori and Kazuha!

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,640
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,240
Tears are the start of all dramas.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,140
The story with an unexpected twist.

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,140
Is the victim Shinichi Kudo?

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,340
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:40,985
"The Victim is Shinichi Kudo".

29
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:47,185
"Mouri Detective Agency" -We did ring the bell,

30
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:50,485
but you didn't answer and we heard screaming.

31
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:53,085
Also your front door was unlocked.

32
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,385
But even so,

33
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:57,185
that's not a reason for you to just barge in like that.

34
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,985
Anyway, what did you mean when you said "demon dog"?

35
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:02,585
Oh, it's just a silly made-up story!

36
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:04,585
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that yet.

37
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,185
Do you know that about five years ago,

38
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:11,185
an extremely rich elderly man named Tsunechika Inubuchi passed away?

39
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:12,485
Yeah.

40
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:16,785
Wasn't he the president of the Inubushi Group?

41
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:19,685
Is it possible that this president was killed by the demon dog?

42
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:22,285
No, no. He just died of an illness.

43
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,885
He apparently had terminal cancer.

44
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,985
Nevertheless, about that president...

45
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,485
It is said that he was wild

46
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:30,185
and quite a ladies man when he was young.

47
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:32,185
In fact, in the days after he died,

48
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:34,785
his estate was visited by people claiming

49
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:39,085
"I am connected to the president by blood".

50
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,085
Illegitimate children?

51
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,685
Yes, and each one of them

52
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,785
carried a picture of the president with their mother.

53
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:47,185
Geez.

54
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,585
Wouldn't something like that just be a lie in order to get inheritance?

55
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:51,185
You're absolutely right.

56
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,585
But even if they wanted to confirm it,

57
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,685
the old man himself is already gone.

58
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:58,385
And since they each said that their own mother died as well,

59
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,785
they couldn't learn about the romance.

60
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:03,385
Normally, they'd be turned away at this point.

61
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:06,485
But the president's wife, Satomi,

62
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:10,885
accepted them all as her adopted children.

63
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,385
All eight of them!

64
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,985
Eight of them?

65
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:17,985
And now that the wife has been struck with illness,

66
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,685
the case begins.

67
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,385
Fight over inheritance...

68
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:23,385
Yeah.

69
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:26,685
The huge inheritance the wife received from the president,

70
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,285
which was to be divided

71
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:31,685
amongst the eight adopted children upon her death.

72
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:36,185
But two of the children have since died in bizarre ways.

73
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,485
One of them fell from a cliff

74
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:41,585
and just before dying said that

75
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:46,085
what pushed him was a kind of monster,

76
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,785
whose body was engulfed in crimson flames

77
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:50,485
that grew bigger and bigger as it attacked.

78
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,385
An apparition that strongly resembled a dog.

79
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,185
What?

80
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,285
It was probably just someone who set a plastic doll on fire

81
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,085
and closed in after him.

82
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,385
However,

83
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:07,085
that guy, he fled from the dog by bike for as far as one kilometre.

84
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,085
He would've noticed it's a fake, wouldn't he?

85
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:10,885
Then, were you, Heiji,

86
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:13,785
contacted by that Inubushi family?

87
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:16,185
No, it happens that one of the adopted children

88
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:18,885
is an acquaintance of Kazuha's mother.

89
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,285
I heard that they were elementary schoolmates.

90
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,885
He said he used to live in Kansai (western part of Japan).

91
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:27,185
And he said the two people who died

92
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:29,785
were killed by a curse.

93
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,485
A... a curse?

94
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:34,085
According to him, one of the eight children

95
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:38,185
is an imposter who holds a grudge against the Inubushi family.

96
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,085
And plans to use a cursed demon dog

97
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:44,185
to root out all those with Inubushi blood!

98
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,385
Root out?

99
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:49,385
In fact, it was my dad, the chief detective with the Osaka Police,

100
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,785
who he really wanted to consult with.

101
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,985
But there's no way my dad can leave Osaka.

102
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:54,985
Having no choice,

103
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:57,585
he asked if someone could at least come and listen to his story.

104
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,985
That's where I step in.

105
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,385
But all in all,

106
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:03,785
you still need to go to that Inubushi house, no?

107
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:07,385
Nah, it seems he gave up all claim to the inheritance

108
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,585
and left the Inubushi family.

109
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,185
He has since changed his name

110
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,485
and lives here in Tokyo.

111
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:17,185
I'm going to go listen to his story tomorrow.

112
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,885
You guys want to come?

113
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,385
What?

114
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:24,385
Actually, that guy has a very funny name.

115
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,985
"Shinichi Kudo" -Shinichi Kudo?

116
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:31,385
No kidding.

117
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:33,885
See, isn't it hilarious?

118
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,785
Not funny.

119
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:38,685
Who may I ask is calling?

120
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,285
The detective who was summoned by Mr. Shinnichi Kudo.

121
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,885
That was a woman's voice just now, right?

122
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:47,585
But doesn't that person live alone?

123
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:50,085
He has a bad back, so he has a helper

124
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:52,385
who comes to look after him two to three times a week.

125
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:55,585
It seems he can't even go to work at his company now.

126
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,785
"Funae Abukawa (39)" -Well...

127
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,185
"Homehelper" -Mr. Kudo is sleeping right now.

128
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,085
Mr. Kudo, you have visitors.

129
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,185
Sound asleep, huh?

130
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,285
But isn't this room a bit too warm?

131
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,085
Yeah. He might have a slight cold.

132
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:24,785
"Shinichi Kudo (43)" -Also, he said he didn't sleep much at all last night

133
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,185
"Adopted heir of Inubushi" -because he stayed up doing a lot of thinking.

134
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:30,085
But he should wake up soon.

135
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,185
Then, if you don't mind,

136
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,385
we'll wait here until he does.

137
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,285
I'd be grateful if you would listen to what he has to say.

138
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:41,885
I don't think I can handle it anymore.

139
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,885
He'd rather die now and be at peace?

140
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:48,785
Did he really say that?

141
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,085
Yes.

142
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:53,485
He said that if he were going to be eaten by accursed demon dog...

143
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,285
That man may have seen it as well,

144
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,185
I mean the dog.

145
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,485
I guess so.

146
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:03,485
All right now, I'm going to go buy groceries for dinner.

147
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:05,585
Could you two watch the house for me?

148
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,685
Sure, no problem.

149
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,885
A cursed demon dog, huh?

150
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:15,485
Hey, did you hear anything else about the case?

151
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:16,485
Yeah.

152
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:19,485
I heard about the names of those eight adopted children.

153
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:23,385
Well, the pronunciations are

154
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:28,185
Shinichi, Takako, Saki, Tomoaki,

155
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:32,485
Miwako, Yoshiya, Keiji and Miyuki.

156
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:35,285
It seems they were all named

157
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:38,685
by president Tsunechika Inubushi who died five years ago.

158
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,085
And, who were the two people that died?

159
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,585
Well, if I recall...

160
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,285
What's that sound?

161
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:54,285
I think he may have set an alarm clock to play music.

162
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,885
This... this door...

163
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,485
It's been sealed with packing tape!

164
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:16,585
-Suicide by charcoal poisoning? -Looks like it.

165
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:18,185
I'll take care of the taped window.

166
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:19,785
And I'll get the clay stove out.

167
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,785
Darn, this is stuck on really tight!

168
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,285
Didn't you say he had back pain?

169
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:33,785
Even made a kind of footstool out of a pile of books.

170
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,485
Wait a minute, this charcoal stove is...

171
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:42,185
What... what's going on here?

172
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:45,185
It's carbon monoxide poisoning!

173
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,585
Don't move!

174
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,185
You can't come inside!

175
00:09:56,985 --> 00:10:01,185
We first came to this room about 30 minutes ago, right?

176
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,285
Yeah.

177
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,485
His jaw has started to stiffen.

178
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,485
His back is showing signs of slight rigor mortis.

179
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:12,985
And, this charcoal stove...

180
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:17,585
Not to mention that stack of books used as a footstool...

181
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:20,085
-It's obvious. -Yeah.

182
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:24,285
Anyway, I should go and call the police.

183
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,185
Before you do that,

184
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:29,185
we need to ask you something.

185
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,185
What?

186
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,985
Why did you kill that man?

187
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:38,285
-Why? -That's our question.

188
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:42,685
And if you're thinking of telling us it was the demon dog's curse...

189
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,785
You won't fool us.

190
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,932
Wait... wait just a moment!

191
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:55,532
Why would I be the culprit?

192
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,532
I'm just an ordinary homehelper.

193
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,932
Anyway, I only just returned from shopping.

194
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:04,032
Plus, it looks as if this door

195
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:06,532
was sealed with masking tape.

196
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,032
And when I got here,

197
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:11,332
you were tearing the masking tape off of the window, right?

198
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,332
Yeah. It was stuck on there real good.

199
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:15,532
Not to mention

200
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,632
the fact that a charcoal stove was next to the body.

201
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:21,532
So, no matter how you look at it,

202
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:24,832
it must be suicide by charcoal poisoning!

203
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:27,232
That may be so.

204
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,132
Both the entry door and the window

205
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,532
were sealed from inside,

206
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,432
making it a perfectly sealed-room.

207
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:38,132
And it'd be impossible for anyone else

208
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,932
to be in the room.

209
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,532
In that case...

210
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:45,732
However, it is strange.

211
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:48,432
Despite Shinichi having a bad back,

212
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,932
there's a footstool made from books

213
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:53,032
in the lower part of the shelf.

214
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:54,932
Do you think someone with a bad back

215
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,632
would've deliberately bent over

216
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,032
to take books from the lower shelf?

217
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:03,532
Perhaps the books on the shelves he could easily reach

218
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:06,632
were ones he didn't want to step on?

219
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:08,232
That's why he strained himself to.

220
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,732
Not to mention this charcoal stove...

221
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,532
It isn't hot even though I hold it in my bare hand.

222
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,532
You may not know this, little boy,

223
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,632
but charcoal is...

224
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:18,732
If you burn charcoal in an airtight room,

225
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,932
the oxygen in the air will be exhausted,

226
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,132
causing incomplete combustion

227
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,832
and carbon monoxide is generated.

228
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,032
If inhaled,

229
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:29,632
carbon monoxide will introduce itself to the bloodstream,

230
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,432
combine with the haemoglobin and lead to asphyxiation

231
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:33,932
followed by death.

232
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:35,132
With that said,

233
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:37,732
did you want to say that when the oxygen was finally used up,

234
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:42,032
the flame on the charcoal went out?

235
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,032
Yeah.

236
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:49,432
Well, it would've been extremely painful if it failed,

237
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:51,932
followed by serious after-effects.

238
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,232
But it was about 30 minutes ago

239
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,632
that we last saw this man sleeping in this room.

240
00:12:57,632 --> 00:13:00,432
If he then sealed the door and the window,

241
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,932
wouldn't it take more than ten minutes?

242
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,232
It would take even longer

243
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:07,132
if he took it slow with his bad back!

244
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,032
It would take quite a while

245
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:12,132
for a single clay stove to fill the room with carbon monoxide

246
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:16,232
and the remaining time wouldn't be sufficient.

247
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:18,132
And even if the fire went out,

248
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,132
it should still retain some heat.

249
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,832
In short, this charcoal

250
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,532
has already been burned and left cold for quite a while.

251
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,732
And that means that

252
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:34,832
what was placed in the stove was just cold charcoal.

253
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:36,732
It also means that someone else could've been in this room

254
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,232
to seal the windows and the door with masking tape.

255
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:45,032
Ridiculous! Are you saying I was in the room?

256
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,832
If so, you would've seen me, wouldn't you?

257
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,532
But I wasn't here.

258
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:53,232
You were holding your breath hiding, weren't you?

259
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,032
In the space between this bookshelf and behind the door.

260
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:00,732
It was a well-thought-out plan you made.

261
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,132
If we saw the door and the window all taped up

262
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:05,732
and a charcoal stove on the floor,

263
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:08,132
we'd think it was a charcoal-burning suicide.

264
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,732
And our attention would've been directed

265
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,432
to those instead of to the door.

266
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,732
Enabling you to safely hide behind the door.

267
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:19,032
And, just as we were about to remove the tape on the window

268
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:22,132
and the stove from the room,

269
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:25,832
you took the chance to sneak out to the doorway.

270
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,732
You attempted to raise the room temperature

271
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:31,032
in order to slow the body temperature's drop rate,

272
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:33,132
but since his jaw has already begun to stiffen,

273
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:35,932
more than an hour would've passed since his death.

274
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,732
His back also showed slight rigor mortis.

275
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:40,532
That's proof

276
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,732
that you laid the deceased old man on this bed

277
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:45,332
to make it appear as if he is sleeping.

278
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:47,932
Well, talk about evidence,

279
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:51,432
her fingerprints should still be on the duct tape, shouldn't they?

280
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,432
That's right.

281
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:55,132
Since you had to apply a very sticky masking tape,

282
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:58,632
it would take more time if you had been wearing gloves.

283
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,332
I bet you planned on taking the tape down with us,

284
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,832
and trying to trick us by saying

285
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:05,532
that's how your prints got on the tape.

286
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,532
But your plan is ruined, isn't it?

287
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,632
What... what is this?

288
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:12,432
Who on earth are you?

289
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:16,032
Didn't we tell you when we rang the bell to this house?

290
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:18,832
That we're detectives!

291
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:20,832
This... this is wrong.

292
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,332
This is not what I was told!

293
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,532
What's that?

294
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,732
From what I heard

295
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:30,232
it was only a child detective who was coming.

296
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,432
"It was only a child, so it's no big deal."

297
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,932
Did this man tell you something like that?

298
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,032
It's the culprit!

299
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,332
It was the culprit who said

300
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:41,832
that everything would be fine if I followed the instructions,

301
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:44,332
because I'd be dealing with a child!

302
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:45,832
What now?

303
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:46,932
Look, lady.

304
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:48,032
If you keep spewing nonsense,

305
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,032
I'll teach you a lesson!

306
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,432
I'm not lying!

307
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:52,932
Because when I came here today,

308
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:56,132
Mr. Kudo was already dead.

309
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:58,132
What do you mean?

310
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:00,932
I came in the afternoon as I usually do...

311
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:04,132
But when I rang the doorbell, no one answered.

312
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,232
I had no choice

313
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,332
but to enter using the spare key I was given,

314
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,332
and the phone had been ringing.

315
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,632
When I answered,

316
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:15,532
the caller told me in an eerie, machine-modified voice.

317
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,132
"I have shut Kudo up inside his bedroom wardrobe.

318
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:20,332
If you want to save him,

319
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:23,432
you'd better hurry", they said.

320
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,332
The wardrobe?

321
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,532
This thing.

322
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:30,132
I came to this room half-unconvinced.

323
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,232
The wardrobe had indeed been sealed up with masking tape.

324
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:35,432
And a bar had been shoved through the handles

325
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:38,332
so it couldn't be opened from inside.

326
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,132
Soon after I removed it and opened the door,

327
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:44,732
I found Mr. Kudo was inside.

328
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:47,032
The edges of the door are sticky.

329
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:48,132
Yeah.

330
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,732
It seems they drugged him to sleep

331
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:52,832
and killed him by locking him up in there

332
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,932
with the burning charcoal grill.

333
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,932
You... you understand, right?

334
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,532
That what I'm saying is the truth.

335
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:04,632
Yeah, this was indeed the true scene of the crime.

336
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,532
However,

337
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,032
if that was true,

338
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:10,932
why didn't you call the police?

339
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,132
If you did something this unwise and were discovered,

340
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,732
you knew that the consequences would be irreversible.

341
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:19,432
Because...

342
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:22,332
because of what was stuck to the inside of the wardrobe door!

343
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,732
A picture of my son!

344
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:29,032
He said over the phone that if I didn't do what I was told,

345
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,632
my son would meet the same fate.

346
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:33,432
And you took them seriously?

347
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:35,332
Yeah, it seems that person

348
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:40,032
also knew that I often got into arguments with Mr. Kudo.

349
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:41,832
And said that camouflaging it as a suicide

350
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,932
would be to my benefit as well.

351
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,132
Argument?

352
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,432
Like over the meals I made...

353
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:50,632
Mr. Kudo was picky about his likes and dislikes.

354
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:54,732
And I've often complained about it to my co-workers.

355
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,132
Speaking of meals,

356
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,332
what were you planning on doing earlier?

357
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,232
You said you were going to buy groceries for dinner,

358
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:02,732
but you didn't go, right?

359
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,132
I usually come here straight

360
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:07,932
from the supermarket with groceries.

361
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:09,932
I was instructed to use those

362
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,632
to make it appear as if I had gone shopping.

363
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:16,032
Then what were you planning to make tonight?

364
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:17,332
Boiled mackerel in soy sauce.

365
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,432
You mean Ms. Abukawa, the caretaker?

366
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,532
She came here today at noon.

367
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:25,532
Well, she was persistent today as well,

368
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:27,132
she's such a tough customer.

369
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,032
-Persistent? -About the sliced mackerel!

370
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:32,732
A little of the red juice had collected inside of the pack,

371
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,432
so she demanded a discount.

372
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:38,132
Even though the price had already been lowered.

373
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:41,332
Well, then, thank you very much.

374
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:44,332
Looks like what she said...

375
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,832
Might actually be the truth.

376
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:48,032
If she did something as noticeable

377
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,932
as haggling over the price a fish at noon,

378
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:54,932
she couldn't use it as an alibi for later.

379
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,632
And what about the culprit,

380
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:59,132
did they say anything in regards to who they are?

381
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,232
Well...

382
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:04,832
A vengeful spirit?

383
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:08,832
Did your caller really identify themselves as that?

384
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:12,532
Yeah, after they muttered that, the line went dead.

385
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:14,832
Do you have any clues about it?

386
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:17,832
Such as someone holds a grudge against the victim.

387
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,532
Yeah, actually...

388
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,632
Actually, the victim was

389
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,932
an adopted son of the Inubushi Group president, Tsunichika,

390
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,232
who died five years ago.

391
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,832
And it seems he's been frightened about it lately.

392
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:32,932
He said that a bad person had infiltrated the Inubushi family

393
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:34,432
and was intent on rooting out

394
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:37,132
everyone with Inubushi blood using a cursed demon dog.

395
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,632
Demon dog?

396
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:43,432
It sounds like a story from a mystery novel.

397
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,032
There was a Sherlock Holmes story like that, wasn't there?

398
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,732
Wasn't that The Inugami Clan?

399
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,532
And, didn't you hear anything from the victim?

400
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:56,032
Did he have any appointments to see somebody recently?

401
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:58,032
I only heard that

402
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:01,232
a young boy detective from Osaka was coming.

403
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:04,432
Since the culprit also knew of this,

404
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:07,132
it means that this was definitely a crime by an acquaintance.

405
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,432
Yeah,

406
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:13,432
perhaps he was intending to go out somewhere with that culprit.

407
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,832
Why would you say that?

408
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,632
When I found him inside the wardrobe,

409
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,232
he was wearing a business suit and necktie.

410
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:22,832
Business suit?

411
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:24,232
And necktie?

412
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:26,532
So you removed those

413
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:29,332
and put him in a jersey like that, right?

414
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:32,632
Yes, the culprit ordered me to do so.

415
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,632
Then you laid the body on the bed

416
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:38,232
and waited for the child detective to come.

417
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,632
And after you showed the victim to him as if he was sleeping,

418
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:42,632
you said that you were going shopping

419
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,132
but actually entered the bedroom,

420
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,232
where you moved the body to the floor

421
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:47,832
and placed the charcoal grill,

422
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:50,232
and taped up the window and the door.

423
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:53,532
Finally, you pressed the CD's play button,

424
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:57,332
and hid yourself in a position that would become a blind spot.

425
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,532
After that, when Hattori's group came in

426
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:01,932
after being surprised by the CD music,

427
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:05,432
they'd focus on the window, the body and the grill

428
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,932
and enabling you to leave the blind spot

429
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,632
and move to the doorway.

430
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:11,832
Then you proceeded to pretend that you had just returned from shopping

431
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:15,432
all by order of this culprit, is that correct?

432
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:17,832
Yes, I'm sorry.

433
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:21,332
By the way, can you tell me if anything was stolen?

434
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:26,032
Well, not sure. Only Mr. Kudo himself would know the answer...

435
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:27,832
But...

436
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:31,532
The ornament attached to his necktie pin was removed.

437
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,232
A necktie pin?

438
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:36,032
Was there an expensive jewel attached earlier?

439
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:37,332
No.

440
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:38,532
I only noticed that there were signs

441
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:42,132
of something having been removed from it.

442
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:44,032
As far as what that was, I have no idea.

443
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:48,332
I almost never see Mr. Kudo in a business suit, so...

444
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:50,532
Turn him face-up and put him on the stretcher!

445
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,632
-Okay. -Ready, and... go!

446
00:21:58,432 --> 00:22:00,032
Something fell out of his mouth!

447
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:01,432
It was small and round.

448
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,432
-A pearl? -A pearl?

449
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:09,132
Hey, have that necktie pin checked right now!

450
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,732
Because if this poor man's saliva is found on it...

451
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,732
The fact that he bit this pearl away

452
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:18,932
from his own necktie pin during his final moments

453
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,532
could be his dying message to us!

454
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,932
"Next Episode" -Put it on fire?

455
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:50,332
The ancestor of this house did? The dog on fire?

456
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:53,432
Then, does the tomb really exist?

457
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,932
It says, "Here lies Fusataro".

458
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:58,332
Just above this tomb.

459
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,632
Sa... Saki?

460
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:05,832
It's just like a trace a dog in a ball of fire ran through.

461
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,732
A cursed demon dog could be...

462
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:09,832
It could be a true story?

463
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:11,132
Next Conan,

464
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:15,132
"Inubushi Family, The Ablazed Demon Dog (Will-O'-the Wisp Chapter)".

465
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,659
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,959
"Spheres".

467
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,559
We have another big case that reeks of a bad smell next time!
