00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,840
Today marks the 10th year for the Detective Conan Series.

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,140
In the first episode of this commemorative year,

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,840
of all things, Pop's becomes the target of a sniper.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,740
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,625
Are you all right?

8
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,725
Shall I go flag a cab down?

9
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:07,425
I'm just fine.

10
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,925
Thanks for the service and goodnight.

11
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,625
Take care and goodnight.

12
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,125
Please be careful.

13
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,525
Goodnight.

14
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,225
Hey, watch out!

15
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,325
You're lucky it was me because I was able to dodge it.

16
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:07,925
"The Target is Kogoro Mouri"

17
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,325
Hey! Stay still.

18
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,425
It stings, Ran.

19
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,825
Can't you do it a bit more gently and softly?

20
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:20,725
Oh, come on! It's nothing to make such a big deal out of, Dad.

21
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,725
A little sting won't kill you.

22
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:25,925
I've got to go and caution the person in charge tomorrow.

23
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,425
Who could it be at this time of night?

24
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,625
What is this?

25
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,325
It's mail.

26
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:38,625
What?

27
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,425
Dad, what's up?

28
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,725
Huh?

29
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:46,325
It says, "I won't fail next time. I'll kill you for sure."

30
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,025
Does this mean that it was no accident,

31
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:52,025
but something that happened with the intent to kill?

32
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,325
What a dirty rat.

33
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:57,125
The culprit was ambushing me there.

34
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,425
Dad, don't you have any idea who it could be?

35
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,725
No, not the slightest.

36
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,025
Well, I guess you can't really say

37
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,325
that there's no one who has a grudge against me.

38
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,825
You think someone repaid your kindness with a grudge?

39
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:12,325
Yes. If so, we'll find out soon who it is.

40
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,625
The culprit must always has a motive.

41
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,125
This time, it's a grudge against me.

42
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,225
If I search for those who have a grudge against me,

43
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,325
it'll inevitably lead to the culprit.

44
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:25,925
Hey, this cell phone is not yours, Dad.

45
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,625
-What? -Huh?

46
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,225
Show it to me.

47
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,825
True.

48
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:34,425
Hey! This jacket isn't yours either, Dad.

49
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,025
What?

50
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,925
There's a name on it.

51
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,425
Kimura.

52
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:42,625
In other words, this cell phone is not yours,

53
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,225
but rather of someone name Kimura.

54
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:48,825
Which means this mail was not sent to me.

55
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,225
So that's the story. No fun.

56
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,525
Hey. Just where do you think you're going?

57
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:57,825
I'm going to sleep.

58
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:58,925
There you go.

59
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,825
It hurts.

60
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,125
Conan?

61
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,525
What a sight.

62
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:13,625
Hey. What do you think, Conan?

63
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,125
You mean if there's anything besides the fact that Pop's life is in danger

64
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,625
because he mistakenly wore Mr. Kimura's jacket

65
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,825
and the killer mistook Pops to be Mr. Kimura?

66
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:24,425
Right, I'll try and call Dad's cell phone.

67
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,725
I wonder what kind of person the owner of the cell phone is.

68
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,825
There's no answer.

69
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:39,925
This is unmistakably Mr. Kimura's jacket.

70
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,025
Did Mr. Kimura come last night?

71
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:45,725
He came when Mr. Mouri was asleep over there.

72
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,025
I think it was around 1am.

73
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:52,025
And where is this Mr. Kimura living?

74
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:56,025
I wonder? He's only started coming here recently, so...

75
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:01,525
As for me, I found out his name from his signature on this bottle.

76
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,825
Is that so?

77
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:07,025
I'm sure he'll show up sometime soon.

78
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:09,525
Let's forget about this for a while.

79
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,025
Do you have it?

80
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:14,725
The hand-made cheese that this master makes is super spicy.

81
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,925
It blows up your cells, makes your body hot and sweaty.

82
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,825
One should refrain from eating too much of it, but that's just impossible.

83
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:24,025
That's how good it is.

84
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,125
I see.

85
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,925
So that's why he took off his jacket.

86
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:31,225
After checking the cell phone that sent out the mail last night,

87
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,025
we found that it was registered under a false name.

88
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,825
And from last night up to now there have been no accidents

89
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:41,225
in which a man by the name of Kimura has been involved.

90
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,625
It's probably just some prank.

91
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:48,425
The police are busy so you shouldn't cause them extra problems, Ran.

92
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:49,925
But...

93
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:53,225
Besides, they're not after me. But a man named Kimura.

94
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:56,325
The culprit made a mistake.

95
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,425
But if the culprit doesn't realize that he's making a mistake,

96
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:03,025
he'll go after your life again.

97
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:05,625
That's what Ran is worried about.

98
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:11,925
Officer Takagi, don't take what a kid like her is saying too seriously.

99
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:15,825
Bar Lemon, right?

100
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,625
You sure go looking for all kinds of places to drink, don't you?

101
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,825
About a week ago,

102
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:31,625
I was able to get the service coupons at their grand opening.

103
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,725
So I went to check the place out.

104
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,625
They served this super spicy hot cheese along with the drinks.

105
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,025
Since I've kind of been hooked on spicy hot stuff lately,

106
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,525
I got hooked on this place, you see.

107
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,325
-Officer Takagi. -Yes!

108
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:43,825
There's been an eye-witness report.

109
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:47,025
Last night a student living near the construction site

110
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:51,325
says he saw a man running from the scene right after the steel pipes fell.

111
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:54,025
He says he didn't get a good look at the face of the man though.

112
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,825
However, the culprit seems to have had a burn wound on his right elbow.

113
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,425
Do you have any idea who the man could be?

114
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:05,325
Unfortunately, there were no other suspicious fingerprints

115
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,925
or anything else at the site.

116
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:12,225
Which means, you'll have to find Mr. Kimura and trace things from there.

117
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,425
Dad! You're talking like it's someone else's problem,

118
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,525
-but what it all boil's down to is... -I'm not Mr. Kimura.

119
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,325
This all happened because you went to that bar.

120
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:25,825
Pops! Unless we hurry, the man called Kimura may be attacked again

121
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,625
and get into bigger trouble next time.

122
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,125
Mr. Kimura...

123
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,125
Since the size of this jacket fits Dad just right,

124
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,625
I think he has the same type of physique as Dad.

125
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,225
Have you ever kept his jacket for him?

126
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,625
There is no such person at our shop.

127
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,225
I see.

128
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,425
Look out!

129
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,725
Ran!

130
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,025
Darn it!

131
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,925
Hold it there!

132
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,725
A burn on his right elbow?

133
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:37,125
The truck was a stolen one after all.

134
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,425
Which means it was a planned attempt.

135
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,825
I think so, too.

136
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,425
What's up, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,425
"Kimura. Next time, I will kill you for sure."

138
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:00,425
Inspector! The laundry shop owner has completed being treated.

139
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,625
They say he'll be discharged in two or three days.

140
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,725
How dare he get others who aren't involved into danger.

141
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,925
Mr. Mouri, just where do you plan on going?

142
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:11,425
Where else? I want to nab that guy.

143
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,525
Come on, you don't even know where he is.

144
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,325
Just where do you plan to look for him?

145
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,725
Mr. Mouri.

146
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:20,725
Who cares? I'll find him with my spirit.

147
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,925
Just what are you talking about?

148
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:25,525
Please stay in one place until we find the culprit.

149
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,325
They're right. Somebody's after you life, you know.

150
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,225
I can't do that.

151
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,525
I, the world famous Kogoro Mouri

152
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:36,825
hiding just because he's scared of having his life take away.

153
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:39,225
It'd ruin my reputation.

154
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,825
Come off it! You don't have to bluff courage.

155
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,325
Right, Conan?

156
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,025
Bluff courage?

157
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,525
You actually think I'm bluffing courage or what?

158
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,225
You've got to be kidding!

159
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:55,925
Somebody's after my life you say?

160
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:58,225
Just great.

161
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,225
What better chance could there be?

162
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:03,925
As long as we don't know who this Kimura guy is,

163
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:07,825
I'll serve as decoy and lure the culprit out.

164
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:10,525
Wait a minute! Just what do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

165
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:13,825
I can't stop him if I keep on hiding.

166
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,925
-Okay. -Inspector!

167
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:21,525
But I'm going to have those two serve as your bodyguards.

168
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:23,125
No way.

169
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,325
It'll only put the culprit on guard if he finds out

170
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:26,425
and he won't show himself.

171
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,525
No!

172
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,625
Going out alone is much too dangerous.

173
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,725
I hate to say this, inspector.

174
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,825
But I can't listen to you this time.

175
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:38,825
I can't bear and don't want any more victims resulting from this.

176
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,025
But if anything should happen to me,

177
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,925
please take care of what needs to be done after that.

178
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:47,225
Mr. Mouri.

179
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,525
It seemed to have the opposite effect.

180
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,025
-Mr. Mouri. -He's quite defiant.

181
00:11:54,725 --> 00:12:02,425
So what we've got to do now is to find the person called Kimura.

182
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,625
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,825
Let's go, Officer Takagi.

184
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,925
Okay!

185
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,525
He's been walking around for the past three days.

186
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,025
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:32,025
And what about this Mr. Kimura?

188
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,825
We're still looking. We're doing everything we can.

189
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:37,425
But if the motive of the culprit is a grudge against Mr. Mouri,

190
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,525
I guess we'll eventually get the guy.

191
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,825
But the thing is, he's being sought after mistaken for a man named Kimura,

192
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,225
and he has no idea who or where this Kimura person is.

193
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,125
Moreover, after two attempted tries on Mr. Mouri's life,

194
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,625
the culprit left nothing behind, not even fingerprints.

195
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,325
I really hate to say this

196
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:57,725
but at present we're up the creek without a paddle.

197
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:59,125
Fingerprints.

198
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,225
He didn't want to get nabbed from his fingerprints?

199
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,925
So the culprit's fingerprints are already registered?

200
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,725
Which means, this person has an arrest record.

201
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,025
One who knows Pops well.

202
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:13,025
But he has no motive against Pops.

203
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,125
Wait a second.

204
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,125
If the culprit knows Pops and has met him before...

205
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,825
It could be that...

206
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:28,388
This is Mouri. Long time no see.

207
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:29,988
I'd like to ask you something

208
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:33,188
about a certain case that I solved in the past.

209
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,788
What's all the noise outside?

210
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,088
Come on out.

211
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,088
I know that you're hiding over there.

212
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:50,588
I advise you to come out before I crush you to a pulp.

213
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,488
There's nothing to think about, is there?

214
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,288
Resign yourself and come on out.

215
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:56,288
Come out. Or else I'm going to come get you.

216
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:58,488
No, please don't. Please forgive me.

217
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:02,388
I'm sorry. I will return what I stole.

218
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:03,988
Dad.

219
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:05,988
What? What's going on?

220
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:09,188
You're fantastic, Dad. It's a robber. Good job!

221
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:15,388
A case in which luck and coincidence overlapped.

222
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,888
Why don't you rest a while, Conan?

223
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:20,788
I wonder if that person called Kimura not only resembles dad in physique,

224
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:23,388
but looks alike, too.

225
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:25,888
Because don't they say that there are three people

226
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,688
who resemble you existing in this world?

227
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,888
Three people with a face like his?

228
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,288
People who look alike.

229
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:40,088
Yes, I got a call from Mr. Kimura's wife.

230
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,488
And it seems she realized that her husband was wearing the wrong jacket.

231
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:44,988
Talk about easygoing.

232
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:48,188
Mr. Kimura seems to have gone out to take pictures.

233
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,688
Yes, sir. And Mr. Mouri, Mrs. Kimura just happened to say

234
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:56,988
that a strange man was checking out their house.

235
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:58,988
He had a wound on his right elbow?

236
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:01,388
And, where is Mr. Kimura?

237
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,388
Lake Beika?

238
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,288
The strange man is trailing him.

239
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:07,188
Okay, it's very likely.

240
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:09,888
Are you going there too, Mr. Mouri?

241
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:12,288
I think that's dangerous.

242
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,288
What a short-tempered man.

243
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,988
Money?

244
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,788
I dropped it and it went under the car.

245
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:31,988
Okay! I'll move the car and look for it.

246
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:34,088
Really? I'm glad. Thank you!

247
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,688
Just as I thought.

248
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:49,988
Manicure?

249
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:52,688
I found it.

250
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,288
Thank you, sir.

251
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,988
Inspector? This is Kogoro.

252
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:00,188
I've found out where Mr. Kimura is.

253
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,688
What?

254
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,888
Mr. Kimura, where are you?

255
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:08,388
Please answer me, Mr. Kimura!

256
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:11,388
Hey, it's cold here. So hurry up and show yourself.

257
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,988
Yes, this is Kogoro.

258
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:19,988
Oh, Inspector!

259
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:23,588
I've found out where Mr. Kimura is. He's by the thicket.

260
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:26,088
And Mr. Mouri, take care not to catch cold because it's cold.

261
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,988
Hurry! Hurry!

262
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:40,788
Mr. Kimura! Mr. Kimura!

263
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,488
Mr. Kimura!

264
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:55,188
Inspector! Isn't that Mr. Mouri on board that boat?

265
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:56,388
It is Mr. Mouri!

266
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:58,388
He's out there in clear view with nothing to protect him.

267
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:01,388
He has no chance against the sniper! Talk about reckless!

268
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:10,688
Inspector.

269
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,588
On the left side of the lakeside opposite here, something glittered.

270
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:15,688
What? It's a rifle.

271
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:18,088
It could be the rifle of the sniper who is after Mr. Mouri's life!

272
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:20,088
-Hurry, Takagi. -Yes, sir!

273
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,088
Mr. Mouri!

274
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:31,988
Mr. Mouri!

275
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,888
Save Mr. Mouri!

276
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,388
-Hurry! Hurry! -Yes, sir...

277
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:39,888
Officer Takagi, go get the boats.

278
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,388
-Hurry! We've got to save him no matter what. -I'll go ask for support.

279
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:44,488
Will both of you come with me?

280
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:46,988
Inspector!

281
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,688
Conan.

282
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:49,988
Where's Pops?

283
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:56,388
Inspector Megure.

284
00:17:56,388 --> 00:18:00,088
We found this in the water.

285
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:02,588
And?

286
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:05,288
We could not locate Mr. Mouri though.

287
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,888
The man from Bar Lemon.

288
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:16,288
Yes. I suddenly got a call from Mrs. Kimura,

289
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:17,988
and couldn't make out the address she gave me.

290
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:23,188
I thought I had to relay the message to Mr. Mouri as soon as possible.

291
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,288
I had no idea that things would turn out like this.

292
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:32,088
It sure gets cold when the sun goes down, Mr. Kimura.

293
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:34,588
Mr. Mouri! You're okay!

294
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:37,688
Huh? I picked this up.

295
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:41,588
I get it. You put a dummy on board the boat and...

296
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,788
Yes, yes. You tried to lure the sniper out.

297
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,488
I'm so glad. You are indeed Kogoro Mouri.

298
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:49,788
Inspector, what about Mr. Kimura?

299
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,188
Did you find him?

300
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:57,688
Inspector, you don't have to worry about him.

301
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,288
What do you mean?

302
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:03,688
There is no such person by the name of Kimura to begin with.

303
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,588
In other words, the culprit is targeting me.

304
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:10,588
In order to camouflage his motive towards me,

305
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:13,588
the sniper made up a character by the name of Kimura.

306
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:15,688
Made up? A motive?

307
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,388
Yes. If I were to be killed,

308
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,088
the police will thoroughly investigate my surroundings

309
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,688
and will be able to trace the sniper from there.

310
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:29,588
But if I were to be killed because I was mistaken for a man named Kimura,

311
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:31,788
it will make investigation difficult.

312
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:36,288
Because there will be nothing connecting me to this man.

313
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,088
Which means that the accident at the construction site,

314
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,788
the hit-and-run after that

315
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,888
and the warning mail of murder to be carried out

316
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:46,588
were all camouflage that the sniper schemed?

317
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,588
Do you have evidence that he doesn't exist?

318
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,888
Then who is the sniper?

319
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,588
Now, hold your horses.

320
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:53,688
Mr. Inoue.

321
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,988
You have a briefcase in your car, don't you?

322
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,988
Could we have a look at it?

323
00:19:58,988 --> 00:19:59,988
Yes, go ahead.

324
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:02,088
I'll go get it.

325
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,388
It's in the trunk.

326
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:04,988
By the way, Mr. Inoue.

327
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:08,588
You gave me the service coupon in Bar Lemon

328
00:20:08,588 --> 00:20:11,388
just to provide services for me.

329
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,888
You waited for an opportunity.

330
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:17,188
When I fell asleep after getting drunk,

331
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:21,188
you exchanged the jacket and cell phone that you had prepared with mine.

332
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,388
No. Mr. Kimura really came and...

333
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,888
He went home after he had a drink?

334
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,588
But he only drank water.

335
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:30,888
The contents of Mr. Kimura's bottle was water.

336
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,488
Inspector, I found it.

337
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,588
This is...

338
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:38,888
The rifle that fired at me.

339
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,788
Do you have proof that I fired it?

340
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:43,088
In that dummy over there,

341
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,888
you can find the bullet of a rifle in its left chest.

342
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:48,688
If you match the bullet and the traces that the bullet left behind,

343
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:51,488
and if the rifle mark matches,

344
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,488
it will serve as immovable evidence.

345
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:56,888
But I have no motive to go after Mr. Mouri's life.

346
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,388
You do. You have a grudge against me.

347
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,088
Please look through the file.

348
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,388
-Conan. -Yes, sir.

349
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,388
Here you are.

350
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,288
What's this?

351
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:09,788
The grudge that you have against me for arresting you.

352
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:11,988
That picture is of you, back then.

353
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:13,988
After serving time, you got yourself plastic surgery.

354
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,988
Well, I don't know how you did it

355
00:21:15,988 --> 00:21:18,788
but you also changed your family register and became a different person.

356
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,788
Mr. Hiroshi Ukita.

357
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,588
This is your real name.

358
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:23,988
If you insist that I'm wrong,

359
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:26,388
let's have you remove the manicure you have on your fingers

360
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,688
with nail polish remover and try matching your fingerprints.

361
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:38,488
I finally got myself a girlfriend and needed money to get married to her.

362
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:42,388
That was the last job I did, but I got nabbed by you.

363
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,388
She left me.

364
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,688
I swore that once I got out,

365
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,888
I would get back at you for messing up my life.

366
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:49,588
Cut out your stupid talk!

367
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:53,388
You could never become happy with money that you had to commit a crime for!

368
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:56,188
Don't you think that you're a fool for trying to get back at Mr. Mouri

369
00:21:56,188 --> 00:22:00,088
for your own wrongdoing, committing an additional crime?

370
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:29,888
You never know when someone like me, being such a famous detective,

371
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,888
could become a target of some sniper.

372
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:34,188
I tell you, he's hopeless.

373
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:37,988
The one in the class next to ours, the boy called Kitada.

374
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:40,088
A thief! Conan, hold my bag for me, will you?

375
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,388
That person is...

376
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:48,188
Dad?

377
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,888
What're you doing dressed like that?

378
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,188
If you see any suspicious looking guy, let me know right away.

379
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:58,288
You're the one who looks most suspicious.

380
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:00,888
"Next Episode"

381
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:03,888
The client is a family of musicians.

382
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:08,188
There's a perfect-pitch composer among them.

383
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:10,888
Perfect pitch?

384
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:12,588
A Stradivarius?

385
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:18,088
Pops! Park the car under that window.

386
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,088
Hurry!

387
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:22,288
Wait. That's absurd.

388
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:29,588
Next Conan, "Cacophony of Stradivarius! Prelude!"

389
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,415
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,815
"Requiem"

391
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:36,115
The Detective Conan Series enters its 10th year.

392
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:37,615
I have a feeling something's going to happen this year.

393
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:39,519
-Root for us, okay? -Root for us, okay?
