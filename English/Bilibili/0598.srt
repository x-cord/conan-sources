1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.740
Dr. Agasa took us to a hot spring inn in Hakone.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
The filming for the newest version of the movie

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.540
called the "Blood Smoke Hitman" was taking place there.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.540
"Ganji Tetsuyama (67)" -We met scriptwriter, Mr. Ganji Tetsuyama,

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.040
"Mishio Natori (28)" -the actress playing the heroine Ms. Mishio Natori,

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.240
"Junsaku Tanzawa (34)" -her manager Mr. Junsaku Tanzawa,

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.740
"Unpei Terado (33)" -and the lead actor Mr. Unpei Terado.

8
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.440
Early in the morning the following day,

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.940
we went to the lake top outdoor spa

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.940
and found Mr. Tetsuyama murdered in the women's bath.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.240
Judging from the circumstances,

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.040
the culprit most likely waited for Mr. Tetsuyama

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.540
outside the spa all night and ambushed him,

14
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.840
then mingled among the crowd after committing the crime.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.140
The only guests who walked around alone the night before were...

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.740
Ms. Mishio, Mr. Tanzawa and Mr. Terado.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.640
The culprit is most probably among the three.

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.840
Brooding over passing seasons

19
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.640
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.440
An actor falls into a trap.

21
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.540
The spa mystery is finally solved.

22
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:47.703 --> 00:02:52.903
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 2)"

26
00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:55.903
If so, the culprit is...

27
00:02:55.903 --> 00:02:58.303
the woman right here!

28
00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.503
Last night I overheard Mr. Tetsuyama

29
00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.003
talking on the phone in the lobby.

30
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.603
He was saying, "So you've finally decided to do it."

31
00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.103
"Let's take a dip in the open-air bath on the lake

32
00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.703
with the morning sun shining on us."

33
00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:11.003
Or, "If you don't like the lead actor,

34
00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.703
I could make a switch."

35
00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:17.503
I'm sure she used her feminine wiles to lure Mr. Tetsuyama here and...

36
00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:18.903
I see...

37
00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:22.503
If so, I can see why he was found dead in the women's spa.

38
00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.703
How about it?

39
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.503
Were you the one talking to him on the phone?

40
00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:29.703
Yes, it was I.

41
00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:32.203
I told him that if he came to the women's spa first thing in the morning,

42
00:03:32.203 --> 00:03:35.903
I would soak in it until the other guests came.

43
00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:37.803
But, I was just lying.

44
00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:40.603
I only wanted to teach that perverted man a lesson

45
00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:43.603
by standing him up and embarrassing him.

46
00:03:43.603 --> 00:03:45.503
I wasn't the only actress who was fed up

47
00:03:45.503 --> 00:03:49.303
with Mr. Tetsuyama sexual harassment.

48
00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:54.703
Which means, that you both had a motive for killing Mr. Tetsuyama.

49
00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:56.803
Hey, hold it.

50
00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.003
This guy has a motive too.

51
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:01.503
Five years ago his role as leading actor

52
00:04:01.503 --> 00:04:03.003
was suddenly taken away from him by Mr. Tetsuyama.

53
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.603
And he hasn't acted since then.

54
00:04:05.603 --> 00:04:07.103
Is that true?

55
00:04:07.103 --> 00:04:10.903
Yes. I resented him a bit back then,

56
00:04:10.903 --> 00:04:13.303
but now I'm grateful for what he did.

57
00:04:13.303 --> 00:04:14.803
Because thanks to him,

58
00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:18.203
I'm experiencing a variety of things other than being an actor.

59
00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:20.003
It's not that I hated him to the point

60
00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:21.703
of wanting to kill him either.

61
00:04:21.703 --> 00:04:23.903
Same here.

62
00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:25.003
Inspector Yokomizo.

63
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.303
What?

64
00:04:26.303 --> 00:04:29.103
This was found in the back of a basket in the changing room.

65
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:31.403
A PET of Japanese tea.

66
00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:34.603
It's not tea that's inside it, though...

67
00:04:34.603 --> 00:04:37.803
Yes. It looks like plain water.

68
00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:40.603
And, burnt remains of matches were found

69
00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:42.803
floating on the lake near the site of the crime.

70
00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:45.303
Burnt remains of matches?

71
00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:46.403
Why?

72
00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:48.703
Excuse me,

73
00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:52.103
why not have those three people meet

74
00:04:52.103 --> 00:04:53.703
with the employees who were at the entrance

75
00:04:53.703 --> 00:04:56.103
of the wharf from the main building?

76
00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:59.903
Right. If he were hiding here all night,

77
00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:03.603
he wouldn't have passed through that entrance yet, no?

78
00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.703
Yes. Well... you see, as for this floor

79
00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:08.003
the lights are set at low

80
00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:10.703
and kept dim until 6 am in the morning.

81
00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:14.003
Many people from the police and all passed through here today,

82
00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:15.903
so I really can't tell who's who.

83
00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:18.803
I do remember that Mr. Tetsuyama was the very first to come here

84
00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:22.803
and the children came here right after him though...

85
00:05:22.803 --> 00:05:24.003
You told us that Mr. Tetsuyama

86
00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:26.503
has a special privileges and gets to enter that outdoor spa

87
00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:27.903
earlier than anyone else,

88
00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:29.303
does he always do so?

89
00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:32.903
Yes, Mr. Tetsuyama loves to be the first to take a bath.

90
00:05:32.903 --> 00:05:35.203
So, when he stays at this inn

91
00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:38.803
the lights in the spa are turned on before 4:30 am,

92
00:05:38.803 --> 00:05:41.703
and we let him go through quite early.

93
00:05:41.703 --> 00:05:42.903
Inspector.

94
00:05:42.903 --> 00:05:46.203
It seems that one of the rings of the victim is missing.

95
00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:47.303
Ring?

96
00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:51.203
Yes. Only an empty case was left back at the room.

97
00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:55.403
On the case it said, "Nichiuri TV Newcomer Scenario Award".

98
00:05:57.203 --> 00:06:00.703
You mean the ring with the soybean sized jewel on it.

99
00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:03.103
That's right, the silver one.

100
00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:06.103
He used to wear it to parties

101
00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:07.603
or when he had to make speeches

102
00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:09.903
saying that it was like a good-luck charm for him.

103
00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:11.203
You can't find it anywhere?

104
00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:12.603
No, sir.

105
00:06:12.603 --> 00:06:14.403
It was probably disposed of into the lake

106
00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:16.403
along with the murder weapon.

107
00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:19.303
Didn't anything come out of the rooms of these three?

108
00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:21.703
No, but there's something that bothers us in each room.

109
00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:23.103
What?

110
00:06:23.103 --> 00:06:25.403
The ashtray of Mr. Terado's room

111
00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:27.303
was full of burnt remains of matches.

112
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.403
Matches?

113
00:06:28.403 --> 00:06:32.003
What's wrong with lighting cigarettes with matches?

114
00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:34.003
Inside the bag found in Mr. Tanzawa's room,

115
00:06:34.003 --> 00:06:35.903
we found gloves,

116
00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:37.803
but for some reason they were only for the left hand.

117
00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:39.803
They are golf gloves.

118
00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:42.003
A lot of people wear them only on their left hand

119
00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:43.603
to keep their hand from slipping.

120
00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.703
Me too, since I'm right handed.

121
00:06:45.703 --> 00:06:48.903
And, from the wastebasket in Ms. Natori's room,

122
00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:50.303
we found a cracked wine glass cup

123
00:06:50.303 --> 00:06:53.803
and on the table, a script with several pages crumpled.

124
00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:56.803
I was playing the role.

125
00:06:56.803 --> 00:06:58.303
When I was reading the script last night

126
00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:00.203
there was a scene where the character ripped out paper

127
00:07:00.203 --> 00:07:02.603
and threw a wine glass at the person she was with.

128
00:07:05.403 --> 00:07:08.503
I did it almost unconsciously.

129
00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:10.603
Concentrating my all into becoming the character

130
00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:12.503
is my style of acting.

131
00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:15.503
Concentrate on the role and become the character.

132
00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:20.803
I see. So, that's the story.

133
00:07:20.803 --> 00:07:23.203
The culprit got too absorbed in his role,

134
00:07:23.203 --> 00:07:25.303
and forgot completely

135
00:07:25.303 --> 00:07:27.803
that he had hidden the conclusive evidence

136
00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:31.203
inside his own pocket.

137
00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:33.603
Inspector Yokomizo.

138
00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:36.603
I've spoken with the inn employees at the front desk.

139
00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:39.203
-And? -They said that around 5:30 am this morning,

140
00:07:39.203 --> 00:07:41.903
Ms. Natori turned her room key in to the front desk

141
00:07:41.903 --> 00:07:44.003
and still hasn't come to pick it up.

142
00:07:44.003 --> 00:07:46.903
Mr. Terado at about 2 am this morning,

143
00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:48.903
called an employee up to his room

144
00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.003
saying that the air conditioner had broken down.

145
00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.803
Well, it turned out I wasn't operating it correctly though.

146
00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:55.803
Then, what about Mr. Tanzawa stopping

147
00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:58.103
at the front desk to get loose change at about 4:30 am?

148
00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.903
That's been confirmed too.

149
00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:02.503
He exchanged 1000 yen to 100 yen coins.

150
00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:04.103
What?

151
00:08:04.103 --> 00:08:05.103
Hey.

152
00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:06.503
Before we, the police came,

153
00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:08.703
is it really true that not even a single person

154
00:08:08.703 --> 00:08:10.703
went back to the main building from the wharf?

155
00:08:10.703 --> 00:08:12.303
No, sir.

156
00:08:12.303 --> 00:08:14.703
If so, these three people would've been

157
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.103
at the main building this morning,

158
00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:18.203
so the deduction about the culprit hiding

159
00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:20.903
all night inside the lake top outdoor spa

160
00:08:20.903 --> 00:08:24.803
that the brat made was completely off the mark?

161
00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:26.603
But that's...

162
00:08:29.903 --> 00:08:30.903
Dr. Agasa.

163
00:08:30.903 --> 00:08:32.203
So, you're up.

164
00:08:34.203 --> 00:08:36.903
If so, the culprit must've come into the outdoor spa

165
00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:38.803
from the lake after all,

166
00:08:38.803 --> 00:08:43.103
and after killing Mr. Tetsuyama returned to the lake and fled.

167
00:08:43.103 --> 00:08:46.203
Okay. Go ask around the places surrounding the lake...

168
00:08:46.203 --> 00:08:49.403
I don't think that will be necessary.

169
00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:53.403
Why? Because the killer is here...

170
00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:55.803
right in front of my eyes.

171
00:09:06.508 --> 00:09:07.508
Hey, hey...

172
00:09:07.508 --> 00:09:10.708
I don't have any idea about the murder, you know.

173
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:13.708
Never mind just pretend to talk along with my voice.

174
00:09:13.708 --> 00:09:15.008
What is this?

175
00:09:15.008 --> 00:09:16.808
Butting in all of a sudden.

176
00:09:16.808 --> 00:09:18.708
No, I just...

177
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.708
I'm saying that despite traces of someone

178
00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:24.808
having been hiding by the outdoor spa all night...

179
00:09:24.808 --> 00:09:27.808
Are you guys so blind that you can't see it?

180
00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:29.608
Traces?

181
00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:32.208
The bottle of green tea that for some reason had water in it

182
00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:34.108
and was found in the changing room

183
00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:35.908
and the burnt remains of matches

184
00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:38.208
that were found floating in the lake are evidence.

185
00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:42.008
It's too cold to wait all night outside the outdoor spa on the lake,

186
00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:45.408
where the wind blows through during this season.

187
00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:48.808
And even if you were to enter the spa from the veranda,

188
00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:50.008
with the lights and the heater turned off,

189
00:09:50.008 --> 00:09:54.308
it would be impossible to endure the cold in the changing room.

190
00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:57.008
The only way to keep warm is...

191
00:09:57.008 --> 00:10:00.108
Don't tell me the culprit went into the spa?

192
00:10:00.108 --> 00:10:01.708
Yes, that's right.

193
00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:03.108
After the culprit drank up all the tea,

194
00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:05.108
judging from the fact that the culprit drank up not only the green tea

195
00:10:05.108 --> 00:10:06.308
but refilled the bottle repeatedly with water

196
00:10:06.308 --> 00:10:08.208
from the sink of the changing room,

197
00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:11.308
I'm sure that the culprit soaked repeatedly in the water all night.

198
00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:14.308
Soaking in the spa makes you thirsty.

199
00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:16.008
Then, what about the burnt remains of the matches

200
00:10:16.008 --> 00:10:17.808
that were afloat in the lake?

201
00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:20.808
The culprit smoked to stay awake.

202
00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:25.308
And did so on the veranda to avoid making the spa smell of smoke.

203
00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:27.308
Which means that the suspicious one would be you

204
00:10:27.308 --> 00:10:29.208
because you had cigarettes on you.

205
00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:31.008
Hey, hey, I...

206
00:10:31.008 --> 00:10:33.908
I said the culprit smoked.

207
00:10:33.908 --> 00:10:36.308
I didn't say the culprit smoked cigarettes.

208
00:10:36.308 --> 00:10:37.808
What?

209
00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:41.008
Not cigarettes...

210
00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:42.608
A pipe?

211
00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:46.908
Wait. If the culprit waited while smoking a pipe...

212
00:10:46.908 --> 00:10:49.508
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:53.808
The one who was hiding all night by the lake top outdoor spa was...

214
00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:57.408
the one who was killed, Mr. Tetsuyama.

215
00:10:57.408 --> 00:10:59.208
-What? -What?

216
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:02.608
Then, who is the Mr. Tetsuyama that went pass this entrance here

217
00:11:02.608 --> 00:11:04.308
at 4:30 am in the morning?

218
00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:06.208
That one's the killer.

219
00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:09.808
He was disguised as Mr. Tetsuyama.

220
00:11:09.808 --> 00:11:11.308
In other words, by reversing the common sense

221
00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:13.908
that there would be no reason for the victim to hide

222
00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:18.208
at the would-be crime scene for a long time for the culprit,

223
00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:20.608
we were thrown off by a psychological trick that was set up.

224
00:11:20.608 --> 00:11:23.008
Hey, is that right?

225
00:11:23.008 --> 00:11:25.108
You guys let Mr. Tetsuyama pass through

226
00:11:25.108 --> 00:11:26.808
the entrance to the outdoor spa, didn't you?

227
00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:30.808
Well, I think it was him.

228
00:11:30.808 --> 00:11:33.308
His unique way of walking.

229
00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:35.608
And, the stern facial expression he wore,

230
00:11:35.608 --> 00:11:38.608
as if coercing us were manners that only belonged to Mr. Tetsuyama.

231
00:11:38.608 --> 00:11:41.908
However, back then, this floor was dimly lit

232
00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:43.908
and moreover, that person

233
00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:47.008
was wearing a knitted cap, wearing glasses

234
00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:49.708
and had a towel around him as if it were a muffler, right?

235
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:52.008
Yes.

236
00:11:52.008 --> 00:11:53.708
I see.

237
00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:56.908
You knew Mr. Tetsuyama very well

238
00:11:56.908 --> 00:11:58.308
so as an actor and former actor,

239
00:11:58.308 --> 00:12:02.308
you both could've acted out being Mr. Tetsuyama

240
00:12:02.308 --> 00:12:04.808
if you wanted to.

241
00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.208
Hold it.

242
00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.208
If so, this woman who's also

243
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:10.208
an actress should be suspected too.

244
00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:11.808
If she wears many layers of clothing,

245
00:12:11.808 --> 00:12:13.908
she could imitate his physique,

246
00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:15.208
and if he wore a stern facial expression,

247
00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:17.308
she wouldn't have had to say a word.

248
00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:19.708
She also told him that if he came to the women's spa

249
00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:21.008
first thing in the morning,

250
00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:23.208
she would bathe with him until the other guests came.

251
00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:27.008
If she made him promise to hide in the women's spa all night

252
00:12:27.008 --> 00:12:29.008
then it all fits in, doesn't it?

253
00:12:29.008 --> 00:12:30.908
That's true,

254
00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:36.108
if the person on the other side of the line was really her.

255
00:12:36.108 --> 00:12:39.608
Really her? Are you saying she's lying?

256
00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:43.608
She had to say so to protect him.

257
00:12:43.608 --> 00:12:47.808
Mr. Terado was watching Mr. Tetsuyama talking on the phone

258
00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:50.008
and if Ms. Natori completely denies

259
00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:51.808
that she wasn't the one who was talking on the other side of the line,

260
00:12:51.808 --> 00:12:55.608
there would only be one person left who would turn out to be the culprit.

261
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.908
Ms. Natori's manager, Mr. Tanzawa.

262
00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:01.808
You're the only one.

263
00:13:01.808 --> 00:13:03.408
Just what're you talking about?

264
00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.708
I'm not lying.

265
00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:10.008
Mr. Tanazawa probably told Mr. Tetsuyama

266
00:13:10.008 --> 00:13:11.808
that Ms. Natori will be going first thing

267
00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:13.908
in the morning to take a bath at the outdoor spa on the lake.

268
00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:16.008
If you want to watch her taking a bath,

269
00:13:16.008 --> 00:13:20.308
stay in hiding all night and wait for her.

270
00:13:20.308 --> 00:13:22.308
A strategy that only you,

271
00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:25.408
as her manager could've carried out.

272
00:13:25.408 --> 00:13:27.308
Mr. Tetsuyama, because of that phone call

273
00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:31.708
remarked, "So, she's finally decided to listen to me."

274
00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:35.908
I'll bet Mr. Tetsuyama nagged you repeatedly about this.

275
00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:37.508
Of course, Mr. Tetsuyama

276
00:13:37.508 --> 00:13:39.208
could've come to the spa first thing in the morning

277
00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:41.308
and hid in the women's spa.

278
00:13:41.308 --> 00:13:42.808
But, if Ms. Natori finds out

279
00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:45.708
that Mr. Tetsuyama went to the outdoor spa before her,

280
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:49.008
you probably talked him in by saying that she may get suspicious.

281
00:13:49.008 --> 00:13:50.808
This way, you, Mr. Tanazawa,

282
00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:54.408
made Mr. Tetsuyama hide on the veranda of the women's bath,

283
00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:55.708
and you headed for the outdoor spa

284
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:59.508
a little before 5 am in the morning.

285
00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:04.008
Then, you took off your disguise in the changing room.

286
00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:05.908
And, you probably fast talked Mr. Tetsuyama

287
00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:07.708
into coming into the spa, saying where he was wasn't good.

288
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:10.508
Then, you struck him with a blunt weapon and killed him.

289
00:14:10.508 --> 00:14:12.608
After that, you planned to re-enter

290
00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:16.208
the spa amidst the confusion, didn't you?

291
00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:20.208
Because you figured that maybe some of your hair may be found in the spa.

292
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:24.108
But, the children came earlier than expected,

293
00:14:24.108 --> 00:14:27.008
and instead of getting all worked up over finding the dead body

294
00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:30.208
they blocked the entrance to the spa.

295
00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:32.008
Although you wanted to hide the traces

296
00:14:32.008 --> 00:14:34.308
of you being at the scene of the crime,

297
00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:37.108
you just couldn't come around to doing so.

298
00:14:37.108 --> 00:14:39.208
That's why Mr. Tanazawa, who had no other choice...

299
00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:41.808
Hey, you're talking like you actually saw everything but...

300
00:14:41.808 --> 00:14:43.708
Do you have proof or what?

301
00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:45.908
Yes, that evidence is...

302
00:14:45.908 --> 00:14:48.708
What are you doing in secret, Conan?

303
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:52.408
That's the voice changer bow-tie, isn't it?

304
00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:54.508
Are you talking in Dr. Agasa's voice?

305
00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:56.208
You can't talk in your own voice?

306
00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:59.608
No. He's helping Dr. Agasa who doesn't know

307
00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:01.508
anything about the case out by whispering from behind.

308
00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:03.008
I see.

309
00:15:03.008 --> 00:15:04.708
Thanks, Ai.

310
00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:06.308
Don't worry.

311
00:15:06.308 --> 00:15:09.508
I won't let them take a peek like you did.

312
00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:10.808
Peek in?

313
00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:15.808
As to that, you don't have to worry about it either.

314
00:15:15.808 --> 00:15:17.708
All I got to see is your butt.

315
00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.308
Butt?

316
00:15:19.308 --> 00:15:21.508
What about... butt?

317
00:15:21.508 --> 00:15:22.908
Nothing...

318
00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:26.108
Shoots. I talked in Dr. Agasa's voice.

319
00:15:26.108 --> 00:15:28.308
But, he knew something.

320
00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:30.608
Something that only the culprit would've known.

321
00:15:30.608 --> 00:15:33.108
Mr. Tanzawa that is...

322
00:15:33.108 --> 00:15:35.708
That's why Mr. Tanzawa took the lead

323
00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:38.308
and step foot into the spa.

324
00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:39.908
That's the evidence.

325
00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:41.408
What?

326
00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:43.608
Because the children were blocking the entrance,

327
00:15:43.608 --> 00:15:47.308
it's only natural to want to find out what's going on inside.

328
00:15:47.308 --> 00:15:50.108
But, the scene was the women's spa you know.

329
00:15:50.108 --> 00:15:52.308
Wouldn't you normally ask a woman

330
00:15:52.308 --> 00:15:54.708
to go check the place out first of all.

331
00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:56.208
Yes.

332
00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:58.408
Mr. Tanzawa already knew...

333
00:15:58.408 --> 00:16:01.208
that in the spa, there would only be Mr. Tetsuyama's dead body

334
00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:03.408
and the children.

335
00:16:03.408 --> 00:16:05.308
He also knew that even if he inevitably happened to look

336
00:16:05.308 --> 00:16:06.508
at the naked bodies of the children,

337
00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.608
it would not be a problem.

338
00:16:13.108 --> 00:16:15.108
What's wrong, Ai?

339
00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:19.308
You're emitting a sinister and dreadful aura.

340
00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:21.708
You look scary.

341
00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:25.008
That's proof? What a laugh.

342
00:16:25.008 --> 00:16:28.508
If it's immovable evidence, you know of it too, don't you?

343
00:16:28.508 --> 00:16:31.308
That Mr. Tanzawa still has it on him.

344
00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:37.108
It's that ring that you said on the spur of the moment,

345
00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:39.508
had a soybean size jewel on it,

346
00:16:39.508 --> 00:16:41.108
in order to protect him.

347
00:16:41.108 --> 00:16:42.908
She said to protect him?

348
00:16:42.908 --> 00:16:46.508
Yes. If it were a ring with such a large jewel on it,

349
00:16:46.508 --> 00:16:49.408
it would be readily apparent if you wear it on your finger.

350
00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.808
You would never think that the blackened ring

351
00:16:51.808 --> 00:16:57.608
that Mr. Tanazawa is wearing on the finger of his left hand is the one.

352
00:16:57.608 --> 00:16:58.908
What?

353
00:17:01.408 --> 00:17:02.808
This?

354
00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:05.908
When he was told to show you his belongings...

355
00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:12.008
he remembered that he had forgotten that in the left pocket of his slacks,

356
00:17:12.008 --> 00:17:15.808
the ring that he had forgotten to dispose of was still inside.

357
00:17:15.808 --> 00:17:18.208
So, he fuddled inside his pocket and wore the ring on his middle finger

358
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.008
by sticking his hand into his pocket.

359
00:17:20.008 --> 00:17:22.408
He also made sure that he wore the ring so the jewel would be hiding,

360
00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.708
facing the palm of his hand.

361
00:17:25.008 --> 00:17:27.608
But, why did he go out of his way to wear the ring?

362
00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:31.708
Because the silver sulfurized and blackened.

363
00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:34.008
This hot spring is a sulfur spring.

364
00:17:34.008 --> 00:17:37.408
Reacting to the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide,

365
00:17:37.408 --> 00:17:40.408
the surface of the silver ring sulfurized and blackened.

366
00:17:40.408 --> 00:17:43.508
Seeing the blackened ring,

367
00:17:43.508 --> 00:17:46.308
he figured he had to remove the ring.

368
00:17:46.308 --> 00:17:50.008
He feigned coming to take a bath just now and yet

369
00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:54.208
he didn't want to be suspected of having soaked in the spa for a long time.

370
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:57.208
Well, but if the spa has a highly concentrated content of sulfur in it,

371
00:17:57.208 --> 00:18:00.908
the ring would blacken in no time at all.

372
00:18:00.908 --> 00:18:02.908
But, what an idiot...

373
00:18:02.908 --> 00:18:04.408
to forget to dispose of it.

374
00:18:04.408 --> 00:18:06.708
He couldn't help it.

375
00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:09.508
Because he was playing the role of being Mr. Tetsuyama.

376
00:18:09.508 --> 00:18:13.208
Mr. Tetsuyama always held his pipe in his left hand

377
00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:15.008
so he was probably left-handed.

378
00:18:15.008 --> 00:18:17.308
That's why you put the ring in your left back pocket

379
00:18:17.308 --> 00:18:19.708
that you normally don't put anything inside, right?

380
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:22.208
You just planned to leave it there until you were ready

381
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.508
to dispose of the blood spattered bathrobe and outer robe,

382
00:18:24.508 --> 00:18:27.208
as well as the murder weapon into the lake.

383
00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:29.008
You pushed the button of the vending machine

384
00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:33.608
with your left hand and called me "brat", too...

385
00:18:33.608 --> 00:18:35.608
You were playing the role of Mr. Tetsuyama

386
00:18:35.608 --> 00:18:37.608
already from that time, right?

387
00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:38.808
Yes.

388
00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:40.508
I really had it tough

389
00:18:40.508 --> 00:18:43.708
because I never acted the role

390
00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:46.008
of such a narrow minded man like him.

391
00:18:46.008 --> 00:18:47.508
Hey. Don't tell me...

392
00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:49.908
It's because you held a grudge against Mr. Tetsuyama

393
00:18:49.908 --> 00:18:51.908
for taking your role as leading actor away from you five years ago.

394
00:18:51.908 --> 00:18:55.908
Yes, to put it simply that was my motive.

395
00:18:55.908 --> 00:18:59.608
The role I was denied was for the middle aged hitman,

396
00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:03.208
in Scarlet Wellspring that is currently being made.

397
00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:06.608
Since I received rave reviews for the youth part,

398
00:19:06.608 --> 00:19:09.008
I thought that I would naturally be continuing the role.

399
00:19:09.008 --> 00:19:11.108
Maybe he thought that you were still too young

400
00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.308
to act out the role?

401
00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:16.708
Yes. I thought so too.

402
00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.908
Because he also told me that I was too young,

403
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.108
that I lacked the melancholic feeling that ripens with age,

404
00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:25.108
and that I should accumulate more diverse experiences and all.

405
00:19:25.108 --> 00:19:30.008
That's why I quit acting and started working as her manager.

406
00:19:30.008 --> 00:19:32.408
I experienced what I never got to experience when I was an actor.

407
00:19:32.408 --> 00:19:36.208
I experienced the hardships of being on the bottom of the ladder.

408
00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:40.508
I got to thinking that he wanted me to go through all of what I did.

409
00:19:40.508 --> 00:19:44.108
And, I found out that they would be filming Scarlet Wellspring again,

410
00:19:44.108 --> 00:19:47.708
so I called and pleading with him to give me the part,

411
00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:49.008
but he was so wasted

412
00:19:49.008 --> 00:19:51.808
that he didn't recognize that it was me on the phone.

413
00:19:51.808 --> 00:19:55.208
Junsaku Tanzawa to play the leading role as the hitman?

414
00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:59.308
No. He won't do. He's too good.

415
00:19:59.308 --> 00:20:01.408
Just like when he played the youth part,

416
00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:03.608
I don't want to feel vexed after he's reputed by the public

417
00:20:03.608 --> 00:20:06.108
as acting the part out way better than the original work.

418
00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:10.908
No matter what I did, he wasn't going

419
00:20:10.908 --> 00:20:13.708
to give me the part of the middle aged hitman.

420
00:20:13.708 --> 00:20:15.308
Unfortunately, that is,

421
00:20:15.308 --> 00:20:19.608
so long as he remains in this world...

422
00:20:19.608 --> 00:20:22.508
The black and white version of the Scarlet Wellspring

423
00:20:22.508 --> 00:20:24.208
that I saw as a child

424
00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:27.208
was what intrigued me to become an actor,

425
00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:29.408
so I wanted the part at all costs.

426
00:20:29.408 --> 00:20:31.508
But, thinking back,

427
00:20:31.508 --> 00:20:35.708
maybe I couldn't have acted it out after all.

428
00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:42.108
If I was able to become a hitman soon after I killed him,

429
00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:45.308
I wouldn't have goofed in this way.

430
00:20:45.308 --> 00:20:46.608
Mishio.

431
00:20:46.608 --> 00:20:49.008
Act the part of the woman owner of the inn with all your might

432
00:20:49.008 --> 00:20:54.308
because it's a part that will open up the breadth of your roles.

433
00:20:54.308 --> 00:20:56.208
I can't,

434
00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:57.508
because you're the one who taught me

435
00:20:57.508 --> 00:21:00.308
that I'd have to live the role I'd be acting

436
00:21:00.308 --> 00:21:03.108
even in my private life until the filming is completed.

437
00:21:03.108 --> 00:21:07.208
The one who hired the hitman was the woman herself.

438
00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:11.908
In order to conceal this fact without batting an eyebrow.

439
00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:17.308
The woman attempts to kill the killer in cold blood.

440
00:21:17.308 --> 00:21:20.008
I can no longer...

441
00:21:20.008 --> 00:21:22.508
go on acting this role.

442
00:22:43.808 --> 00:22:46.808
Okay, everybody, don't forget your things.

443
00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:48.108
Yes!

444
00:22:48.108 --> 00:22:49.808
We should get one more souvenir.

445
00:22:49.808 --> 00:22:53.108
Hey, Dr. Agasa. Come here for a while.

446
00:22:53.108 --> 00:22:55.608
After I changed clothes after taking a bath,

447
00:22:55.608 --> 00:22:58.308
there's a stinging feeling on my butt.

448
00:22:58.308 --> 00:22:59.508
Will you take a look at it for me?

449
00:22:59.508 --> 00:23:01.008
Okay...

450
00:23:01.008 --> 00:23:02.608
Talking of hot springs,

451
00:23:02.608 --> 00:23:06.108
Ai was at the men's spa a while ago.

452
00:23:06.108 --> 00:23:07.808
What? Why?

453
00:23:07.808 --> 00:23:09.108
I wonder...

454
00:23:09.108 --> 00:23:11.708
She was saying that she was looking for something.

455
00:23:13.508 --> 00:23:15.408
It's a bit red and swollen.

456
00:23:15.408 --> 00:23:18.108
No joke?

457
00:23:18.108 --> 00:23:19.408
-What? -What?

458
00:23:19.408 --> 00:23:21.408
That's red pepper...

459
00:23:21.408 --> 00:23:24.608
If you rinse it off with water, you'll be just fine.

460
00:23:24.608 --> 00:23:28.108
There's red pepper powder on the inside of your undies.

461
00:23:28.108 --> 00:23:29.108
What?

462
00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:32.408
Well, there's nothing to worry about.

463
00:23:32.408 --> 00:23:34.608
It's only the naked body of a child.

464
00:23:34.608 --> 00:23:38.008
It's no problem if anyone sees it, right?

465
00:23:41.308 --> 00:23:43.408
That rat...

466
00:23:47.308 --> 00:23:49.208
Catch him!

467
00:23:49.208 --> 00:23:50.908
Stop.

468
00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:52.108
Move it.

469
00:23:52.108 --> 00:23:53.208
Oh, no.

470
00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:55.308
He's Kanemura.

471
00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:58.108
He's member of the fraud group, right?

472
00:23:58.108 --> 00:23:59.508
The scene of the crime is in between

473
00:23:59.508 --> 00:24:02.408
this Natsuhabara Station and Beika Station.

474
00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:04.108
It's near Sugame Station.

475
00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:09.508
I understand how you feel.

476
00:24:09.508 --> 00:24:11.608
But, it's not right.

477
00:24:11.608 --> 00:24:16.808
Next Conan, "A Friend of Justice".

478
00:24:17.876 --> 00:24:20.076
Next Conan's Hint:

479
00:24:20.076 --> 00:24:21.876
"Automatic Wicket".

480
00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:23.376
The next episode, "A Friend of Justice"

481
00:24:23.376 --> 00:24:24.576
It's about Yaiba.

482
00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:26.276
No, he's not appearing. It's about me, then.

483
00:24:26.276 --> 00:24:26.839
What?
