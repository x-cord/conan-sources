1
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:07,213
As times change,
difficult cases increase in number!

2
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:09,593
Today's stage is high school baseball!

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,023
A thin line separates outs and safes!

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:13,853
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:16,143
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:18,393
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,999
The Shredded Championship Flag Case.

8
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,519
Beika High
Shuko Academy

9
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,469
Come on, you can do it!

10
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,679
Hey, I can't hear you!

11
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:18,769
They won't win unless you cheer louder!

12
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,769
Dad! This isn't like pro baseball!

13
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,489
Send that ball flying!

14
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:32,639
Why did he come to cheer
for his bartender's son?

15
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,459
Besides, there's no point
with such a one-sided game...

16
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:41,759
Shuko's pitcher sure is good, though.

17
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,849
Strike two!

18
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,559
Strike three! You're out!

19
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,029
Strike!

20
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:01,649
Strike two!

21
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,949
Strike three! You're out!

22
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:14,099
You're so cute, Kaji-kun!

23
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,639
Whose side are you on?!

24
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,489
But he's just so cute!

25
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,509
Really? Let me see!

26
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,469
This could be a good game!

27
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:27,099
Hey, now...

28
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,469
Plus his dad's a doctor and
he's the school's best student!

29
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,019
Too good to pass up!

30
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,319
Say, didn't Shuko win the
district championship last year?

31
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,969
Yep! They're looking to
win it this year too!

32
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,279
They've got such a great pitcher!

33
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,949
But when did Shuko get so good?

34
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,429
It all thanks to Kaji-kun!

35
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:57,269
The current headmaster
founded it way back when

36
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,839
as a prestigious prep school.

37
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,379
But its image suddenly changed
when Kaji-kun showed up!

38
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,269
You sure know a lot!

39
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,349
I know everything about Kaji-kun!

40
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,189
What are those people doing?

41
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:26,659
Thanks, Principal!

42
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,219
Even the principal?
Shuko sure has lots of school spirit!

43
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:34,719
Safe!

44
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,809
Huh? They're gone.

45
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,309
Balk! Ball one!

46
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:59,469
It's okay, Kaji!

47
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,179
You can do it!

48
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,079
Good hit!

49
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,309
Kaji-kun...

50
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:36,099
What happened?

51
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:44,189
It started after he got that balk call...

52
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,689
It looked like he saw something.

53
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,739
But what?

54
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,449
What do you think's wrong?

55
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,409
Maybe he has a stomachache?

56
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,889
Who was that?

57
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,769
Eto-kun, Shuko's former southpaw ace.

58
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,769
But he got suspended for causing trouble

59
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,599
after Kaji-kun stole the spotlight!

60
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,769
He must've asked to pitch.

61
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,519
I guess he wasn't allowed...

62
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,219
Of course he wasn't!

63
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,899
Nobody can take Kaji-kun's place!

64
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,859
Nurse's Office

65
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,599
That's it!

66
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,889
This stuff's great!

67
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,359
Kaji-kun is being mocked...

68
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,559
Oh, come on now...

69
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,019
Are you serious?!

70
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,409
I wonder what happened.

71
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,309
That's horrible!

72
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:31,259
Authorized personnel only!

73
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,719
The championship flag
was shredded up?!

74
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:39,889
Totally thrashed!
Everyone was in a panic!

75
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,869
But who would do that?!

76
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:43,189
That's just it...

77
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,469
Ever since last year's victory,

78
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:48,929
we've had all sorts
of jealousy-related trouble.

79
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:52,269
If this was similarly
done by an outsider,

80
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:56,099
then we're victims, and we
can save our school's reputation.

81
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,389
But we were still responsible
for the flag's safe-keeping.

82
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,079
We have no choice but
to drop out of the tournament.

83
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:07,929
That's terrible...

84
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,379
Why don't they call the police?

85
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,269
To save face.

86
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,639
They want to figure out if this was

87
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,969
an inside or an outside job first.

88
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,389
I see.

89
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,349
Dad, get up! We need you!

90
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,769
Huh? I can't drink any more...

91
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,729
You can't be serious, Ran...

92
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,619
Two windows...

93
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,749
One faces the field...

94
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,099
Wow! It's like the
best seat in the house!

95
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,169
Hey, you! This is
authorized personnel only!

96
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,629
Dad! No violence!

97
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:55,719
Yeah, yeah...

98
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,089
And one other window-- What the?!

99
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,469
The window's broken!

100
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:03,519
What's this?

101
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,979
There's a ladder leading up to it!

102
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,769
The culprit snuck in from outside.

103
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,889
Well done, Mori Kogoro-san!

104
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,739
I'm glad I asked you for help!

105
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,429
But they still have to
drop out of the tournament.

106
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,619
Everyone's sad but the principal...

107
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:32,459
Wait a minute! What's this?!

108
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,799
He's so useless!

109
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,929
Hey, Mister. Where
is that ladder usually at?

110
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:47,429
The storeroom. I have
no idea when it was taken.

111
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,189
Was the storeroom locked?

112
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:53,609
Actually, the key has
been missing all morning.

113
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,599
What?!

114
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:02,309
The keys to that office too?!

115
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,989
Yes, they disappeared
this morning.

116
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,449
I figured as such.

117
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,289
This was an inside job.

118
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,249
Come again?!

119
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:15,209
The culprit used the
key to enter this office.

120
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,339
What about the ladder?!

121
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,429
A ruse to make it look

122
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:26,679
like someone
snuck in from outside.

123
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,389
Do you have any proof of that?

124
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:33,309
Ahh! The floor's covered in glass!

125
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,279
The floor? That's it!

126
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,059
Yes. There's broken
glass near the window.

127
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,769
Had the culprit stepped in it,

128
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,079
glass shards would
have lodged in the shoes.

129
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,769
But the floor is scratch-free.

130
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,179
The culprit set the ladder up
but didn't enter through the window.

131
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,179
There was no reason to--

132
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,089
they had the key to the office.

133
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,549
Yeah, now you got it!

134
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,019
Did you want this to be
an outside job that badly?

135
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,969
I guess it might be natural
for any good principal, but...

136
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:13,349
It would seem this
happened during the game.

137
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:16,869
So the culprit wasn't at the game?

138
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:17,729
That's right.

139
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,179
I saw Eto-kun
enter the school building...

140
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:25,099
So did I!

141
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,599
Stop kidding around!

142
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,659
I did come inside,
but I went to the bathroom!

143
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,119
Can you prove that?

144
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:38,839
No, but I wasn't the only one inside!

145
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,419
Kaji-kun was holding his stomach--

146
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,389
That's right!
He went to the nurse's office!

147
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,349
It was me! I did it!

148
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:51,599
You did?!

149
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,019
You can't be serious!

150
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:57,929
I haven't been pitching well lately...

151
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,389
You saw me out there.

152
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,609
I was scared to
be in the tournament.

153
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,519
His pitching was bad.

154
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,059
But he lost his cool
only after the 7th-inning balk.

155
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,969
And if he didn't wanna play,

156
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,349
he could've faked an illness.

157
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:18,389
Would he really shred up
the flag and create a ruse?

158
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,049
Kenya!

159
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:20,879
Mom!

160
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,069
I saw her earlier...

161
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,559
Something's fishy here!

162
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,769
Why won't they look at each other?!

163
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:36,349
It was me! I did it!

164
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:39,519
No, I did it! I have proof!

165
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,029
Here! I did it with this!

166
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,779
It's the same fabric as the flag.

167
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:51,139
Kenya!

168
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,269
How could you?!

169
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,749
What were you thinking?!

170
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,519
Well?

171
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,429
They're deciding whether
to call the police or not.

172
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,099
Apparently, they need to
consult the ailing headmaster.

173
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,809
I still can't believe it.

174
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,479
Did he really do it?

175
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,319
I'm almost certain--

176
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:37,719
Yes, Kaji definitely saw
someone in the office then.

177
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:41,519
That's why he pitched
poorly and was relieved.

178
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,879
Then he went to the nurse's
office and the headmaster's office.

179
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:49,759
Hey, Conan-kun!
What're you looking at?

180
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,399
I don't think we
should be doing this...

181
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,269
What the?!

182
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,599
Aha! So that person did it!

183
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,639
But I don't understand why...

184
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,579
What was there to gain from this?

185
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,929
It's definitely strange, alright.

186
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,719
A friend that goes here
told me that even though

187
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:31,469
Kaji-kun was likely to
help them win again this year,

188
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,809
some people were complaining.

189
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,179
What?!

190
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,519
This used to be a top prep school.

191
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,519
They said that if the team got too good,

192
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,179
people wouldn't study as much.

193
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,359
That was the headmaster's policy.

194
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,559
He really hates sports.

195
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,349
He insists that
they're unnecessary;

196
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:58,809
all he wants is to create
notable people like himself.

197
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,369
He was actually
supposed to come today.

198
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:02,539
Why didn't he?

199
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,639
He was going to announce
the team's withdrawal

200
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,759
from the tournament,
but with his health failing...

201
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:15,469
That's it! That's the motive!

202
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:18,769
Now I just need the old man's help!

203
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,715
An autograph session for my fans?

204
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,875
Yeah! Sit over there!

205
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,725
All those girls are waiting!

206
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:42,645
Is it really okay
to do this at a school?

207
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,505
Here we go again...

208
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:51,375
Ahem! This is Mori Kogoro!

209
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,115
Can you hear me?

210
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,575
Dad?

211
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,995
Would everyone please
come to the headmaster's office?

212
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,045
I'm about to reveal
the truth behind this incident.

213
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:12,125
Mori-san! Your work here is over!

214
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,875
If this is about your payment--

215
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,335
No, I'm not done here;

216
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,965
the real culprit
hasn't been caught yet.

217
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:20,355
The real culprit? Don't be silly.

218
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,185
He's right here!

219
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,185
No, Kaji-kun isn't
the one responsible.

220
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,005
Then--

221
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,655
Nor is it his mother.

222
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,035
Then who?

223
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,045
If you purposely cut a flag up,

224
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:39,375
you'd probably cut the front.

225
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,035
Ran. Hold the flag up.

226
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,045
Okay.

227
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,965
As you can see,
the cuts on the front

228
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,585
go from the top
left to the bottom right.

229
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:53,255
The flagpole is on
the left, which means...

230
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:58,165
Ran. Pretend to cut
it as if you were the culprit.

231
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,055
It's hard to cut!

232
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:04,515
Yes. It's hard because
you're right-handed.

233
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:08,835
Ran. Do it as if
you were left-handed.

234
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:09,825
Like this?

235
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:10,835
Yes.

236
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:13,375
Cut downward with your left hand,

237
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,165
as you hold the flag with your right.

238
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,495
It's easy! And the cuts are the same!

239
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:22,455
You pitch with your right hand, correct?

240
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:23,715
Yes.

241
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:26,215
How about you, Eto-kun?

242
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:28,915
Eto?!

243
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,545
Was it you?!

244
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:34,385
Don't be stupid!
Yes, I am a southpaw, but!

245
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,965
I'm told you're a former ace pitcher.

246
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,875
Perhaps you felt there was no point

247
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:44,895
for the team to play
if you couldn't pitch for it.

248
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,805
No! It wasn't me!

249
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:47,895
How could you?!

250
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,815
He's right.

251
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:52,415
It wasn't Eto-kun?

252
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:55,715
Have another look at the flag,

253
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:56,775
where the cuts begin.

254
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,755
Where the cuts begin?

255
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:01,205
Don't they seem a little low?

256
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:06,045
Had the 180 cm
Kaji-kun or Eto-kun cut it,

257
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:09,045
they would've cut from higher up.

258
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,915
But the real culprit
couldn't reach the top.

259
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:16,175
In other words, the culprit is
under 160 cm in height.

260
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,135
How tall is Kaji-kun's mother?

261
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:21,755
157 cm.

262
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,425
But I hear you're right-handed?

263
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:24,845
Yes.

264
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:26,965
Which counts you out.

265
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,815
So why did you come to this office?

266
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,775
I--

267
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,695
Mom...

268
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:37,625
You wanted to talk
to the headmaster today.

269
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,655
Am I right?

270
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,045
You are.

271
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:47,875
I wanted Kenya to be a
doctor like my late husband.

272
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,255
I wanted him to quit baseball.

273
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:55,125
I was going to ask the
headmaster to take the team

274
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,135
out of the tournament.

275
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:01,385
Unaware that he
was going to do so anyway...

276
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,755
Ironic, isn't it?

277
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,725
But he wasn't there, so you left.

278
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:10,775
That's when Eto-kun saw you.

279
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,735
The hidden culprit then cut the flag.

280
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:18,295
But then Kaji-kun
came in after he saw

281
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,045
you in the window.

282
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:24,215
The culprit accidentally
dropped the cutter,

283
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:27,075
which Kaji-kun picked up.

284
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,495
Certain that his
mother had cut the flag,

285
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,795
you two wound up
covering for each other.

286
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,835
So who is the real culprit?

287
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:42,715
One other person disappeared

288
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,965
when his mother headed for the school.

289
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,515
A left-handed person
less than 160 cm tall!

290
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,605
I'm referring to you...

291
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:01,945
No way!

292
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:03,445
You don't mean--

293
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,865
Yes. The championship flag was cut

294
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,375
by you, Principal!

295
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,495
You waited for your
chance to sneak in here

296
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,545
before the headmaster
was supposed to come.

297
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,125
You snuck off after
giving the impression

298
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,165
you were on the field,
then cut the flag,

299
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:24,625
made it look like someone
broke in from outside,

300
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,915
and returned to the field.

301
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,515
That was your plan.

302
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,395
Pure conjecture! You have no proof!

303
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:38,275
The key to this office
should be in your pocket.

304
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,875
You intended to lock
the door and return the key

305
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,415
to create your ruse,

306
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:49,005
but you couldn't with
everyone coming and going.

307
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:52,415
The key hasn't been returned yet,

308
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:55,835
which means it's only
natural to think the culprit

309
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,465
still has it!

310
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,425
Bad news!

311
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:05,385
We just got a call--
the headmaster is dead!

312
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:20,775
No... What have I done?!

313
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,295
The headmaster told me

314
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:29,715
to keep the team from
entering the tournament.

315
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:34,205
But it wasn't so easy
with the media watching!

316
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:39,715
People would condemn
us for dropping out

317
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,635
and ruining a great pitcher's career!

318
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,835
"What kind of school
would crush kids' dreams?!"

319
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:52,625
So to drop out and
protect the school's name, I--

320
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,585
I loved this school!

321
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:58,605
Much more than the headmaster!

322
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:02,295
You're both the same in the end--

323
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:06,025
you crushed kids' dreams
with your own two hands!

324
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:09,535
You're right. I was a fool!

325
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:12,785
Forgive me!

326
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:49,165
The tournament began
half a month later,

327
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:52,045
and Shuko Academy was in it too.

328
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:56,225
The tournament directors
saw their passion for baseball.

329
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:58,685
Strike!

330
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:05,105
Kaji's pitching brings
them closer and closer

331
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:08,715
to the new championship flag.

332
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,655
He's dead!

333
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:18,965
Who's behind this?!

334
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:23,545
I was watching the whole time!

335
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:26,245
Shinichi! Are you there?

336
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:32,375
Shinichi?

337
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,565
Are you back, Shinichi?

338
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,295
On the next Conan--

339
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:41,165
"The Karaoke Box Murder Case."

340
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:59,925
Next Conan's Hint:

341
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,405
Reindeer.
