1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.400
While I was coming home from school,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.700
Officer Yumi Miyamoto forced me to accompany her

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.200
as she tailed Shukichi Haneda Meijin,

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.900
who she suspected of infidelity.

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.600
However, Haneda Meijin was just meeting a few young shogi players

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.200
at an apartment for a shogi study session.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.600
It's unlocked.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.100
Mr. Genda?

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.500
Mr. Genda!

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.700
Mr. Hishinuma?

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Mr. Genda, are you okay? Mr. Genda!

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.400
After that, there was a third victim

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.900
in this case which the police determined

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.800
were a series of serial murders.

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
Inspector Yuminaga.

16
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.300
What is the situation?

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.500
We avoided a total loss,

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.800
but the occupant who was in the house was burnt to death.

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
No vital signs were detected in the body,

20
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.800
so it seemed like he died before the fire broke out.

21
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
Shortly before?

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.000
You mean he died after that shogi player

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400
was murdered at the Beika City apartment?

24
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.200
I heard from Megure

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
that a shogi board was found at the crime scene.

26
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.600
We actually found one here, too.

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.500
A shogi board with three legs missing.

28
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.100
Besides that, Taiko Meijin was kidnapped by the culprit.

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.100
You said Akai's brother seemed to have noticed something.

30
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.600
Why did you think that way?

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.600
When the Meijin moved around to take a look at the deceased,

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.000
he touched the kitchen counter.

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500
He held his hand as though he'd touched something.

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.700
What was on top of the kitchen counter?

35
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.300
Nothing significant.

36
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.100
Just two ice trays, a mixer, and a toaster, I think.

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.800
Sounds like there was a magic tool

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.800
where one of them could have used it to fabricate an alibi.

39
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800
Oh, right!

40
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800
It comes to visit after we've fallen asleep!

41
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.900
Fall in love with logical reasoning

42
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.200
and the joy of solving mysteries!

43
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.300
What is the final move that will dissolve their alibi?

44
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.000
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.900
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.100
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.100
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board (Checkmate)"

48
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.700
It's been a long time, kid.

49
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.800
Since the last time we met, you were wearing this face.

50
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.200
We didn't have a choice.

51
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.800
I doubt you had time to disguise yourself.

52
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.200
Ms. Yukiko was so eager to disguise me.

53
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.700
So, do you know where my brother is?

54
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.000
Most probably, he's being held captive in the culprit's home,

55
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.100
but it seemed that they moved recently.

56
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.100
I could only figure out their phone number.

57
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.000
They answered Officer Yumi's call this morning,

58
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.400
and I wanted to call and get their address from them,

59
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.000
but they are very cautious and won't pick up the phone.

60
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.200
Naturally, I've been calling the Meijin's phone as well,

61
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.500
but it's been turned off.

62
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.900
Most probably, he expected the culprit to capture him,

63
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.100
so he didn't bring along his phone that contains information

64
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.800
about his close friends.

65
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.100
As his brother,

66
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.000
I certainly hoped that he had considered

67
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.600
how not to get captured instead.

68
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.400
Who are you calling?

69
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.800
My brother's other phone.

70
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.800
It is exclusively used for secret conversations.

71
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.400
Like a certain high school detective,

72
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.000
I don't officially exist.

73
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.500
An incoming call.

74
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.700
It must be my brother.

75
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.700
He picked up.

76
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.900
He did?

77
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.300
Hey.

78
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.900
You seem to be waiting for something.

79
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.000
You're a shogi player as well.

80
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.800
If you've got nothing better to do...

81
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.200
Would you like to play a game of blind shogi

82
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.900
with this Meijin?

83
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.400
4-5 P.

84
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
Same P.

85
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.900
5-5 S.

86
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.900
2-4 P.

87
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.700
6-4 P.

88
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.700
Same P.

89
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.800
5-6 G.

90
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.600
2-5 P.

91
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.100
You're good.

92
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.600
In that case, 6-4 S.

93
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.800
5-5 P.

94
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.200
They're playing blind shogi?

95
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.700
Yes.

96
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.600
My brother must be up to something.

97
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.800
He might be using the game record of that blind shogi game

98
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.900
to drop hints about the location where he's being held captive.

99
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.000
No, it's not necessary.

100
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.800
I got through his phone, so I can use this.

101
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.200
A GPS?

102
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.700
I'd better hurry to this location now.

103
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.400
Could you listen to my brother's blind shogi match

104
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.100
while explaining to me

105
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.900
how you identified the culprit?

106
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.400
The suspects are the following three individuals

107
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.000
who said they left the victim in the room to go shopping.

108
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.700
Kosuke Hishinuma, who went to a coffee shop

109
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.700
to pick up coffee for everyone.

110
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.500
Mina Katsumata, who bought freshly baked bread at a bakery.

111
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.200
And Shoko Uryu, who purchased freezing cold ice cream.

112
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.000
Even if they wanted to acquire

113
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.400
what they purchased earlier to fabricate an alibi...

114
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.600
But you could have just used instant coffee and water

115
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.600
from a water heater to make lukewarm coffee, right?

116
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.500
Actually, the water heater is broken right now.

117
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.300
It only dispenses cold water.

118
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.800
How about an electric kettle, then?

119
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.100
I broke that the other day, too.

120
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.300
What about that stove?

121
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.200
Couldn't you use that to boil water?

122
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.200
Well, yes, but...

123
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.900
But when we found Mr. Genda,

124
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.100
Mr. Hishinuma and Mina put the bags they were holding

125
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.200
on top of the stove.

126
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.700
Why don't you check the bottoms of the bags?

127
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.000
There's nothing unusual about them.

128
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.600
Then, it's clear that nobody used that stove.

129
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.000
We were out shopping for about ten minutes.

130
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.900
If someone used the stove to boil water,

131
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.600
it would have remained hot for about 15 minutes.

132
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.100
The bags should have burnt or melted.

133
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.700
I see.

134
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.200
Who bought these breads, then?

135
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.900
I bought them.

136
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.100
That bakery's breads are my favourite.

137
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.400
It's just nearby, and I always bought some.

138
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.900
But you could buy the breads beforehand, couldn't you?

139
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.600
I bought hot freshly baked bread.

140
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.900
They really were warm and looked so good.

141
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.400
It's too bad they didn't have any freshly fried curry bread, though.

142
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.800
It's their most popular item, so it was sold out.

143
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.400
Well, it doesn't look like there's a microwave here.

144
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.300
It would be impossible to reheat bread.

145
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.200
Ms. Uryu, what did you buy?

146
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
Right.

147
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.800
I bought ice cream.

148
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.600
It's from a shop that recently started its operations nearby.

149
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.300
Everyone said they loved them after I bought some once.

150
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.400
But if you hid the ice cream in the freezer...

151
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.000
Before we went shopping,

152
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.200
we checked to see if we needed to replenish anything.

153
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.900
There wasn't any ice cream then.

154
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.100
Our hint is the objects on the kitchen counter

155
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.500
that caught Haneda Meijin's attention.

156
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.700
Two ice trays, a mixer, and a toaster.

157
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.000
There could be a magic tool

158
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.100
where one of them could have used it to fabricate an alibi.

159
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.600
It's the mixer.

160
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.300
The mixer?

161
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.000
If you put room temperature water in a mixer

162
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.100
and mix it for five minutes,

163
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.600
the kinetic energy from the friction

164
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.700
generated by the water molecules turns into thermal energy.

165
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.800
Its temperature rises three degrees to 42-43 degrees Celsius.

166
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.300
If you put instant coffee in the hot water,

167
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.100
you can make lukewarm coffee.

168
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.500
In other words, the culprit pretended to go shopping

169
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.300
and after that, he claimed to have forgotten something

170
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.800
and returned to the room.

171
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.600
He put water in the mixer, and while it was mixing,

172
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.500
he strangled the victim Genda to death with an electrical cord.

173
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.700
They placed the shogi board with two missing legs

174
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.400
which they had earlier hidden in the room two legs next to the body,

175
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.200
indicating that Genda was the second victim of the serial murders.

176
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.600
Then, they poured the lukewarm water that was heated using the mixer

177
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.000
into cups they had previously purchased from the coffee shop

178
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.900
and made coffee.

179
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.100
They put the cups of coffee inside the coffee shop bag

180
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.600
and went downstairs to the building entrance.

181
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.500
Then, they pretended that the victim wouldn't let them in

182
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.900
after they went to buy coffee.

183
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.200
Right.

184
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.500
Kosuke Hishinuma must be the culprit.

185
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.800
3-3 G.

186
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.900
5-4 B drop.

187
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.100
While the investigation was going on for Genda's death,

188
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.900
Kishimoto's house caught fire.

189
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.700
A shogi board with three legs missing was placed next to the body

190
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.100
to confuse the order in which the murders took place.

191
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.900
He killed Kishimoto before going to the second crime scene,

192
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.200
the Beika City apartment where the study sessions were held.

193
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.900
After killing him,

194
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.600
he left the body in a room

195
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.900
and set the air-conditioning unit to 37 degrees.

196
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.100
He made sure that the house would catch fire

197
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.300
automatically after Genda's murder was discovered,

198
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.500
so that a body with a relatively high rectal temperature

199
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.000
would be discovered in the wreckage of the fire.

200
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.400
Naturally, the body was burnt,

201
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.500
which broadens the estimated time of death,

202
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.900
but he could also use the number of legs on the shogi board

203
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.900
to convince us that it happened after the second murder.

204
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.600
I see.

205
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.900
In other words,

206
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.500
he left a shogi board with one leg missing next to Nishikido,

207
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.900
his first victim,

208
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.300
to lay the groundwork

209
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.800
indicating that it seemed like he killed Kishimoto,

210
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:04.500
his second victim, after Genda, his third victim.

211
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.400
Bingo.

212
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.800
I see it.

213
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.800
The GPS is leading us to that building right in front of us.

214
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.000
Yes.

215
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.700
But which unit is the Meijin being held captive?

216
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.300
Probably, the blind shogi that he's playing is telling us that.

217
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.500
That's how my brother honks his horn.

218
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.500
He must have come to rescue me.

219
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.900
What's wrong, Meijin?

220
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.600
Do you need some time to think?

221
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.500
8-3 B promote.

222
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.800
No way! That was a bad move!

223
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.500
My jewelled general

224
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.000
will be taken by your incense chariot now!

225
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.900
An 8-3 B promote

226
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.700
means an incense chariot will take his king?

227
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.100
8-3 B is the square eighth from the right

228
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.400
and third from the top,

229
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.000
which would be the eighth unit

230
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.900
from the right on the third floor below the roof.

231
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.400
And if his piece was promoted, that means it was flipped.

232
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.000
In other words, Taiko Meijin is in the room in that location

233
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.800
when the building is viewed from behind.

234
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.800
Mr. Akai.

235
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.300
Very impressive, kid.

236
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.000
I knew Haneda Meijin would never make a bad move like this.

237
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
You tricked me

238
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.100
so you could disclose this location to somebody.

239
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.100
If the police found the written confession

240
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.500
and you agreed not to tell anyone about me,

241
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.000
I planned to release you and go into hiding.

242
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.900
But it seems like I'll have to kill you now!

243
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.700
I knew it. He's being held in the living room.

244
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.900
In English, the incense chariot is called the lance, or L for short.

245
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.200
"Living room" starts with an L, too.

246
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.400
But how can we rescue him?

247
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.500
Kid.

248
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.800
Do you see that clothesline pipe on that apartment's balcony?

249
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.400
Yes. What about it?

250
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.200
Can you use your ball to change its angle?

251
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.600
It isn't impossible.

252
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.400
Then, just go along with the plan that I will be telling you.

253
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.700
Seriously. What are the police doing?

254
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.500
It's none of my business,

255
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.800
but you should turn yourself in soon.

256
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.000
It's still not too late.

257
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.900
Zip it!

258
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.700
Mr. Akai, I set my voice changer to loudspeaker mode.

259
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.400
Give the signal in 30 seconds.

260
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.000
Got you.

261
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.900
What just happened?

262
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.700
Where did this ball come from?

263
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.200
This is the MPD!

264
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.200
We're the Special Assault Team!

265
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.600
Kosuke Hishinuma, we're watching your every move!

266
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.400
Discard your weapon and give yourself up!

267
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.900
Shut up!

268
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.500
Stay away from me!

269
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.400
Or don't you care what happens to the Meijin?

270
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.900
I'd expected him to do that.

271
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.900
In that case...

272
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.000
That was a warning shot!

273
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.300
A detached force is on its way to your location.

274
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.600
Remain there quietly until they arrive.

275
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.500
Somehow, I made it in time to tranquilise him.

276
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.300
Thanks for saving me, Conan.

277
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.000
It wasn't me. It was all Mr. Akai's effort.

278
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.800
I suppose so.

279
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.100
Anyway...

280
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.600
Why did the culprit Mr. Hishinuma stay here

281
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.600
instead of going on the run?

282
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.300
He was waiting for the police to find the written confession.

283
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.900
A written confession?

284
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.200
Yes.

285
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:08.300
A letter confessing that those four shogi players were cheating.

286
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.800
Those four shogi players?

287
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.000
Kimiharu Nishikido,

288
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.700
Yasukiyo Genda,

289
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.600
Yuhei Kishimoto,

290
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.400
and Kinji Uryu were using pens

291
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.900
that were equipped with miniature cameras

292
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.600
in their pockets.

293
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.700
They sent videos of their matches to their accomplices' phones,

294
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.500
who searched the web for expert moves.

295
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500
They won many games

296
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.900
by casually informing each other

297
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.500
about the moves when they passed each other

298
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.300
in the washroom or hallways.

299
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.800
Nishikido ranked up without getting caught,

300
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.400
but someone from the Shogi League warned Uryu

301
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.100
that he was using the washroom too frequently.

302
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.400
When he asked the others what he should do,

303
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.400
they apparently responded coldly.

304
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.200
They told him to follow the rule of silence and die.

305
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.500
The rule of silence?

306
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.200
The legs of shogi boards

307
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.400
are modelled after the gardenia (kuchinashi) fruit.

308
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400
It comes from the ban against speaking

309
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.900
during someone else's match (kuchi wo dasu).

310
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.900
They made their own agreement modelled after the gardenia.

311
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.400
If any of them were at risk of being exposed,

312
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.800
he would commit suicide to keep the group's secret

313
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.000
and protect the others.

314
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.200
Because of it, Uryu was forced to commit suicide.

315
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.500
Hishinuma found Uryu's suicide suspicious,

316
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.700
so he tracked down their cheating,

317
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.400
and made his first victim Nishikido confess.

318
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.400
To avenge his friend Uryu,

319
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.800
he killed the three of them

320
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.700
and left shogi boards with their missing gardenias

321
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.400
at the crime scenes.

322
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.800
Before we began our blind shogi game,

323
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.600
he told me to sit quietly and listen

324
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.300
so he could tell me why he did it.

325
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.000
Nishikido used their cheating to fix matches.

326
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.600
Hishinuma said he was a disgrace to shogi players.

327
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.800
Well, the confession was meant to frame Kishimoto,

328
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.200
who was discovered dead in the burnt wreckage.

329
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.300
It apparently said he killed the other two

330
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:25.600
and himself in order to atone for their cheating.

331
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.000
But why haven't the police found the confession?

332
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.900
It was because I got to it before them and took it.

333
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.000
What?

334
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.400
At that time, I knew Hishinuma

335
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.300
was responsible for the serial murders.

336
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.300
Hishinuma might have burnt down Kishimoto's house, too.

337
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.600
If that was the case,

338
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.900
I deducted that he would place a confession letter

339
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.500
in the apartment's mailbox

340
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.400
so it would seem like

341
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.400
Kishimoto came to the apartment to kill Genda

342
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.900
before setting fire to his own home and killing himself.

343
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.400
Come to think of it, Officer Yumi said the Meijin

344
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.900
went back inside while they were leaving the building.

345
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.100
That must be the time he took the confession.

346
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.600
Well, I'd expect no less from the great Taiko Meijin.

347
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.600
Oh, Camel?

348
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.000
I'd like you to take care of something

349
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.100
while the police are escorting the murderer to their car.

350
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.100
Yes.

351
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.800
One broken glass window and a bullet stuck in the wall.

352
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.200
Yes.

353
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.700
Yes, that's right.

354
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.100
Thanks for taking care of this, Camel.

355
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.800
Shuichi, I have a question about mum.

356
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.800
What about mum?

357
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.200
She refuses to meet my girlfriend.

358
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.400
She wouldn't even pick up her phone.

359
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.000
You haven't told her I'm alive, have you?

360
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.400
No.

361
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.700
Don't worry.

362
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.900
You'll eventually get to see mum.

363
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:41.700
Once their mist concealing the truth clears.

364
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.800
"Next Episode"

365
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.600
Can't you nod your head in agreement today?

366
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.700
I know.

367
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.200
But, Mr. Ishibashi,

368
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.600
you've been keeping something important from me.

369
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.200
Hurry up. They're right behind us.

370
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.400
Seriously.

371
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.000
We won't be able to escape at this rate.

372
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.400
Next Conan,

373
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.000
"Whiteout (Part 1)"

374
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.000
Next Conan's Hint:

375
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
"A snowy mountain"

376
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.200
Thanks for saving me!

377
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.000
-You'd better not do it again. -Do what?

378
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.700
Cheat on Officer Yumi.
