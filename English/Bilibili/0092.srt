1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.680
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.750
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.760
Today's case is a "traverse"!

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720
Look it up and
you'll find a zigzag hike!

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.050
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.720
His name?

8
00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:00.599
Bus Accident! Kindergartener
Killed! CEO Murdered!!

9
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.509
The CEO of a quick-loan
company was murdered,
Bus Accident! Kindergartener
Killed! CEO Murdered!!

10
00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.459
and one child perished when a
school bus was caught in the accident.
Bus Accident! Kindergartener
Killed! CEO Murdered!!

11
00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.429
The man who ordered
the murder has been arrested!

12
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.669
He appears to have had
a debt-related grudge.

13
00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.389
The murder was done by an unknown
pro hitman known as the "Fox."

14
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.349
Investigations have been futile,
and his whereabouts are unknown.

15
00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:27.429
"The Traverse of Terror
Murder Case (Part 1)."

16
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.309
I'm at the scene of the
kindergartener's death six months ago.

17
00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.779
The man responsible, the "Fox,"
is still at large, and the police--

18
00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.989
Dad. You have a client.

19
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.589
Client!

20
00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.469
Shut up... Don't yell...

21
00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.589
He's already here.

22
00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.629
Oof.

23
00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.129
Sorry for showing up so suddenly.

24
00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.679
Not at all...

25
00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.809
F-Find the hitman
and keep him from killing?!

26
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:08.849
I may not look it,

27
00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.839
but I'm president of a Kansai
real estate agency branch.

28
00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:14.219
Ushio Bunzo (40) Real Estate Branch President
but I'm president of a Kansai
real estate agency branch.

29
00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.809
When I underwent the company's
Ushio Bunzo (40) Real Estate Branch President

30
00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.099
health check five days ago,
Ushio Bunzo (40) Real Estate Branch President

31
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.989
they mistook a simple ulcer for stomach cancer!
Ushio Bunzo (40) Real Estate Branch President

32
00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.759
they mistook a simple ulcer for stomach cancer!

33
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.639
I overheard the doctor and nurse,

34
00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.369
so I was really shocked
when I heard it was cancer!

35
00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.839
So don't tell me you...
hired a hitman to kill you?

36
00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.799
Yes. The Fox.

37
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.509
Fox?!

38
00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:49.309
But I only realized the mistake
after I used my various work contacts

39
00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.019
to get in touch with him.

40
00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.719
My money transfer
had been deposited,

41
00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:00.969
and his always-changing internet
addresses had been closed out.

42
00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.639
Even if I could contact him,
it wouldn't be until a month later--

43
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.829
basically, I can't contact
him while he's out to kill me!

44
00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.349
I see. So that's why you
came to the great Mori Kogoro.

45
00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.259
But are you being serious?

46
00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.549
This isn't some
hidden camera thing, is it?

47
00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.929
What?! Are you
saying you can't trust me?!

48
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.139
No, I do!

49
00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.559
Look out!

50
00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.979
Bullets! Stay down!

51
00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.759
That damn Fox...

52
00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.869
Damn! He got away!

53
00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.869
It looks safe now.

54
00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.339
Oh, man...

55
00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.909
Oh! What a big wallet! What's this?

56
00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:01.719
It's nothing!

57
00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.639
What was that?

58
00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.809
Damn. We gotta call the police.

59
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:10.849
No!

60
00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.429
I hired a killer to kill me!

61
00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:17.679
They wouldn't think too fondly of that!

62
00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:19.819
No police!

63
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.739
Please! I beg you!
I'll even pay for your windows!

64
00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.449
Yeah, okay. I'll take the case.

65
00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.659
Really, detective?!

66
00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.349
Allow the great Mori Kogoro
to catch the deadly Fox

67
00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.969
that's given the
police so much trouble!

68
00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.129
Great!

69
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.719
Whoa, are you sure about this?

70
00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.219
But how are you gonna catch the Fox?

71
00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.089
You don't know what he's like, right?

72
00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:47.639
Don't worry about that!

73
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.559
The truth is, I included
a condition with it!

74
00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:56.019
I asked him to kill me while I'm
on one of my beloved traverse trips!

75
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.559
Traverse?

76
00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.729
You mean like a trek
up a mountain ridge?

77
00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.259
If it's to be during a traverse,
then what was that attack just now?!

78
00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.219
It's dangerous by the window.
Let's talk over here.

79
00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.869
R-Right.

80
00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.569
There's definitely
something more to this guy...

81
00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:18.809
Tanbara Mountains

82
00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.679
The next day, we set out on a traverse
up the Tanbara Mountain ridge.
Tanbara Mountains

83
00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:25.789
The next day, we set out on a traverse
up the Tanbara Mountain ridge.

84
00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.179
This feels great!

85
00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:31.349
Take a picture, Conan-kun!

86
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.009
We're gonna run out of film before
we even go hiking, Ran-neechan.

87
00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.809
We'll be fine!
Here, let's get one together!

88
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:40.269
Hey, Dad! Take our picture!

89
00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.029
Ugh! We're not here for fun, you know!

90
00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:46.889
Here, Dad!

91
00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.239
You guys understand, right?!

92
00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.809
Of course! We're here to make
it look like you're an ordinary hiker!

93
00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:01.429
Which means we'll seem
suspicious if we don't take pictures!

94
00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:02.759
Oh, right.

95
00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:03.919
Oh, man...

96
00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.139
Shortly after, we filled out
the hiking forms at the office

97
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.759
at the base of the mountain.

98
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.809
They faxed the number of hikers
and their names to a mountain lodge

99
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:21.939
so they could prepare our meals
and such before we stayed the night.

100
00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.759
Let's see...
Here we go, the mountain lodge.

101
00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.719
We're staying the night here.

102
00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.889
It's a route for experts,
so you better be ready!

103
00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:32.309
You too, Ran-neechan!

104
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:34.429
Oh, what's with that tone?

105
00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:36.579
Hey there! Is this your first time?

106
00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:40.349
Hirai Kenichi (22) Toto Univ. Hiking Club
I'm Hirai. I'm in my college's hiking club.

107
00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.259
I come here every year.
Hirai Kenichi (22) Toto Univ. Hiking Club

108
00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:42.349
I come here every year.

109
00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:43.799
So you can count on me!

110
00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.509
Great! We appreciate the help!

111
00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:49.719
Hey, now. He could be
the Fox, you know!

112
00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:54.509
I'm Ran! Oh, and this
is my little brother, Conan!

113
00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:55.179
Oh, uhh...

114
00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:58.059
And this is my father!

115
00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:01.559
I'm from Tokyo. My name's Mori--

116
00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:02.679
Moriyama!

117
00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:06.559
I'm Ushio, from Kansai!
Good to know you!

118
00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:07.529
Nice to meet you!

119
00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:11.529
Well then, let's all go cheerily!

120
00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:15.449
I work for a real estate agency.
How about you?

121
00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:19.079
W-What does it matter?!
Takanashi Wataru (50) Company Exec

122
00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:27.209
Given these clouds,
the weather might change.

123
00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:31.049
I'll give the mountain lodge a call.

124
00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:34.559
Does he have a thing for you?!

125
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.559
The Fox is apparently left-handed.

126
00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.559
He's thrown all his
knives with his left hand.

127
00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:45.309
Take a look at that man there.

128
00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:47.529
He's left-handed!

129
00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:48.279
So he is!

130
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:52.989
Oh, Gramps? This is Hirai.
I'll be staying again tonight!

131
00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:58.789
Umm, Moriyama-san, was it?
Have we met somewhere before?

132
00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:02.749
I'm Nose Shingo. I write novels.
Nose Shingo (35) Novelist

133
00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:08.709
Oh, the Nose Shingo-san who wrote
The Beautiful Amnesiac Case?!

134
00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:13.059
Oh, wow! I'm so happy to
meet one of my very few readers!

135
00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:15.059
You read it too, didn't you,
Conan-kun?

136
00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:15.929
Y-Yeah.

137
00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:20.429
It was about a killer with amnesia,
if I'm not mistaken.

138
00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:22.639
I recall the trick being pretty lame...

139
00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:25.019
We haven't missed
the check-in time, have we?!

140
00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:27.079
Please add us to the list, too!

141
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:30.939
Looks like it's gonna
be a pretty big group...

142
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:33.389
Saegusa Kyoko (25) Hiker
We don't know the way,

143
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:35.359
so I hope you don't mind us coming along.
Saegusa Kyoko (25) Hiker

144
00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.699
No, not at all!

145
00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:41.969
Come to think of it, we don't
know the Fox's gender for sure.

146
00:09:41.969 --> 00:09:43.659
It could be a woman!

147
00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:48.629
Sorry to keep you waiting!
I'm Kawabe! It's nice to meet you!

148
00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:52.429
And so the traverse began.

149
00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:57.599
Assuming the Fox is going to
strike in this limited time and space,

150
00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:01.559
he's either waiting in the mountains
for his chance, like a guerilla,

151
00:10:02.349 --> 00:10:04.639
or he's one of the hikers.

152
00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:11.609
In short, there's a good chance one
of the other five people is the Fox!

153
00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:14.529
Be careful, it's slippery here!

154
00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:16.739
There you go.

155
00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:19.489
Please hold onto the rope.

156
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.989
Watch out!

157
00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:29.629
Are you all right, Ushio-san?!

158
00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:33.139
How dare you...

159
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:35.179
W-What are you doing?!

160
00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.259
You did that on purpose!

161
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:40.849
No! This snapped on its own! See!

162
00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:43.599
It was all old and worn out.

163
00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:46.559
Don't scare me like that!

164
00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:49.759
T-That's my line!

165
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.859
When I consider the Fox
being one of the traverse members...

166
00:10:55.859 --> 00:10:57.449
...everyone seems a likely suspect!

167
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:05.309
Those two really seem suspicious.

168
00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:06.959
Him, too.

169
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:10.479
He's been glaring
like crazy this whole time.

170
00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:15.089
He looks like he has
something against Ushio-san.

171
00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:20.389
Plus he was way ahead before,
but now he's with us...

172
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:22.049
Hey, you two.

173
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.269
Whatcha talkin' about?
Are you people-watching?

174
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:27.229
N-No, we're just...

175
00:11:28.099 --> 00:11:30.389
Nothing happened after that,

176
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:35.239
as we approached the final rest
spot before our lodging for the night.

177
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:41.509
What?

178
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:43.829
Nothing... You just seem full of energy...

179
00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:47.159
Of course I am! I'm in shape
because of my karate training!

180
00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:50.059
Want to try out a leg technique?

181
00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:51.629
No, that's okay.

182
00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:55.339
Say, where's that college guy?

183
00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:58.259
Probably taking a rest somewhere.

184
00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:01.759
Or he ran off 'cause his cover got blown!

185
00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:04.139
Shh! Ushio-san!

186
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:07.219
They said the cover's been blown!

187
00:12:07.219 --> 00:12:08.769
Keep quiet! Let's go!

188
00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:16.059
There seems to be
something to those two...

189
00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:31.289
H-Help! Someone!

190
00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:33.709
Hurry! Someone!

191
00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:36.099
What's going on?!

192
00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:37.169
D-Down there!

193
00:12:37.969 --> 00:12:38.959
Down there...

194
00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:44.889
Hirai-san!

195
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.559
W-Why?!

196
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.130
Why? Why Hirai-san...

197
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.030
So it wasn't him?

198
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.460
You did this!

199
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.880
You threw him over, didn't you?!

200
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.970
L-Let go! Don't touch me!

201
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.990
Stop!

202
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.570
Shouldn't we hurry
down there and take a look?

203
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.810
Oh, right!

204
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.060
Poor guy...

205
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.740
He had to have died instantly...

206
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.430
Hey, you. Don't be wandering
around. It's dangerous.

207
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.040
A knife! There's a little blood on it!

208
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.960
What?! A knife?!
D-Don't tell me the Fox did this!

209
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.920
But he doesn't have any stab marks...

210
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.390
This mark!

211
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.350
Ah!

212
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.810
Look! This cut looks
like the knife grazed him!

213
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.600
And the fact that the knife is lying there...

214
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.810
...means he dodged
a knife the killer threw...

215
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:08.720
...but he lost his footing
and fell off the cliff...

216
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.200
So he intended to kill him?

217
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.070
You! Where've you been?!

218
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.300
I've been around.

219
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.410
The hell you have!

220
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.490
I went on ahead, but came
back when I heard screaming.

221
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.630
I mean, those guys seem
pretty fishy if you ask me...

222
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.550
What?! Them?!

223
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.410
Screw this! These people
are nothing but trouble!

224
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.510
Let's get going!

225
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.350
Hold it! We're all going
to wait at the mountain lodge!

226
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.310
I must ask you all to stay
with us until the police arrive.

227
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.280
Screw that! W-What gives
you the right to do that?!

228
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.740
Whoever leaves a murder scene
will seem all the more suspicious.

229
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.700
Damn!

230
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.660
Moriyama-san. You seem quite
accustomed to this. What's your job?

231
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.780
Oh, I, uh...

232
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.240
He's an office worker! Right, Dad?

233
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.130
Y-Yeah, that's right!

234
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.050
An office worker, huh?

235
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.570
He definitely doesn't look like it...

236
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.210
Rain!

237
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.770
Let's hurry!

238
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.980
Yes! It's getting dark!

239
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.200
Dry yourselves off. You'll filthy up the cabin.
Iwata Jukichi (60) Cabin Manager

240
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.460
Are you the manager
of this cabin, old man?

241
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.420
Yes. Come inside, already!
You'll catch cold!

242
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.380
Whew...

243
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.240
I'm exhausted...

244
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.490
Dad. Aren't you going to call?

245
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.070
Oh, right.

246
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.650
I'm gonna use the phone, mister.

247
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.860
What the-- I'm not
even getting a tone! Umm--

248
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.070
The lines probably got knocked
out during all that lightning earlier...

249
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.530
Happens all the time.

250
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.990
Now, what? It's raining, it's night...

251
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.460
It's dangerous to go down mountains
at night! I'd advise against it!

252
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:28.990
Not to mention this is the summit.
There are no other cabins nearby.

253
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.630
Meaning we're pretty
much completely isolated.

254
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.070
You can't be serious!

255
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:38.100
What the hell?! I can't believe
we're trapped in here with a murderer!

256
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.060
Murderer?

257
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.270
One of our companions
was murdered in a fake accident.

258
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.230
A fake accident?

259
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.110
Tarnishing these mountains
like that... how shameful!

260
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.160
Anyway, the killer
could be in this very room.

261
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.870
Who knows?
Maybe it was you, Ushio-san.

262
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.750
S-Say what?!

263
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:12.210
It's common sense in mysteries that
the killer is the least likely person.

264
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.430
Rubbish! I'm starving! Food!

265
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.350
Curry
Rice

266
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.810
This... is dinner?

267
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.770
What do you want?
We're in the mountains.

268
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.730
H-Huh?

269
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.410
What's wrong?

270
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.160
Oh, nothing.

271
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.320
What is this feeling of strangeness?

272
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.620
Something's not right!

273
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.580
What could it be?!

274
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.460
What do you think's
wrong with Takanashi-san?

275
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.380
He knows what he's done.

276
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.180
You really did...

277
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.570
N-No!

278
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.900
D-Don't kill us!

279
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.860
What nonsense! Everyone
carries hunting knives when hiking!

280
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.070
T-That's true, but...

281
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.030
I remember now! Moriyama-san!

282
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.950
You're Mori Kogoro-san,
the great detective, aren't you?!

283
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.910
D-Detective?!

284
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.370
D-Don't tell me...

285
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.380
What's with the false name?
Are you on some sorta case?

286
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.340
Personal reasons? Or...
could it have to do with this murder?

287
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.510
Sheesh! How long is it going to rain?

288
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.190
What's the forecast got in store?

289
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.190
You can tell me in secret. C'mon.

290
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.320
Now for the next news item.

291
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.070
This morning, Tanaka Yoro, 60,
was fatally stabbed in Tanbara Village,

292
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.030
and the suspects may have
fled into the Tanbara Mountains.

293
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.120
Police and fire departments have
a 50-man team searching the area.

294
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.930
Oh, come on! I can't sleep like this!

295
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.030
Look out!

296
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.850
What the--?!

297
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.230
Dad?!

298
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.690
Someone just left!

299
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.150
What's going on?

300
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.490
Takanashi-san is gone!

301
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.540
I knew it was him!

302
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.700
Damn you! You can't get away from us!

303
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.360
Be careful! You're the one he's after!

304
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.900
Let's go!

305
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.340
Someone!

306
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.220
Takanashi-san!

307
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.210
What was that?

308
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:18.910
Help! Help me!

309
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.200
H-H-Help!

310
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.870
H-Help me!

311
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.790
Watch out, Conan!

312
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.950
It's the Fox!

313
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.410
Wait! Something's not right!

314
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.380
T-The ceiling's falling!

315
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.300
The walls are closing in!
I'm scared! I'm scared!

316
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.140
Help me!

317
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.100
H-Huh?

318
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.100
I think he might have claustrophobia.

319
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.280
Claustrophobia?

320
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.020
Meaning that's why
he rushed out of the cabin?

321
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.980
Yeah. And he came here to avoid the rain,
but then it happened again.

322
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.280
Which means he's...

323
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.450
...not the Fox...

324
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.380
Some land sharks
once held me captive.

325
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.240
I got them mad when
I refused to sell my land.

326
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.300
I've been afraid of
cramped places ever since...

327
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.770
So that's also why you
don't like the real estate guy!

328
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.730
Good call, kid.

329
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:40.700
But that means the
Fox is still on the loose!

330
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.030
Which one of the
other four is the hitman?!

331
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.710
That was Ran!

332
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.300
D-Don't tell me something's
happened to Ran?!

333
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.290
The Fox is in this room.
And he's the one behind these murders!

334
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.990
C-Come again?!

335
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.260
The hitman?!

336
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.550
The Fox?!

337
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:59.970
Yes! The peerless hitman, the Fox,
the one behind these incidents...

338
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.760
...is you, the novelist, Nose Shingo!

339
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.930
R-Really?!

340
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.460
Damn you!

341
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.560
W-What are you doing?!

342
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.360
On the next Conan: "The Traverse
of Terror Murder Case (Part 2)."
