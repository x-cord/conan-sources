1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,340
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,240
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,040
A mysterious elderly couple moves into a new house.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,940
A presence and sense of being watched that sprout concern.

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,740
Am I the target or is it Ai?

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,045
To Beikacho, right?

10
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,645
Okay.

11
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:27,045
Hey. Do you know that a new house was built near your house, Conan?

12
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:28,645
A new house?

13
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,345
No.

14
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:31,745
What kind of house is it?

15
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,145
Is it big?

16
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:36,945
No, it's small and very cute!

17
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,745
The house suits your taste, doesn't it, Ayumi?

18
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,945
Yep!

19
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:45,445
I thought that I'd like to live in a house like that after I get married.

20
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:46,445
-What? -What?

21
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,445
-Married? -Married?

22
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:57,345
Conan, would you like to go see it on our way home?

23
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,945
What?

24
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:00,945
Nothing.

25
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,945
Come on, Ayumi. Let's just all of us go!

26
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:06,445
Just leave that guy alone, okay?

27
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:09,345
What? Why are coming along, too?

28
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:11,045
The same to you, Mitsuhiko.

29
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:12,945
Conan! Quick!

30
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:14,845
Why are you asking Conan to come?

31
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,345
Right!

32
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:21,245
What's the matter?

33
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,345
Nothing.

34
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:25,345
I just felt like someone is watching me.

35
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,945
Maybe it's just my imagination.

36
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:43,045
"The Grenier House on Beikacho"

37
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,045
I see.

38
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,545
So it's this house.

39
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,145
Here you go. Mitsuhiko, open your mouth.

40
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:58,545
Genta, you finished eating already?

41
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:01,145
Hey, hey.

42
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,245
What are you all imagining?

43
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:05,545
It's really a small and cute house.

44
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,745
Don't you think so?

45
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:09,345
And Conan, do you like houses like this?

46
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,545
What?

47
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,545
-Me? -Yes, you.

48
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:13,745
Ayumi!

49
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:16,045
How come you're asking Conan?

50
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,045
He's out of the picture.

51
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:21,445
Because he may become my husband in the future.

52
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,345
So I'd like to know what kind of things he likes.

53
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,945
Hey, Ayumi!

54
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:31,545
Then you've got to see the inside of the house at all costs, too.

55
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:32,545
What?

56
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:38,045
So, will you show us inside?

57
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,745
You've got to be kidding.

58
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,845
Just because I didn't say anything about your ridiculous conversation.

59
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,945
Her parents are looking for a house right now, you know.

60
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:48,345
If she likes the house...

61
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,145
They may just buy the house.

62
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,645
Let me show you in!

63
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:01,745
There are two 6-mat western style rooms, a bathroom with a bath tub

64
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:05,545
with a changing room on the 1st floor.

65
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:08,145
Are the two western style rooms for children?

66
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:09,345
Yes.

67
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:12,145
It seems that the person who built this house had in mind

68
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,745
a couple in their 30's with two children, a total family of four.

69
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:20,745
On the 2nd floor is a 16-mat living room and a kitchen.

70
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:21,745
How spacious!

71
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,245
It's nice and sunny, too!

72
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:27,545
There is an 8-mat western style room towards the roadside.

73
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:29,145
There's a 3rd floor, too.

74
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:33,545
Yes, the selling point of this house is the Grenier.

75
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:36,345
This is interesting!

76
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,245
There's a window here, too!

77
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,545
You can see the sky!

78
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,145
You can watch the stars at night, too.

79
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,345
Detective agency?

80
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:01,845
It's in view from here.

81
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,645
How did you like it?

82
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:09,045
The Grenier and the 2nd floor living room were nice.

83
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:11,845
Both rooms on the 1st floor were kind of dark.

84
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:14,145
A larger yard would be better, too.

85
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:16,545
The stairs were a bit too steep, too.

86
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:21,445
But for a house built on a small lot, I think it's pretty well made.

87
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:25,245
And will you recommend this house to your parents?

88
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,345
What?

89
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,045
Well, of course...

90
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:31,945
Now that we have seen the inside,

91
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:32,945
let's go.

92
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:34,945
The layout was not all that great.

93
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:37,045
My house is a lot more comfy to live in!

94
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,745
What? That house was sold?

95
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:52,545
Yep, when I passed by yesterday with mother,

96
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,545
the "For Sale" sign was folded,

97
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:56,545
so I asked.

98
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,145
That's too bad,

99
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:01,045
since you seemed to like it, Ayumi.

100
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,845
But the inside wasn't all that great.

101
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,345
No need to be disappointed, Ayumi.

102
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,745
I'll build you a better house.

103
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,945
Why are you going to build a house for Ayumi, Genta?

104
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,045
I'm the one who's going to build her house!

105
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:19,145
I wonder if the buyer was a couple in their 30's with two children?

106
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:20,545
Well, I guess so.

107
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:22,145
Nope.

108
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:25,145
They were an elderly couple way into the 70's.

109
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,845
An elderly couple?

110
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:32,845
Strange. That house isn't made for elderly people to live in.

111
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:34,245
You're right.

112
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,445
It has three floors and the stairs are steep, too.

113
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:44,945
But everyone has their own reason, so I guess it's okay.

114
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:53,145
Hisashi Udo?

115
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,145
What a queer name.

116
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,545
You guys.

117
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,745
Since there's a name plate, it means...

118
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,845
They've already moved in.

119
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:03,745
What brings you guys here?

120
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:07,345
We figured you'd be concerned and come look.

121
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:11,645
Even if it's a trivial thing, if in doubt, check it out thoroughly.

122
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,745
That's the basics of a detective!

123
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,145
Hey, hey.

124
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:20,045
My, hello!

125
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,745
Hello...

126
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:24,945
Do all of you live in this neighbourhood?

127
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:28,545
We just moved in today.

128
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:30,345
If it's okay with you,

129
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:33,245
please come in and tell me all kind of things about this town.

130
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,145
Yes! Sure!

131
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,945
If it's about Beikacho, you can count on us!

132
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:41,345
I even know which shop sells the best eels over rice and its cheap, too!

133
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,545
Right.

134
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,045
There.

135
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:46,645
Here goes.

136
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,945
I'll be going, then.

137
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,445
Goodbye.

138
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:56,045
Goodbye...

139
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:03,345
So you're all detectives?

140
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:07,045
Yes! The Youth Detective Squad of Teitan Elementary...

141
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:09,645
Is known by everyone in Beikacho.

142
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:12,845
We're just as well-known as Kojima Liquor Store.

143
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,845
-Here you go. -What?

144
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,545
-Thank you. -Is that so?

145
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:22,145
I'm sorry. The furniture hasn't arrived yet.

146
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,245
Not at all.

147
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,545
Grandma.

148
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,445
Are you going to live here with the elderly man who went out a while ago?

149
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:28,545
That's right.

150
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:31,145
The stairs seem steep, but aren't you afraid?

151
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,245
Not at all.

152
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:37,445
I've always wanted to live in a house like this since I was young.

153
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:40,345
I think I know how you feel.

154
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:45,145
My grandma said she wanted to try living in a tower condo once, too!

155
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:49,045
Besides, this house is close to the house our only son lives in.

156
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,945
I see.

157
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:53,445
But please do be careful.

158
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:55,845
Thank you. It's so nice of you.

159
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,245
Thank you for everything.

160
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,645
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

161
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,345
Our doubts have been cleared.

162
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:07,145
That couple bought that house because their son lives nearby.

163
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:10,945
She also said she wanted to live in that type of house.

164
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,845
But something bothers me.

165
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,945
What does?

166
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,645
Well, I can't really say.

167
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,645
What? The day after tomorrow?

168
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,845
Yeah.

169
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,045
What is it?

170
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:28,245
What is it that's bugging me?

171
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:33,445
I've always wanted to live in a house like this since I was young.

172
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,945
Here goes.

173
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,145
Is it this?

174
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,245
Is this what's bothering me?

175
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,645
But any elderly man would do so.

176
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:42,945
More than that, back then...

177
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,445
Why was she wearing that look on her face?

178
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,345
Hey, hey. Conan, are you listening?

179
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,445
Like I was saying,

180
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:53,545
dad and I have to attend a memorial service tomorrow and will be late,

181
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:55,845
please watch the house.

182
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:58,145
Gosh, Conan.

183
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,845
I see. Sorry, sorry.

184
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:04,345
Hey, don't ponder when you're eating!

185
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,845
It hurts!

186
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,045
Dad!

187
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:11,867
Shoots.

188
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,967
A cab? Bummers.

189
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,667
Darn it!

190
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,867
Shinichi, what are you doing in a place like this?

191
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,967
Doc? All right!

192
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,467
Talk about good timing!

193
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,767
What?

194
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:42,867
Could you...

195
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,067
go after that cab up front?

196
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,367
Doc! Hurry!

197
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,367
Yeah. Okay.

198
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,567
Although it bothers you,

199
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:58,267
there's nothing unnatural about the activity of the old man.

200
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:03,067
Old people usually use their hands for support when standing up.

201
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,367
I thought so, too.

202
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,767
The old lady probably frowned

203
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,667
because she's been telling him time and again to get up smoothly.

204
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,067
She probably doesn't like her husband acting too old.

205
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:19,267
Although Genta always told me that I act like an old fart, too.

206
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,767
Old fart!

207
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,067
I'm sorry to have bothered you on your way shopping.

208
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,367
Go on ahead home.

209
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,767
Okay.

210
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:35,067
I understand you want to check things out until you're convinced,

211
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,867
but are you going to be okay alone?

212
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,067
Don't worry.

213
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,467
Shinichi.

214
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,767
I wonder what Ai would do at a time like this?

215
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,967
Yes!

216
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,667
For things like that...

217
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,267
I'll cooperate anytime if I can be of help.

218
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:38,767
Shoots!

219
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,367
That was so close!

220
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:45,667
I came home leaving things as is.

221
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,067
Who on earth is that Chinese man?

222
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,267
And who is that old man...

223
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,367
exactly?

224
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:59,167
Isn't that from the direction of the Grenier house?

225
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,167
Don't tell me that...

226
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,867
The skylight of the Grenier house.

227
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,567
A camera?

228
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,867
Moreover,

229
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,567
why is it facing towards the detective agency?

230
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,667
Are they taking pictures of Pops?

231
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,267
Or...

232
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,667
What's the matter?

233
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,667
Nothing.

234
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,967
I just felt like someone is watching me.

235
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,067
Am I the target?

236
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,067
If so...

237
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,467
Don't tell me they're the guys from Black Organization?

238
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,067
How about it, Haibara?

239
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,567
Have you ever seen them in the organization?

240
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:54,767
I see.

241
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:58,767
But they could be in disguise.

242
00:15:58,767 --> 00:15:59,967
In disguise?

243
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:00,967
Yes.

244
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,267
Disguise?

245
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:57,567
Shinichi...

246
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,067
So it's you after all, mom.

247
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:10,167
Long time no see, Yukiko.

248
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,967
Dr. Agasa.

249
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,967
He got us, Yukiko.

250
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,967
This time, he got Doc to act on his side.

251
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,767
He paid us back for what we did some time ago.

252
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,067
But how did you find out?

253
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:28,367
Give me an explanation before you ask me questions.

254
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,967
What do you think you're doing, pulling off something like this?

255
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,167
We came back to Japan in the morning the day before yesterday

256
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,767
for Yusaku's next interview job.

257
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,467
To Beikacho, right?

258
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,767
Okay.

259
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:44,267
After we stopped over at the house,

260
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,167
I got worried about you

261
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,367
and went alone to check you at the elementary school.

262
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,767
You just happened to come out with your friend.

263
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,967
Conan! Quick!

264
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,767
Why are you asking Conan to come?

265
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,167
Right!

266
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,967
You're really sharp, Shinichi.

267
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,967
I thought you saw through me.

268
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:11,667
I was relieved to see that you are doing well,

269
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:15,067
but I was thinking that I wanted to see how you were living

270
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,467
after becoming Conan before leaving for the States

271
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,267
without letting you know.

272
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,767
You didn't have to start feeling that way.

273
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:27,267
But when I was walking, I was thinking about

274
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:31,667
the way I could watch you without being noticed.

275
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,767
I coincidentally found that house.

276
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,467
Though it was small, I liked the house

277
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,667
and I didn't intend to get it at first.

278
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,767
From the window of the Grenier,

279
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,367
the detective agency is in view!

280
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,667
That's when she came upon this striking thought.

281
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,967
We'll just rent the house for a week,

282
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:54,767
disguised as an elderly couple and watch your lifestyle secretly

283
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,667
from the window of the Grenier.

284
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:02,567
Yusaku thought that my idea was amusing, too.

285
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:08,467
So we went to the realtor to ask if it was okay.

286
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:11,767
It turns out the president happened to be a great fan of mine.

287
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,367
-Here you go. -Thank you.

288
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,667
He immediately agreed.

289
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:25,567
I was really surprised when all of you came the following day though.

290
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:32,367
Since I'm an actress, I had confidence that I could deceive you,

291
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,867
but as for Yusaku...

292
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:39,067
Yeah. That acting of yours was what got me thinking, dad.

293
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,967
Here goes.

294
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,767
But that's...

295
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah.

296
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,267
Like you said Doc,

297
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,467
it's only natural for elderly men

298
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,867
to use their hand to support themselves when getting up,

299
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,867
but that's only when nobody's watching.

300
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,467
In front of people, they try with all their might not to show it.

301
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,567
I feel that's the psyche of elderly people.

302
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,967
Yes, even in the world of acting,

303
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:04,367
when people act as elderly people, they are inclined to act that way.

304
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:08,067
That's why you frowned when he did so, right?

305
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,267
You saw?

306
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:13,067
Right. I thought, "Oh no, he did it."

307
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,867
It can't be help, can it?

308
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:18,567
After all, I'm a suspense novel writer and not an actor.

309
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,367
But your acting was pretty good too, dad.

310
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,367
You knew that Doc and I were tailing you, right?

311
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:27,167
Sort of.

312
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,267
The Chinese owner of the shop

313
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,367
used to be the head of a chivalrous group of robbers

314
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,667
that raided the great continent during his younger days.

315
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:37,067
I went to the shop to interview him about my upcoming "Night Baron" Series.

316
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:42,767
"Night Baron vs. Mysterious Chinese Man"

317
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:45,167
I asked him to scare you a bit.

318
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,267
I was really surprised when he threw the dagger at you.

319
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,567
Yusaku!

320
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:59,267
At any rate, don't you think that's going a bit too far?

321
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,867
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:06,467
But I was really worried about the kind of life you were living,

323
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,867
since we've been living away from you for a while.

324
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,567
If I were to see you in person and ask you,

325
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,267
you would naturally say that everything's okay, right?

326
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,967
I wanted to know...

327
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:17,267
I wanted to know the real genuine fact.

328
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:20,667
Mom.

329
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,467
Besides,

330
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,267
I wanted a lot of pictures of you...

331
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,267
as a child again!

332
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,167
You win, mom.

333
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:16,167
That elderly couple already moved, didn't they?

334
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,967
The house wasn't suited for elderly people after all.

335
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,567
But their name was sure interesting.

336
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,067
What was it?

337
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,967
Hisashi Udo.

338
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:30,867
Why didn't I realize something so simple?

339
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:35,267
All I had to do was interchange the characters of Udoku.

340
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,967
Oh, well.

341
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,567
"Next Episode"

342
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,267
I'm going to check out the famous sightseeing spots

343
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,667
and drink up the "all-you-can-drink"!

344
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,167
I wonder if something happened?

345
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,167
What?

346
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:08,767
Don't...

347
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,967
Don't tell me that this is...

348
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:16,367
Next Conan, "The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 1)"

349
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:20,035
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,535
"Sightseeing spot"

351
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:22,835
What does the sightseeing spot bring to mind?

352
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:24,235
-Seeing eye dog! -A seer!

353
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,339
-Kyoto. -What a wet blanket.
