1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,767
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,567
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,067
Today's subtitle is a kind of doodad!

4
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:07,867
You'll see why after watching the episode.

5
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:09,467
The dying message points to the killer!

6
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,867
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,567
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,367
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:56,777
Get out!

10
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:58,277
Ouch.

11
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,377
What do you think you're doing, Dad?

12
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,677
Cut out the violence.

13
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:05,177
Don't ever show your face before me again!

14
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:06,877
Please calm down, Mr. Umezu.

15
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,377
"Osamu Umezu (60)" -You wander here and there, and never visited,

16
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,177
but the minute I finish moving house,

17
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,477
you suddenly appear, saying "Give me money"?

18
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:18,977
I don't ever want to see your face again!

19
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,477
Dad, wait.

20
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:24,877
Your blood pressure will rise if you get mad.

21
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:25,977
Shut up!

22
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:27,477
Get out of here!

23
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:28,477
Excuse me.

24
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:30,677
Pops!

25
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,077
I'm sorry!

26
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:33,277
Mr. Mouri.

27
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:37,277
Mr. Umezu, this is Mr. Mouri who I was talking about.

28
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:38,777
Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:45,877
"Conan: A Strange Child"

30
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,377
I've heard about your high reputation.

31
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,077
Here's some tea.

32
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:52,577
Thank you.

33
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,077
Mr. Umezu,

34
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:57,377
I'm sorry to intrude at a busy time like this when you just moved in.

35
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,677
Takashi, we have a guest.

36
00:02:58,677 --> 00:02:59,877
"Takashi Umezu (25)" -Go on home.

37
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:03,177
I'm not finished talking to you.

38
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,677
Although it's an unlucky story...

39
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:09,277
Some people saw me take illegal drugs, and I'm being blackmailed.

40
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:12,277
They said that they're going to squeak to the police.

41
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,077
If that happens,

42
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:15,577
your name will be publicized by the mass media

43
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:18,277
and maybe you'll have to live an unlucky life too, Dad.

44
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:20,777
You're a nominee for some literary award, right?

45
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:23,877
If I get caught, won't it be minus image for you?

46
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,977
They say that they won't turn me in depending on how much I give them.

47
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:27,877
Lucky story, don't you think?

48
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:28,877
So...

49
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,377
You got to be kidding!

50
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,877
What happens to you is none of my business!

51
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,477
Get going home!

52
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:35,777
Excuse me,

53
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:39,777
but this thing about being blackmailed is quite disquieting.

54
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:42,377
Please don't take what he says seriously.

55
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:45,077
He's just making up stories to get money from me.

56
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,977
Sonny, do you want some gum?

57
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,777
Gum helps keep the brain active.

58
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,077
Thank you.

59
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,077
I'll take it.

60
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,077
"Touru Mikami (30)"

61
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,377
Who are they?

62
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:01,777
Detective Kogoro Mouri and Conan.

63
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:06,577
I have read "The road to the 13th Stairs" and was deeply impressed.

64
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:10,377
So I came to get your autograph to keep it as a family treasure.

65
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:13,777
Dad's book as a family treasure?

66
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:16,377
Maybe it's written by a ghostwriter?

67
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:22,177
Many senior's publish books are written by their disciples, right?

68
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,077
Takashi, watch your words.

69
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:29,077
You're the one doing the writing, aren't you, Ms. Araki?

70
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,577
"Chika Araki (27)" -What?

71
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:31,877
I thought so.

72
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:37,477
I don't need the money, Dad.

73
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,377
I'll write memoirs.

74
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:43,277
"Son Says Father's Best Sellers Are Written By Ghost Writer"

75
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:44,277
Takashi!

76
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:47,577
How despicable can you get?

77
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:50,677
Mr. Umezu, please calm down!

78
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:51,977
Excuse me...

79
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,377
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

80
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,077
Would you wait for us at the cafe outside?

81
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:57,077
All right.

82
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:08,577
You can never tell about people.

83
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:14,277
I thought he had money and fame, and no worries whatsoever.

84
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:19,477
I'm sorry for what happened, Mr. Mouri.

85
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,777
Mr. Umezu's autograph is in the book.

86
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:23,677
Thank you.

87
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:25,777
And where is he now?

88
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:27,977
He is dispirited.

89
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:29,377
A bit depressed.

90
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:30,877
He may look to be a dynamic character,

91
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:34,077
but he's quite concerned about how others view him.

92
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,077
Isn't that Ms. Araki?

93
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:38,177
Yes. She's going to the police

94
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,577
for an interview in place of Mr. Umezu.

95
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:44,577
It's not easy to be a writer, is it?

96
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,377
Mr. Mikami, what's the truth?

97
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:49,777
About what?

98
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:52,577
About Ms. Chika Araki being a ghostwriter.

99
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,077
Not you too, Mr. Mouri.

100
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,977
You believe Takashi's lie?

101
00:05:55,977 --> 00:06:00,177
No, it's not that.

102
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,477
It's baloney.

103
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:06,177
That button is unusual.

104
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,077
You mean this?

105
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,577
Mr. Umezu passed it out to all personnel involved

106
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,977
since his book made a big hit.

107
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:15,477
It's cloisonne work made in the image of a peony.

108
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:17,877
A peony button.

109
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,777
I guess I'll be on my way, then.

110
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,377
Already?

111
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:24,077
I have an appointment at a television station from now.

112
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,877
If you will excuse me.

113
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:31,377
Mr. Mikami sure is a busy man.

114
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,577
A novelist.

115
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,377
Not bad.

116
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,977
I'm going to become a popular novelist.

117
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:38,977
I've made up my mind.

118
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:45,277
I already bought manuscript papers and pens.

119
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:47,377
All you need now is talent.

120
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:48,377
Yeah.

121
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,377
What?

122
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,377
Huh?

123
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:54,877
Mr. Mikami?

124
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:57,377
Mr. Umezu is not answering the phone?

125
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,477
Yes, sir.

126
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,877
Since I was bothered about him being depressed, I called him.

127
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:01,877
But...

128
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:05,177
No, I'm sure I'm just taking my worries overboard.

129
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,577
I'll be able to handle this alone.

130
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,577
No. Let me go with you.

131
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:12,377
I haven't thanked Mr. Umezu either.

132
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:13,877
And I would also like to ask what things a novelist should...

133
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:17,377
Mr. Umezu!

134
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:18,877
Can you hear me, Mr. Umezu?

135
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,777
This way, this way! Hurry!

136
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:21,977
Let's see.

137
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:24,777
The spare key for room 503 is...

138
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:27,777
Mr. Umezu!

139
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:30,177
Mr. Umezu!

140
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,377
Mr. Umezu!

141
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,177
Mr. Mouri, please call an ambulance!

142
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,977
Please call the ambulance right away!

143
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:38,077
Hurry!

144
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,177
No, I'm sorry,

145
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:44,477
but there's no need for an ambulance.

146
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:52,677
This is probably some sort of nerve poisoning.

147
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,977
Mr. Mouri, something's written.

148
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,277
"My life as a writer has ended.

149
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:00,677
I feel total emptiness."

150
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:03,277
It seems to be a suicide note.

151
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,377
Mr. Umezu committed suicide?

152
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,877
Guess so.

153
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,677
He put this poison into his coffee.

154
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:10,877
There's a suicide note.

155
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,977
Moreover, the front entrance of this room,

156
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:15,777
was locked and closed.

157
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,777
Hey, the window is slightly open.

158
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:22,777
-Don't tell me someone entered from that window? -No.

159
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,077
At this height...

160
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,977
it's probably impossible to come in from the window.

161
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,577
By the way, what is he holding in his hand?

162
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:40,177
That is a sceptre that's held by a Shinto priest,

163
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:42,477
which was given to him by a fan as a lucky charm,

164
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:45,177
in hopes that his novel "The Road to the 13th Step"

165
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,777
would win the Literary Award.

166
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,377
The sceptre and the award? I don't understand.

167
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,077
It seems that this sceptre is made from an Ichii tree.

168
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,877
Ichii can be written as "first place".

169
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:00,177
I see.

170
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:03,077
He chose to die, but he wanted to win first place.

171
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,877
He died feeling mortified.

172
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:10,777
Pops, there's something on the corner of the wastebasket.

173
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:13,477
Blood?

174
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:21,377
He has a wound on the back of his head.

175
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,777
I wonder if he fell and bumped his head.

176
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:26,477
If so, the waste basket would've been toppled over, right?

177
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:28,977
He put it back once on his own and...

178
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:30,077
No.

179
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:33,977
A person who's determined to die wouldn't do things like that.

180
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:37,477
If he were to be pushed by somebody and fell...

181
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,877
Do you mean someone killed Mr. Umezu?

182
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:44,777
Mr. Mikami, what's this envelope?

183
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:46,677
Mr. Umezu's manuscript.

184
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:50,577
It's the Weekly Nichiyomi, with the essay, "My Secret" inside it.

185
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:54,877
There were three keys here just a while ago,

186
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:57,077
but there's only one now.

187
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:58,377
True.

188
00:09:58,377 --> 00:10:01,677
Maybe Ms. Araki and Takashi took it with them.

189
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:06,877
That means someone was here before the room was locked.

190
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:07,977
Mr. Mikami,

191
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:11,477
please contact Inspector Megure of the police department right away.

192
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:22,582
His woman disciple, Ms. Araki and his son, Takashi.

193
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,882
Both were pretty close to the victim,

194
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:29,482
so they could've been waiting for a chance to poison him.

195
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:33,482
Moreover, there is a possibility that they have the keys.

196
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:37,282
There isn't anything here that leads to clues regarding the killer.

197
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:40,182
I'm not sure if this is supposed to be meaningful.

198
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,982
"From a third person's point of view, they're all ridiculous doodads.

199
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:46,582
Everyone can see it, but no one can recognize it.

200
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:50,882
I always leave a certain doodad in my stories for me to enjoy."

201
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,382
That's it.

202
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:56,282
There's some kind of doodad in this book.

203
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:57,782
What kind of doodad is it?

204
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,282
Beats me. It's new to me.

205
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,482
Mr. Umezu.

206
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,482
Mr. Umezu!

207
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:06,382
Wait a minute!

208
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:09,082
Don't touch the corpse.

209
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:13,082
When you left here, did you take one of the spare keys?

210
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:14,682
Yes.

211
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:15,682
Here.

212
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:18,282
I'll be very straightforward with you.

213
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:22,882
Mr. Umezu's novel, "The Road to the 13th Step" is a big hit right now,

214
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,082
but I bet that you're not too happy about it?

215
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:27,782
Just what do you mean?

216
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:29,982
Please be honest with me.

217
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,782
You are the real writer of this book,

218
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,682
isn't it, Ms. Chika Araki?

219
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,982
No, I'm not.

220
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:39,182
I didn't write that book.

221
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:44,982
You were vexed because Mr. Umezu snatched your work away from you.

222
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:46,182
That isn't true!

223
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:49,882
Mr. Umezu wrote all his novels on his own.

224
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:52,182
Even if Ms. Araki were to be the culprit,

225
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:53,982
why was the window open?

226
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,282
This schedule is...

227
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,782
It looks like the scotch tape was peeled off once and stuck back on again.

228
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,082
What's this?

229
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:05,882
It's slightly puffed up?

230
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:09,182
Something like a string must have been pulled in through the window.

231
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:13,382
Ms. Araki, do you know what a dying message is?

232
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:14,782
Yes, I do.

233
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:22,082
His dying message is in the sceptre that Mr. Umezu is holding.

234
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:24,382
A dying message in the sceptre?

235
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:25,882
The sceptre seems to be made of material

236
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:28,382
that is taken from the Ichii tree.

237
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,482
While waiting for you, I decided to look it up in a dictionary.

238
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:36,082
An Ichii tree is also known as an Araragi tree.

239
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:37,582
Araragi?

240
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:41,182
Araki and Araragi. They're very similar.

241
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:43,782
Isn't that just a coincidence?

242
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:46,282
Why is he holding the sceptre upside down?

243
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,682
There's no meaning to that.

244
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:48,982
No meaning?

245
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:51,482
He probably grabbed at it out of desperation,

246
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,982
just as a drowning man would grasp at straw.

247
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,882
Dad died?

248
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:59,682
Talk about super lucky.

249
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:03,482
Royalty on the books and the estate are all mine.

250
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,582
Your father just died, and all you have to say is "lucky"?

251
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:08,582
Lucky?

252
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:12,282
This is the key to this room?

253
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:13,482
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:16,482
I took it a while ago when Dad wasn't watching.

255
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:19,982
I was thinking of stealing something valuable when Dad leaves the house,

256
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,182
but I guess I don't need it anymore.

257
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:24,482
May I do a body check?

258
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:25,682
Yeah, sure.

259
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:28,782
Today's my lucky day. I'll let you do anything you want to.

260
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:31,982
What's this?

261
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,682
A drug.

262
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:36,882
What?

263
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,982
I know nothing!

264
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,582
I didn't kill him!

265
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:41,482
I'm not the one who killed Dad!

266
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,482
Mr. Mikami, say something!

267
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,782
Wait!

268
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:50,282
I've figured it out.

269
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:52,082
Takashi Umezu,

270
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:56,482
Mr. Umezu's dying message was referring to you.

271
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:59,682
Wasn't the message supposed to be Chika Araki?

272
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,682
He made it seem that way,

273
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,482
but there was another message,

274
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:07,782
and I saw through it.

275
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:10,582
Another message in the sceptre?

276
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:11,682
Yes, sir.

277
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:14,582
About the Ichii tree that this sceptre is made of.

278
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:15,582
When written in Kanji characters,

279
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:18,182
the radical is "ki" and beside it is the character "raku".

280
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:23,582
Inspector, you noticed that the sceptre was upside down.

281
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:26,182
This was also part of his dying message.

282
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,682
Why was it upside down?

283
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,482
He did not want it to be "ki" and "raku",

284
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,982
but rather "raku" and "ki".

285
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:33,482
"Raku" and "Ki"?

286
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:36,682
"Raku" and "Ki",

287
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,782
as in lucky?

288
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:41,282
This man's favourite word, lucky.

289
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:42,582
I see!

290
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,282
Just what's that supposed to mean?

291
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,282
You got to be kidding!

292
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:46,882
I didn't do it! It's not me!

293
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:49,182
The sceptre is made out of Ichii.

294
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:50,782
Ichii.

295
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:51,982
Maybe...

296
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,082
I see!

297
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,182
I got it!

298
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,082
Somewhere around here...

299
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:10,882
I found it!

300
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,082
Let me go! I didn't do it!

301
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,782
I will have you come with me to the station, too.

302
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,282
I have some things to discuss with the publishers and media,

303
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:26,082
so if you will excuse me.

304
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,982
Conan, where did you go?

305
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,182
I'm hungry, so we're going home.

306
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:35,682
Huh?

307
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,482
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

308
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,282
Please wait, Inspector Megure.

309
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,582
Those two are not the killer.

310
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:46,382
Mouri.

311
00:15:46,382 --> 00:15:47,682
Then, who is?

312
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,582
The only others who have the key to this room

313
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,382
besides Mr. Umezu are these two.

314
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,482
It is possible to enter this room without a key.

315
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,582
Even Mr. Mikami can.

316
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,982
All he has to do is have Mr. Umezu open the window from inside.

317
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,682
Mr. Mikami.

318
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,682
I would like to ask you something.

319
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:06,682
Would you please tell me what you did

320
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:10,382
after you parted with me outside the coffee shop?

321
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:13,882
I called Mr. Umezu on the way to the TV station, but got no answer.

322
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:16,482
So I came here with you.

323
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:19,282
Isn't that the wrong order?

324
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:23,782
After you parted with me, you went to the roof of this condo

325
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,082
and suspended a string that was long enough to reach this room.

326
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:31,482
Then you had Mr. Umezu open the door for you and went inside.

327
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:35,882
While his attention was diverted, you poisoned his coffee.

328
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:44,082
You typed the dying message with the computer.

329
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:49,882
Then you pulled the string that was hanging from the roof into the room.

330
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:02,682
You went out and locked the door then head to the roof.

331
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:19,282
And just in case somebody sees through your trick,

332
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:23,182
you prepared a killer who is thought to have set up a suicide trick.

333
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,682
That person happened to be Takashi.

334
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:29,282
In other words, he prepared a guarantee to protect himself.

335
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,582
The poison that came out of Takashi's pocket was probably put inside

336
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:35,982
when he was arguing with Mr. Umezu.

337
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:37,382
Mr. Mouri,

338
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,182
that's enough!

339
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:40,882
Everything you're saying is based on assumption.

340
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,982
You have no proof whatsoever.

341
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:44,282
That's true.

342
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:48,382
But Mr. Umezu left a dying message behind.

343
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,482
Dying message again?

344
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,882
It's the third time.

345
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:55,682
Mr. Umezu was holding the sceptre upside down.

346
00:17:55,682 --> 00:18:00,682
He was hoping that I would figure it out.

347
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:04,582
Do you remember Mr. Umezu's sentences in his essay?

348
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:08,882
"From a third person's point of view, they're all ridiculous doodads.

349
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:11,482
Everyone can see it, but no one can recognize it.

350
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:13,482
I always leave a certain doodad in my stories for me to enjoy."

351
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,382
Please look at the bookshelf.

352
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:17,782
The secret doodad is there.

353
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:19,782
"A Chicken, a Bird, and a Crocodile."

354
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,382
"A God? A Wolf?"

355
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:22,682
"Honey and Sin."

356
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:26,382
"My Mama's Selfishness Towards Me."

357
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:29,282
These are all like "shinbunshi",

358
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:32,382
words that are the same forwards and backwards,

359
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,682
also called palindromes.

360
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:36,182
Among his works are also titles such as

361
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,382
"Don't Cry, Papa Don't Cry" and "Oh No, I'm Doomed"

362
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:42,182
and many other palindrome titles come to mind.

363
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:46,282
In other words, sneaking phrases like these secretly into his works

364
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:49,282
was Mr. Umezu's secret enjoyment.

365
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:50,582
Mr. Mouri.

366
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:53,082
Could it be that you suspect me only because my name is Mikami

367
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:56,282
and can be read from the right or the left and sound the same?

368
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,282
Exactly.

369
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,682
Ridiculous.

370
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:02,982
That's why I had my eyes on you.

371
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:05,182
That's when I noticed.

372
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:10,982
The button that was there when I met you at the coffee shop wasn't there.

373
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,882
The button where the material overlay each other.

374
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:16,782
Did someone pull it off?

375
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,982
Please let me check.

376
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:26,882
After you parted with me, you came back here.

377
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:30,182
Using the method I explained a while ago, you killed Mr. Umezu.

378
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,082
You headed for the television station to create your alibi

379
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,382
and you realized that your button was missing.

380
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:42,682
If the button is found near Mr. Umezu's body,

381
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,182
everything you thought up till now will go down the drain.

382
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:48,082
Therefore, you rushed back.

383
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:51,082
That's where you happened to run into us.

384
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,582
You looked for the button in this room,

385
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,882
but you haven't found it yet.

386
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,882
Yet another thing is still not found, too.

387
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:01,682
It's gum.

388
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:06,382
Gum that Mr. Umezu always had in his mouth wasn't found.

389
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:07,682
Officer Takagi,

390
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:12,282
please check carefully the area that where Mr. Umezu's body was found.

391
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:15,282
I'm sure that the button and gum are still there.

392
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:20,782
I found it!

393
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:21,982
-Chiba! -Yes, sir!

394
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:30,982
Inspector.

395
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:35,782
Mr. Mikami, this is your button.

396
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,882
You will admit everything, right?

397
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:44,582
The novel that I wrote was published under Mr. Umezu's name.

398
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:47,182
He wouldn't even allow me to talk about the book in public,

399
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:50,482
since everyone would find out that it was in my style of writing.

400
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:54,182
Is that why you killed Dad?

401
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:58,182
You should've kept committing murder just within the books you wrote.

402
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:00,982
You took the wrong road, Mr. Mikami.

403
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:03,082
You're lucky, Takashi.

404
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:08,082
Your father's estate and all his fortune now belongs to you.

405
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:11,282
Takashi, the timing couldn't have been better.

406
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,882
Inspector Megure will be more than willing to hear you out

407
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:17,482
about the illegal drug that you're being blackmailed on.

408
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,482
Illegal drug?

409
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:20,782
No...

410
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,782
I'll hear you out all you want.

411
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,282
Officer Takagi, please take him to the station.

412
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:29,282
-Yes, sir! -No, just a second...

413
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:30,482
Please wait!

414
00:22:58,382 --> 00:22:59,882
How about it, Pops?

415
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,382
How's your novel coming along?

416
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:04,982
I have a bit of a problem.

417
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:07,982
I'm on a roll at the beginning, but when I get to the conclusion

418
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:10,082
where the case is to be solved,

419
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,082
I remember absolutely nothing.

420
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:13,882
Of course you don't.

421
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:16,782
Because all you did was sleep right through it.

422
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:18,682
It's strange, isn't it, Pops?

423
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:21,382
I wonder why I can't remember.

424
00:23:21,382 --> 00:23:23,182
By the way, Conan,

425
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,082
I just thought of something interesting.

426
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:27,382
Ready?

427
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:29,882
Weird Conan Weird. How do you like it?

428
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,682
Weird Conan Weird?

429
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:34,682
That's right! Weird Conan Weird.

430
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,582
Weird Conan Weird.

431
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,882
It's a palindrome.

432
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,482
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:45,882
"Next Episode"

434
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,982
Blood.

435
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:49,682
Yoriko wasn't hurt to the point where she was bleeding.

436
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:52,782
Which means that this is Kinue's blood?

437
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:54,082
What did you just say?

438
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,682
Musashi did?

439
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:58,382
Officer Takagi, I'll leave it to you.

440
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:01,382
Officer Sato, even if I have to risk my own life, I will.

441
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:05,182
It's probably no mistake that Musashi attacked Kinue.

442
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:07,582
What did you find this time?

443
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:08,582
Don't tell me that...

444
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:14,782
Next Conan, "Good Work, Coeur"

445
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,367
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:20,067
"Dog brushing teeth"

447
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,367
Weird Conan Weird?

448
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,713
Reading from left to right and vice versa.
