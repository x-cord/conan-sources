1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.980
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.510
Let's heal hearts dried by modern
society with Conan's logic!

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.090
Today's case is the world of acting!

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.430
Bloodlust behind the glitter!

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.350
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.520
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.220
His name?

8
00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.319
The Stage Actress Murder Case.

9
00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:48.659
Mori Detective Agency

10
00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.329
You're Dad's teacher?

11
00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.069
He wasn't too bright.

12
00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.319
He always needed my help,
even when he worked for the police.

13
00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.099
Are you Shiota Heihachiro-san?!

14
00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.989
Shiota Heihachiro
Legendary Detective

15
00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.559
I'm known as the Japanese Holmes.
Shiota Heihachiro
Legendary Detective

16
00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.979
Shiota Heihachiro?!

17
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.899
This geezer is that
legendary detective?!

18
00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.109
I hear he's done a lot lately,
so I came to observe.

19
00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.949
I'm so sorry! He's out
on a case right now!

20
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.989
Some famous acting
troupe was threatened...

21
00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.199
Threatened?!

22
00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.989
Lead the way, young lady!

23
00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:32.669
Okay...

24
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:38.129
This is great! I get to see
the famous detective in action!

25
00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.629
Beika Art Theater

26
00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.269
"Cancel the show or it will
become a terrible tragedy."

27
00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.319
Any ideas who sent it?

28
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.779
Of course not.

29
00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.189
Hey! Where's Shoko?!
When can we start rehearsal?!

30
00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.399
She's still not ready.

31
00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.319
Motoki Kazuo
Director
Dammit. Thinks she's so

32
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.859
great after some TV work.
Motoki Kazuo
Director

33
00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:07.819
Anyway, it's probably just a prank,
but everyone's scared,

34
00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.949
so look into it.

35
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.209
Just don't get in the way.

36
00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.779
Yeesh...

37
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.919
Ah, so this is it...

38
00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.279
What're you doing here?!

39
00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.949
Shiota Heihachiro-san
asked to come.

40
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.199
What?! That old man?!

41
00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.929
Where is he?!

42
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.389
He disappeared when we got here...

43
00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.319
Disappeared?!

44
00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.179
Make way!

45
00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.279
Hei-san! What are you doing here?!

46
00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.279
He touched my butt!

47
00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:50.199
Forgive me!
I'm not long for this world!

48
00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:52.329
Old crackpot...

49
00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:53.199
What happened, Shoko-san?
Is there a problem?!

50
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.869
Sasaki Hitomi
Manager
What happened, Shoko-san?
Is there a problem?!

51
00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.459
I'm sick of it all!

52
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.319
Oide Shoko
Leading Actress
And why's that pathetic director

53
00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.129
telling me how to act?!
Oide Shoko
Leading Actress

54
00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.009
And having my ex as
the leading man sucks!

55
00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.409
Move!

56
00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.389
Shoko-san!

57
00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.349
Thinks she's so big!
Nakayama Eiko
Actress

58
00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.109
What's the big idea of showing
up and obstructing my work?!

59
00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.779
That actress still needs practice.

60
00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.949
Rears are the essence of life.

61
00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.659
One touch will tell
you how a person lives.

62
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.329
What're you doing?!

63
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:36.419
Dad!

64
00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:40.209
So vivacious!

65
00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.159
Are you really a
legendary detective?

66
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.469
What are they doing there?

67
00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.109
That's called 'marking.'
It lets actors know where to stand.

68
00:04:55.109 --> 00:05:00.189
It's important to choose
specific spots for the lighting.

69
00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:02.819
Plays sure are complicated!

70
00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.609
What's your problem?!

71
00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:07.029
Quit complaining, amateur!

72
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.319
I'm not complaining! I'm asking!

73
00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.159
The lights almost fell
on Shoko last week!

74
00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.029
You saying I did it on purpose?!

75
00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.069
So this is what it's
like above the stage!

76
00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.239
Tateoka Jun'ichi
Props
So this is what it's
like above the stage!

77
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.049
Go ahead and check!
Tateoka Jun'ichi
Props

78
00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:26.069
Get real.

79
00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.489
Thanks, little boy!

80
00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:31.049
Is someone after Shoko-san?

81
00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.109
Maybe.

82
00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:36.159
You shouldn't be up here!
It's dangerous!

83
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.519
Is Oide Shoko-san
the culprit's target?

84
00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.449
I will never leave you,
even if I go to Hell.

85
00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.609
I'll follow you wherever you go!

86
00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:55.869
Surely, our love will become
a star in the heavens!

87
00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.329
How boring. They should do
some of the classics instead.

88
00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.009
So you'll die with me?
Uda Yuichi
Leading Man

89
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:17.769
I'm not afraid to,
if it's with you.

90
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.019
What lame acting!

91
00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.379
Marvelous, Shoko!
That was absolutely realistic!

92
00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.949
Yeah! You really outshone me!

93
00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.489
Hey, Shoko!

94
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:03.689
Shoko...

95
00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:05.309
What's wrong?

96
00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.739
Come on, Shoko! That's enough!

97
00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.819
She's dead!

98
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.409
Everyone stay where you are!

99
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:21.369
Darn it!
Right before my very eyes!

100
00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.609
Dark pink skin and strange spots...

101
00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:29.669
This is clearly--

102
00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.129
--a case of cyanide poisoning.

103
00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:35.389
Hei-san! What are you doing here?!

104
00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:38.029
I heard stories about you and Mori

105
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:40.559
so I came to see how
much you've improved.

106
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.269
Anyway, you're retired!
Please don't get in the way!

107
00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:48.819
Listen to the big man talk!

108
00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:55.239
Who saved your job when you let
that serial murderer get away?

109
00:07:55.239 --> 00:07:57.029
Um, well...

110
00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:02.699
There's also the time I solved
that locked-room murder for you.

111
00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:07.199
Don't worry, Inspector.
I know who did it.

112
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:11.759
I hope so. I'll never hear the
end of it if he beats me again.

113
00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:16.469
I suppose I'll just
sit here and watch...

114
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:22.109
The killer was the one who poisoned
the water! You, Uda-san!

115
00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:25.599
Ridiculous. I had
no reason to kill Shoko.

116
00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:30.109
Not true. You two
used to be an item.

117
00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:34.279
I bet she cheated on
you once she got popular!

118
00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:39.909
You two used to argue nearly
every day about her acting!

119
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:44.289
I just wanted the play to be good.

120
00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:45.749
Convenient way to put it!

121
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.789
Swallowing cyanide means
a near-instant death!

122
00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:55.199
She drank the water just fine
after swallowing the prop poison.

123
00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:58.889
There was no poison in that packet.

124
00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:03.159
Watch. I'll prove
if there's poison or not.

125
00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.099
Wait! Don't!

126
00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:05.989
Ahh! What are you?

127
00:09:07.469 --> 00:09:08.349
See?

128
00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:11.309
Mori-kun!

129
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:14.729
How did they slip her the poison?

130
00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:18.529
The rehearsal went
for forty minutes straight.

131
00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:23.319
A capsule before the rehearsal
would've dissolved in fifteen minutes.

132
00:09:23.319 --> 00:09:27.609
Plus they're not airtight,
so they're not suitable for cyanide.

133
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.959
In which case...

134
00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.579
Thinks she's so big!

135
00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:34.959
She brought the water
and glasses out.

136
00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:38.429
She's not here!

137
00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:42.929
What are you doing?
You haven't improved one bit!

138
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.949
You know who did it?!

139
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:48.829
It's elementary. The woman did it.

140
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:49.389
The woman?!

141
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:53.859
She was the one who carried
the pitcher and glasses out.

142
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:58.949
That's it! She put
poison in the pitcher!

143
00:10:01.699 --> 00:10:03.649
What're you doing there?!

144
00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:07.779
Nothing! Just cleaning up!

145
00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:11.159
What are you trying to hide?!

146
00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.249
Stop!

147
00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:16.319
What did I do?!

148
00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:20.819
I said to stay where you were
until we're done investigating!

149
00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:22.159
This is--

150
00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:25.179
This writing pad was used
to write the threat letter!

151
00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:28.849
What?! Why, you!
Getting in the way again?!

152
00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:31.909
There's no way to
know that so easily!

153
00:10:31.909 --> 00:10:34.409
But there are pen imprints left!

154
00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:37.229
There are...

155
00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:44.409
The case is closed,
all thanks to him.

156
00:10:46.819 --> 00:10:49.949
How could you tell
she was suspicious?

157
00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:54.129
As the saying goes,
"There's a woman in every crime."

158
00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:56.589
You're kidding, right?

159
00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.659
Inspector.

160
00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:59.739
Well, Takagi-kun?

161
00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:02.049
There's no cyanide to be found...

162
00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:09.019
See! I'll admit to writing the letter,
but I didn't kill that woman!

163
00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:10.699
You sure?

164
00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:15.479
You were pretty pissed when
Shoko got the leading role.

165
00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:21.069
Of course I was! But you said
you wanted her to die, too!

166
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:25.029
I'll lose the most if this play flops!

167
00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:26.609
Calm down, now...

168
00:11:26.609 --> 00:11:27.569
Inspector.

169
00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:33.199
We found cyanide in the
water left in her glass.

170
00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:34.579
The pitcher was clean.

171
00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:37.109
So it was you!

172
00:11:37.109 --> 00:11:39.859
No it wasn't, you lousy detective!

173
00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:45.549
Didn't someone give
you the glasses backstage?

174
00:11:45.549 --> 00:11:47.429
Yeah! That's right!

175
00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.929
Tateoka-san got them ready for me!

176
00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:54.949
That's true, but I didn't poison anyone!

177
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:59.689
She did tell me to fire you...
What was that about?

178
00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:04.029
Manager Sasaki Hitomi-san.
Have you heard anything?

179
00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:08.989
Tateoka-san peeked as she
was changing clothes...

180
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.909
She must've resented it, so you-

181
00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:14.319
He didn't do it.

182
00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:15.319
How's that?

183
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.159
Because he's not a woman?

184
00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:20.669
You're a smart one.

185
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.049
Elementary? Yeah, right.

186
00:12:24.049 --> 00:12:26.409
Elementary?!

187
00:12:26.409 --> 00:12:30.099
Things wouldn't fit if
Tateoka-san was after Shoko-san!

188
00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:33.319
The two glasses were exactly the same.

189
00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:38.349
Which glass Shoko-san
got depended on Eiko-san.

190
00:12:38.819 --> 00:12:40.859
He couldn't accurately target her!

191
00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:44.029
Spill it already!

192
00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.909
It's the truth!
I didn't poison anything!

193
00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:51.829
I just thought I'd injure
her by rigging the curtain...

194
00:12:52.449 --> 00:12:54.489
Rigging the curtain?

195
00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:00.209
Dad!

196
00:13:02.989 --> 00:13:04.629
I'm staying here!

197
00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:09.089
Come, now.
What do you think I'm here for?

198
00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:12.659
A teacher assists his useless pupils.

199
00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:14.559
Take it easy and recuperate.

200
00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:17.409
I will solve this case.

201
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:22.739
Oh, no, you won't! You always--

202
00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:23.519
Ouch!

203
00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.759
Get him to the hospital!

204
00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:36.739
How did the killer slip
Shoko-san the cyanide?

205
00:13:36.739 --> 00:13:39.819
They didn't put it on the
glass, or in the water.

206
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:45.199
It was definitely added moments
before she drank the water.

207
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.419
That's the look, boy.

208
00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:51.339
You look much more detective-like
than Mori ever could!

209
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:56.949
Say, how do you think the
killer poisoned Shoko-san?

210
00:13:56.949 --> 00:14:01.349
Good question. The answer is,
"Only the gods know."

211
00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:05.779
It's nothing to make light of.

212
00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:08.029
Do you know of the novel,
"The Spider's Thread"?

213
00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:11.609
Yeah! The one Akutagawa
Ryunosuke wrote?

214
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:17.739
Yes. He says that Buddha knows
all things, good and bad.

215
00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:20.579
Have a look at that ugly scene.

216
00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:24.489
Tateoka! Were you tryin'
to ruin my play?!

217
00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.659
This is your fault
for using that broad!

218
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:28.799
You blaming me?!

219
00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:35.389
When fools fight, they don't
realize they expose their ugliness.

220
00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:40.659
Just like the fools
who cut the spider thread

221
00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:42.349
that Buddha extended to them.

222
00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:47.779
This is no time for spider
thread talk. We need to--

223
00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:49.069
Spider thread?!

224
00:14:52.989 --> 00:14:55.199
Why is that star pulled up?!

225
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:05.779
This is it!

226
00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:09.629
It's directly above the table!

227
00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.989
Torn fishing line...

228
00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:15.119
It was wrapped around
the star's cord!

229
00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:17.759
Spider thread? Now I get it!

230
00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:23.889
Using this method, anyone could've
put the cyanide in her glass!

231
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:34.271
Was it Tateoka-san's job to
give the water to Nakayama Eiko-san?

232
00:15:34.271 --> 00:15:36.941
No. Anybody around does it.

233
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:42.821
Aha, so it was this person!

234
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:46.271
Now what? The old man's gone
just when I need him.

235
00:15:46.271 --> 00:15:49.751
Oh yeah! I know someone
who's perfect for the role!

236
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:52.121
I'm counting on you,
Legendary Detective!

237
00:15:54.151 --> 00:15:56.801
Naptime already?

238
00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:06.231
Okay, Tateoka-san! You can
explain it all down at the station!

239
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:13.611
All the players are here,
so let us get this 'show on the road'...

240
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:18.731
...and reveal the leading
actor and director of this drama.

241
00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.441
You're saying someone else did it?!

242
00:16:21.941 --> 00:16:23.771
Indeed, I am.

243
00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:26.901
The killer was waiting
for a specific moment.

244
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:34.371
Yes. The climax, in which all eyes
were on the two main characters.

245
00:16:34.771 --> 00:16:38.591
But wouldn't everyone have
seen the killer add the poison?!

246
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:42.941
This situation was
a little different...

247
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:47.891
The spotlight only illuminated them;
the surroundings were dark.

248
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:51.901
The killer waited for
that moment of blindness.

249
00:16:53.231 --> 00:17:00.071
Dark as it was, nobody could've
approached the table unnoticed.

250
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:03.531
There was no reason to.

251
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:07.111
What's with your voice?

252
00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:09.231
Nothing.

253
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:15.271
When people concentrate on one spot,
they become careless of others.

254
00:17:15.271 --> 00:17:16.711
Especially of what's overhead.

255
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:20.381
Someone dripped
the cyanide from above?

256
00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:23.631
It's possible, but unlikely.

257
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:27.981
It would've made a sound if
it was dripped from above.

258
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:32.271
Plus nobody could accurately get
it into the cup from up there!

259
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:36.811
For a director,
you have no imagination.

260
00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:42.781
Do you know Akutagawa Ryunosuke's
story, "The Spider's Thread"?

261
00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:49.731
The one where Buddha tries to
save thieves in Hell by lowering a--

262
00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:50.741
A thread!

263
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:58.651
Yes. See the star higher up
than the others on the ceiling?

264
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.671
Wrapped around it is the
fishing line used in the murder.

265
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:09.651
At the end of it is a weight.
Check it and you should find cyanide.

266
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:15.431
The killer lowered the
poisoned weight past the star,

267
00:18:15.431 --> 00:18:18.731
put it inside the glass,
then pulled it back up.

268
00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:23.231
Unaware, she drank the water.

269
00:18:24.111 --> 00:18:29.061
So I'm in the clear,
since I wasn't up there then!

270
00:18:29.061 --> 00:18:30.071
No.

271
00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:34.581
One could pull this off
without being up above.

272
00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:36.541
But how?!

273
00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:41.271
Isn't the location of the
victim's glass predetermined?

274
00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:44.251
I believe it's called 'marking.'

275
00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:54.061
One could do this from backstage
by extending the line below.

276
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:58.441
However, the line caught on
the star's cord when pulled in.

277
00:18:58.941 --> 00:19:02.191
The raised star on the ceiling!

278
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:05.111
So who did it, then?!

279
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.951
We will find out by
examining their hands!

280
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:10.061
Hands?

281
00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:11.941
What's the deal, old man?

282
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:15.911
Bah. You gonna read our
palms to find the killer?

283
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:21.331
The guilty party will be
unable to show their hands!

284
00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:24.311
That's what this is?

285
00:19:24.311 --> 00:19:27.091
Alright! Everyone put their hands out!

286
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:30.221
Geez...

287
00:19:32.111 --> 00:19:36.221
Good. Now inspect their hands.

288
00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:50.741
Sasaki Hitomi-san. What's wrong?
Please show us your hands.

289
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:56.121
Those marks are--

290
00:19:56.731 --> 00:20:00.711
Yes. They're from forcefully
pulling the fishing line.

291
00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:02.711
She was probably nervous.

292
00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:10.611
After the incident,
Mori ordered everyone to stay put.

293
00:20:11.561 --> 00:20:16.471
The fishing line you used
should still be in your pocket.

294
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:18.941
Why would the manager do this?

295
00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:22.061
Is it because
I dumped you for Shoko?

296
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:23.341
No.

297
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:28.981
I accepted the fact
that you chose her over me.

298
00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:29.981
But then...

299
00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:32.451
I broke up with Uda.

300
00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:36.161
He's as dumb and boring as I thought.

301
00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:40.361
You can have him back.
Why not make up with him?

302
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:46.311
She never cared about the play.

303
00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:49.271
She just wanted
to steal you from me!

304
00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:54.431
Hitomi...

305
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:04.521
Great work, Hei-san!

306
00:21:04.941 --> 00:21:08.651
I heard the rumors,
but that 'Sleeping Kogoro logic'

307
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:12.491
could only have come from
Mori Kogoro-san's teacher!

308
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.411
It was Mori who copied me!

309
00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:23.031
And you're even as
shameless as he is!

310
00:22:48.961 --> 00:22:51.791
Pull yourself together.
Are you alright?

311
00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:53.861
Huh?

312
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:55.261
What?!

313
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:59.761
Shiota Heihachiro Detective Agency

314
00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:01.591
What's the meaning of this?!

315
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:04.861
Just how it looks.

316
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:11.601
You're still unreliable, so I'll watch
you for a while. Don't worry.

317
00:23:12.981 --> 00:23:13.941
Alright, you!

318
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:15.651
Honey!

319
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:20.441
You come to Tokyo to
sightsee but don't come back!

320
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.121
You cheated on me again, didn't you?!

321
00:23:22.771 --> 00:23:23.571
Cheating?!

322
00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:29.231
Please believe me!
You're the only one I love!

323
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:32.061
Yeah, sure! Now let's go!

324
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.021
Come on!

325
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:42.021
Guess he gets his women skills
from his teacher, too.

326
00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:48.441
My father hasn't revealed
the Night Baron's identity yet,

327
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:52.401
but whoever's using
his name is in here...

328
00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:54.611
My father's a detective!

329
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.821
Looks like Dad's famous!

330
00:24:01.361 --> 00:24:02.361
The Night Baron!

331
00:24:08.521 --> 00:24:09.811
On the next Conan--

332
00:24:09.811 --> 00:24:13.071
The Night Baron Murder Case (Part 1).

Next Conan's Hint:
Computer Virus.

335
00:24:16.308 --> 00:24:18.397
Computer Virus.
