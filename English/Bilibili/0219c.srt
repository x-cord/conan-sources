1
00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:05.924
"Twilight Inn"

2
00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:08.624
Let's see.

3
00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.624
Dad, open the back, please.

4
00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:51.524
The closer you get to it, the more it looks like a haunted house.

5
00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:54.524
Dad, I'm going to go on inside!

6
00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:57.424
The ladies room...

7
00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:04.024
Wow! Look at all those fantastic cars!

8
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:09.224
A Bentz, a Ferrari, a Porsche.

9
00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:11.924
It sure is full of dangerous cars.

10
00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:15.124
It's an Alfa Romeo!

11
00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:18.124
-Classy. -Hey!

12
00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:24.324
Don't you go touching my girl like that.

13
00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:28.724
This one's a shrewd that I finally tamed after 5 years.

14
00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:31.124
I don't want her to get upset over

15
00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.824
some strange man touching her.

16
00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:35.724
Right, flimsy mustache?

17
00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.024
Flimsy mustache?

18
00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:40.324
Hi there Mogi, it's been a while.

19
00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:42.324
You were invited over too?

20
00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:44.324
Hey! Granny Senma.

21
00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:46.924
Which means you were invited here too.

22
00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:48.824
Mogi?

23
00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.124
He's Detective Harufumi Mogi.

24
00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:54.224
Are you all right, though?

25
00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:56.324
I read in the papers that you were shot

26
00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.024
by a Mafia in Chicago last week.

27
00:01:59.024 --> 00:02:02.324
I've forgotten something so old.

28
00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:05.624
And? Have you come around to wanting to get married yet?

29
00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:08.024
You're going to be 40 in three days, aren't you?

30
00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:11.524
Heck... who knows about the future?

31
00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:13.224
Right now, all I want is

32
00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:17.924
something to ease my aching stomach.

33
00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:28.524
Welcome,

34
00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:32.224
Mr. Mogi. Mr. Mouri and Ms. Senma, I believe.

35
00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:33.824
We've been waiting for you.

36
00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:35.624
Please come in.

37
00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:43.024
Oh. Well, this is...

38
00:02:43.024 --> 00:02:45.224
A haunted house?

39
00:02:46.024 --> 00:02:48.724
Please put your umbrellas here.

40
00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:49.924
Oh, okay.

41
00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:52.124
-Hey, you! -Yes, sir!

42
00:02:52.124 --> 00:02:53.924
Please excuse me.

43
00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:59.424
I just went to the kitchen, but...

44
00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:00.924
If I remember correctly, he's...

45
00:03:00.924 --> 00:03:03.224
The gourmet detective...

46
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.024
Shukuzen Ogami.

47
00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:09.124
What? The cook suddenly fell ill and can't come?

48
00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:10.724
You've broken your promise.

49
00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:14.324
I've come all this way looking forward to the dinner!

50
00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:16.224
I'm so very sorry.

51
00:03:16.224 --> 00:03:18.324
I've bought all the ingredients necessary to make dinner, though.

52
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:19.624
Okay, forget it already!

53
00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:22.024
Lend me your kitchen! I'll make dinner!

54
00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:23.324
Gourmet food and murder

55
00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:25.924
are treasures I cherish that uplift

56
00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:28.624
and stimulate my brain cells!

57
00:03:28.624 --> 00:03:30.324
Darn it!

58
00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:35.624
I'm so sorry

59
00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:38.424
to have kept you waiting.

60
00:03:38.424 --> 00:03:41.724
Why did you summon four detectives up to a remote place

61
00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:44.424
in the mountains like this for?

62
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:49.124
Well, we actually invited six detectives all together.

63
00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:50.724
Hey,

64
00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:53.124
are you telling me that there are two more detectives?

65
00:03:53.124 --> 00:03:56.324
Yes, another woman and a young man.

66
00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:58.924
Young man? Don't tell me it's Shinichi?

67
00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:02.424
No way! I think it's Heiji.

68
00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:04.024
Right?

69
00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:10.524
No. Two other detectives were also included in the master's list,

70
00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:13.024
but Mr. Kudo could not be contacted

71
00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:15.024
and as for Mr. Hattori, we got a call from his mother

72
00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:16.824
saying that he can't make it

73
00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:19.324
because he's got an exam coming up.

74
00:04:19.324 --> 00:04:21.724
Because those two were cancelled,

75
00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.724
the master agree Mr. Mouri

76
00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:27.724
to bring two members of his family.

77
00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:33.124
Oh, and where is this detective lover weirdo?

78
00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:36.924
I have no idea, since I, myself has never met him yet.

79
00:04:36.924 --> 00:04:39.624
Huh? But, you got the list from him, didn't you?

80
00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:43.624
Yes. I did get this list when I came here for an interview

81
00:04:43.624 --> 00:04:45.224
to be hired as a maid.

82
00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:48.424
But, it was a very peculiar type of interview.

83
00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:49.724
Peculiar?

84
00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:52.424
Yes, since it was a high paying job,

85
00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:55.124
people wanting the position crowded over here.

86
00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:57.924
When I entered the interview room,

87
00:04:57.924 --> 00:05:00.224
all I saw there were a computer,

88
00:05:00.224 --> 00:05:02.224
an explanation of the dinner

89
00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:05.424
and a list of the invitees on the desk.

90
00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.024
Nobody was in the room.

91
00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:09.124
So, having no choice

92
00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:13.224
I started reading the papers as instructed on the PC.

93
00:05:13.224 --> 00:05:15.024
Suddenly, I heard a noise.

94
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:17.824
Then, I saw the sentence, "You are hired"

95
00:05:17.824 --> 00:05:19.824
on the screen of the computer.

96
00:05:21.124 --> 00:05:25.224
Then, you don't know why you were hired?

97
00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:28.524
-No. -But, you must've at least heard his voice?

98
00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:31.624
You did say that he gave you an okay, didn't you?

99
00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:33.724
Well, all the details

100
00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:37.824
were exchanged by mail using the cell phone.

101
00:05:40.124 --> 00:05:42.624
Wow. This sounds really interesting.

102
00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:45.624
The thrill is killing me.

103
00:05:45.624 --> 00:05:49.424
I was already electrified the minute I saw

104
00:05:49.424 --> 00:05:51.324
that strange pattern on that door!

105
00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:54.824
It sure does look strange.

106
00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:56.724
I wonder what it is a pattern of?

107
00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:58.424
Be careful, baby.

108
00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.424
If I'm not mistaken,

109
00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:01.124
that probably the remains of an old blood stain.

110
00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:02.924
What?

111
00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:04.224
Yuk.

112
00:06:05.224 --> 00:06:07.024
You're joking, aren't you?

113
00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:09.224
No, they're real blood stains.

114
00:06:11.224 --> 00:06:13.024
The remains of blood that had splattered

115
00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:16.924
at just about a 45-degree angle to the door.

116
00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:19.024
Not only the door. On the wall

117
00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:20.324
there are the remains of blood stains streaming downward.

118
00:06:20.324 --> 00:06:23.024
On the floor, there are droplet blood stains.

119
00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:24.924
Although they have been wiped away,

120
00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:26.724
there is blood stains soaked here and there

121
00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:29.124
everywhere in this house.

122
00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.824
It seems that these blood stains

123
00:06:32.824 --> 00:06:35.124
are not just those of one or two people.

124
00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:37.024
Just as expected of you.

125
00:06:41.124 --> 00:06:43.024
Luminol.

126
00:06:44.024 --> 00:06:45.924
When it is sprayed onto blood stains,

127
00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:49.224
it is oxidizes because of the active oxygen within the blood,

128
00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:53.424
and emits a bluish purple fluorescent color.

129
00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:58.924
You make good deductions, ex-coroner. Ms. Ikumi Souda.

130
00:06:58.924 --> 00:07:03.024
My, you're smart.

131
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:05.324
Boy.

132
00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:08.924
I am Saguru Hakuba. Nice to meet you all.

133
00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:10.924
Hakuba?

134
00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:13.224
You mean you're Police Superintendent, Habuba's...

135
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.324
Yes.

136
00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:18.324
Police Superintendent Hakuba is my father indeed,

137
00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:19.724
Mr. Mouri.

138
00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:26.324
An eagle?

139
00:07:27.924 --> 00:07:30.624
Oh, I'm sorry to have scared you.

140
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:34.624
Whether it was because Watson here was accompanying me in Britain,

141
00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:37.924
I'm not sure, but he has become very sensitive to the smell of blood.

142
00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.624
Watson?

143
00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:42.824
I'm sure glad I came all the way back home, though.

144
00:07:42.824 --> 00:07:44.924
After all, here I am standing at the scene

145
00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:48.524
of the tragedy that has been hidden for ages.

146
00:07:48.524 --> 00:07:52.324
One that I have only heard of as rumors.

147
00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:54.524
I'm here at last after a period of 40 years.

148
00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:56.724
This is more than I could ask for to awaken my intellectual excitement.

149
00:07:56.724 --> 00:07:58.724
Tragedy?

150
00:08:13.124 --> 00:08:15.024
No...

151
00:08:15.024 --> 00:08:16.924
You're pretty good.

152
00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:19.524
I've been playing awhile.

153
00:08:22.624 --> 00:08:27.024
How about this, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?

154
00:08:28.124 --> 00:08:29.424
All right!

155
00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:31.824
Look, look, I've got a straight!

156
00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:34.024
So, I win again!

157
00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:37.024
She sure is as strong as ever.

158
00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:38.824
Wait a minute.

159
00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:43.424
Now, let's not cheat, Ran.

160
00:08:43.424 --> 00:08:45.324
See, the Jack to your very left.

161
00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.124
You've got one on top of the other, don't you?

162
00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:50.424
Huh? Oh, you're right.

163
00:08:50.424 --> 00:08:53.124
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it.

164
00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:57.424
They seem to have been stuck together from the start, though.

165
00:09:02.424 --> 00:09:04.124
What's wrong, Ran?

166
00:09:04.124 --> 00:09:05.824
There's blood on the playing card.

167
00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:10.624
My, my, blood has splattered there too, I see.

168
00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:12.724
Come to think of it, the maid was saying,

169
00:09:12.724 --> 00:09:13.724
that the things here

170
00:09:13.724 --> 00:09:15.424
are just as they were at the time of the crime.

171
00:09:15.424 --> 00:09:18.224
That practically nothing had been moved.

172
00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.824
Which means that something happened in this room too...

173
00:09:23.224 --> 00:09:25.124
Thank you all for waiting.

174
00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:29.024
Dinner is ready, so please come to the dining room.

175
00:09:29.024 --> 00:09:31.124
The master is waiting for you.

176
00:09:31.124 --> 00:09:33.224
So, the big boss finally makes his appearance.

177
00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:34.824
I can't wait to see him.

178
00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:43.924
I somehow don't seem to have an appetite.

179
00:09:48.224 --> 00:09:50.324
Here we are.

180
00:09:56.624 --> 00:09:57.924
Please go on inside.

181
00:10:04.024 --> 00:10:07.524
Hey, hey, what's with that attire of yours?

182
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:09.524
I think you've been watching too much TV.

183
00:10:09.524 --> 00:10:13.024
To you all, the distinguished and famed 6 detectives!

184
00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:17.124
Welcome to the Twilight Inn.

185
00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:21.524
Well then, won't you all take your seats?

186
00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:31.924
Take the dishes out just like I instructed to you a while ago.

187
00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:33.524
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:37.324
Now, the reason why I invited you all over here is because...

189
00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:40.224
I want you to find the treasure

190
00:10:40.224 --> 00:10:43.424
that I have hidden somewhere in here.

191
00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:45.324
I want you to find the enormous amount of riches

192
00:10:45.324 --> 00:10:47.824
that I have accumulated over the years.

193
00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:50.424
And, risk your lives to do so.

194
00:10:50.424 --> 00:10:52.724
Risk our lives?

195
00:10:56.424 --> 00:10:58.224
What was that sound?

196
00:10:58.224 --> 00:10:59.824
No need to worry.

197
00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:02.424
I just made sure that you'd be stranded here.

198
00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:03.524
What?

199
00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:07.524
I am always being chased around by all of you.

200
00:11:07.524 --> 00:11:09.224
So, I thought I'd experience

201
00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:12.524
being the one to corner you for once.

202
00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.924
Besides, I also did away with the bridge

203
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.824
that you crossed to come here,

204
00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:18.224
so even if you had your cars,

205
00:11:18.224 --> 00:11:21.024
you wouldn't have been able to make it out of here anyway.

206
00:11:21.024 --> 00:11:23.824
Of course there is no telephone here

207
00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:25.924
and the cell phone is out of range of the waves.

208
00:11:25.924 --> 00:11:30.024
So it is impossible to get help from someone on the outside.

209
00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:32.924
Yes. Half of the treasure,

210
00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.424
as well as the solution as to how to get out of here

211
00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:38.824
will be given only to the one who finds the treasure.

212
00:11:38.824 --> 00:11:40.824
This is the game.

213
00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:43.124
How do you like the idea?

214
00:11:44.924 --> 00:11:47.924
I just don't take well to people like you

215
00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:51.524
who go around fleeing about hiding under a mask like that.

216
00:11:55.024 --> 00:11:58.224
Come now, you can't work on an empty stomach.

217
00:11:58.224 --> 00:12:00.424
Please enjoy the dinner to your heart's content.

218
00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:02.524
A speaker is attached to the neck of a mannequin?

219
00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:04.124
Darn it!

220
00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:05.524
Who...

221
00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.524
Who on earth could be doing this?

222
00:12:07.524 --> 00:12:09.824
My. A person as renown as you, Mr. Mouri

223
00:12:09.824 --> 00:12:12.424
had no idea why you were called here?

224
00:12:12.424 --> 00:12:15.624
It was written in black and white in the invitation letter.

225
00:12:15.624 --> 00:12:20.224
"The Phantom Of A God Forsaken Child."

226
00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:23.224
The phantom.

227
00:12:23.224 --> 00:12:24.624
That is something that appears unexpectedly

228
00:12:24.624 --> 00:12:26.324
and has no concrete body.

229
00:12:26.324 --> 00:12:28.424
The word "child" in the sentence

230
00:12:28.424 --> 00:12:30.224
refers to the child of a beast,

231
00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:32.224
because this character is used to write words

232
00:12:32.224 --> 00:12:33.724
like colt and puppy in Japanese.

233
00:12:33.724 --> 00:12:37.024
"The God forsaken beast" in the New Testament,

234
00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:40.524
refers to the goat that could not receive the blessings of God.

235
00:12:40.524 --> 00:12:44.124
Therefore, it refers to a baby goat.

236
00:12:44.124 --> 00:12:46.724
And, of course, a goat is a goat,

237
00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:50.124
but a baby goat in English is called...

238
00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:53.424
-a kid. -What?

239
00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:56.924
Maybe this will make it easier to understand.

240
00:12:56.924 --> 00:12:59.424
Kid the phantom thief.

241
00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:01.524
Hey, don't tell me that...

242
00:13:01.524 --> 00:13:03.124
Don't tell me that...

243
00:13:03.124 --> 00:13:06.024
Right. He never lets the prey that he is after escape.

244
00:13:06.024 --> 00:13:09.524
The way he carries out his feat is practically like magic.

245
00:13:09.524 --> 00:13:12.224
He is a genius criminal that confuses the police

246
00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:15.424
with faces and voices that are as limitless as the stars.

247
00:13:15.424 --> 00:13:21.124
He's the main dish that we, the detectives drool to savor.

248
00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:22.724
He's a stuck up villain

249
00:13:22.724 --> 00:13:24.624
that I would sure like to throw into jail.

250
00:13:24.624 --> 00:13:29.124
He is the only existence so far, that ever threw me off.

251
00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:32.924
People who have seen him in dark dressed in his white outfit

252
00:13:32.924 --> 00:13:35.424
call him...

253
00:13:35.424 --> 00:13:37.724
The Thief Kid!

254
00:13:45.314 --> 00:13:47.014
The Thief Kid.

255
00:13:48.314 --> 00:13:50.114
He's an honest guy.

256
00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:51.814
The minute his name was mentioned,

257
00:13:51.814 --> 00:13:54.714
he showed signs of his identity.

258
00:13:54.714 --> 00:13:58.714
I sensed your piercing, callous presence.

259
00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:03.014
No doubt about it, he is here, inside this house.

260
00:14:03.014 --> 00:14:06.214
I don't know what he's up to, but...

261
00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:08.514
I wonder if he can continue deceiving

262
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.914
the 7 detectives who are gathered here.

263
00:14:12.814 --> 00:14:14.914
Then, are you saying that

264
00:14:14.914 --> 00:14:18.614
the Thief Kid is the one who invited us here?

265
00:14:18.614 --> 00:14:21.414
Yeah, it seems that he gathered the six of us

266
00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:23.814
who have a reputation of being good detectives here

267
00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:26.614
to compete intelligence.

268
00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:29.114
By staking the treasure that he had stolen up to now,

269
00:14:29.114 --> 00:14:31.614
as well as our lives.

270
00:14:31.614 --> 00:14:36.314
He's probably watching us from somewhere this very minute.

271
00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:40.414
I found surveillance cameras all over this place.

272
00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:42.214
What?

273
00:14:51.714 --> 00:14:54.014
This is an appetizer.

274
00:14:54.014 --> 00:14:58.314
So, the last supper that he is referring to has finally come.

275
00:15:03.114 --> 00:15:04.314
Excuse me, maid?

276
00:15:04.314 --> 00:15:06.014
Oh, yes.

277
00:15:06.014 --> 00:15:08.014
Did by any chance the master instruct you on

278
00:15:08.014 --> 00:15:12.214
which order to place the dishes on the table?

279
00:15:12.214 --> 00:15:15.114
Yes. I was told to place the dishes on the table

280
00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:16.914
starting with Mr. Hakuba and continue on clockwise.

281
00:15:16.914 --> 00:15:18.314
Well...

282
00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:21.914
It just bothered me that he was calling this the last supper

283
00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:26.414
despite the game having just begun.

284
00:15:26.414 --> 00:15:28.314
There's no poison in the food,

285
00:15:28.314 --> 00:15:30.614
because I'm the one who made it.

286
00:15:30.614 --> 00:15:34.614
But, the forks, knives and spoons,

287
00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:36.914
the wine glasses and tea cups

288
00:15:36.914 --> 00:15:39.914
have been placed on the table beforehand.

289
00:15:39.914 --> 00:15:43.714
We all seated ourselves according to where we found our name plates.

290
00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:48.514
Well, I don't think he intends to commit murder,

291
00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:51.414
but he may set up an unlaughable joke

292
00:15:51.414 --> 00:15:54.314
to test our capabilities.

293
00:15:54.314 --> 00:15:56.914
It may be wiser to wipe your glass cup and fork

294
00:15:56.914 --> 00:16:00.214
with your own handkerchief before eating.

295
00:16:00.214 --> 00:16:01.814
No doubt about it.

296
00:16:01.814 --> 00:16:03.714
I don't like the idea that things are being carried out

297
00:16:03.714 --> 00:16:05.214
as he planned.

298
00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.414
Would you like to do a game of stone, paper, scissors

299
00:16:07.414 --> 00:16:08.614
and change seats then?

300
00:16:08.614 --> 00:16:13.014
But, what if someone ill-fatedly gets the poisoned seat?

301
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:18.214
That's that, take it as fate, and cry in the coffin.

302
00:16:18.214 --> 00:16:20.014
Oh, no.

303
00:16:25.014 --> 00:16:27.114
Boy, that sure was good.

304
00:16:27.114 --> 00:16:29.214
Just as expected of a gourmet detective!

305
00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:31.814
You've really got fantastic talent for cooking too, don't you?

306
00:16:31.814 --> 00:16:34.714
I went through a lot of training

307
00:16:34.714 --> 00:16:38.014
to satisfy this tongue of mine, so...

308
00:16:38.014 --> 00:16:40.414
It seems we took our imagination a bit too far.

309
00:16:40.414 --> 00:16:43.514
No. We can't be too sure yet.

310
00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:48.714
Well, how did you like the last supper that I prepared for you?

311
00:16:48.714 --> 00:16:51.414
So, here it comes.

312
00:16:51.414 --> 00:16:53.914
I guess it's time for me to talk.

313
00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:57.614
Let me explain why I chose this place which I dished out a lot for,

314
00:16:57.614 --> 00:17:00.214
as the stage for this game.

315
00:17:00.214 --> 00:17:02.714
First, take a good look

316
00:17:02.714 --> 00:17:06.914
at the many dishes that are in front of you.

317
00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:09.814
A bird.

318
00:17:09.814 --> 00:17:14.214
There is a mark of an eerie bird with a large beak.

319
00:17:14.214 --> 00:17:16.514
Isn't this a crow?

320
00:17:16.514 --> 00:17:18.814
Then, this is probably...

321
00:17:18.814 --> 00:17:20.914
Have you figured it out?

322
00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:24.014
That's the millionaire who died a mysterious death

323
00:17:24.014 --> 00:17:25.414
a half a century ago.

324
00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:30.314
It's the crest of Renya Karasuma.

325
00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:32.714
Renya Karasuma?

326
00:17:34.114 --> 00:17:35.814
Not only the dishes

327
00:17:35.814 --> 00:17:38.514
but also the doors, floors, railings,

328
00:17:38.514 --> 00:17:41.714
the men of chess and the playing cards in the living room

329
00:17:41.714 --> 00:17:45.514
were all specially ordered and made by his request.

330
00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:47.514
In other words, this is a villa,

331
00:17:47.514 --> 00:17:49.814
which had been built by Karasuma

332
00:17:49.814 --> 00:17:52.914
or, rather, it used to be a villa.

333
00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:57.514
40 years ago, a blood-chilling tragedy occurred here,

334
00:17:57.514 --> 00:18:01.714
on that stormy night.

335
00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.714
Being that you are all superb detectives,

336
00:18:03.714 --> 00:18:05.514
you may have already noticed

337
00:18:05.514 --> 00:18:07.814
the minute you set foot into this place,

338
00:18:07.814 --> 00:18:11.014
the remains of the enormous amount of blood

339
00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:13.814
that splattered and shed.

340
00:18:13.814 --> 00:18:18.114
Yes, it was on a certain night 40 years ago,

341
00:18:18.114 --> 00:18:22.314
when this place still retained its beauty.

342
00:18:22.314 --> 00:18:25.814
The prominent figures of the financial world were invited here,

343
00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.714
and a certain gathering was held.

344
00:18:28.714 --> 00:18:30.714
He passed away at the age of 99.

345
00:18:30.714 --> 00:18:34.914
It was entitled "Memorial for the late Renya Karasuma".

346
00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:36.614
But, in actuality,

347
00:18:36.614 --> 00:18:38.614
the gathering was an auction of the various artworks

348
00:18:38.614 --> 00:18:41.714
that Karasuma had collected during his life time.

349
00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:44.314
More than 300 items were auctioned.

350
00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:48.214
And, it was scheduled for a period of three days.

351
00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:52.514
On the 2nd night, that stormy night.

352
00:18:54.114 --> 00:18:59.114
Two men who were drenched with rain came to this place.

353
00:18:59.114 --> 00:19:04.314
The two men were freezing and with trembling lips, remarked

354
00:19:04.314 --> 00:19:07.014
that they had lost their way in the storm,

355
00:19:07.014 --> 00:19:11.114
and they would like to spend the night until the storm subsided.

356
00:19:11.114 --> 00:19:13.214
The host of the auction was hesitant about

357
00:19:13.214 --> 00:19:16.114
letting the two stay over at first, but...

358
00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.214
the man handed the host over a small parcel

359
00:19:18.214 --> 00:19:21.714
saying that it was in exchange for letting them stay over.

360
00:19:21.714 --> 00:19:22.714
The contents of the parcel

361
00:19:22.714 --> 00:19:23.814
seemed to be something like a cigarette,

362
00:19:23.814 --> 00:19:27.314
and the host smoked it just as he was told to.

363
00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:29.914
Then, he gradually got merrier and merrier,

364
00:19:29.914 --> 00:19:33.614
and let the two men inside.

365
00:19:33.614 --> 00:19:37.014
The other guests who were watching

366
00:19:37.014 --> 00:19:38.914
were urged by the two to smoke likewise,

367
00:19:38.914 --> 00:19:42.714
and the whole place was covered with smoke.

368
00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:45.914
Don't tell me that the parcel was...

369
00:19:45.914 --> 00:19:47.514
Marijuana.

370
00:19:48.214 --> 00:19:52.814
The guests had enjoyed a merry, boisterous time for a while,

371
00:19:52.814 --> 00:19:56.314
but after a while, things began to change.

372
00:19:56.814 --> 00:20:00.414
A man screamed as if he had seen the devil,

373
00:20:00.414 --> 00:20:04.214
carried the item that he had bid for and now owned, and ran.

374
00:20:04.214 --> 00:20:08.414
A woman started crying as if asking someone for forgiveness

375
00:20:08.414 --> 00:20:11.214
until her tears dried out.

376
00:20:11.214 --> 00:20:14.114
Yet another man, delightedly poked his arm time and again

377
00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:17.814
with the pen that he was holding.

378
00:20:17.814 --> 00:20:20.014
The guests finally

379
00:20:20.014 --> 00:20:22.114
began to snatch the works of art from each other,

380
00:20:22.114 --> 00:20:23.414
and using auctioned items,

381
00:20:23.414 --> 00:20:24.614
such as long swords and jeweled daggers,

382
00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:26.214
started killing each other.

383
00:20:26.214 --> 00:20:27.814
The auction grounds

384
00:20:27.814 --> 00:20:31.014
had transformed into a scene of massacre and hell.

385
00:20:31.014 --> 00:20:33.614
The day after the hideous and nightmarish night,

386
00:20:33.614 --> 00:20:36.814
the two men had disappeared with the art work and all,

387
00:20:36.814 --> 00:20:44.014
leaving 8 dead and as many as over 10 people in a comma behind.

388
00:20:45.514 --> 00:20:50.214
But, why is such a serious crime not known to the public?

389
00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:53.914
Probably because among them,

390
00:20:53.914 --> 00:20:56.114
there was a powerful figure of the financial world,

391
00:20:56.114 --> 00:20:58.414
or maybe a member of the family.

392
00:20:58.414 --> 00:21:00.014
I see.

393
00:21:00.014 --> 00:21:02.514
If conditions were that no one could tell who killed who,

394
00:21:02.514 --> 00:21:05.114
those involved may have come to the conclusion...

395
00:21:05.114 --> 00:21:07.814
That it would've been better

396
00:21:07.814 --> 00:21:11.814
to keep the case under cover, rather than solving it.

397
00:21:12.714 --> 00:21:14.314
It was probably within

398
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.814
the calculation of those men too, wasn't it?

399
00:21:16.814 --> 00:21:22.314
Well, this age old story sure does whet my appetite.

400
00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:25.814
So, now do you understand

401
00:21:25.814 --> 00:21:30.214
why I chose this place as the stage for the game?

402
00:21:30.214 --> 00:21:32.914
I would like all you detectives

403
00:21:32.914 --> 00:21:39.014
to re-enact the tragedy that occurred here 40 years ago.

404
00:21:39.814 --> 00:21:42.614
That ugly scene of people fighting over the treasure

405
00:21:42.614 --> 00:21:45.814
and killing each other.

406
00:21:45.814 --> 00:21:47.414
Really stupid.

407
00:21:47.414 --> 00:21:49.914
I figure it's too cruel to make you all

408
00:21:49.914 --> 00:21:51.914
just search blindly all through this building,

409
00:21:51.914 --> 00:21:55.614
so let me give you a hint.

410
00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:57.614
Hint?

411
00:21:57.614 --> 00:22:01.014
When the two travelers looked up at the sky,

412
00:22:01.014 --> 00:22:04.114
a devil descended near the palace.

413
00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:07.714
The king carries the treasure with him as he flees.

414
00:22:07.714 --> 00:22:10.014
The queen collects tears in the chalice

415
00:22:10.014 --> 00:22:12.614
and asks for forgiveness.

416
00:22:12.614 --> 00:22:19.414
The warrior falls dead by the sword stained with his own blood.

417
00:22:19.414 --> 00:22:21.614
That must be...

418
00:22:21.614 --> 00:22:24.114
Don't you think that these sentences are more than suited

419
00:22:24.114 --> 00:22:25.814
to describe the competition of intelligence,

420
00:22:25.814 --> 00:22:29.514
staking your lives that is about to be carried out here?

421
00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:30.914
Don't be ridiculous.

422
00:22:30.914 --> 00:22:32.714
To kill someone,

423
00:22:32.714 --> 00:22:34.714
you need to have someone who wants to kill you,

424
00:22:34.714 --> 00:22:37.114
as well as, the will to kill yourself.

425
00:22:37.114 --> 00:22:41.114
Of course, you do not have a choice and cannot have out of this game.

426
00:22:41.114 --> 00:22:42.914
Because you are all

427
00:22:42.914 --> 00:22:48.614
already under the magic spell that I have chanted.

428
00:22:51.914 --> 00:22:56.614
So when someone among you lets out a scream,

429
00:22:56.614 --> 00:22:58.914
that is the start of the game.

430
00:22:58.914 --> 00:23:02.114
Understand? The one who finds the treasure

431
00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:04.214
must enter the location of the treasure

432
00:23:04.214 --> 00:23:06.014
in the computer that is in the room

433
00:23:06.014 --> 00:23:08.614
on the fourth floor in the center tower.

434
00:23:08.614 --> 00:23:11.614
I will give you half the treasure as promised,

435
00:23:11.614 --> 00:23:15.914
as well as instructions on how to get out of here.

436
00:23:18.714 --> 00:23:20.214
Mr. Mogi.

437
00:23:21.814 --> 00:23:24.314
Mr. Mogi, are you all right?

438
00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:29.814
Just kidding.

439
00:23:30.914 --> 00:23:33.514
What a bad old man you are, really.

440
00:23:33.514 --> 00:23:34.914
Sorry, sorry.

441
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:37.214
In token of my apology, I'm out.

442
00:23:37.214 --> 00:23:39.114
I'm not at all interested in treasure hunting.

443
00:23:39.114 --> 00:23:41.914
But, how do you intend to get out of here?

444
00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:44.214
Don't worry.

445
00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:47.314
This is not some isolated island in the middle of the ocean.

446
00:23:47.314 --> 00:23:50.814
I'll get somewhere if I keep roaming the mountains.

447
00:23:50.814 --> 00:23:53.914
See you all then, detectives!

448
00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:12.414
Hey, mister, it won't work twice.

449
00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:22.314
22:34 and 51 seconds, verified breathing stopped.

450
00:24:22.314 --> 00:24:23.314
Judging from the circumstances here,

451
00:24:23.314 --> 00:24:25.414
I think it is impossible to try to resuscitate him.

452
00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:27.014
What?

453
00:24:27.014 --> 00:24:31.914
No sign of cyanosis, in which the lips turn purple is seen.

454
00:24:31.914 --> 00:24:35.414
And besides, this almond odor distinct of hydro cyanic acid gas.

455
00:24:35.414 --> 00:24:38.914
Which means cyanide was in the tea that he just drank...

456
00:24:38.914 --> 00:24:43.314
Nope, there is no redox reaction.

457
00:24:43.314 --> 00:24:46.614
I guess it's not the tea.

458
00:24:46.614 --> 00:24:49.014
Then, what on earth happened to him?

459
00:24:49.014 --> 00:24:51.814
So, the dice has been thrown.

460
00:24:51.814 --> 00:24:53.914
For the sake of Detective Ogami who has died

461
00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:55.314
to make way for the grand start

462
00:24:55.314 --> 00:24:57.014
of this life risking competition of intelligence,

463
00:24:57.014 --> 00:24:59.514
go search for the treasure with all your might...

464
00:24:59.514 --> 00:25:03.714
Cut out your stupid talk!

465
00:25:03.714 --> 00:25:06.014
While you are still alive.

466
00:25:07.514 --> 00:25:09.314
A cassette tape.

467
00:25:09.314 --> 00:25:11.814
It seems to be connected to a timer.

468
00:25:11.814 --> 00:25:13.614
A timer?

469
00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:17.814
Were you also instructed on the time at which to bring the food in?

470
00:25:17.814 --> 00:25:22.714
Yes, in detail, appetizers, soup, main dish and dessert.

471
00:25:22.714 --> 00:25:29.414
Which means that he wasn't talking while watching us, but...

472
00:25:29.414 --> 00:25:32.214
The tape was being played.

473
00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:34.614
So, now we know two things.

474
00:25:34.614 --> 00:25:38.414
That the killer intended to kill Mr. Ogami to begin with.

475
00:25:38.414 --> 00:25:43.914
And, that maybe, the killer is among us.

476
00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:54.345
The killer may be among us?

477
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:56.445
Take that tape for instance.

478
00:25:56.445 --> 00:25:59.145
Somebody in this room could've recorded the voice beforehand,

479
00:25:59.145 --> 00:26:03.845
and pretended listening to it, like everyone else here, right?

480
00:26:04.945 --> 00:26:07.745
That is possible.

481
00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:10.445
And sit in this same dining room as Mr. Ogami,

482
00:26:10.445 --> 00:26:13.045
without us noticing.

483
00:26:13.045 --> 00:26:15.145
He was made to drink the cyanide

484
00:26:15.145 --> 00:26:16.745
and poisoned him to death.

485
00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:20.845
Yeah, right in front of the very eyes of all 5 of us.

486
00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:24.245
Moreover, from the contents of the tape,

487
00:26:24.245 --> 00:26:26.445
it sure sounds like the killer

488
00:26:26.445 --> 00:26:29.645
knew what time the victim was going to die too.

489
00:26:29.645 --> 00:26:30.645
The question is,

490
00:26:30.645 --> 00:26:34.345
there was no cyanide compound reaction from the tea

491
00:26:34.345 --> 00:26:37.545
that he was drinking until just before he died.

492
00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:41.145
Then, maybe the poison was on the rim of the cup

493
00:26:41.145 --> 00:26:43.345
and not in the tea itself.

494
00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:49.245
No, because he drank from the cup two to three times.

495
00:26:49.245 --> 00:26:52.045
But, the criminal that you're referring to is,

496
00:26:52.045 --> 00:26:54.245
the Thief Kid, right?

497
00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:58.345
I've heard that he never kills anyone.

498
00:26:58.345 --> 00:27:01.245
No, this is the first case that something like this has happened,

499
00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:02.645
as far as I know.

500
00:27:02.645 --> 00:27:05.345
Well, talking is not going to get us anywhere.

501
00:27:05.345 --> 00:27:07.445
Shouldn't we go take a look?

502
00:27:07.445 --> 00:27:10.545
Whether our cars have really been blown up or not.

503
00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:12.645
I agree.

504
00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:17.345
There could be a car that was spared being blown up.

505
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:21.045
Yeah. The explosion that we heard a while ago

506
00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:24.345
could've been a bluff.

507
00:27:34.845 --> 00:27:36.845
Ouch!

508
00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:40.245
The car that I rented.

509
00:27:40.745 --> 00:27:44.445
My Ferarri's done medium to.

510
00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:48.545
My Alfa as well as Ogami's Porsche are all gone.

511
00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:51.645
Is that Bentz yours, then?

512
00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:56.545
No. I had my granny drive me over here.

513
00:27:56.545 --> 00:28:01.545
Strange. I had Mr. Mouri give me a lift here.

514
00:28:01.545 --> 00:28:03.645
Who's Bentz is that, then?

515
00:28:03.645 --> 00:28:07.645
I think it's the master's car.

516
00:28:07.645 --> 00:28:10.945
When I got here early this morning,

517
00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:13.145
it was already here.

518
00:28:13.145 --> 00:28:14.145
Which means that

519
00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:18.645
there is someone else besides us, here, after all?

520
00:28:18.645 --> 00:28:21.145
Could it mean that my car that is on the other side,

521
00:28:21.145 --> 00:28:23.645
has also been burned?

522
00:28:23.645 --> 00:28:27.945
On the other side? You mean you didn't park your car here?

523
00:28:27.945 --> 00:28:32.745
No, because I was instructed to park it at the back gate.

524
00:28:34.845 --> 00:28:36.545
What's the shortcut to the back gate?

525
00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:38.945
Go through the enclosed garden.

526
00:28:45.045 --> 00:28:47.945
Go to the back gate from the kitchen to the left beyond!

527
00:28:52.045 --> 00:28:54.545
Oh, your car's just fine!

528
00:28:55.245 --> 00:28:58.045
Isn't there something fishy about this car?

529
00:28:58.045 --> 00:29:01.245
The rat probably forget to set the bomb.

530
00:29:01.245 --> 00:29:04.045
Then, maybe we should go check to see

531
00:29:04.045 --> 00:29:05.845
if the bridge is really gone.

532
00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:08.945
-I'll go with you. -I guess I will too.

533
00:29:08.945 --> 00:29:10.545
Me too.

534
00:29:10.545 --> 00:29:13.745
Come now, too many captains will sink the ship.

535
00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:16.945
True. We'll end up not the "Phantom Thief"

536
00:29:16.945 --> 00:29:19.445
but rather, a "Phantom Ship."

537
00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:21.745
Then, why not decides which detective goes,

538
00:29:21.745 --> 00:29:23.345
by tossing a coin?

539
00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:26.145
I just happen to have exactly 5 coins on me.

540
00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:34.645
My, you're pretty well prepared, little one.

541
00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:37.845
This is a very primitive way to decide, however.

542
00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:40.345
I guess we've got no choice.

543
00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:43.945
Then, the one who gets heads...

544
00:29:43.945 --> 00:29:47.145
Get to go drive over to the bridge and check it out.

545
00:29:57.145 --> 00:30:01.945
The ones who are going are me, Mr. Mouri and Mogi, right?

546
00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:13.345
Please be careful, dad!

547
00:30:23.545 --> 00:30:25.245
Don't tell me that...

548
00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:27.745
It couldn't be...

549
00:30:29.845 --> 00:30:32.745
Come, let's go back inside.

550
00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:34.345
Come on, let's go!

551
00:30:34.345 --> 00:30:36.145
Oh, okay.

552
00:30:40.945 --> 00:30:43.245
What a sight.

553
00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:46.145
The bridge is completely downed.

554
00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:48.445
Hey, Granny Senma!

555
00:30:48.445 --> 00:30:50.245
Will you bring the headlights up closer?

556
00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:52.345
I want to look at my feet.

557
00:30:52.345 --> 00:30:58.345
Okay! Uh... closer...

558
00:31:01.145 --> 00:31:03.645
I wonder if the killer will move.

559
00:31:03.645 --> 00:31:06.545
Yeah. I don't think this is all there is to it.

560
00:31:18.045 --> 00:31:19.245
Sen...

561
00:31:19.245 --> 00:31:20.945
Ms. Senma!

562
00:31:22.645 --> 00:31:25.845
Ms. Senma!

563
00:31:42.092 --> 00:31:44.792
What? Senma died?

564
00:31:44.792 --> 00:31:46.992
Yeah, it was rigged

565
00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:48.392
so that when you touch the lights of the car,

566
00:31:48.392 --> 00:31:50.192
it would explode.

567
00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:51.392
Oh, no.

568
00:31:51.392 --> 00:31:54.092
Waiting here is just going to get us killed.

569
00:31:54.092 --> 00:31:56.992
Let's split up and go check

570
00:31:56.992 --> 00:31:58.892
if there is really someone else in this house!

571
00:31:58.892 --> 00:32:03.492
Then maybe we three women should form a group.

572
00:32:03.492 --> 00:32:05.892
That way we can even go to the restroom together.

573
00:32:05.892 --> 00:32:07.992
Hey. By the way,

574
00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:10.392
where did that brown haired, fair skinned young man go?

575
00:32:10.392 --> 00:32:12.892
Beats me. Maybe he's feeding the eagle

576
00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:15.192
that he brought along with him?

577
00:32:31.892 --> 00:32:35.092
Oh. What a fancy thing to find here.

578
00:32:37.592 --> 00:32:41.692
There is a brand new scratch on the piano cord.

579
00:32:41.692 --> 00:32:44.992
That was probably made by the claws of the eagle.

580
00:32:44.992 --> 00:32:50.292
It shows that the young man also came and searched this room.

581
00:32:50.292 --> 00:32:54.892
Huh? There is something stuck between the keys of the piano!

582
00:33:00.792 --> 00:33:02.692
This is the secret code that indicates

583
00:33:02.692 --> 00:33:05.092
the location of the treasure that he was talking about?

584
00:33:06.892 --> 00:33:11.392
But why is it mimeographed on rice paper?

585
00:33:11.392 --> 00:33:14.692
Somebody probably printed a whole lot of this

586
00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.292
when no such things as copy machines existed yet.

587
00:33:17.292 --> 00:33:20.992
And, for some reason, distributed it to many people.

588
00:33:20.992 --> 00:33:23.492
In other words, the thing he was referring to...

589
00:33:23.492 --> 00:33:26.992
The story about the tragedy that occurred here 40 years ago

590
00:33:26.992 --> 00:33:31.892
as well as the secret code indicating the hidden treasure,

591
00:33:31.892 --> 00:33:34.892
are all a bunch of baloney.

592
00:33:39.092 --> 00:33:42.492
Huh? This piano is leaking.

593
00:33:42.892 --> 00:33:45.292
Come to think of it, yes, it is.

594
00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:49.892
This is that young lady's luminol fluid.

595
00:33:49.892 --> 00:33:52.892
Which means that she's been in this room too.

596
00:33:52.892 --> 00:33:55.892
Hey, flimsy mustache, turn off the light!

597
00:33:55.892 --> 00:33:56.892
Quick!

598
00:33:56.892 --> 00:33:59.492
What the...

599
00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:23.192
Huh? Where is Aki, the maid?

600
00:34:23.192 --> 00:34:26.392
She said she'd be waiting in the corridor outside the restroom,

601
00:34:26.392 --> 00:34:27.692
but you go check?

602
00:34:27.692 --> 00:34:29.492
Oh, okay.

603
00:34:31.692 --> 00:34:33.292
Aki.

604
00:34:34.792 --> 00:34:36.292
Aki.

605
00:34:48.792 --> 00:34:51.192
There are letters written in blood on the piano.

606
00:34:51.192 --> 00:34:56.292
Something did happen after all, 40 years ago.

607
00:34:56.992 --> 00:34:58.492
An ace...

608
00:34:58.492 --> 00:34:59.992
Don't tell me that...

609
00:35:13.992 --> 00:35:16.892
Just as I thought, it was you, after all.

610
00:35:18.092 --> 00:35:20.292
The killer would never risk danger,

611
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:24.092
such as to ride a car that has been rigged with a bomb.

612
00:35:24.092 --> 00:35:27.392
In other words, the possible killers are those who stayed behind.

613
00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:29.192
You and me.

614
00:35:29.192 --> 00:35:32.792
Ran and the maid, Aki.

615
00:35:33.592 --> 00:35:37.492
Oh, my, sonny, that stuff can be dangerous.

616
00:35:37.492 --> 00:35:41.592
It was under the pillow in my room.

617
00:35:41.592 --> 00:35:42.792
Although you probably put it there

618
00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:46.492
so that you could set me up as the killer later.

619
00:35:46.492 --> 00:35:48.992
Oh, what a coincidence.

620
00:35:48.992 --> 00:35:51.492
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

621
00:35:51.492 --> 00:35:54.892
I made the exact same deduction as you.

622
00:35:59.392 --> 00:36:01.092
Gun fire?

623
00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:02.992
It came from the center tower!

624
00:36:13.892 --> 00:36:17.392
No good, the bullet's gone right through his chest.

625
00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:18.992
Darn.

626
00:36:19.992 --> 00:36:21.192
The stairs?

627
00:36:21.192 --> 00:36:23.792
Somebody's using the stairs!

628
00:36:26.892 --> 00:36:28.392
Why, you...

629
00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:35.892
A computer?

630
00:36:35.892 --> 00:36:40.992
He said to come here after we find where the treasure is.

631
00:36:42.292 --> 00:36:44.692
So... Ms. Souda?

632
00:36:45.092 --> 00:36:46.292
Take a look.

633
00:36:47.592 --> 00:36:49.292
If I turn the knob that is on the inside,

634
00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:51.592
a needle is set up to come out.

635
00:36:54.692 --> 00:36:55.792
When the one who finds the treasure

636
00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:57.492
inputs the location into the computer

637
00:36:57.492 --> 00:37:01.092
and is ready to leave the room, that person is poisoned to death.

638
00:37:01.092 --> 00:37:02.192
But...

639
00:37:02.192 --> 00:37:04.392
where on earth is the killer?

640
00:37:06.392 --> 00:37:08.192
Don't you play dumb with me.

641
00:37:10.492 --> 00:37:11.892
This woman

642
00:37:11.892 --> 00:37:15.092
couldn't have got done with by a trap she set up herself,

643
00:37:15.092 --> 00:37:16.892
and the maid and your daughter

644
00:37:16.892 --> 00:37:19.092
are snoozing away in the toilet.

645
00:37:20.092 --> 00:37:22.992
If that gunshot was a fake,

646
00:37:22.992 --> 00:37:26.792
the only two people who can commit murder are you and me.

647
00:37:26.792 --> 00:37:28.892
I know it's not me, so it means that...

648
00:37:33.092 --> 00:37:35.392
You're the one, right?
