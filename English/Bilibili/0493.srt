1
00:00:01.132 --> 00:00:03.532
In our search to find out whether Eisuke Hondo's older sister

2
00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:06.132
and Rena Mizunashi, were one and the same person,

3
00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:10.132
we found out that Rena Mizunashi's blood type was AB.

4
00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:13.032
I'm blood type AB!

5
00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:15.532
On the other hand, Eisuke tells us that he is blood type O,

6
00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:18.632
and from the mansion where his mother used to work as a housekeeper.

7
00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:21.232
A mother-child booklet that was found, confirmed Eisuke's blood type too.

8
00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:23.532
It's written here, see?

9
00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:26.932
Eisuke Hondo, blood type O!

10
00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:28.832
True.

11
00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:31.232
So, now everyone knows that I'm blood type O!

12
00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:32.432
I see.

13
00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.032
So, all that's left now is to verify the story about

14
00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:37.232
whether his older sister really gave him blood for transfusion.

15
00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:39.632
The son of the Okudaira's

16
00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:44.232
had been killed by someone a year ago.

17
00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:49.332
And this is the print out of the video we were watching back then.

18
00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:52.232
Both his legs are tied and his mouth is covered with masking tape.

19
00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:54.432
Talk about terrible.

20
00:00:54.432 --> 00:00:56.332
Do you have any idea of anyone

21
00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:58.732
who could've had a grudge against your son?

22
00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:00.932
An idea of anyone,

23
00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:03.832
not outside, but rather inside this house.

24
00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:11.132
This is what I think, Detective Mouri.

25
00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:13.632
My son Tango

26
00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:17.632
was killed by a sly and clever someone...

27
00:01:19.732 --> 00:01:22.732
who lives in this mansion.

28
00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.332
Sizzling hot suspense.

29
00:01:48.332 --> 00:01:51.232
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

30
00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:53.532
A surprising truth that is revealed through blood type!

31
00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:55.932
Echoing through the mansion are screams and shrieks!

32
00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:57.432
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:57.432 --> 00:01:59.232
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:01.632
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:39.229
"Red and Black Crash: A Shriek"

36
00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:44.829
Your son was killed by someone in this house?

37
00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.329
But, didn't you say that

38
00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.429
while everyone in the house

39
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:53.429
was watching the video in the living room,

40
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.529
your son was drowned and killed in the pool

41
00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.829
outside your house by someone!

42
00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.329
"Kakuzo Okudaira (63), Head of Okudaira Family"

43
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.529
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death of your son

44
00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.429
was between 9:00 to 10:00 at night.

45
00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:09.729
All the way before and after that time span,

46
00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.029
that is, from 7:00 pm to 12:00 pm,

47
00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.729
all of you were watching video, is that right?

48
00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:23.429
That's true.

49
00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:27.029
But, I'm sure that Tango was killed by someone in this house.

50
00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.829
I can't help thinking so!

51
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.529
Do you have a hidden door or something in the living room?

52
00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.929
And do you think that someone slipped out from there?

53
00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:39.229
No, there is no such door.

54
00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.529
But, there was someone who stood up to go to the restroom

55
00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.629
-while we were watching the video. -I see!

56
00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.429
So, someone snuck outside during that time.

57
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:47.229
Not possible either.

58
00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.229
The restroom is connected to the living room,

59
00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.129
and the window of the restroom is too small

60
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.629
for an adult to go through.

61
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.229
Then, it would be impossible for anyone inside

62
00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.129
to have committed the crime.

63
00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.029
But, take a good look!

64
00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.629
Over here in the picture!

65
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.429
See, Tango's right hand. He's wearing a white glove.

66
00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:09.129
Yes.

67
00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.729
That's the glove that the steward that used to work here before

68
00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.629
used to always wear when he drove!

69
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:23.729
But he died two years ago today, when his car fell over a cliff.

70
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.429
Today, you mean

71
00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:35.929
on the same day a year ago, when your son was murdered?

72
00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:38.529
Right, today.

73
00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.229
And three days after my son's death,

74
00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.829
the left side of the glove that belonged to the steward

75
00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:46.329
was found in my study.

76
00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:49.129
I see! You mean the glove that the killer

77
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.929
tried to put on your son's hand, for some reason came off.

78
00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:54.829
No! Wrong!

79
00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:58.729
Somebody has a grudge against the death of the previous steward!

80
00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.329
A grudge?

81
00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:03.329
Didn't the steward die of an accident?

82
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.629
No...

83
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.429
You mean someone thought that

84
00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:10.829
you and your son were responsible for the death of the steward?

85
00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.929
The killer made your son wear the steward's glove

86
00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:17.529
then later put the glove of this other hand in this room

87
00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:21.829
to warned you that you were next in line to be killed.

88
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:24.729
That's what you wanted to say, right, sir?

89
00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.729
Yeah.

90
00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.729
What's with you guys?

91
00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.629
Coming in without permission!

92
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.429
Conan suggested that we come to hear about the case,

93
00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:36.229
since we finished what we had to do.

94
00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.229
Cut out that stupid chuckle of yours!

95
00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.029
If you're done with what you have to do, go on home!

96
00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:55.329
It's been a long time, Uncle Kakuzo.

97
00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:58.329
Oh, it's you, Eisuke!

98
00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:01.429
I hear that your mother's belongings were found.

99
00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:05.329
Yes! I got them all thanks to everyone.

100
00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:09.629
Your mother was a fantastic housekeeper.

101
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.529
She was very thoughtful and always smiling.

102
00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:15.629
I'm so sorry that

103
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.529
I'm not thoughtful and not amiable on top of that.

104
00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:22.829
Oh, no, I didn't mean it to sound that way.

105
00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:27.229
By the way, I heard that Tango passed away.

106
00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:32.929
Yeah, I'm having Detective Mouri check on it for me now.

107
00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:35.929
-Mr. Segawa. -Yes, sir.

108
00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.929
Please show Detective Mouri to the living room.

109
00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:41.329
Yes, sir, Mr. Okudaira.

110
00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:44.729
And, Kikuyo, could you get us another serving of coffee?

111
00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:46.529
-Yes, sir. -And, could you also

112
00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:48.929
go get Mrs. Okudaira while you're at it?

113
00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:52.429
I want her to help me organize this study.

114
00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:54.329
Will you all come and help me too,

115
00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:55.929
once you've finished doing what you have to?

116
00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:58.829
I've got something I'd like to talk to you about too.

117
00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:01.229
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:03.429
Oh, and Segawa.

119
00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:04.829
Yes?

120
00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:08.029
I've told you time and again

121
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.129
to knock before coming into my room!

122
00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:14.929
Haven't you informed the guests, you blockhead?

123
00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:17.429
I'm very sorry.

124
00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:25.629
What? Help organize the study?

125
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.129
No way!

126
00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:32.129
He's so detailed and so hung up complaining about petty things.

127
00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:34.329
But, Mrs. Okudaira...

128
00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:37.029
Even just a while ago, when I tried to open

129
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:39.629
the cardboard box with a set of large books inside that arrived today,

130
00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:41.229
he bawled me out,

131
00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.929
telling me not to touch it until he opened it!

132
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.129
He changed the shelf of the bookshelf

133
00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:48.729
in order to fit the large books in.

134
00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:52.929
We consequently ended up moving almost all the books,

135
00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:56.429
and now he wants help organizing it again?

136
00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:58.729
But...

137
00:08:58.729 --> 00:09:00.929
Let's do this, then!

138
00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:04.429
I'll show Detective Mouri to the living room,

139
00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:06.129
so you go ahead and help my husband.

140
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:11.329
But, I've got to clean Tango's car too.

141
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:15.229
No one has been using that car for the past two years,

142
00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:17.529
so why not just leave it as is?

143
00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:19.429
But, Mrs. Okudaira...

144
00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:22.029
Come along, this way.

145
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.029
Since you can wash the car later,

146
00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:26.729
-do so for me, okay? -Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:30.029
Please come this way.

148
00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:32.429
Is this the living room in question?

149
00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:33.929
Yes.

150
00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:37.629
Back then, my husband, the steward, the housekeeper and I

151
00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:40.429
were all here watching the video.

152
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:43.229
We watched the video of my husband and I taking a trip abroad

153
00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:45.529
for approximately five hours straight.

154
00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:48.929
Why didn't your son watch the video together?

155
00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:53.129
Most probably because he was trying to avoid me.

156
00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:56.829
I'm not his real mother.

157
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:57.929
Is that so?

158
00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:02.029
No, Tango is the son of my husband's previous wife.

159
00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:04.129
Haven't I told you?

160
00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:07.529
But, is my husband really suspecting us?

161
00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:08.929
Yes.

162
00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:13.429
How dare he suspect us just because the killer can't be found?

163
00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:16.029
My husband sure is a pain in the neck.

164
00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:21.229
The living room restroom.

165
00:10:21.229 --> 00:10:25.929
Sure has a window that adults could never go through.

166
00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:27.329
Moreover, there is no secret hole

167
00:10:27.329 --> 00:10:31.129
where someone cannot go in and out of in this living room.

168
00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:34.329
If so, the four that were watching the video here,

169
00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:36.129
would have a perfect alibi.

170
00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:38.329
It really came as a surprise to me, though,

171
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.629
that you, Eisuke who used to be such a cry baby

172
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:44.629
has come here with such a cute girlfriend.

173
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:47.529
Oh no, we're not.

174
00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:50.729
Not lovers or anything like that!

175
00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:57.529
We came here to find out what Eisuke's blood type is,

176
00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:01.929
since we were told that his mother-child booklet was found!

177
00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:05.129
Right, Eisuke?

178
00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:06.829
Yep.

179
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:09.329
Why the blood type?

180
00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:11.729
Well, when I showed Mr. Mouri the picture of my older sister,

181
00:11:11.729 --> 00:11:15.529
he said that it may be Rena Mizunashi,

182
00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:18.129
so I came to clear the fact that she isn't.

183
00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.929
This announcer, Rena Mizunashi is blood type AB,

184
00:11:20.929 --> 00:11:22.529
but my blood type is O.

185
00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:25.729
I once receive blood transfusion from my older sister so,

186
00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:28.929
I know that she and the announcer are two different people!

187
00:11:28.929 --> 00:11:32.529
Eisuke knew about it.

188
00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:35.729
Come to think of it, I remember that there was something like that.

189
00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:39.029
If I remember correctly, soon after your mother passed away

190
00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:42.629
and you went to live with your father in Osaka,

191
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:45.829
you got into an accident.

192
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:48.129
After hearing what happened, I rushed over

193
00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:53.329
and saw your older sister lying exhausted beside you.

194
00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:01.529
I asked the nurse, and found out

195
00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:05.229
that you had a large amount of blood transfusion from your sister.

196
00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:07.229
I heard that she said, she didn't mind

197
00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:09.229
if they took all the blood they could get from her,

198
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.929
and give it to you.

199
00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:14.929
I see.

200
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:17.729
So, this does it.

201
00:12:17.729 --> 00:12:21.129
His older sister and Rena Mizunashi

202
00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:23.429
are two different people.

203
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.740
I don't watch much TV but, do they resemble each other that much,

204
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.240
his older sister and that woman?

205
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.940
Yes, from the picture, they look exactly alike.

206
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.540
But, don't you think it's strange?

207
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.140
I mean it's not like this is a doppelganger phenomenon or something.

208
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.540
It's unbelievable to think that there's someone

209
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.040
who looks so much alike in this world.

210
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.640
I wonder if it has anything to do with the disappearance of my sister?

211
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.840
-What do you think? -Beats me.

212
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.540
I see.

213
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.040
He's going to get her suspicious enough

214
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.940
and lead uncle to check things out, then disclose her crime.

215
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.740
After that, he plans to meet Rena Mizunashi

216
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.940
and ask her about his older sister.

217
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.840
He doesn't want to risk her fleeing,

218
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.040
so he wants to take it slow.

219
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.240
Would you like to go see her, then? In fact, I know where her...

220
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.940
Please show me the pool while we're at it.

221
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.540
We may find something out about Tango.

222
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.540
I guess so.

223
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.340
Oh, but... it's raining outside.

224
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.340
Oh, Kikuyo,

225
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.140
have you been out somewhere?

226
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.840
Yes, I ran out of milk for the coffe,

227
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.840
so I went shopping nearby.

228
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.440
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

229
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.440
Would you show everyone to the pool?

230
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.240
I'll serve the coffee.

231
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.340
Yeah, I don't mind.

232
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.140
Take care of them, okay?

233
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.440
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.340
Talk about dirty.

235
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.640
Yes. It's been left the way it's been

236
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.240
since the incident that occurred last year.

237
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.540
But, how nostalgic.

238
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.940
I used to swim in this pool a lot too.

239
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.240
Hey, Eisuke?

240
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.140
Oh, boy. I mean talk about being a klutz.

241
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.540
My, it's just right.

242
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.840
I'm sorry. The only clothes of the same size

243
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.540
that I could find were that of my late son.

244
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.640
No problem.

245
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.940
Which means that your son was of small build too?

246
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.940
It's a little too big for me.

247
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.740
Yes.

248
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.240
Tango used to do body building.

249
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.640
I put your clothes in the washing machine just now,

250
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.140
so please wait a while.

251
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.540
Oh, Kikuyo,

252
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.840
there was no coffee in the kitchen.

253
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.540
Oh?

254
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.440
I left it on the coffee maker and went shopping.

255
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.940
Oh, Mr. Segawa.

256
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.940
Yes?

257
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.040
Do you know where the coffee in the kitchen is?

258
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040
No.

259
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.040
Maybe Mr. Okudaira couldn't wait and came to get it himself.

260
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.840
What was that sound?

261
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.340
I wonder if it came from Mr. Okudaira's study?

262
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.640
I'll go check.

263
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.940
Yes, please.

264
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.740
Maybe it's that huge vase that we saw a while ago.

265
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.540
No way. That vase is something Mr. Okudaira

266
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.940
had valued since long ago, and it's worth 50,000,000 yen,

267
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.840
A black out?

268
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.640
Don't open the door!

269
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.840
What was that?

270
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.340
Dear!

271
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.140
-It can't be! -What happened to him?

272
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.540
-Dear! -Mrs. Okudaira,

273
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.040
shattered pieces of the vase are still on the floor!

274
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.740
Are you all right?

275
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.840
Yes.

276
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.940
Dear.

277
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.840
Let's get him down right away!

278
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.940
-Yes, sir! -Ran!

279
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.540
Contact the police and call an ambulance!

280
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.340
Okay, right away!

281
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.840
Darn, what's with this rope? It won't come off.

282
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.140
The mouth of the vase...

283
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.040
is wet?

284
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.540
I'm sorry to say that

285
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:03.740
your husband was already dead when he arrived at the hospital.

286
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.740
Oh no!

287
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.040
Mrs. Okudaira.

288
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.140
Mrs. Okudaira. Here, take this.

289
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.340
Thank you.

290
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.640
I'd like to ask you a few questions, ma'am.

291
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.340
Who was the first to find him?

292
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.240
Oh, yes. The first two who found my husband

293
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.440
were Kikuyo and Mr. Segawa, right?

294
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.140
Yes, we heard something crack from the study,

295
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.840
so we rushed over and knocked

296
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.440
but there was no answer.

297
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.040
Since he didn't answer,

298
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.140
I tried turning the door knob.

299
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.740
But then, I heard him shout, "Don't open the door!"

300
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.540
Oh, and did you open the door?

301
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.240
Of course I did,

302
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.940
because I couldn't make out what was happening.

303
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.140
Then, when we opened the door,

304
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.240
we found Mr. Okudaira's body suspended in the air.

305
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.640
Which means that the man hung himself just before you opened the door?

306
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.540
Yes, his body was still swaying.

307
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.840
The window is locked tightly

308
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.640
so it looks to be he committed suicide but...

309
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.840
But, I wonder why he shouted, "Don't open the door?"

310
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.440
I'm sure he didn't want anybody to witness him die.

311
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.040
It seems that Mr. Okudaira got sick and tired of this world

312
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.840
and decided to take his life.

313
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.140
You again.

314
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.540
Please take a look, Inspector,

315
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.840
at the shattered pieces of the vase on the floor!

316
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.840
This was indeed the sound of something cracking that everyone heard!

317
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.940
Moreover, this is the vase that he treasured most,

318
00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.240
worth 50,000,000 yen!

319
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.840
50,000,000 yen! Is that true?

320
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.940
Yes.

321
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.740
My husband used to boast that

322
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.040
it is valued at over 200,000,000 yen now.

323
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.740
The fact that he used the vase as a stepping stool to hang himself

324
00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.440
is just proof that he got sick and tired of everything.

325
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.440
However, the result of the autopsy showed that

326
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.540
coffee as well as a sleeping drug were found inside his stomach.

327
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.740
Coffee?

328
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.940
Huh? You mean that?

329
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.640
There are two cups there!

330
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.240
One is mine.

331
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.240
But, would a person who is ready to hang himself

332
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.740
drink coffee with sleeping pills in it?

333
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.040
Maybe he planned to kill himself

334
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.640
taking an overdose of sleeping pills at first,

335
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.840
but found that he couldn't die, so he switched methods.

336
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.040
He glued the rope on together carefully the second time around,

337
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.540
so that it wouldn't come off.

338
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.840
Glue?

339
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.240
Yes, I was wondering why the rope wouldn't come off right away

340
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.540
when I tried to bring Mr. Okudaira down,

341
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.840
and found that glue was on the connecting parts of the rope.

342
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.040
What was his motive for committing suicide?

343
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.140
Do you have any idea?

344
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.340
No.

345
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.440
Come to think of it, he said to come to his study later

346
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.240
because he wanted to talk something over,

347
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.440
so maybe he had something that was bothering him.

348
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.540
Then, why would he hang himself before he talked to all of you about it?

349
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.740
Maybe he thought it was useless even if talked to us about it?

350
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.740
I hate to say this,

351
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.340
but I don't think Mr. Okudaira trusted any of you.

352
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.040
Your husband was probably bleeding from the mouth

353
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.340
because he bit his lip in vexation.

354
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.940
I'll bet he didn't like the idea of his favourite vase,

355
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.440
being owned by someone else after his death.

356
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.040
That's why he used it as a step and cracked the vase by stepping on it.

357
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.140
-So, that man was really greedy after all. -What?

358
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.640
Because if the man stepped on the vase to hang himself

359
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.740
and the sound of the vase cracking was heard,

360
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.040
that means the man was already choking at that time, right?

361
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.440
He must've been really greedy because he was able to shout,

362
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.540
"Don't give the vase to anyone" despite being choked.

363
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.840
Wrong, Conan.

364
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.740
He didn't shout don't give the vase away, he said don't open the door.

365
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.540
Oh, did he?

366
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.840
Come to think of it, isn't it strange?

367
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.040
How could he have shouted when he was being choked?

368
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.240
Which means that when the vase cracked he hadn't hung himself yet.

369
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.140
Which means that he hung himself from the shock of the vase cracking?

370
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.640
No, if they heard the sound of the crack and ran over,

371
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.740
he wouldn't have had enough time to hang himself with the rope.

372
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.140
Oh, maybe it's because of this?

373
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.040
See, this book is stained with blood.

374
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.940
I'll bet he was disappointed because it was a book he treasured.

375
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.540
"Murderer from the Land of the Dead?"

376
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.440
It's located right below Mr. Okudaira's feet.

377
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440
Huh?

378
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.440
Could this by chance be a dying message?

379
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.440
Don't be ridiculous.

380
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.240
Are you saying that the killer is a ghost

381
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.240
who came from the Land of the Dead?

382
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.740
Oh, no, I think that the message is

383
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.440
where the word Land of the Dead is, because there's a lot of blood there,

384
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.940
and because of the hiragana "ko"

385
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.040
that seems to have been written by dripping blood.

386
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.140
Land of the Dead, (pronounced "yomiko")

387
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.340
Ko... Koyomi?

388
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.340
Does it have anything to do with a date?

389
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.740
No, I'm not really sure yet if this is the letter "ko".

390
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.740
If you change the angle of the letter by turning it sideways,

391
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.840
it looks like the hiragana "i" or even "ri".

392
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.540
If this is a dying message,

393
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.940
Mr. Kakuzo Okudaira was killed by one of you.

394
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.740
Here in this house.

395
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.340
What is the meaning of the "Murderer from the Land of the Dead

396
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.440
and the dying message written in blood that are left behind?

397
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.740
If the murderer is someone who is in the house right now,

398
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.840
is the murderer also connected to the murder of Tango,

399
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.640
who was killed a year ago?

400
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.340
The ruthless trick is common in both incidents...

401
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.440
It is the key to solving everything.

402
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.640
Next on Detective Conan,

403
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.240
"Red and Black Crash: Hades"

404
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.040
Stepstool.

406
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.740
Officer Takagi, may I use you as a stepstool?

407
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740
-Yeah, sure. -Me too, then.

408
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.340
-Oh, same here! -Too heavy...
