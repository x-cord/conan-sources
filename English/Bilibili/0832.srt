1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.170
We arrived at the filming site of a zombie movie.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.770
We encounter the staff who came to film a sequel of the movie there.

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.470
But during the filming,

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.470
Mr. Takashi Harawaki, the producer, dies.

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.970
Furthermore, amidst the commotion of the zombie audition,

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.570
Ms. Kyoko Ejiri, the cameraman, died too.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.170
A canvas stained black with crime.

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.270
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

9
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.370
Although Inspector Yamamura stirs things up,

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.770
The Heiji-Conan duo solve the mystery in an unexpected way.

11
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.570
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.070
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:30.928
"The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 3)"

15
00:02:33.628 --> 00:02:35.528
Excuse me...

16
00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:41.228
The zombies said, they brought police officers

17
00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.728
from the Gunma Prefectural Police Department.

18
00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:45.828
Ran?

19
00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:48.528
The Gunma Prefectural Police?

20
00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:50.228
Which means that...

21
00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:52.428
Don't tell me...

22
00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:54.328
Those having problems with zombies,

23
00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:57.528
sorry to keep you all waiting!

24
00:02:57.528 --> 00:03:00.428
There's nothing to worry about anymore now

25
00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:02.728
that monster hunter Yamamura is here for you.

26
00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:09.328
Zombies...

27
00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:12.028
Zombies everywhere.

28
00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:15.628
Begone, evil spirits...

29
00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.328
-Hey! -What?

30
00:03:17.328 --> 00:03:18.828
What're you doing?

31
00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:20.628
The corpse is upstairs.

32
00:03:20.628 --> 00:03:23.228
You guys?

33
00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:25.228
I see...

34
00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:27.028
So you're saying...

35
00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:29.728
After finishing filming the movie trailer,

36
00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:34.328
the two of you went to call Mr. Harawaki because it was time for lunch.

37
00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:38.128
But he was collapsed in the room next to this one,

38
00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:42.228
and on the phone he was holding, a video of him taking the poison,

39
00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:45.328
and something that looked to be a suicide note were displayed.

40
00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:49.728
Then the surprise Zombies that Mr. Harawaki called over scared you

41
00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.228
and you instructed the staff to evacuate upstairs.

42
00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:56.228
While you two were fighting the zombies downstairs,

43
00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:58.428
Ms. Kyoko Ejiri was for some reason

44
00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:01.228
was slashed on the neck and killed, correct?

45
00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:02.928
Yeah, that's right.

46
00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:06.128
Furthermore, a video of her being bitten on the neck

47
00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:07.528
was left on the cell phone,

48
00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:11.528
along with the perpetrator who did this to her and committed suicide.

49
00:04:11.528 --> 00:04:12.528
And that supposed perpetrator, Mr. Harawaki,

50
00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:16.228
suddenly disappears from the room he committed suicide in.

51
00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:20.328
This can mean nothing more than that he...

52
00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:26.128
Mr. Harawaki turned into a zombie and killed Kyoko!

53
00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:28.428
How frightening! Scary!

54
00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:29.828
I thought that what he'd say.

55
00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:32.128
I guess this was to be expected.

56
00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:35.628
Then, where did that Mr. Harawaki disappear to anyway?

57
00:04:35.628 --> 00:04:37.928
I think he fled amidst the zombies?

58
00:04:37.928 --> 00:04:41.228
That's why he called so many zombies over!

59
00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:42.328
Gosh.

60
00:04:42.328 --> 00:04:43.828
Everything falls into place.

61
00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:47.228
If not, this video couldn't exist!

62
00:04:47.228 --> 00:04:50.428
It kept on recording until you stopped it, right?

63
00:04:50.428 --> 00:04:51.428
Yeah.

64
00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:55.028
If let's say he tricked the victim Kyoko and tried taking that video,

65
00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.428
I don't think she would go as far as

66
00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:59.828
to cooperate being bitten by a zombie and killed!

67
00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:02.228
In the first place, Kyoko is a cameraman

68
00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:03.828
and not an actress, correct?

69
00:05:03.828 --> 00:05:05.728
Well, it seems she was an actress eight years ago

70
00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:10.628
when they filmed a zombie movie back when she was in college, though.

71
00:05:10.628 --> 00:05:13.228
I'm sure that they would all check the image of the videos

72
00:05:13.228 --> 00:05:15.828
they've taken for themselves,

73
00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:18.428
Besides, you can tell just by looking at it, right?

74
00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:20.628
What?

75
00:05:20.628 --> 00:05:23.628
Nobody saw the video that was taken eight years ago?

76
00:05:23.628 --> 00:05:25.228
Is that true?

77
00:05:25.228 --> 00:05:26.228
Yes.

78
00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:28.828
"Ria Kawabata (29)" -Because the chief told us that

79
00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:32.028
he'd show us the video after he edited and compiled the videos.

80
00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:35.428
That's why even Kyoko, who was cameraman, back then complained that

81
00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:37.628
she may have parts that she wanted to do a retake of

82
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:41.628
"Orie Baisho (29)" -but couldn't!

83
00:05:41.628 --> 00:05:42.928
"Tetsuto Naito (38)" -I'm sure that my brother

84
00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:46.028
considered you all as his first audience

85
00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:49.528
and was looking forward to how you would react.

86
00:05:49.528 --> 00:05:50.528
And?

87
00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:54.528
What kind of role did Mr. Harawaki and Kyoko play in that movie?

88
00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:57.028
If I remember correctly,

89
00:05:57.028 --> 00:06:01.628
Harawaki who turns into a zombie tries to attack Kyoko

90
00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.028
but since they were lovers before,

91
00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:04.728
he didn't attack her, correct?

92
00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:07.928
Isn't that scenario the one that chief got rid of

93
00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:10.128
because he said love was unnecessary in zombie movies?

94
00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:11.928
Come to think of it,

95
00:06:11.928 --> 00:06:13.928
Harawaki mentioned that he didn't just want to become a zombie,

96
00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:16.328
but resisted to some extent.

97
00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:17.628
That's a first.

98
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:18.628
What's this?

99
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.428
Nobody remembers for sure?

100
00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:22.428
Hey.

101
00:06:22.428 --> 00:06:27.428
Did the data for that movie really go missing?

102
00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:28.528
Yes.

103
00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:30.428
Kyoko said so, didn't she?

104
00:06:30.428 --> 00:06:32.728
"Masahaschi Ninomiya (29)" -But Harawaki told me

105
00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:36.228
that he had it in his tablet.

106
00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:38.528
Was he carrying it around?

107
00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:41.428
Yes. If it was his mini tablet, Harawaki...

108
00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:45.828
Always carried it around in the chest pocket of his jacket.

109
00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:46.828
Let's see.

110
00:06:47.928 --> 00:06:49.128
This is it.

111
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.428
No good!

112
00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:55.328
The data is all deleted.

113
00:06:55.328 --> 00:06:58.728
But if it's the picture that we took with everybody in it

114
00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:02.128
when were taking that movie, I have it!

115
00:07:02.128 --> 00:07:03.228
See!

116
00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:09.728
This T shirt that Kyoko is wearing.

117
00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:11.228
This is the T shirt that

118
00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:13.228
Kyoko used to favor and wear,

119
00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:16.428
a brand of a shop that has T shirts with capitalized "E" on it.

120
00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:19.028
She said because her last name is Ejiri,

121
00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:21.728
she had various colors of this T shirt.

122
00:07:21.728 --> 00:07:26.228
Talking about clothes, before was killed Kyoko had taken off her top,

123
00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:27.828
but do you know why?

124
00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:29.728
It was a bit damp too, right?

125
00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:30.928
I wonder.

126
00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:33.428
Maybe she perspired so she changed clothes?

127
00:07:33.428 --> 00:07:37.128
Come to think of it, she was saying even during the filming

128
00:07:37.128 --> 00:07:41.028
that she wanted to take a bath and get change as soon as possible.

129
00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.028
That was about an hour

130
00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:45.928
before we started searching for Mr. Harawaki, wasn't it?

131
00:07:45.928 --> 00:07:47.128
Right! That's right!

132
00:07:47.128 --> 00:07:51.428
During the break I also went to the restroom

133
00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:53.428
but something strange happened!

134
00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:55.028
Something strange?

135
00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:57.328
Ran, who used the restroom before me warned me that

136
00:07:57.328 --> 00:08:02.428
there was only one roll of toilet paper left, so to be careful,

137
00:08:02.428 --> 00:08:04.328
but when I went inside I found no extra rolls of toilet paper at all.

138
00:08:04.328 --> 00:08:06.328
But when I went to the restroom just a while ago,

139
00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:09.928
there was a roll of extra toilet paper inside!

140
00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:13.928
That's... That's a bit creepy, isn't it?

141
00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:17.028
Well, as to how that roll was used.

142
00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:18.728
I have an idea.

143
00:08:18.728 --> 00:08:20.828
What? You know too, Conan?

144
00:08:20.828 --> 00:08:22.028
No!

145
00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:24.728
I'm just copying Heiji!

146
00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:31.428
There seems to be no hidden doors or anything inside the room.

147
00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:34.128
The only thing you can use toilet paper for is

148
00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:38.528
if you want to go from being a zombie to a mummy.

149
00:08:38.528 --> 00:08:39.728
Wait...

150
00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:45.228
The beads of the rosary that were in the top drawer

151
00:08:45.228 --> 00:08:47.728
came out of the drawer below.

152
00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:48.928
Why?

153
00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.628
I see.

154
00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:52.428
You can't see what's right under your nose.

155
00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:54.728
This is what it's all about.

156
00:08:54.728 --> 00:08:57.028
Come to think of it, I didn't ask you,

157
00:08:57.028 --> 00:08:59.828
but did you come all the way here from Osaka on the motorbike?

158
00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:01.128
Nope,

159
00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:03.528
we arrived in Tokyo on the bullet train

160
00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:05.428
and rented a motorbike from there,

161
00:09:05.428 --> 00:09:08.328
because we heard that it was a villa out in the remote mountains.

162
00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:11.828
Which means you insisted on coming along again, Kazuha?

163
00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:14.328
Heiji's the one who asked me to come along.

164
00:09:14.328 --> 00:09:17.928
He said he had something important he wanted to talk to me about...

165
00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:19.728
Something important to talk about?

166
00:09:23.128 --> 00:09:24.128
What?

167
00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:25.228
You've figured out the perpetrator,

168
00:09:25.228 --> 00:09:26.928
so you'd like to disclose the mystery?

169
00:09:26.928 --> 00:09:29.428
Yeah. Me and this boy.

170
00:09:30.628 --> 00:09:32.828
Did you figure out who the perpetrator is too, Conan?

171
00:09:32.828 --> 00:09:34.528
No!

172
00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:37.428
I'm just helping Heiji out!

173
00:09:37.428 --> 00:09:39.028
I see.

174
00:09:39.028 --> 00:09:42.128
I guess there'll no Sleeping Kogoro.

175
00:09:42.128 --> 00:09:45.828
Because he's sick over poisoned mushroom.

176
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.028
Funny!

177
00:09:48.028 --> 00:09:49.528
What's with him?

178
00:09:49.528 --> 00:09:52.328
But, isn't Harawaki the perpetrator?

179
00:09:52.328 --> 00:09:53.428
Yeah!

180
00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:56.828
Because there was a video of him attacking Kyoko, right?

181
00:09:56.828 --> 00:09:59.528
Besides, even the video of him drinking poison

182
00:09:59.528 --> 00:10:01.428
and committing suicide too.

183
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:04.128
How are you going to explain that video?

184
00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:07.728
That's the video of the movie

185
00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:11.128
that was filmed here eight years ago by all of you.

186
00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:12.528
-What? -What?

187
00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:16.228
The video that was saved in Mr. Harawaki's tablet

188
00:10:16.228 --> 00:10:18.628
was recorded using the cell phone.

189
00:10:18.628 --> 00:10:20.628
Then simultaneous to black out,

190
00:10:20.628 --> 00:10:22.728
the side of the cell phone with the lens on it

191
00:10:22.728 --> 00:10:25.028
was placed face down on the chair

192
00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:28.728
and the floor while the device kept on recording as is.

193
00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:32.528
But was there a scene where Harawaki drank poison?

194
00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:33.628
Beats me?

195
00:10:33.628 --> 00:10:37.928
Mr. Harawaki mentioned that he not only just wanted to be a zombie

196
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.628
but wanted to resist, right?

197
00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:43.628
So, maybe he took the video secretly with the chief.

198
00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:47.228
The part where he drank the poison and committed suicide.

199
00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:50.128
Besides the first script was about the star of the show

200
00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:53.128
using the Zombie Blade to kill all of his friends

201
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:56.628
who turned into zombies one after the other, wasn't it?

202
00:10:56.628 --> 00:10:58.328
Yeah.

203
00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:00.728
If so, should be around somewhere,

204
00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:03.428
the video of the scene that Mr. Harawaki bites onto Kyoko

205
00:11:03.428 --> 00:11:06.028
and turns her into a zombie.

206
00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:09.928
The perpetrator used it to his advantage!

207
00:11:09.928 --> 00:11:13.528
But, it's hard to believe this is something that was taken in the past.

208
00:11:13.528 --> 00:11:16.328
We filmed here, so the background is the same.

209
00:11:16.328 --> 00:11:19.128
The proof is right there on the monitor!

210
00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:38.395
Before Mr. Harawaki died he had a goatee,

211
00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:40.895
but he didn't have one in the video

212
00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:43.795
and the color of his pants is slightly different too.

213
00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:46.195
Kyoko had lipstick on,

214
00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:48.395
but had none on the video, wasn't it?

215
00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:49.695
Her hair that she usually had tied back

216
00:11:49.695 --> 00:11:52.395
was untied like in her university days!

217
00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:54.595
Talking of her university days,

218
00:11:54.595 --> 00:11:56.395
the T-shirt that she bought at the shop

219
00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:59.195
that was in the picture that we just saw a while ago

220
00:11:59.195 --> 00:12:01.895
Kyoko, in the video was also wearing it.

221
00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:03.695
See, right here!

222
00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:06.295
It's hidden with her hand and you can't really see it but,

223
00:12:06.295 --> 00:12:08.195
if you enlarge it,

224
00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:10.695
you can see the alphabet capital "E" can't you?

225
00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:12.195
True.

226
00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:15.995
Kyoko's corpse was wearing only a plain white T shirt.

227
00:12:15.995 --> 00:12:20.495
It's proof that the two were killed by the same perpetrator!

228
00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:23.695
But what about Mr. Harawaki's will?

229
00:12:23.695 --> 00:12:26.395
The thing that was written on the will, "Funeral Procession of the Dead"

230
00:12:26.395 --> 00:12:30.195
was the subtitle of the movie that Harawaki had thought up

231
00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:32.495
and sealed inside the envelope.

232
00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:36.395
You said that only Mr. Harawaki could've written it, right?

233
00:12:36.395 --> 00:12:39.195
That's because we didn't realize back then...

234
00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:44.695
That the perpetrator used this to look inside the sealed envelope!

235
00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:46.495
Toilet paper?

236
00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:48.495
How?

237
00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:49.795
It's easy.

238
00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:52.895
You put the toilet paper roll against the envelope

239
00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:54.795
and look through the hole.

240
00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:56.395
Do you want to try?

241
00:12:56.395 --> 00:12:57.395
Okay.

242
00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:01.895
You're right!

243
00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:03.695
It's slightly transparent and I can see!

244
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:05.095
But, how come?

245
00:13:05.095 --> 00:13:07.095
The reflection of light.

246
00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:10.195
You can't see through the white envelope

247
00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:12.395
because of the reflected light.

248
00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:16.795
So if you block off just the right amount of light,

249
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.595
you can see right through the envelope!

250
00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:24.095
Which means that the toilet paper missing during break time was...

251
00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.595
Yeah. The perpetrator probably used that time

252
00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:28.995
to poison Mr. Harawaki to death,

253
00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:30.395
look inside the envelope

254
00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:33.195
and wrote his note in the cell phone.

255
00:13:33.195 --> 00:13:37.195
But then, where is Harawaki's body?

256
00:13:37.195 --> 00:13:39.995
It's right here in this room!

257
00:13:39.995 --> 00:13:41.095
-What? -What?

258
00:13:41.095 --> 00:13:43.695
Inside this wardrobe!

259
00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:44.695
What?

260
00:13:44.695 --> 00:13:47.495
Just what're you talking about?

261
00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:49.995
Only a jacket is inside it

262
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.895
and the drawers are empty!

263
00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:53.795
Okay then, look closely.

264
00:13:53.795 --> 00:13:55.095
First...

265
00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:58.495
You take off the top and bottom drawers.

266
00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:01.195
Then, you remove the inside board.

267
00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:03.795
It should be in here.

268
00:14:03.795 --> 00:14:08.995
The cart with Mr. Harawaki's body on it.

269
00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:11.895
-No way. -It's just like magic!

270
00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:17.695
The trick is the inside board and top drawer of the wardrobe.

271
00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:18.795
See.

272
00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:20.395
Just enough is cut out

273
00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:22.395
so that the torso of a human can fit inside. Right?

274
00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:23.995
Using this trick,

275
00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:28.995
the body of a person can be hidden inside the wardrobe!

276
00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:32.195
That's why the beads that went in from the top drawer

277
00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:35.195
came out of the bottom drawer.

278
00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:39.095
Yeah. They fell through the hole to the bottom drawer.

279
00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:41.795
This is what's called...

280
00:14:41.795 --> 00:14:44.395
You can't see what's right under your nose!

281
00:14:44.395 --> 00:14:47.895
They say the closer you are to it the more you don't realize it's there!

282
00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:49.795
Right, Heiji?

283
00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:51.495
Yeah.

284
00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:54.295
Shoots, I was just going to say that.

285
00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:56.795
He always steals my thunder.

286
00:14:56.795 --> 00:15:01.495
But didn't you notice that the first time opened the drawer?

287
00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:04.995
I thought the drawer was a bit heavy

288
00:15:04.995 --> 00:15:07.495
but the body was on the cart

289
00:15:07.495 --> 00:15:10.295
and the middle board distributed his weight evenly,

290
00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:12.495
so I didn't notice.

291
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.795
But even if he were on the cart,

292
00:15:14.795 --> 00:15:17.695
if you open the drawer, wouldn't the corpse come out?

293
00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:18.795
Look!

294
00:15:18.795 --> 00:15:22.395
Neither of the drawers have a board behind it. Right?

295
00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:24.795
By setting the middle board in place, you can keep what's inside in place.

296
00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:27.395
A gimmick for keeping the board in place is also here.

297
00:15:27.395 --> 00:15:29.395
So even if the drawer were to be pulled out,

298
00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.195
the board would serve as a stopper

299
00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:33.095
and the corpse won't come out.

300
00:15:33.095 --> 00:15:36.895
But, we didn't have time to put a trick like that together.

301
00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:37.995
No!

302
00:15:37.995 --> 00:15:40.595
The one who made this isn't the perpetrator.

303
00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:44.595
Your younger brother made this contraption eight years ago!

304
00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:46.695
What? Joji did?

305
00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:50.395
Then, are you saying that the chief disappeared from this room by...

306
00:15:50.395 --> 00:15:51.395
Yeah!

307
00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:53.795
He probably used this contraption and hid inside the wardrobe

308
00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.095
to make it look like he vanished.

309
00:15:56.095 --> 00:16:00.295
Well, there's no mistake that Joji was hiding in the wardrobe.

310
00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:04.195
The fact that he was found sitting with his arms around his knees

311
00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:06.795
shows that he got stuck, couldn't come out of the wardrobe

312
00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:08.995
and starved to death.

313
00:16:08.995 --> 00:16:10.895
You mean my brother died

314
00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:12.795
because he couldn't make it out of the wardrobe on his own?

315
00:16:12.795 --> 00:16:13.895
No.

316
00:16:13.895 --> 00:16:16.895
If he pushed the top drawer out and remove the board that is inside,

317
00:16:16.895 --> 00:16:21.395
I'm sure he could've come out on his own.

318
00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:22.695
Then why?

319
00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:25.995
Most probably because he couldn't push the drawer out.

320
00:16:25.995 --> 00:16:27.495
Hey, wait...

321
00:16:27.495 --> 00:16:31.795
Don't tell me that because we moved the wardrobe of this room

322
00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:35.595
to look for the chief eight years ago,

323
00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:38.695
he couldn't push out the drawer and...

324
00:16:38.695 --> 00:16:42.495
Since Mr. Harawaki and Kyoko were killed, then...

325
00:16:42.495 --> 00:16:45.395
Don't tell me that the perpetrator is chief's older brother?

326
00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:47.895
Oh, no. I...

327
00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:50.795
Well, that's one of the reasons why he died.

328
00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:52.695
But that's not the problem.

329
00:16:52.695 --> 00:16:56.695
After being trapped in the wardrobe and starved to death,

330
00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:58.195
why was Joji sitting on the floor

331
00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:01.495
when you all came back to look for him again four days later?

332
00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:03.295
Why?

333
00:17:03.295 --> 00:17:05.395
Somebody knew.

334
00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:08.295
That Joji was hiding in the wardrobe.

335
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:09.295
What?

336
00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:10.495
Isn't that right?

337
00:17:10.495 --> 00:17:13.095
Actress Ms. Ria Kawabata!

338
00:17:13.095 --> 00:17:17.195
You're the one who killed Mr. Harawaki and Ms. Kyoko too!

339
00:17:19.395 --> 00:17:21.995
First during break time, you went to Mr. Harawaki's room,

340
00:17:21.995 --> 00:17:27.795
conned him into drinking the poisoned water and killed him.

341
00:17:27.795 --> 00:17:31.495
Then you used the roll of toilet paper to read the subtitle

342
00:17:31.495 --> 00:17:33.495
before including it in the suicide note.

343
00:17:33.495 --> 00:17:36.195
After that you played the video that was taken eight years ago

344
00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:37.695
using the tablet

345
00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:39.995
and recorded it onto his cell phone.

346
00:17:39.995 --> 00:17:41.195
After you make the blacked out scene,

347
00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:44.395
you made his body hold his cell phone

348
00:17:44.395 --> 00:17:47.795
and finally returned to the place where they were filming.

349
00:17:47.795 --> 00:17:48.895
If you stopped there,

350
00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:52.795
Mr. Harawaki's death would've been concluded as suicide.

351
00:17:52.795 --> 00:17:55.895
However, Kyoko realized what you did.

352
00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:59.695
Well, if the whereabouts of the data can be found then,

353
00:17:59.695 --> 00:18:03.895
maybe the mystery of Harawaki's suicide can be solved too.

354
00:18:03.895 --> 00:18:05.095
Because you had no other choice,

355
00:18:05.095 --> 00:18:07.795
you wet Kyoko's T-shirt with water or something

356
00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:10.695
when you fled to the second floor during the zombie scare

357
00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:13.095
and made her get changed into a plain white T-shirt.

358
00:18:13.095 --> 00:18:14.795
After that you cornered her to the wall

359
00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:17.795
and slashed her neck with a cutter-knife.

360
00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.095
In order to make it look exactly like the video

361
00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:21.295
that was taken eight years ago.

362
00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:25.895
You recorded the video taken eight years ago on Kyoko's cell phone

363
00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:30.695
to make everyone think that Mr. Harawaki turned into a zombie

364
00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:34.195
and killed Kyoko then hid his corpse into the wardrobe.

365
00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:36.195
Using the contraption of the wardrobe

366
00:18:36.195 --> 00:18:38.395
that you heard about from Joji eight years ago.

367
00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:44.995
If we check I'm sure we'll find it on your clothes,

368
00:18:44.995 --> 00:18:48.295
the blood that splattered on you when you killed Kyoko.

369
00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:52.795
But anybody else besides Ria could've used that trick too.

370
00:18:52.795 --> 00:18:55.095
Ms. Ria, remember what you said?

371
00:18:55.095 --> 00:18:57.595
When I tried to look into the wardrobe,

372
00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.595
you asked me to check under the bed, didn't you?

373
00:19:01.995 --> 00:19:03.995
That was because you thought you'd be in trouble

374
00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:06.395
if I looked there since I'm short, right?

375
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:10.495
You thought that the corpse you hid in the drawer would be found, right?

376
00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:13.195
Besides, remember what Ms. Orie said?

377
00:19:13.195 --> 00:19:14.195
That eight years ago

378
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:18.095
when Ms. Kyoko and you went upstairs to look for Joji,

379
00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:20.895
your scream was heard after a while,

380
00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:26.895
and Kyoko was standing behind you, who had gone weak in the hips.

381
00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:30.095
Heiji said that's when he figured it out.

382
00:19:30.095 --> 00:19:32.695
This room is right near the stairs,

383
00:19:32.695 --> 00:19:36.595
and one of the two of you would've searched the wardrobe first thing,

384
00:19:36.595 --> 00:19:38.995
and yet, Ria's scream was not heard for a while,

385
00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:40.595
so that it's strange.

386
00:19:40.595 --> 00:19:43.995
If Kyoko was standing behind Ria,

387
00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:46.295
then he said that it had to be Ria,

388
00:19:46.295 --> 00:19:48.295
who pulled the corpse out of the wardrobe,

389
00:19:48.295 --> 00:19:50.395
and pretended to be stunned!

390
00:19:51.595 --> 00:19:55.195
Well, it's true that I was stunned.

391
00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:58.695
I thought he had gotten out of the wardrobe long before

392
00:19:58.695 --> 00:20:01.795
and snoring in bed,

393
00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:04.495
but was surprised to see him still in there.

394
00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:07.795
So, I quickly pulled him out of the drawer

395
00:20:07.795 --> 00:20:11.195
and scream after I sat him up.

396
00:20:11.195 --> 00:20:13.495
As if I had just found him.

397
00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:16.495
But isn't that an accident?

398
00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:18.195
Right.

399
00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:21.595
You were asleep in bed with a cold back then.

400
00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:25.395
But Harawaki didn't think so.

401
00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:28.195
When we came as the staff for the filming,

402
00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:31.695
it seems that Harawaki found the letters written in blood by the chief

403
00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:36.095
inside the wardrobe that I didn't remove completely.

404
00:20:36.095 --> 00:20:37.495
It's true.

405
00:20:37.495 --> 00:20:38.995
It says, "I'll curse you".

406
00:20:38.995 --> 00:20:41.195
There are a whole bunch of stuff written here.

407
00:20:41.195 --> 00:20:43.795
I, myself was surprised.

408
00:20:43.795 --> 00:20:47.695
I made him drink the poison because he threatened me to act in the movie

409
00:20:47.695 --> 00:20:50.795
if I didn't want him disclosing to everyone that I was a killer.

410
00:20:50.795 --> 00:20:53.695
To think that I went as far as to even kill Kyoko

411
00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:56.095
who getting close to revealing the trick.

412
00:20:56.095 --> 00:21:00.795
I'm supposed to be the woman warrior who defeats zombies and yet...

413
00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:04.195
The one who has a rotten heart and turned into a zombie

414
00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:06.395
must be me.

415
00:22:32.495 --> 00:22:34.895
Is this the sound of Hattori's motorbike?

416
00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:37.995
Yep! It seems the road service man just came

417
00:22:37.995 --> 00:22:39.795
and filled the motorbike up with gas.

418
00:22:39.795 --> 00:22:41.695
I guess I'll go see them off then!

419
00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:43.295
Don't!

420
00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:44.595
What?

421
00:22:44.595 --> 00:22:49.195
Heiji said that he had something important to talk to Kazuha about.

422
00:22:50.795 --> 00:22:52.595
Really?

423
00:22:52.595 --> 00:22:54.595
Something important to talk about?

424
00:22:56.695 --> 00:22:59.495
Hey, Heiji, what is it?

425
00:22:59.495 --> 00:23:02.795
You had something important to tell me, didn't you?

426
00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:06.995
Kazuha. This something that's been on my mind from some time ago.

427
00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:10.195
The thing is...

428
00:23:17.495 --> 00:23:18.595
What?

429
00:23:18.595 --> 00:23:21.095
Wasn't today the day for audition?

430
00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:22.895
It was yesterday, you idiot!

431
00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:25.795
It finished long ago.

432
00:23:25.795 --> 00:23:28.295
Everybody, they say that the audition's over!

433
00:23:28.295 --> 00:23:29.395
What?

434
00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:30.595
No joke.

435
00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:35.995
And? What did you want to talk to me about?

436
00:23:35.995 --> 00:23:37.295
Hold your skirt down

437
00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:39.495
so that your panty doesn't show is what I wanted to say.

438
00:23:39.495 --> 00:23:40.795
What? Wait a minute.

439
00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:43.895
Heiji?

440
00:23:43.895 --> 00:23:45.595
I guess the time's not right yet.

441
00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:51.795
Well, at least I gave him back what I owed him.

442
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.595
"Next Episode"

443
00:24:12.195 --> 00:24:15.395
So, if you're going to shoot, shoot me!

444
00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:16.795
Don't die!

445
00:24:16.795 --> 00:24:18.395
Pops!

446
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:24.379
Next Conan, "Weak Point of the Great Detective"

447
00:24:24.938 --> 00:24:26.938
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:26.938 --> 00:24:29.438
"Emergency stairs"

449
00:24:29.438 --> 00:24:30.938
Dad's full of weak points.

450
00:24:30.938 --> 00:24:32.538
And Heiji's weak point is me?

451
00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:33.938
That's absolutely wrong.
