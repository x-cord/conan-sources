1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.770
Ms. Sadako.

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.070
Ms. Sadako, if you don't leave soon, you'll be late.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.670
Ms. Sadako, I'm coming in.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.070
What?

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.270
Ms. Sadako!

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.170
Oh, no...

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.470
Strangled?

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.170
Using rope.

9
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.170
The victim is the owner of the home,

10
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.370
Sadako Baba, 62 years old.

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.470
She was a medium and fortune teller.

12
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.670
A fortune teller?

13
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.170
Yes.

14
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.970
"Masaya Ogu (26)" -She ran a fortune telling shop

15
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.470
near Shibahama Station under the name Barbara Sadako.

16
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.270
This is Ms. Sadako's secretary, Mr. Masaya Ogu.

17
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.470
He was the first to discover the body.

18
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.070
We're waiting on the autopsy for details,

19
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.470
but it seems she was killed last night.

20
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.670
Last night?

21
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.870
Is there a problem?

22
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.170
Then Detective Kogoro Mouri might know something.

23
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.870
Mr. Mouri?

24
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.270
He called yesterday.

25
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.270
"Barbara Sadako's Fortune Telling"

26
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.870
This is Barbara Sadako's fortune telling shop.

27
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.270
One moment, please.

28
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.370
Miss, it's Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

29
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.770
The famous detective?

30
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.570
"Sadako Baba (62)" -This is Barbara Sadako.

31
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.770
Mr. Mouri invited the victim out?

32
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.670
In my eyes are maximum creation.

33
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.270
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

34
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.270
The old man called the victim on the phone?

35
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.470
I'm curious what his fortune was.

36
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.970
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.370
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:20.027 --> 00:03:25.827
"The Fortune Teller and the Three Customers"

40
00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:29.527
I didn't call her.

41
00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:30.527
But...

42
00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:32.327
Don't "but" me.

43
00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:35.427
Besides, I don't know anything about the victim.

44
00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:38.427
And you were at home all night last night.

45
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:39.727
That's right.

46
00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:42.627
Wait, this brat followed me again?

47
00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:46.627
I verified your alibi.

48
00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:48.927
It's possible the secretary did it

49
00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:52.427
and he's trying to frame me.

50
00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.927
He discovered the body.

51
00:03:54.927 --> 00:03:57.327
Naturally, we checked his alibi.

52
00:03:57.327 --> 00:03:58.727
He's totally innocent.

53
00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:01.527
I see.

54
00:04:01.527 --> 00:04:04.427
The culprit probably used Mr. Mouri name

55
00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.927
to invite Ms. Sadako out to the scene of the murder.

56
00:04:07.927 --> 00:04:09.427
Yes.

57
00:04:09.427 --> 00:04:11.827
She wasn't killed here?

58
00:04:11.827 --> 00:04:15.127
No. After being killed somewhere else,

59
00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:17.927
she was transported to this house.

60
00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:22.227
Why did the culprit bother to move the body?

61
00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:25.327
To delay its discovery, of course.

62
00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:27.927
Then wouldn't they take it into the mountains?

63
00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:31.527
And why did they use your name?

64
00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:34.527
Maybe because he's famous.

65
00:04:34.527 --> 00:04:36.427
But if someone used your name,

66
00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:39.327
wouldn't you be determined to find the culprit?

67
00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:40.627
Of course.

68
00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:45.027
So why would they get a detective involved?

69
00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:48.627
I don't understand what this culprit is doing.

70
00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:53.627
About the criminal profile...

71
00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.527
Huh?

72
00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.627
What's this?

73
00:04:57.627 --> 00:04:59.427
"I was nearly killed again."

74
00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:02.427
"Which one of those three did it?"

75
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.527
"Is it K? Is it E? Is it S?"

76
00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:08.127
Does she mean those three?

77
00:05:08.127 --> 00:05:12.227
After appearing on a live TV broadcast about a week ago...

78
00:05:17.827 --> 00:05:19.727
You three...

79
00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:22.527
I'm Kanawa. You told my fortune last month.

80
00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:23.927
"Shinsuke Kanawa (37)" -I ran into these two

81
00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:25.527
"Barbara Sadako's Client" -on the way here.

82
00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:26.927
According to them,

83
00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.927
they experienced tragedies because of your fortunes, too.

84
00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:32.727
"Fukami Endo (29)" -We came running when we saw you on TV!

85
00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:35.027
"Barbara Sadako's Client" -Take responsibility for your fortune telling!

86
00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:37.727
"Ryoichi Sazanami (33)" -I'll never forgive you!

87
00:05:37.727 --> 00:05:38.927
"Barbara Sadako's Client" -Take responsibility!

88
00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:41.527
Now, now. Please calm down.

89
00:05:41.527 --> 00:05:42.627
What's wrong?

90
00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:45.827
This place is too public.

91
00:05:45.827 --> 00:05:49.327
We should leave for now and come up with a plan later.

92
00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:51.727
You'll pay for this, Barbara Sadako!

93
00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:55.927
I don't know what fortunes she told them.

94
00:05:55.927 --> 00:05:58.327
But if anyone hated her,

95
00:05:58.327 --> 00:05:59.727
then it must have been Shinsuke Kanawa,

96
00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:03.027
Fukami Endo, or Ryoichi Sazanami.

97
00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:06.827
Kanawa, Endo, Sazanami.

98
00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:09.227
One of them must be the culprit.

99
00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:11.727
But to be sure, check to see

100
00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:14.127
if there was anyone else who hated the victim.

101
00:06:14.127 --> 00:06:15.727
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:18.727
Three suspicious persons.

103
00:06:18.727 --> 00:06:21.327
One was a woman.

104
00:06:21.327 --> 00:06:23.927
We found this next to the body.

105
00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:31.227
That brooch.

106
00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:32.927
It belongs to Ms. Endo.

107
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:37.527
So they accidentally dropped it when they transported the body here.

108
00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:38.927
If that's true,

109
00:06:38.927 --> 00:06:40.627
then they're unbelievably careless.

110
00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:42.727
Excuse me.

111
00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:47.227
Hello? What?

112
00:06:47.227 --> 00:06:51.427
Something suspicious was just discovered at Shibahama Park.

113
00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:53.427
"Shibahama Park"

114
00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:55.727
That's Ms. Sadako's business card case.

115
00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:59.227
Could this rope be the weapon?

116
00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:02.827
This must be where she was killed.

117
00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:05.227
I'm surprised you found them.

118
00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:08.527
We received an anonymous tip this morning.

119
00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:12.727
They saw a suspicious figure packing something large

120
00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:14.827
into a car in this park last night.

121
00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:16.627
When I came to investigate,

122
00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:20.127
I found signs of a struggle and those objects.

123
00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:23.527
So Fukami Endo strangled Ms. Sadako here,

124
00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:27.427
drove her to that mansion, and left the body there.

125
00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:31.427
I found this here as well.

126
00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:33.427
S. Kanawa?

127
00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:36.127
Could it belong to Shinsuke Kanawa?

128
00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:40.727
Hello?

129
00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:46.027
A car was abandoned near the mansion?

130
00:07:46.027 --> 00:07:47.127
What?

131
00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:50.427
It belongs to Ryoichi Sazanami?

132
00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:53.127
I was curious, so I looked up the license plate number.

133
00:07:53.127 --> 00:07:56.727
I learned it had already been reported stolen.

134
00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:59.027
It was stolen two days ago.

135
00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:02.427
But what's my car doing here?

136
00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:07.727
That's hair. Compare it to the victim's.

137
00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:09.527
That's my lighter.

138
00:08:09.527 --> 00:08:12.027
But I lost it a few days ago.

139
00:08:12.027 --> 00:08:15.427
Me, too. I lost this brooch.

140
00:08:15.427 --> 00:08:18.027
I've figured out who the killer is.

141
00:08:18.027 --> 00:08:21.627
While these three are suspicious,

142
00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:24.327
the culprit isn't one of them.

143
00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:27.227
The three of them attacked the victim.

144
00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:30.627
That's when Mr. Kanawa dropped his lighter.

145
00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:33.727
Then they loaded the body into the car of the trunk

146
00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:37.027
and transported it to the study in Ms. Sadako's mansion.

147
00:08:37.027 --> 00:08:39.927
That's when Ms. Fukami dropped her brooch

148
00:08:39.927 --> 00:08:42.827
and left without realizing she'd lost it.

149
00:08:42.827 --> 00:08:45.427
It's all three of them.

150
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:47.227
-What? -What?

151
00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:50.627
That does explain all their belongings.

152
00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:51.827
Yes.

153
00:08:51.827 --> 00:08:53.127
But...

154
00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:55.627
Inspector, these three are the only ones

155
00:08:55.627 --> 00:08:57.427
who hated the victim.

156
00:08:57.427 --> 00:08:59.127
Wait, we didn't do it!

157
00:08:59.127 --> 00:09:00.727
Yeah!

158
00:09:06.127 --> 00:09:08.927
The hair belonged to the victim.

159
00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:13.427
Mr. Sazanami, your car was used to transport the body.

160
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:15.427
No way.

161
00:09:15.427 --> 00:09:18.227
And all three of them hated Ms. Sadako.

162
00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:19.527
Of course we did.

163
00:09:19.527 --> 00:09:21.127
I was thinking of buying a house,

164
00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.527
so I had her tell me my lucky direction.

165
00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:28.627
Your lucky direction is north-northeast.

166
00:09:29.427 --> 00:09:32.027
The moment I trusted her and bought a house,

167
00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:34.927
the construction company I was working for shut down,

168
00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:36.627
and my wife left me.

169
00:09:36.627 --> 00:09:39.827
I asked her to tell me my romantic fortune.

170
00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:42.927
The man right before your eyes

171
00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:45.327
is the love of your life.

172
00:09:46.027 --> 00:09:49.227
But when I trusted her and married him, he swindled me.

173
00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:51.527
I had a business I wanted to start,

174
00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:54.527
so I had her tell me when I should start.

175
00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:58.227
Now. Your luck is at its peak.

176
00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:01.327
But when I rushed to quit my job and open shop,

177
00:10:01.327 --> 00:10:03.527
it failed, and now I'm drowning in debt.

178
00:10:03.527 --> 00:10:06.427
All three of you suffered serious blows.

179
00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:10.027
They could definitely be motives.

180
00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:13.827
And none of you have alibis for last night, right?

181
00:10:13.827 --> 00:10:16.527
I told you, someone called me.

182
00:10:16.527 --> 00:10:18.027
It was a man.

183
00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:21.227
We received the same call, too.

184
00:10:21.227 --> 00:10:23.427
He was making sure we wouldn't have alibis.

185
00:10:23.427 --> 00:10:26.527
The culprit set us up.

186
00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:30.127
You expect us to believe your convenient story?

187
00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:33.327
Hello?

188
00:10:34.727 --> 00:10:35.827
What?

189
00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:37.327
The results of the autopsy

190
00:10:37.327 --> 00:10:42.427
show the victim died between 8 pm and 9 pm last night.

191
00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:44.927
She was killed by 9 pm at the latest?

192
00:10:44.927 --> 00:10:46.427
Then...

193
00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:48.427
Kid, where are you going?

194
00:10:49.627 --> 00:10:50.927
I knew it.

195
00:10:50.927 --> 00:10:54.627
This document was created after 10 pm last night.

196
00:10:54.627 --> 00:10:56.327
Which means...

197
00:10:56.327 --> 00:10:59.227
The victim didn't write this.

198
00:10:59.227 --> 00:11:03.327
The culprit wrote it when they brought the body here

199
00:11:03.327 --> 00:11:06.227
to cast suspicion on these three.

200
00:11:06.227 --> 00:11:09.427
In other words, they really were framed.

201
00:11:09.427 --> 00:11:10.527
See?

202
00:11:10.527 --> 00:11:12.627
If one of them killed her,

203
00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:15.727
they'd never write this.

204
00:11:15.727 --> 00:11:17.427
If they tried to frame them,

205
00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:23.327
the culprit must've known they hated the victim.

206
00:11:23.327 --> 00:11:25.127
Did you tell anyone else?

207
00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:27.627
I haven't told anyone.

208
00:11:27.627 --> 00:11:28.727
Me, neither.

209
00:11:28.727 --> 00:11:32.127
I wouldn't embarrass myself by telling anyone that.

210
00:11:32.127 --> 00:11:33.627
Yeah.

211
00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:36.027
But someone had to have told them.

212
00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:39.927
It's hard to imagine them telling someone about it on purpose,

213
00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:41.327
which means...

214
00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:44.527
Please find the person who framed us.

215
00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:46.127
Aren't you a great detective?

216
00:11:46.127 --> 00:11:48.727
It would make up for accusing us.

217
00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:50.627
If we examine the crime scene,

218
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.427
I'm sure we'll find a clue to the culprit's identity.

219
00:11:53.427 --> 00:11:55.827
In order to find the culprit,

220
00:11:55.827 --> 00:11:58.527
let's take a break before discussing the case further.

221
00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:02.527
Could it be?

222
00:12:02.527 --> 00:12:06.627
No one besides those three hated the victim, right?

223
00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:09.827
Yeah. No matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find anyone else.

224
00:12:09.827 --> 00:12:13.327
Then it's possible they weren't framed,

225
00:12:13.327 --> 00:12:16.027
but the culprit wanted us to think that.

226
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.927
In other words, one of them is still the culprit.

227
00:12:20.027 --> 00:12:22.327
Since there was no need to work together,

228
00:12:22.327 --> 00:12:24.727
they probably acted alone.

229
00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:29.627
Why did the culprit make us suspect all three of them?

230
00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:34.427
And why did they get the old man involved?

231
00:12:35.427 --> 00:12:38.427
No, there must be some reason

232
00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:40.327
they had to do both of those things.

233
00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:43.727
And if I can figure that out,

234
00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:45.727
I'll know who did it.

235
00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:56.994
They didn't find anything?

236
00:12:56.994 --> 00:12:58.794
It's odd, though.

237
00:12:58.794 --> 00:13:04.094
The secretary wouldn't have told anyone they hated the victim.

238
00:13:04.094 --> 00:13:06.294
It would hurt business.

239
00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:09.594
And those three wouldn't tell anyone, either.

240
00:13:09.594 --> 00:13:11.494
It would've embarrassed them.

241
00:13:11.494 --> 00:13:15.894
Doesn't that mean no one else knew?

242
00:13:16.994 --> 00:13:19.394
Where and when did I lose my lighter?

243
00:13:19.394 --> 00:13:23.794
Mr. Kogoro told me to ask you.

244
00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:27.094
If he knew, he would've gone to retrieve it.

245
00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:29.294
Is he really a great detective?

246
00:13:30.694 --> 00:13:33.394
If they can't find the real culprit,

247
00:13:33.394 --> 00:13:35.294
what's going to happen to this case?

248
00:13:35.294 --> 00:13:38.194
They'll probably never solve it.

249
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:39.694
Well...

250
00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.994
That bogus fortune teller got what was coming to her.

251
00:13:42.994 --> 00:13:44.594
I got my fortune told

252
00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:46.294
because I couldn't make a decision on my own.

253
00:13:46.294 --> 00:13:48.094
I was in the same boat.

254
00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:49.994
I'm actually a weak person.

255
00:13:49.994 --> 00:13:51.694
Me, too.

256
00:13:51.694 --> 00:13:54.494
That's why I relied on fortune telling.

257
00:13:54.494 --> 00:13:55.894
I see.

258
00:13:55.894 --> 00:13:57.194
When you think of it that way,

259
00:13:57.194 --> 00:14:00.194
it explains why all three of them were framed.

260
00:14:00.194 --> 00:14:03.994
Well, my company wasn't doing well since before I bought the house,

261
00:14:03.994 --> 00:14:07.494
and my relationship with my wife had been going poorly for a while.

262
00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:12.094
And I lied a lot about the man I was dating,

263
00:14:12.094 --> 00:14:15.294
so it's possible that clouded her abilities.

264
00:14:15.294 --> 00:14:17.494
Then she doesn't deserve your hate.

265
00:14:17.494 --> 00:14:19.094
I know that.

266
00:14:19.094 --> 00:14:21.494
My situation's different.

267
00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:24.094
If she hadn't told me to start right away,

268
00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:27.294
Alien Ramen would've succeeded.

269
00:14:27.294 --> 00:14:29.494
Alien Ramen?

270
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.294
It's the restaurant I started after quitting my job.

271
00:14:32.294 --> 00:14:36.094
Waiters dressed like aliens bring your ramen to you

272
00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:37.594
and throw pieces of star-shaped pork

273
00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:40.694
into it while shouting, "Shooting star!"

274
00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:44.094
As long as I opened at the right time,

275
00:14:44.094 --> 00:14:46.894
business would've been booming.

276
00:14:46.894 --> 00:14:47.994
Right?

277
00:14:48.994 --> 00:14:51.794
Why is he so confident?

278
00:14:51.794 --> 00:14:52.894
Right?

279
00:14:52.894 --> 00:14:55.494
Don't ask me.

280
00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:56.994
I need to use the bathroom.

281
00:14:58.594 --> 00:15:00.294
What?

282
00:15:00.294 --> 00:15:01.894
So that's how it is.

283
00:15:01.894 --> 00:15:03.394
When you think of it that way,

284
00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:06.294
it explains why they got the old man involved.

285
00:15:06.294 --> 00:15:08.694
But there's not enough evidence.

286
00:15:08.694 --> 00:15:09.794
In that case...

287
00:15:10.494 --> 00:15:12.294
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri,

288
00:15:12.294 --> 00:15:14.394
and I'm assisting with the investigation.

289
00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:17.194
There's something I'd like to confirm with you.

290
00:15:23.494 --> 00:15:24.994
I know.

291
00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:29.594
Yes, could you please compare it to the data I just sent you?

292
00:15:29.594 --> 00:15:30.994
Thank you.

293
00:15:32.094 --> 00:15:34.794
Everyone, Mr. Mouri just called to say

294
00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:37.694
he's figured out the case.

295
00:15:37.694 --> 00:15:39.294
What?

296
00:15:39.294 --> 00:15:40.294
"Shibahama Park"

297
00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:43.594
Mr. Kanawa, Ms. Endo, Mr. Sazanami.

298
00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:46.294
You weren't framed by the culprit.

299
00:15:46.294 --> 00:15:49.294
You wanted us to think you were.

300
00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:50.694
What?

301
00:15:50.694 --> 00:15:53.194
What does that mean, Mr. Mouri?

302
00:15:53.194 --> 00:15:58.494
By pretending they were framed by the true culprit

303
00:15:58.494 --> 00:16:00.994
after killing the victim,

304
00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:04.394
they tried to avoid becoming suspects.

305
00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:09.494
In other words, there was never a true culprit who framed them?

306
00:16:09.494 --> 00:16:12.194
Yes. I was right all along.

307
00:16:12.194 --> 00:16:15.094
All three of them are accomplices.

308
00:16:15.094 --> 00:16:16.294
-What? -What?

309
00:16:16.294 --> 00:16:18.694
It does make sense.

310
00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:22.194
These three are the only ones who hated the victim.

311
00:16:22.194 --> 00:16:25.894
Sounds like we'll have to question you again.

312
00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:27.994
Bring them down to the station.

313
00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:28.994
Yes, sir.

314
00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:30.394
Wait a minute!

315
00:16:30.394 --> 00:16:31.894
I didn't do it!

316
00:16:31.894 --> 00:16:34.094
Find the true culprit!

317
00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:38.094
That should mean this case... is closed...

318
00:16:39.294 --> 00:16:41.394
Wait, everyone.

319
00:16:41.394 --> 00:16:45.294
All three of you being accomplices is just one possibility.

320
00:16:45.294 --> 00:16:47.894
There's also another way to interpret the situation.

321
00:16:47.894 --> 00:16:49.494
Another interpretation?

322
00:16:49.494 --> 00:16:54.494
The key to solving this case is in the culprit's character.

323
00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:55.994
Character?

324
00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:58.194
What does that mean?

325
00:16:58.194 --> 00:17:00.994
The culprit moved the body,

326
00:17:00.994 --> 00:17:04.994
even though it didn't benefit them in any way.

327
00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:06.894
They deliberately left personal items

328
00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:10.594
at the murder scene and body's location

329
00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:15.294
because they needed Mr. Sazanami's car to move the body...

330
00:17:16.294 --> 00:17:18.494
so that along with the text document,

331
00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:21.194
all three of them would be suspects.

332
00:17:22.194 --> 00:17:25.694
To make it look like they'd been framed?

333
00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:27.594
There was that, of course,

334
00:17:27.594 --> 00:17:31.194
but the culprit's character required them to do it.

335
00:17:31.194 --> 00:17:32.494
What?

336
00:17:32.494 --> 00:17:34.094
If you look at their motive,

337
00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:36.694
it was clear they'd eventually fall under suspicion.

338
00:17:36.694 --> 00:17:41.194
Rather than fearing when the police would arrive at their door,

339
00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:44.894
they thought it'd be better to be identified right away.

340
00:17:44.894 --> 00:17:47.394
What kind of stupid logic is that?

341
00:17:47.394 --> 00:17:50.694
They're not stupid, they're weak.

342
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:52.494
So weak they relied on a fortune teller

343
00:17:52.494 --> 00:17:54.394
to make life decisions.

344
00:17:55.794 --> 00:17:58.794
So all three of them did it.

345
00:17:58.794 --> 00:18:00.594
Because the culprit was weak,

346
00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:02.994
they felt uneasy doing it alone.

347
00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:04.994
They wanted others beside them

348
00:18:04.994 --> 00:18:06.994
who were in the same situation,

349
00:18:06.994 --> 00:18:10.194
same motive, no alibi,

350
00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:12.794
and personal items left at the crime scene.

351
00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:15.394
Who is the culprit?

352
00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.794
They also used my name

353
00:18:16.794 --> 00:18:18.894
and got me involved because of their weakness.

354
00:18:18.894 --> 00:18:22.394
If the investigation dragged on,

355
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:25.694
the police would be forced to ask for my help.

356
00:18:25.694 --> 00:18:28.394
Rather than anxiously waiting to see

357
00:18:28.394 --> 00:18:30.094
when the great detective would turn up...

358
00:18:30.094 --> 00:18:32.794
It'd be better for you to be involved from the start?

359
00:18:32.794 --> 00:18:34.894
Exactly.

360
00:18:34.894 --> 00:18:37.694
And if I, a man trusted by the police,

361
00:18:37.694 --> 00:18:39.594
deduced that the three of them

362
00:18:39.594 --> 00:18:41.994
were framed by the true culprit,

363
00:18:41.994 --> 00:18:44.594
there would be no greater assurance.

364
00:18:44.594 --> 00:18:46.094
But, Mr. Mouri...

365
00:18:46.094 --> 00:18:49.994
There's no guarantee that you'd come to the desired conclusion.

366
00:18:49.994 --> 00:18:52.194
That's exactly the key point.

367
00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:53.194
-What? -What?

368
00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:56.194
A normal person wouldn't take that risk.

369
00:18:56.194 --> 00:18:59.994
But the culprit believed it would work.

370
00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:04.494
One of these three is simultaneously weak-willed

371
00:19:04.494 --> 00:19:07.794
but also incredibly confident.

372
00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:09.094
Right,

373
00:19:09.094 --> 00:19:10.794
Mr. Ryoichi Sazanami?

374
00:19:10.794 --> 00:19:11.894
What?

375
00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:13.394
It's him?

376
00:19:13.394 --> 00:19:15.394
No, no. It couldn't be me.

377
00:19:15.394 --> 00:19:18.994
Yesterday you called the victim,

378
00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:20.194
inviting them out.

379
00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:23.894
I am the Detective Kogori Mouri.

380
00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:27.194
I have something to discuss with Ms. Barbara Sadako.

381
00:19:27.194 --> 00:19:29.794
Then you called Mr. Kanawa and Ms. Endo

382
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.594
so they wouldn't have alibis.

383
00:19:33.594 --> 00:19:35.794
Ms. Sadako will be visiting you tonight

384
00:19:35.794 --> 00:19:37.094
to apologize for her fortune telling.

385
00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:38.894
Please wait at your home.

386
00:19:38.894 --> 00:19:42.794
Then you killed the victim in Shibahama Park.

387
00:19:42.794 --> 00:19:45.794
You left Mr. Kanawa's lighter at the scene of the murder,

388
00:19:45.794 --> 00:19:49.094
which you likely stole when you went to make a complaint.

389
00:19:49.094 --> 00:19:52.494
You used your allegedly stolen car

390
00:19:52.494 --> 00:19:54.794
to transport the body to the Baba mansion

391
00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:59.394
and left Ms. Endo's brooch, which you also stole, by the body.

392
00:19:59.394 --> 00:20:03.994
You also left the text document that would be discovered

393
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.694
during the course of the investigation then.

394
00:20:05.694 --> 00:20:08.694
The culprit set us up.

395
00:20:09.694 --> 00:20:11.094
After making that claim,

396
00:20:11.094 --> 00:20:14.794
you waited for the time of death to be determined.

397
00:20:14.794 --> 00:20:19.394
If one of them killed her, they'd never write this.

398
00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:24.294
You escaped into that blind spot and tried to get away

399
00:20:24.294 --> 00:20:28.394
while the police searched for a true culprit who didn't exist.

400
00:20:29.694 --> 00:20:33.894
Yes, so the case would never be solved.

401
00:20:33.894 --> 00:20:35.994
Weak-willed but confident?

402
00:20:35.994 --> 00:20:39.494
Now I'm the killer just because of my character?

403
00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:41.294
I have nothing to do with the case!

404
00:20:41.294 --> 00:20:45.794
Then how did you know the murder was committed here?

405
00:20:45.794 --> 00:20:47.194
There's no way for me to...

406
00:20:47.194 --> 00:20:49.394
You told us.

407
00:20:51.194 --> 00:20:53.494
You mean the anonymous call?

408
00:20:53.494 --> 00:20:57.394
I listened to the recording earlier.

409
00:20:57.394 --> 00:21:01.094
I saw a suspicious figure in Shibahama Park last night.

410
00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:04.194
I didn't make that call!

411
00:21:06.694 --> 00:21:07.794
I'll answer it.

412
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:12.094
Yeah, I'll let him know.

413
00:21:13.194 --> 00:21:14.694
They said it's a match.

414
00:21:16.794 --> 00:21:19.494
I had them compare your voices...

415
00:21:20.494 --> 00:21:23.394
after sending your voice to forensics.

416
00:21:24.394 --> 00:21:26.394
You made the call.

417
00:21:26.394 --> 00:21:28.494
You told us the scene of the murder,

418
00:21:28.494 --> 00:21:31.194
which only the culprit could've known.

419
00:21:31.194 --> 00:21:34.994
I dug my own grave with that phone call?

420
00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:37.794
But why did he make that call?

421
00:21:37.794 --> 00:21:39.794
He had to.

422
00:21:39.794 --> 00:21:42.794
Only once we discovered Mr. Kanawa's lighter

423
00:21:42.794 --> 00:21:44.794
left at the scene of the murder

424
00:21:44.794 --> 00:21:49.194
would all three of them be together.

425
00:21:50.194 --> 00:21:53.294
I felt hopeless without everyone here.

426
00:21:53.294 --> 00:21:56.694
So you admit you killed Ms. Barbara Sadako?

427
00:21:56.694 --> 00:21:58.894
If she'd properly told me my fortune,

428
00:21:58.894 --> 00:22:01.294
it would've succeeded!

429
00:22:01.294 --> 00:22:04.694
There's no way Alien Ramen wouldn't draw customers!

430
00:22:04.694 --> 00:22:06.594
Alien Ramen?

431
00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:11.194
Weak-willed but confident.

432
00:22:11.194 --> 00:22:13.094
What a character.

433
00:23:36.594 --> 00:23:41.294
Easily flattered, drunkard, and irresponsible...

434
00:23:41.294 --> 00:23:43.694
Huh? Who are you talking about?

435
00:23:43.694 --> 00:23:48.694
Does anyone that hopeless exist?

436
00:23:48.694 --> 00:23:51.094
Nope, nope.

437
00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:52.494
No self-awareness?

438
00:23:54.594 --> 00:23:55.794
"Next Episode" -Let's have an explosive time,

439
00:23:55.794 --> 00:23:57.994
just like we planned.

440
00:23:57.994 --> 00:24:00.494
If only Conan were here...

441
00:24:00.494 --> 00:24:02.694
Nicely done, Ayumi.

442
00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:04.594
You realized something important.

443
00:24:05.594 --> 00:24:08.894
What's the most important part of a police investigation?

444
00:24:10.794 --> 00:24:12.694
If you catch the bad guys,

445
00:24:12.694 --> 00:24:17.394
you might be rewared with lots of tasty food.

446
00:24:17.394 --> 00:24:18.394
What?

447
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:20.694
Next Conan,

448
00:24:20.694 --> 00:24:24.294
"Intrigue at the Food Court"

449
00:24:25.337 --> 00:24:27.437
Next Conan's Hint:

450
00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:29.237
"Star"

451
00:24:29.237 --> 00:24:31.137
Inspector, next time it will be "that".

452
00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:32.537
I'm a bit nervous.

453
00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.237
Somethings going to happen right?
