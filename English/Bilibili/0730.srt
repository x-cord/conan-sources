1
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:07,824
Look at this!

2
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:10,424
This fantastic figurine!

3
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:14,424
These beautiful numbers of georamas!

4
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:16,324
This is super!

5
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:17,624
You think so, don't you? Don't you?

6
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,124
The creator is Mr. Masahiro Kitajima!

7
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:24,024
He's the most focused on plastic figurine creator now.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,424
I can't really tell what's so good about it,

9
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,924
because it's so small and neatly arranged.

10
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,224
How wretched that you

11
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:31,824
don't understand this technique.

12
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,524
How about you, Conan?

13
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:36,224
I don't know about trains and stuff

14
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:39,324
but the georamas sure are great.

15
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:42,524
Each and every branch is a perfect replica.

16
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:44,424
Just as would be expected of you, Conan!

17
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:49,024
Mr. Kitajima is known as a genius plastic art creator of nature.

18
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:51,624
On top of that, his exhibition work for this year's World Tournament

19
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,124
has already been decided on!

20
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:55,824
Mr. Kitajima!

21
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:58,324
You're Mr. Masahiro Kitajima, aren't you?

22
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,824
How can you make such splendid figurines like these?

23
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:03,424
"Masahiro Kitajima (27), Pro-modeler" -Well...

24
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:05,124
"Masahiro Kitajima (27), Pro-modeler" -I guess it's imagery.

25
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:07,724
The richer the image I have,

26
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,824
the better figurine I come up with.

27
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,524
I see, so it's image.

28
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,424
Masahiro!

29
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:17,524
"Reika Kameyama (26), Kitajima's lover" -Reika, you've come.

30
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:20,124
It's a big day for you after all.

31
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:23,424
Cut it out, people are watching.

32
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:26,024
Hey, hey, you guys.

33
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:28,024
Come look at my figure characters too.

34
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:32,424
Wow, how pretty.

35
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:35,224
The colors are so beautiful.

36
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:37,324
Yes. I guess so.

37
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:39,424
"Shunichi Morishita (25), Pro-modeler" -I think you already know

38
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,624
but this is the most popular robot anime around now.

39
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:45,824
I stayed up all night to make it.

40
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:47,324
Fantastic, don't you think?

41
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,424
How childish.

42
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:54,224
Yes, on this day, at this convention hall,

43
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:57,024
the Plastic Model Figurine Festival was being held.

44
00:01:57,024 --> 00:02:00,924
We came to watch this festival.

45
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,224
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

46
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,024
are slashed by the light of deduction.

47
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:19,924
A crime is committed at the event hall.

48
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:21,924
The secret of the figurines is pursued.

49
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,324
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:25,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:27,824
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:05,712
"A Much Too Perfect Figurine"

53
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,912
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

54
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:12,912
Let's go home already! I'm hungry!

55
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,512
Please wait.

56
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,312
I wonder what color would match

57
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,512
the "Masked Yaiba" that I'm making now.

58
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,412
Somebody!

59
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,112
Conan!

60
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,612
Hey, Conan.

61
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,412
One stab right through the chest.

62
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:42,612
He's...

63
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,812
Mr. Kitajima?

64
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,012
Hold it!

65
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,012
Move!

66
00:04:57,712 --> 00:04:59,912
Are you all right? Ai, Ayumi!

67
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:03,912
Yes, I'm fine! Ai saved me.

68
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:06,512
Geez, shape up.

69
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:08,012
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,612
You heard the lady scream,

71
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,812
so you ran over and found Mr. Kitajima lying on the floor here.

72
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,712
Is that right?

73
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:21,512
Yeah, we found him.

74
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:24,712
The victim is Mr. Masahiro Kitajima.

75
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:28,712
Yes. He's one of Japan's top plastic art modelers!

76
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,112
Top modeler?

77
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:34,912
He's a professional at making plastic models.

78
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,712
Okay, okay, I got it.

79
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,912
You children go home for today, all right.

80
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:44,912
Come on, we even nabbed the perp too!

81
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,912
You mean Ai did.

82
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:48,412
Inspector Megure!

83
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,612
I have Mr. Hiroto here with me.

84
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:56,512
It's him! I'm sure he's the perp!

85
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:01,612
"Kenji Hiroto (32), Model Magazine Reporter" -He is Mr. Kenji Hiroto.

86
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,612
He says he's an editor for a plastic model toys magazine.

87
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,612
Is that correct?

88
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:09,512
Yeah, like I told you

89
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:13,112
I just came to interview Kitajima!

90
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,212
Then, why did you run away?

91
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,612
I was shocked. So I...

92
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:23,512
I mean, after all, to see Kitajima like that...

93
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:26,612
He's not the one?

94
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:30,412
No. He didn't have the murder weapon on him.

95
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:33,112
By the way, Dr. Agasa,

96
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:37,412
I think that this is something not good for children to see.

97
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:38,612
I understand.

98
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,412
Come on all of you, let's go home.

99
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:42,412
Come, come...

100
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:44,412
-This is just the beginning. -How lame...

101
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,012
I'm sorry, all of you.

102
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,912
Officer Takagi.

103
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:53,612
How long has Mr. Kitajima been dead from the time we found him?

104
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,712
Just a few minutes I guess.

105
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,212
Was he killed by a sharp knife after all?

106
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:02,512
Yeah, it seems to be a knife of some sort...

107
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,212
You haven't found it yet?

108
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:07,712
No, though we've been looking for it right through.

109
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:10,212
The woman clerk who came to serve them didn't have anything either?

110
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:13,012
She had nothing of that sort on her.

111
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:17,112
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet.

112
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,812
I just know that he's the perp!

113
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:22,212
I wonder about that.

114
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:24,112
If it was only a matter of a few minutes

115
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,912
from when Mr. Kitajima was killed to the time he was discovered...

116
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,912
If that person's the perp,

117
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:32,312
it's highly likely that he has the murder weapon on him.

118
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:35,512
Or he may have hid it somewhere nearby.

119
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,112
But, it hasn't come out from anywhere.

120
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,612
I see.

121
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:41,512
I wonder where the murder weapon disappeared to?

122
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:43,412
Officer.

123
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,612
What should I do?

124
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:47,712
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:50,412
The Inspector would like to have a word with you,

126
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:52,212
so please wait a little while more.

127
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,312
The man who makes robots!

128
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,012
So you guys are here too.

129
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,912
What's the matter, sir?

130
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:03,312
Well, I was in the waiting room on the other side right through.

131
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,712
Then, I heard some commotion,

132
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:08,212
and when I went out, the person in charge was there,

133
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:11,612
saying that something terrible had happened to Mr. Kitajima.

134
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,812
And were you with the person in charge right through?

135
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:20,512
Yeah, he was with that person right through.

136
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:23,312
Was there a knife near Mr. Morishita?

137
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:27,212
No, not anything from him nor the waiting room.

138
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:29,312
He's not the one either?

139
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,012
Morishita.

140
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,912
Mr. Hiroto.

141
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:39,512
Aren't you the one who killed Mr. Kitajima, Mr. Hiroto?

142
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,012
-What? -What the...

143
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:44,612
I mean your interviews are the pits.

144
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,312
You take the figurines with you without permission

145
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,612
and touch them even if you're told not to touch them.

146
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,812
Mr. Kitajima was going around telling all the other modelers

147
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:55,012
not to accept interviews with you!

148
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,212
Talk for yourself, Morishita.

149
00:08:57,212 --> 00:08:59,212
You're just as suspicious, you know.

150
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:03,312
I hear that you borrowed a lot of cash from Kitajima!

151
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,312
I heard that you haven't been able to pay him back for years,

152
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,612
and were even crying your eyes out lately.

153
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:11,112
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

154
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:12,712
Masahiro!

155
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:15,512
Is it really true? That Masahiro was killed?

156
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:18,612
-Hey, miss. -Masahiro, Masahiro!

157
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:20,912
Masahiro!

158
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,612
How could something like this have happened?

159
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,812
The real killer appears.

160
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:30,512
It's you two, Mr. Hiroto and Mr. Morishita too,

161
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:33,312
I'll bet you two are the perps.

162
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,312
Give me a break.

163
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,512
I hear that you were having a tough time lately

164
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:40,012
because he wanted to break up with you.

165
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,912
We're not breaking up.

166
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,212
No way.

167
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:47,212
I was going to get married with Masahiro, you know!

168
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,812
I wonder about that!

169
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,712
You heard about it too, right, Morishita?

170
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,212
Oh, well, sort of.

171
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,012
You people!

172
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,312
Doctor, take the children.

173
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,012
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:02,812
-Come on, let's go! Come, come. -What? Come on, doctor.

175
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,712
Hurry, we're going home.

176
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:07,912
It was just starting and yet.

177
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:11,712
I thought that we could corner the perp, and yet...

178
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,012
Where's Conan?

179
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:20,212
Ms. Reika Kameyama.

180
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:23,812
Where were you when the incident happened?

181
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:25,712
I was out.

182
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,412
After I met him at the hall,

183
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:30,712
I got a text mail from Masahiro.

184
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:34,712
To wait for him at the open lot by the river near the hall.

185
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:37,812
But, he didn't show up no matter how long I waited,

186
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:40,012
so I came over to his waiting room

187
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,812
and this is what I see.

188
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:44,712
It's true that a text mail was sent

189
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,912
from Mr. Kitajima's cell phone to Reika.

190
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,312
11:25 am.

191
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,912
That's 10 minutes before the crime occurred.

192
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:59,112
Which means that Mr. Kitajima was killed after he texted this mail.

193
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,412
Conan.

194
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:05,012
The police officers are?

195
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:08,312
Yeah, there's commotion over there.

196
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:09,312
How is it?

197
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,812
I can't reach it.

198
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,112
Officer, what happened?

199
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,712
Something seems to be stuck between the vending machine and the wall,

200
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,212
but we can't get it out.

201
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,012
I think I can get it out because I'm small.

202
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:24,212
Leave it to me.

203
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:33,212
So, that's it.

204
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:34,612
Genta, a handkerchief!

205
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,512
Yeah!

206
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:41,112
Okay! Here goes!

207
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,512
Okay! Good work, Genta!

208
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:47,612
Yeah!

209
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,212
This is...

210
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,412
Blood stain?

211
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,021
Ms. Kameyama.

212
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,521
Does this broche look familiar to you?

213
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:18,121
Yes, it's mine.

214
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,321
There was a little blood on it.

215
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:25,921
According to forensics it's unmistakably, Mr. Kitajima's blood.

216
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:28,921
Oh no, I've been missing that broche from yesterday.

217
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:31,721
Right, I haven't seen it since yesterday.

218
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,721
Since when yesterday?

219
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:34,821
Last night.

220
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,621
I brought a bouquet of flowers to congratulate him.

221
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,721
Ever since then.

222
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,021
Excuse me.

223
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,921
I just remembered

224
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:47,821
but the thing is I saw you.

225
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:51,321
No. Never, I'll never part with you!

226
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,921
I'm going to go out in to the world

227
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,021
and make my name as a modeler.

228
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,121
You're just getting in my way!

229
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:00,121
No.

230
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,421
Did you have that in mind to begin with?

231
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:06,721
How cruel.

232
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,021
I'm never going to forgive you!

233
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,321
I'll kill you!

234
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:15,521
Is that correct, Ms. Kameyama?

235
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,421
True, I did say that.

236
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,721
But, I didn't do it!

237
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:24,821
So, you're the one who killed him after all.

238
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,021
In other words, is this how it went?

239
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,721
You received his mail,

240
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,821
got scared because he wanted to split with you

241
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,521
and so you went to the waiting room.

242
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,521
But you only ended up getting into an argument again.

243
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:48,421
After that you went out of the hall right away,

244
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,321
pretended to wait for Kitajima

245
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,421
and threw the murder weapon into the river!

246
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,821
I see.

247
00:13:53,821 --> 00:14:00,021
Ms. Kameyama, it seems I need to hear a little more from you.

248
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,421
Oh no. I didn't do it!

249
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:11,721
So, that woman's the killer.

250
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,621
But it's a little vexing, isn't it?

251
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:15,021
I guess so.

252
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,921
They treated us like children to the very end.

253
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:21,921
Darn, I going to take my anger out on dinner!

254
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:25,021
The broche, splattered blood...

255
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,821
Something's strange after all.

256
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,221
Hey, you guys.

257
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:44,021
Great footwork, young lady.

258
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,721
Thank you.

259
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,021
What's with you?

260
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,721
Did you come to take revenge, or what?

261
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,021
Stop it.

262
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:52,521
I'm not taking him on.

263
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:55,121
I may look all right, but the fact is I'm depressed.

264
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:57,821
After all, I let a scandal go by.

265
00:14:57,821 --> 00:15:01,921
Scandal? Are you referring to Mr. Kitajima?

266
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,321
Sir, what is this scandal you're talking about?

267
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,621
Hey, this has nothing to do with you kids.

268
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:08,621
See you.

269
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,621
Okay, okay.

270
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,621
Please wait!

271
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,021
That is it?

272
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:20,121
Mr. Kitajima was a hero for these children.

273
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,121
If he had any hidden secrets,

274
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,621
will please tell them about it?

275
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:29,121
Dreams are best kept dreams.

276
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:35,021
No. I think it'll do these children more good to know the truth.

277
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,621
Well, why not?

278
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,321
He already passed away.

279
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,921
The thing is, there were rumors going around

280
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,321
that maybe Kitajima had a ghost modeler.

281
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,721
A ghost modeler?

282
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:50,921
Yeah. His natural landscapes creations

283
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:53,921
were masterpieces when compared with other modelers.

284
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:59,221
But it wasn't that he was like that to begin with.

285
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:02,721
Only, in these past few years he suddenly...

286
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,121
On top of that,

287
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:07,621
nobody's ever seen him making the figurines in person.

288
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:08,721
I see.

289
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,421
So, you were hiding in that waiting room

290
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:13,421
to confirm whether the rumor was true or not?

291
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:14,421
Yeah.

292
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,121
Right.

293
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:21,421
It's been bothering me from the start.

294
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,521
Since the time I came to this hall.

295
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,321
Conan, what's the matter?

296
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,221
Could this be it...

297
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,521
Mitsuhiko, doesn't this color look similar

298
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,721
to the color used for Mr. Kitajima's georama?

299
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,521
It's Masked Yaiba!

300
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,621
I'm using the same color

301
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,821
for the masked Yaiba that I'm making now too.

302
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,121
So, the finish is...

303
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:47,821
Yes, no mistake about it.

304
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,321
It's the same color.

305
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:52,321
I see. So, that's the story.

306
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:55,321
You're all still here?

307
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,221
Hurry on home.

308
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:01,421
Like I said, Dr. Agasa.

309
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,321
What is this, gathering everybody here like this?

310
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:08,421
I'm sorry. I know it's really sudden but...

311
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:11,621
There are several things that keep bothering me

312
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,621
as to the crime that occurred.

313
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:16,321
First of all, it's Reika's broche

314
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:19,021
that was found on the floor of the corridor.

315
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,521
Mr. Kitajima's blood was found on the broche.

316
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:25,421
But, please take a good look at her clothes.

317
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,021
There is no blood on it at all.

318
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:30,221
Do you think it's possible

319
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:34,621
that splattered blood would pinpoint just the broche?

320
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:38,521
Then, are you saying that someone left

321
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,521
the broche with blood stain on it to frame her?

322
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,221
But, that's no very likely.

323
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:47,221
And there's another strange thing.

324
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:50,321
Mr. Morishita, it's about you.

325
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:51,921
Me?

326
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:55,621
Yes, when I first met you.

327
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,621
This is the most popular robot anime around now.

328
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:01,421
You explained that you were working all night making a piece,

329
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:03,521
and your clothes were soiled with paint.

330
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:05,421
Yes, the one you're wearing.

331
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,921
However...

332
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,821
Please take a look at that robot.

333
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,221
It's what Mr. Morishita made.

334
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,921
The colors are vivid.

335
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:21,821
The colors are completely different from the color on his clothes.

336
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:23,621
Why is that?

337
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:26,521
Inside Mr. Morishita's paint case

338
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,121
there was paint the same color as the stain on his clothes.

339
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,921
It's this!

340
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:35,321
This color is for some reason

341
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:39,321
the same as the color used for Mr. Kitajima's georama.

342
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:44,821
There were rumors going around that Mr. Kitajima had a ghost modeler.

343
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:50,221
Mr. Morishita, isn't it you who was ghost modeling for him?

344
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,521
That's right.

345
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,521
He was making me do it!

346
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:55,321
My mother is ill,

347
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,721
so I borrowed money from Kitajima.

348
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,721
But, because of his outrageous interest my debt ballooned to no end

349
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,321
and I couldn't pay him back!

350
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,521
Then, he tells me...

351
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,621
If so, Morishita...

352
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:10,921
make my pieces for me too, okay?

353
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,521
Moreover, Mr. Kitajima was preparing

354
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,421
to enter the world tournament with your figurines.

355
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,521
Of course you'd feel bad about it, wouldn't you?

356
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:22,321
That's why you killed Mr. Kitajima.

357
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,921
No! That, and this case is totally not connected!

358
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,221
However...

359
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:31,721
if it were so, everything falls perfectly into place.

360
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:38,021
Last night, you coincidentally saw Mr. Kitajima and Reika arguing.

361
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,721
Back then, you picked up the broche

362
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,021
that Reika dropped in the corridor.

363
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:49,021
Today, you killed Mr. Kitajima,

364
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,221
smeared the broche with his blood

365
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:54,921
and threw it inside behind the vending machine in the corridor.

366
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:58,621
In order to frame Reika up as the perp!

367
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:02,221
Of course you lured Reika out by texting her mail,

368
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:06,221
and didn't forget to make sure you had an alibi too.

369
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,421
Please cut it out already.

370
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,821
You should never take something so ridiculous seriously.

371
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,621
I didn't do it.

372
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:21,521
Right, the murder weapon!

373
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,521
Where's the murder weapon?

374
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:26,421
I didn't have anything like that on me, you know!

375
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:32,621
Mr. Kitajima was known as a genius for making natural landscape.

376
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,221
But that was actually really about you,

377
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:38,221
his ghost modeler, wasn't it?

378
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:43,321
This color was found in your paint case.

379
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,321
Natural light green.

380
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:48,121
It's used for Masked Yaiba, so I know it!

381
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,521
There's one thing in this room

382
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:52,521
of the same color that is from nature.

383
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,721
Can you tell what is it, everyone?

384
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,121
Over there!

385
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,021
I'm never going to forgive you!

386
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,221
I'll kill you!

387
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:11,221
Mr. Kitajima said...

388
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,721
that the important thing when making figurines

389
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:17,221
is to have rich images.

390
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:20,521
That's why you imagined too, didn't you, Mr. Morishita?

391
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:24,521
When you saw the flowers that Reika brought.

392
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,521
I see.

393
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:36,921
He painted paint onto the blade to begin with,

394
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,121
and committed the crime.

395
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:41,921
It's all Kitajima's fault!

396
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:45,921
He asked me to ghost model for him, that's why I...

397
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:49,321
I'm not to blame!

398
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:15,121
Everybody complimented us so much.

399
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:17,721
And, besides, they gave us all these plastic model toys.

400
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:21,521
All ended well. But...

401
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,121
Okay!

402
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:25,321
Conan, thanks!

403
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,321
I've already made Yaiba.

404
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:30,921
After making the plastic model, I'm hungry!

405
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,321
Food! Food!

406
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,821
Hey, come on, make it yourselves!

407
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:39,821
Making 4 or 5 wouldn't make much difference, would it?

408
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,321
Food. Food.

409
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,421
You guys!

410
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,121
I guess 6th won't hurt then.

411
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,421
Come on!

412
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,821
For you.

413
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:57,321
Don't open it until I get a hold of all seven of them.

414
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,221
What? Somebody is dead?

415
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,421
This is undoubtedly a suicide.

416
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:05,321
No.

417
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:07,121
It could be homicide, you know?

418
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:13,321
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

419
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,821
If I'm not mistaken...

420
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,321
Next Conan,

421
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:21,221
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 1)"

422
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,421
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,221
"Will".

424
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,021
-A will. When you have four... -Four wills.

425
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:45,121
-Dr. Agasa's quiz is funny. -Right?

426
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,221
My tougue slipped.
