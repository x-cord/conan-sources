1
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:07.824
Look at this!

2
00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.424
This fantastic figurine!

3
00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:14.424
These beautiful numbers of georamas!

4
00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:16.324
This is super!

5
00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:17.624
You think so, don't you? Don't you?

6
00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:20.124
The creator is Mr. Masahiro Kitajima!

7
00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:24.024
He's the most focused on plastic figurine creator now.

8
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.424
I can't really tell what's so good about it,

9
00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.924
because it's so small and neatly arranged.

10
00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:29.224
How wretched that you

11
00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:31.824
don't understand this technique.

12
00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.524
How about you, Conan?

13
00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:36.224
I don't know about trains and stuff

14
00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:39.324
but the georamas sure are great.

15
00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:42.524
Each and every branch is a perfect replica.

16
00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.424
Just as would be expected of you, Conan!

17
00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:49.024
Mr. Kitajima is known as a genius plastic art creator of nature.

18
00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:51.624
On top of that, his exhibition work for this year's World Tournament

19
00:00:51.624 --> 00:00:53.124
has already been decided on!

20
00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:55.824
Mr. Kitajima!

21
00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:58.324
You're Mr. Masahiro Kitajima, aren't you?

22
00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.824
How can you make such splendid figurines like these?

23
00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:03.424
"Masahiro Kitajima (27), Pro-modeler" -Well...

24
00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:05.124
"Masahiro Kitajima (27), Pro-modeler" -I guess it's imagery.

25
00:01:05.124 --> 00:01:07.724
The richer the image I have,

26
00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:09.824
the better figurine I come up with.

27
00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:12.524
I see, so it's image.

28
00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:14.424
Masahiro!

29
00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:17.524
"Reika Kameyama (26), Kitajima's lover" -Reika, you've come.

30
00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:20.124
It's a big day for you after all.

31
00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:23.424
Cut it out, people are watching.

32
00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:26.024
Hey, hey, you guys.

33
00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:28.024
Come look at my figure characters too.

34
00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.424
Wow, how pretty.

35
00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:35.224
The colors are so beautiful.

36
00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:37.324
Yes. I guess so.

37
00:01:37.324 --> 00:01:39.424
"Shunichi Morishita (25), Pro-modeler" -I think you already know

38
00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:42.624
but this is the most popular robot anime around now.

39
00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:45.824
I stayed up all night to make it.

40
00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:47.324
Fantastic, don't you think?

41
00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:50.424
How childish.

42
00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:54.224
Yes, on this day, at this convention hall,

43
00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:57.024
the Plastic Model Figurine Festival was being held.

44
00:01:57.024 --> 00:02:00.924
We came to watch this festival.

45
00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:16.224
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

46
00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:18.024
are slashed by the light of deduction.

47
00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:19.924
A crime is committed at the event hall.

48
00:02:19.924 --> 00:02:21.924
The secret of the figurines is pursued.

49
00:02:21.924 --> 00:02:23.324
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:25.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:25.424 --> 00:02:27.824
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:05.712
"A Much Too Perfect Figurine"

53
00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:09.912
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

54
00:04:09.912 --> 00:04:12.912
Let's go home already! I'm hungry!

55
00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:14.512
Please wait.

56
00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:16.312
I wonder what color would match

57
00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:18.512
the "Masked Yaiba" that I'm making now.

58
00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:21.412
Somebody!

59
00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.112
Conan!

60
00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:36.612
Hey, Conan.

61
00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.412
One stab right through the chest.

62
00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:42.612
He's...

63
00:04:44.312 --> 00:04:45.812
Mr. Kitajima?

64
00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:49.012
Hold it!

65
00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:50.012
Move!

66
00:04:57.712 --> 00:04:59.912
Are you all right? Ai, Ayumi!

67
00:04:59.912 --> 00:05:03.912
Yes, I'm fine! Ai saved me.

68
00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:06.512
Geez, shape up.

69
00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:08.012
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:05:09.712 --> 00:05:12.612
You heard the lady scream,

71
00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:16.812
so you ran over and found Mr. Kitajima lying on the floor here.

72
00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:18.712
Is that right?

73
00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:21.512
Yeah, we found him.

74
00:05:21.512 --> 00:05:24.712
The victim is Mr. Masahiro Kitajima.

75
00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:28.712
Yes. He's one of Japan's top plastic art modelers!

76
00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:32.112
Top modeler?

77
00:05:32.112 --> 00:05:34.912
He's a professional at making plastic models.

78
00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:38.712
Okay, okay, I got it.

79
00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:40.912
You children go home for today, all right.

80
00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:44.912
Come on, we even nabbed the perp too!

81
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.912
You mean Ai did.

82
00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:48.412
Inspector Megure!

83
00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:50.612
I have Mr. Hiroto here with me.

84
00:05:52.912 --> 00:05:56.512
It's him! I'm sure he's the perp!

85
00:05:59.112 --> 00:06:01.612
"Kenji Hiroto (32), Model Magazine Reporter" -He is Mr. Kenji Hiroto.

86
00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:04.612
He says he's an editor for a plastic model toys magazine.

87
00:06:04.612 --> 00:06:06.612
Is that correct?

88
00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:09.512
Yeah, like I told you

89
00:06:09.512 --> 00:06:13.112
I just came to interview Kitajima!

90
00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:16.212
Then, why did you run away?

91
00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:19.612
I was shocked. So I...

92
00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:23.512
I mean, after all, to see Kitajima like that...

93
00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:26.612
He's not the one?

94
00:06:26.612 --> 00:06:30.412
No. He didn't have the murder weapon on him.

95
00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:33.112
By the way, Dr. Agasa,

96
00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:37.412
I think that this is something not good for children to see.

97
00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:38.612
I understand.

98
00:06:38.612 --> 00:06:40.412
Come on all of you, let's go home.

99
00:06:41.412 --> 00:06:42.412
Come, come...

100
00:06:42.412 --> 00:06:44.412
-This is just the beginning. -How lame...

101
00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.012
I'm sorry, all of you.

102
00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:47.912
Officer Takagi.

103
00:06:47.912 --> 00:06:53.612
How long has Mr. Kitajima been dead from the time we found him?

104
00:06:54.812 --> 00:06:56.712
Just a few minutes I guess.

105
00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:59.212
Was he killed by a sharp knife after all?

106
00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:02.512
Yeah, it seems to be a knife of some sort...

107
00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:04.212
You haven't found it yet?

108
00:07:04.212 --> 00:07:07.712
No, though we've been looking for it right through.

109
00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:10.212
The woman clerk who came to serve them didn't have anything either?

110
00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:13.012
She had nothing of that sort on her.

111
00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:17.112
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet.

112
00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:19.812
I just know that he's the perp!

113
00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:22.212
I wonder about that.

114
00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:24.112
If it was only a matter of a few minutes

115
00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:25.912
from when Mr. Kitajima was killed to the time he was discovered...

116
00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:27.912
If that person's the perp,

117
00:07:27.912 --> 00:07:32.312
it's highly likely that he has the murder weapon on him.

118
00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:35.512
Or he may have hid it somewhere nearby.

119
00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:37.112
But, it hasn't come out from anywhere.

120
00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:38.612
I see.

121
00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:41.512
I wonder where the murder weapon disappeared to?

122
00:07:41.512 --> 00:07:43.412
Officer.

123
00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:45.612
What should I do?

124
00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:47.712
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:50.412
The Inspector would like to have a word with you,

126
00:07:50.412 --> 00:07:52.212
so please wait a little while more.

127
00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:54.312
The man who makes robots!

128
00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:57.012
So you guys are here too.

129
00:07:57.012 --> 00:07:58.912
What's the matter, sir?

130
00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:03.312
Well, I was in the waiting room on the other side right through.

131
00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:05.712
Then, I heard some commotion,

132
00:08:05.712 --> 00:08:08.212
and when I went out, the person in charge was there,

133
00:08:08.212 --> 00:08:11.612
saying that something terrible had happened to Mr. Kitajima.

134
00:08:11.612 --> 00:08:14.812
And were you with the person in charge right through?

135
00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:20.512
Yeah, he was with that person right through.

136
00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:23.312
Was there a knife near Mr. Morishita?

137
00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:27.212
No, not anything from him nor the waiting room.

138
00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:29.312
He's not the one either?

139
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:33.012
Morishita.

140
00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.912
Mr. Hiroto.

141
00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:39.512
Aren't you the one who killed Mr. Kitajima, Mr. Hiroto?

142
00:08:39.512 --> 00:08:42.012
-What? -What the...

143
00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:44.612
I mean your interviews are the pits.

144
00:08:44.612 --> 00:08:46.312
You take the figurines with you without permission

145
00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.612
and touch them even if you're told not to touch them.

146
00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:50.812
Mr. Kitajima was going around telling all the other modelers

147
00:08:50.812 --> 00:08:55.012
not to accept interviews with you!

148
00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:57.212
Talk for yourself, Morishita.

149
00:08:57.212 --> 00:08:59.212
You're just as suspicious, you know.

150
00:08:59.212 --> 00:09:03.312
I hear that you borrowed a lot of cash from Kitajima!

151
00:09:03.312 --> 00:09:05.312
I heard that you haven't been able to pay him back for years,

152
00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:08.612
and were even crying your eyes out lately.

153
00:09:08.612 --> 00:09:11.112
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

154
00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:12.712
Masahiro!

155
00:09:12.712 --> 00:09:15.512
Is it really true? That Masahiro was killed?

156
00:09:15.512 --> 00:09:18.612
-Hey, miss. -Masahiro, Masahiro!

157
00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:20.912
Masahiro!

158
00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:22.612
How could something like this have happened?

159
00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:24.812
The real killer appears.

160
00:09:26.412 --> 00:09:30.512
It's you two, Mr. Hiroto and Mr. Morishita too,

161
00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:33.312
I'll bet you two are the perps.

162
00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:35.312
Give me a break.

163
00:09:35.312 --> 00:09:37.512
I hear that you were having a tough time lately

164
00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:40.012
because he wanted to break up with you.

165
00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.912
We're not breaking up.

166
00:09:41.912 --> 00:09:43.212
No way.

167
00:09:43.212 --> 00:09:47.212
I was going to get married with Masahiro, you know!

168
00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.812
I wonder about that!

169
00:09:48.812 --> 00:09:51.712
You heard about it too, right, Morishita?

170
00:09:53.212 --> 00:09:54.212
Oh, well, sort of.

171
00:09:54.212 --> 00:09:56.012
You people!

172
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.312
Doctor, take the children.

173
00:09:58.312 --> 00:10:00.012
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:00.012 --> 00:10:02.812
-Come on, let's go! Come, come. -What? Come on, doctor.

175
00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:05.712
Hurry, we're going home.

176
00:10:05.712 --> 00:10:07.912
It was just starting and yet.

177
00:10:07.912 --> 00:10:11.712
I thought that we could corner the perp, and yet...

178
00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.012
Where's Conan?

179
00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:20.212
Ms. Reika Kameyama.

180
00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:23.812
Where were you when the incident happened?

181
00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:25.712
I was out.

182
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:27.412
After I met him at the hall,

183
00:10:27.412 --> 00:10:30.712
I got a text mail from Masahiro.

184
00:10:30.712 --> 00:10:34.712
To wait for him at the open lot by the river near the hall.

185
00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:37.812
But, he didn't show up no matter how long I waited,

186
00:10:37.812 --> 00:10:40.012
so I came over to his waiting room

187
00:10:40.012 --> 00:10:41.812
and this is what I see.

188
00:10:41.812 --> 00:10:44.712
It's true that a text mail was sent

189
00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:47.912
from Mr. Kitajima's cell phone to Reika.

190
00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:50.312
11:25 am.

191
00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:52.912
That's 10 minutes before the crime occurred.

192
00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:59.112
Which means that Mr. Kitajima was killed after he texted this mail.

193
00:11:01.212 --> 00:11:02.412
Conan.

194
00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:05.012
The police officers are?

195
00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:08.312
Yeah, there's commotion over there.

196
00:11:08.312 --> 00:11:09.312
How is it?

197
00:11:09.312 --> 00:11:10.812
I can't reach it.

198
00:11:10.812 --> 00:11:13.112
Officer, what happened?

199
00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:18.712
Something seems to be stuck between the vending machine and the wall,

200
00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:20.212
but we can't get it out.

201
00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:23.012
I think I can get it out because I'm small.

202
00:11:23.012 --> 00:11:24.212
Leave it to me.

203
00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:33.212
So, that's it.

204
00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:34.612
Genta, a handkerchief!

205
00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:36.512
Yeah!

206
00:11:38.912 --> 00:11:41.112
Okay! Here goes!

207
00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:46.512
Okay! Good work, Genta!

208
00:11:46.512 --> 00:11:47.612
Yeah!

209
00:11:54.012 --> 00:11:55.212
This is...

210
00:11:56.812 --> 00:11:58.412
Blood stain?

211
00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:11.021
Ms. Kameyama.

212
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.521
Does this broche look familiar to you?

213
00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.121
Yes, it's mine.

214
00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:20.321
There was a little blood on it.

215
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:25.921
According to forensics it's unmistakably, Mr. Kitajima's blood.

216
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:28.921
Oh no, I've been missing that broche from yesterday.

217
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:31.721
Right, I haven't seen it since yesterday.

218
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:33.721
Since when yesterday?

219
00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:34.821
Last night.

220
00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:37.621
I brought a bouquet of flowers to congratulate him.

221
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:39.721
Ever since then.

222
00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:41.021
Excuse me.

223
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.921
I just remembered

224
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:47.821
but the thing is I saw you.

225
00:12:47.821 --> 00:12:51.321
No. Never, I'll never part with you!

226
00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:53.921
I'm going to go out in to the world

227
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:56.021
and make my name as a modeler.

228
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:58.121
You're just getting in my way!

229
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:00.121
No.

230
00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:02.421
Did you have that in mind to begin with?

231
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:06.721
How cruel.

232
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.021
I'm never going to forgive you!

233
00:13:10.021 --> 00:13:11.321
I'll kill you!

234
00:13:12.421 --> 00:13:15.521
Is that correct, Ms. Kameyama?

235
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.421
True, I did say that.

236
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:20.721
But, I didn't do it!

237
00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:24.821
So, you're the one who killed him after all.

238
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:27.021
In other words, is this how it went?

239
00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:28.721
You received his mail,

240
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:30.821
got scared because he wanted to split with you

241
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:32.521
and so you went to the waiting room.

242
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.521
But you only ended up getting into an argument again.

243
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:48.421
After that you went out of the hall right away,

244
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:50.321
pretended to wait for Kitajima

245
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.421
and threw the murder weapon into the river!

246
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:53.821
I see.

247
00:13:53.821 --> 00:14:00.021
Ms. Kameyama, it seems I need to hear a little more from you.

248
00:14:00.021 --> 00:14:02.421
Oh no. I didn't do it!

249
00:14:09.021 --> 00:14:11.721
So, that woman's the killer.

250
00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:13.621
But it's a little vexing, isn't it?

251
00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:15.021
I guess so.

252
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.921
They treated us like children to the very end.

253
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:21.921
Darn, I going to take my anger out on dinner!

254
00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:25.021
The broche, splattered blood...

255
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:38.821
Something's strange after all.

256
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:41.221
Hey, you guys.

257
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:44.021
Great footwork, young lady.

258
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:45.721
Thank you.

259
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.021
What's with you?

260
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:48.721
Did you come to take revenge, or what?

261
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.021
Stop it.

262
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:52.521
I'm not taking him on.

263
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:55.121
I may look all right, but the fact is I'm depressed.

264
00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:57.821
After all, I let a scandal go by.

265
00:14:57.821 --> 00:15:01.921
Scandal? Are you referring to Mr. Kitajima?

266
00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:04.321
Sir, what is this scandal you're talking about?

267
00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:07.621
Hey, this has nothing to do with you kids.

268
00:15:07.621 --> 00:15:08.621
See you.

269
00:15:10.321 --> 00:15:12.621
Okay, okay.

270
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.621
Please wait!

271
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:16.021
That is it?

272
00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:20.121
Mr. Kitajima was a hero for these children.

273
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:23.121
If he had any hidden secrets,

274
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:25.621
will please tell them about it?

275
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:29.121
Dreams are best kept dreams.

276
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:35.021
No. I think it'll do these children more good to know the truth.

277
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:36.621
Well, why not?

278
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:39.321
He already passed away.

279
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:43.921
The thing is, there were rumors going around

280
00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:46.321
that maybe Kitajima had a ghost modeler.

281
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.721
A ghost modeler?

282
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:50.921
Yeah. His natural landscapes creations

283
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:53.921
were masterpieces when compared with other modelers.

284
00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:59.221
But it wasn't that he was like that to begin with.

285
00:15:59.221 --> 00:16:02.721
Only, in these past few years he suddenly...

286
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:04.121
On top of that,

287
00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:07.621
nobody's ever seen him making the figurines in person.

288
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:08.721
I see.

289
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:11.421
So, you were hiding in that waiting room

290
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:13.421
to confirm whether the rumor was true or not?

291
00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:14.421
Yeah.

292
00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:19.121
Right.

293
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:21.421
It's been bothering me from the start.

294
00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:23.521
Since the time I came to this hall.

295
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:29.321
Conan, what's the matter?

296
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.221
Could this be it...

297
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:34.521
Mitsuhiko, doesn't this color look similar

298
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:37.721
to the color used for Mr. Kitajima's georama?

299
00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:39.521
It's Masked Yaiba!

300
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:41.621
I'm using the same color

301
00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:43.821
for the masked Yaiba that I'm making now too.

302
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:46.121
So, the finish is...

303
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:47.821
Yes, no mistake about it.

304
00:16:47.821 --> 00:16:49.321
It's the same color.

305
00:16:49.321 --> 00:16:52.321
I see. So, that's the story.

306
00:16:53.521 --> 00:16:55.321
You're all still here?

307
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:57.221
Hurry on home.

308
00:16:58.721 --> 00:17:01.421
Like I said, Dr. Agasa.

309
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:05.321
What is this, gathering everybody here like this?

310
00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:08.421
I'm sorry. I know it's really sudden but...

311
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:11.621
There are several things that keep bothering me

312
00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:13.621
as to the crime that occurred.

313
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:16.321
First of all, it's Reika's broche

314
00:17:16.321 --> 00:17:19.021
that was found on the floor of the corridor.

315
00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:22.521
Mr. Kitajima's blood was found on the broche.

316
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:25.421
But, please take a good look at her clothes.

317
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:28.021
There is no blood on it at all.

318
00:17:28.021 --> 00:17:30.221
Do you think it's possible

319
00:17:30.221 --> 00:17:34.621
that splattered blood would pinpoint just the broche?

320
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:38.521
Then, are you saying that someone left

321
00:17:38.521 --> 00:17:41.521
the broche with blood stain on it to frame her?

322
00:17:41.521 --> 00:17:43.221
But, that's no very likely.

323
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:47.221
And there's another strange thing.

324
00:17:47.221 --> 00:17:50.321
Mr. Morishita, it's about you.

325
00:17:50.321 --> 00:17:51.921
Me?

326
00:17:51.921 --> 00:17:55.621
Yes, when I first met you.

327
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:57.621
This is the most popular robot anime around now.

328
00:17:57.621 --> 00:18:01.421
You explained that you were working all night making a piece,

329
00:18:01.421 --> 00:18:03.521
and your clothes were soiled with paint.

330
00:18:03.521 --> 00:18:05.421
Yes, the one you're wearing.

331
00:18:05.421 --> 00:18:06.921
However...

332
00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:14.821
Please take a look at that robot.

333
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:17.221
It's what Mr. Morishita made.

334
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.921
The colors are vivid.

335
00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:21.821
The colors are completely different from the color on his clothes.

336
00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:23.621
Why is that?

337
00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:26.521
Inside Mr. Morishita's paint case

338
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:30.121
there was paint the same color as the stain on his clothes.

339
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:31.921
It's this!

340
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:35.321
This color is for some reason

341
00:18:35.321 --> 00:18:39.321
the same as the color used for Mr. Kitajima's georama.

342
00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:44.821
There were rumors going around that Mr. Kitajima had a ghost modeler.

343
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:50.221
Mr. Morishita, isn't it you who was ghost modeling for him?

344
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.521
That's right.

345
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:53.521
He was making me do it!

346
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:55.321
My mother is ill,

347
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:57.721
so I borrowed money from Kitajima.

348
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.721
But, because of his outrageous interest my debt ballooned to no end

349
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:02.321
and I couldn't pay him back!

350
00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:04.521
Then, he tells me...

351
00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:06.621
If so, Morishita...

352
00:19:06.621 --> 00:19:10.921
make my pieces for me too, okay?

353
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:13.521
Moreover, Mr. Kitajima was preparing

354
00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:16.421
to enter the world tournament with your figurines.

355
00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:19.521
Of course you'd feel bad about it, wouldn't you?

356
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:22.321
That's why you killed Mr. Kitajima.

357
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:25.921
No! That, and this case is totally not connected!

358
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:27.221
However...

359
00:19:27.221 --> 00:19:31.721
if it were so, everything falls perfectly into place.

360
00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:38.021
Last night, you coincidentally saw Mr. Kitajima and Reika arguing.

361
00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:40.721
Back then, you picked up the broche

362
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:43.021
that Reika dropped in the corridor.

363
00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:49.021
Today, you killed Mr. Kitajima,

364
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.221
smeared the broche with his blood

365
00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:54.921
and threw it inside behind the vending machine in the corridor.

366
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:58.621
In order to frame Reika up as the perp!

367
00:19:58.621 --> 00:20:02.221
Of course you lured Reika out by texting her mail,

368
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:06.221
and didn't forget to make sure you had an alibi too.

369
00:20:11.921 --> 00:20:14.421
Please cut it out already.

370
00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:17.821
You should never take something so ridiculous seriously.

371
00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:19.621
I didn't do it.

372
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:21.521
Right, the murder weapon!

373
00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:23.521
Where's the murder weapon?

374
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:26.421
I didn't have anything like that on me, you know!

375
00:20:26.421 --> 00:20:32.621
Mr. Kitajima was known as a genius for making natural landscape.

376
00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:35.221
But that was actually really about you,

377
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:38.221
his ghost modeler, wasn't it?

378
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:43.321
This color was found in your paint case.

379
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:45.321
Natural light green.

380
00:20:45.321 --> 00:20:48.121
It's used for Masked Yaiba, so I know it!

381
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:49.521
There's one thing in this room

382
00:20:49.521 --> 00:20:52.521
of the same color that is from nature.

383
00:20:52.521 --> 00:20:54.721
Can you tell what is it, everyone?

384
00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:56.121
Over there!

385
00:21:05.221 --> 00:21:07.021
I'm never going to forgive you!

386
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:09.221
I'll kill you!

387
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:11.221
Mr. Kitajima said...

388
00:21:11.221 --> 00:21:13.721
that the important thing when making figurines

389
00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:17.221
is to have rich images.

390
00:21:17.221 --> 00:21:20.521
That's why you imagined too, didn't you, Mr. Morishita?

391
00:21:20.521 --> 00:21:24.521
When you saw the flowers that Reika brought.

392
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:35.521
I see.

393
00:21:35.521 --> 00:21:36.921
He painted paint onto the blade to begin with,

394
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.121
and committed the crime.

395
00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:41.921
It's all Kitajima's fault!

396
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:45.921
He asked me to ghost model for him, that's why I...

397
00:21:45.921 --> 00:21:49.321
I'm not to blame!

398
00:23:12.721 --> 00:23:15.121
Everybody complimented us so much.

399
00:23:15.121 --> 00:23:17.721
And, besides, they gave us all these plastic model toys.

400
00:23:17.721 --> 00:23:21.521
All ended well. But...

401
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:23.121
Okay!

402
00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:25.321
Conan, thanks!

403
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:28.321
I've already made Yaiba.

404
00:23:28.321 --> 00:23:30.921
After making the plastic model, I'm hungry!

405
00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:32.321
Food! Food!

406
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:35.821
Hey, come on, make it yourselves!

407
00:23:35.821 --> 00:23:39.821
Making 4 or 5 wouldn't make much difference, would it?

408
00:23:41.121 --> 00:23:42.321
Food. Food.

409
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.421
You guys!

410
00:23:46.421 --> 00:23:48.121
I guess 6th won't hurt then.

411
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:50.421
Come on!

412
00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:52.821
For you.

413
00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:57.321
Don't open it until I get a hold of all seven of them.

414
00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:59.221
What? Somebody is dead?

415
00:24:01.021 --> 00:24:03.421
This is undoubtedly a suicide.

416
00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:05.321
No.

417
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:07.121
It could be homicide, you know?

418
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:13.321
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

419
00:24:13.321 --> 00:24:15.821
If I'm not mistaken...

420
00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.321
Next Conan,

421
00:24:17.321 --> 00:24:21.221
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 1)"

422
00:24:37.021 --> 00:24:39.421
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:39.421 --> 00:24:41.221
"Will".

424
00:24:41.221 --> 00:24:43.021
-A will. When you have four... -Four wills.

425
00:24:43.021 --> 00:24:45.121
-Dr. Agasa's quiz is funny. -Right?

426
00:24:45.121 --> 00:24:46.221
My tougue slipped.
