Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,566
In today's episode, a car explodes.

4
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,666
The adult world is a bit complicated.

5
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,366
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,866
His name is Detective Conan.

Thanks for waiting.

12
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,679
What're you looking at so intently?

13
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,879
I was just remembering the past.

14
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
The past?

15
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,079
You may not know,

16
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,279
but in the past, in every bank,

17
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:07,079
there was a space open for the general public.

18
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,979
They had a bulletin board with messages

19
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,579
such as "Looking for a nice home for kitten" or whatever.

20
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:18,079
I once put up a please hire tutor message on the board, too.

21
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,579
Were you tutoring, Pops?

22
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,479
Really? I didn't know at all.

23
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,879
Well, I didn't have money,

24
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,279
but I married your mother while I was still a student.

25
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,979
So I had no choice but to part-time to make a living.

26
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,579
You and Mom had quite a tough time, I see.

27
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,579
But, the one who really had a tough time

28
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,879
must've been the one who was taught by Pops.

29
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,279
You can say that again.

30
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:48,179
What're you talking about? I was a pretty good tutor.

31
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:51,579
As proof of that, the student I taught for 3 years,

32
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,579
entered the law department of Jonan University.

33
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,579
Oh, right. She used to live in Beika Town!

34
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:03,379
Follow me. I'll introduce you to her, Megumi!

35
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,979
Megumi?

36
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,279
Hey, wait. What was that?

37
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,279
Is she a woman?

38
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,879
How nostalgic.

39
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,179
I've never been in this part of Beika Town very much,

40
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,279
but it hasn't changed much.

41
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,379
Are you sure you haven't seen that person for a long time?

42
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:27,579
Yeah. Her name is Megumi Tanaka,

43
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,279
and her father is a lawyer.

44
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,779
He used to let me drink beer after lessons.

45
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,079
That's what kept you in one place for so long?

46
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,779
What's with that car?

47
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,779
Hey, hey!

48
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,179
Watch out, Conan.

49
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,279
Gosh. What's with that car anyway?

50
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,879
Speeding like that on such a narrow road.

51
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,979
Her house is right around that tobacco shop!

52
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,879
Maybe the person called Megumi has gotten married long ago,

53
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,079
and doesn't live there anymore?

54
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,379
Could be,

55
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,779
but there's also a possibility that she's still single.

56
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,079
Dad.

57
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,579
I hope you're not thinking of anything funny.

58
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:15,979
Come of it.

59
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,379
What can I do with you kids along with me?

60
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,579
Oh, it's her!

61
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:25,079
Megumi!

62
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,279
Mr. Mouri?

63
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,079
Hi! You've really grown to be an adult, haven't you?

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,879
Wait, Mr. Mouri!

65
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,579
All right!

66
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,979
Okay, okay.

67
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,679
Hiromi.

68
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,179
Megumi!

69
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,579
My little sister...

70
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:59,979
Hiromi is inside.

71
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,379
What? Hiromi is...

72
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,679
There it is. A fire extinguisher.

73
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,679
Give it to me.

74
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,979
I'll handle this.

75
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,879
Hiromi.

76
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,979
Megumi.

00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,979
I am sure you are in shock because it is right after the accident.

79
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,079
-But may I ask you a few questions? -Yes.

80
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,579
Your name is Mrs. Sakihara, is that right?

81
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,879
"Megumi Sakihara (35)" -Yes, that's right.

82
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,379
The person who died in the car that exploded is

83
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,179
Ms. Hiromi Tanaka, your younger sister?

84
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,179
"Hiromi Tanaka (32)"

85
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,679
Yes, that's right.

86
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:15,379
An explosive was rigged on to the car.

87
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,279
Explosives?

88
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,679
Just as I thought.

89
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:22,079
Yeah. It seems that the explosive was rigged

90
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,879
onto the underside of the car together with an ignition device.

91
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,479
It was probably rigged so that when the tires turned,

92
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,079
an explosion would occur.

93
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,579
Yes, I also remember that the car exploded

94
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,479
soon after she reversed.

95
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,479
Ms. Sakihara.

96
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,279
I know how you feel, but you've got to rest a bit more.

97
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,179
That house you came out of is your parents' house, isn't it?

98
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,179
Yes.

99
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:54,179
My parents died in a car accident 6 months ago.

100
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,579
What? You mean your father?

101
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,679
Yes, that's right.

102
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,279
My sister's been living there alone ever since.

103
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,079
Was that car was your sister's?

104
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,079
No, it was mine.

105
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,279
Yours?

106
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,579
What?

107
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,279
That's the car that I drove all the way here

108
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,279
from my residence in West Tama today.

109
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,879
My sister's car was at an auto shop for a safety check,

110
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,579
so I parked my car in the empty garage.

111
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,679
Since I'm not good at backing up,

112
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:24,879
my sister was getting the car out for me, so I could head on home.

113
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,479
My sister...

114
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,279
She offered to back it out for me.

115
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,679
Which means that you were the one

116
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,279
who was actually supposed to be driving that car?

117
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,379
Yes.

118
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,379
Then, the killer mistakenly killed your younger sister?

119
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,779
I don't know!

120
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,779
I don't know what on earth is going on.

121
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,979
Megumi.

122
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:52,879
Megumi, about what time did you leave your residence in West Tama?

123
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,579
A little before 2 pm.

124
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,179
Did you notice anything abnormal about the car back then?

125
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,079
No.

126
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,879
What time did you arrive at your parents' house?

127
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,479
I think it was around 2:30 pm.

128
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,879
The explosion occurred at 3 pm sharp!

129
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:15,079
If so, then it is most likely that the explosive was rigged to the car

130
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,579
during the 30 minutes period.

131
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,479
Do you have any idea as to who it may be?

132
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,979
Do you know if anyone may have a grudge against you?

133
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,379
No. But...

134
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:26,879
But?

135
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,279
About a week ago,

136
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,079
I was being watched

137
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,779
by a male stranger at a supermarket near my house.

138
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,979
A male stranger?

139
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:43,079
Yes. I pretended not to notice,

140
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,079
but I felt quite uncomfortable.

141
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:47,879
Do you remember that man's face?

142
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,779
Yes. He had a very characteristic face.

143
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,179
We'll get an officer who is good at drawing portraits,

144
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,379
so we'd like your cooperation.

145
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,079
Megumi.

146
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,579
It didn't even occur to me that I'd be meeting you again like this.

147
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,579
I knew that you had become a famous detective, Mr. Mouri.

148
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:22,079
I used to always boast to my friends that you used to be my tutor.

149
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,679
I see.

150
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,479
I will surely track down the killer

151
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,879
who did such a terrible thing to Hiromi!

152
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,379
Please do that, Mr. Mouri.

153
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,179
Leave it to me!

154
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:41,879
What a surprise that she used to be a student of yours.

155
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,679
You also knew her younger sister too, then, didn't you?

156
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,079
Yes.

157
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,379
She was still in junior high school back then

158
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:51,979
and used to always serve us cake and tea.

159
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:55,279
Unlike her older sister, Megumi, who was quiet and easy-going,

160
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,579
Hiromi used to joke a lot, had many friends,

161
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:59,079
was outgoing,

162
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,579
and was very cheerful.

163
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,679
They don't seem to have changed much to this day.

164
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,279
After Ms. Megumi graduated from college,

165
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,479
she went to work for a securities company.

166
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,279
She stayed there only for a short while and got married.

167
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,679
She has no children,

168
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,479
but seems to be living a peaceful life as a housewife.

169
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:22,079
On the contrary, after Ms. Hiromi graduated from a two-year college,

170
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,079
worked as a free part-timer,

171
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,179
and even after reaching the age of 30,

172
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,679
still seemed to be living a carefree life.

173
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,179
It seems the investigation on Hiromi's going to take some time.

174
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,579
Inspector Megure.

175
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,779
The portrait is done.

176
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,679
Thank you.

177
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,779
Let me see, too.

178
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,379
He's...

179
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,279
Doesn't he look like that man?

180
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,079
Remember the driver who overtook us on our way to Megumi's house.

181
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,679
Although he was wearing sunglasses,

182
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,479
his hairstyle and chin look exactly the same.

183
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,879
Come to think of it...

184
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,679
He looks just like the man!

185
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,079
About what time did you see him?

186
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,979
About 10 minutes before we got to Megumi's house

187
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:19,379
at the alley about 500 meters before reaching her house.

188
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,379
Which means he could've been fleeing after setting up the explosive.

189
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,679
Do you remember the model and license number of the car?

190
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,879
Well...

191
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,879
It was a red RV, with a Shinjuku license number.

192
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,079
All right. Let's search for it immediately.

193
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,279
Excuse me, how is Megumi? She is my wife.

194
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,979
How is she?

195
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:42,079
Excuse me, but are you Mr. Kazuo Sakihara?

196
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,879
"Azuo Sakihara (37)" -Yes.

197
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,979
I got a call from the police saying that my wife had a bombing accident.

198
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:49,779
And, how is she?

199
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,879
Please don't worry, she's fine.

200
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,779
But, your wife's younger sister passed away.

201
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,679
Hiromi?

202
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,579
Oh, I mean...

203
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:06,879
Why her?

204
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,279
An explosive was rigged to your wife's car

205
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,779
but Ms. Hiromi was driving the car in her place.

206
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,179
Mr. Sakihara, have you ever seen anyone like this before?

207
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:23,179
I see. So you have, haven't you?

208
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,479
No, never.

209
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,079
Excuse me.

210
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,579
He sure is acting strange.

211
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:36,679
Inspector Megure!

212
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,979
Investigation at the scene of the explosion has been completed.

213
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:44,479
How was the portrait?

214
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,779
Here it is.

215
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,479
Mouri and the others seem to have seen him

216
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,579
near the scene of the explosion.

217
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,679
That's reliable evidence.

218
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,779
This man...

219
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,579
What's up, Officer Takagi?

220
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,379
Well, I thought I saw him

221
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,179
among the papers of the case that Officer Sato is handling.

222
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,179
What?

223
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,479
You mean the one who was killed in Shinjuku?

224
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:09,079
Yes, I only took a glimpse,

225
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,479
but he looks a lot like the victim's husband.

226
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,979
All right. Check on that portrait right away

227
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,879
and contact Officer Sato.

228
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,879
Yes, sir.

229
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,968
"Police Station"

230
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:35,368
Yes, they do look alike.

231
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,768
I've met the man himself,

232
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:40,068
so I think there is no mistake about it.

233
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:45,268
He's the husband of the woman who was stabbed to death on her way back

234
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,468
after shopping at a convenience store at night.

235
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:49,668
"Hiromasa Takahashi (33)" -He is Hiromasa Takahashi,

236
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:52,868
age 33, an employee at a chemicals company.

237
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,368
And over here is his wife, the victim,

238
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:59,868
Mrs. Sachiko Takahashi, age 27.

239
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,768
We're investigating a random murder.

240
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,268
She was covered by a very expensive insurance policy.

241
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:10,468
Her husband who is in debt was also a suspect.

242
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,568
However, he had a perfect alibi.

243
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,668
I see.

244
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:21,068
Is Takahashi's car a red RV with a Shinjuku license plate number?

245
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,768
Yes. Exactly.

246
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,068
What?

247
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:29,268
Now, it is quite definite that the man we saw was Takahashi.

248
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:33,068
And if he works for a chemicals company,

249
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:35,668
he could easily get a hold of explosives, too.

250
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,868
A random murder case and a bombing incident,

251
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:39,168
looks to be two very different cases,

252
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,168
but I wonder if there is any connection?

253
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:46,668
Although there are no names that correlate in both cases.

254
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:50,268
But, too many things fit in for this to be a coincidence.

255
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:52,668
Another deduction could be...

256
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,068
Officer Takagi,

257
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:06,568
you've got a cool looking badge there!

258
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:09,468
Please exchange it with mine.

259
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,668
No, Conan, this is not a badge.

260
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:13,668
Please exchange it with me.

261
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:16,468
-Exchange it with me, please. -Conan!

262
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,768
Hey! Don't you understand that you can't exchange it?

263
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,668
Exchange?

264
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:27,068
I've figured it out, inspector.

265
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,268
This is an exchange murder.

266
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,168
Exchange murder?

267
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:33,868
Yes.

268
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,068
If so, both incidents connect.

269
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,068
Do you mean...

270
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:43,268
that an agreement of an exchange murder

271
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,068
was made between Kazuo Sakihara and Hiromasa Takahashi.

272
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:50,168
First, Sakihara kills Takahashi's wife, Sachiko.

273
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:54,168
Next, Takahashi kills Sakihara's wife, Megumi.

274
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:57,068
I see.

275
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:01,168
When Sakihara saw the sketch of Takahashi at the hospital,

276
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:04,068
he looked out rightly shocked.

277
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:07,668
That's because he knew that Mr. Takahashi was the killer.

278
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:12,668
But, why did Mr. Sakihara want to kill his wife?

279
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:16,668
That can be imagined from his remark when he found out

280
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,668
that the one who died was his wife's younger sister.

281
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,068
Hiromi?

282
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,068
He's remark sounded obviously more intimate

283
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:26,868
than just a brother-in-law relationship with her.

284
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:29,268
All right.

285
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:31,068
Let's investigate the case with all that was pointed out just now.

286
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:32,368
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

287
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,068
Mr. Takahashi?

288
00:17:56,468 --> 00:18:00,468
You seem to be in a rush, but are you going anywhere?

289
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,968
Darn!

290
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,168
Freeze!

291
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,368
You're arrested on charges of assault and battery!

292
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,268
Darn!

293
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:13,568
There is a bomb in the bag.

294
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,968
What?

295
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,768
We did it, Officer Takagi!

296
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:17,868
Indeed.

297
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:21,168
"A few days later" -After Sakihara saw the sketch,

298
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:24,568
he informed Takahashi to run for it.

299
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:27,768
But, that in turn, was a breakthrough for us.

300
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:31,368
After Sakihara hearing that Takahashi had admitted the crime,

301
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:34,568
also resigned and confessed that he had killed Takahashi's wife.

302
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,868
He seems to have talked Takahashi into committing an exchange murder

303
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,068
when they happened to see each other at a bar.

304
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:43,268
They never met after that first meeting,

305
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:46,668
all arrangements were done by phone.

306
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:50,668
They used the payphone so that no proof would be left.

307
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:55,768
Sakihara had a phone exclusively for himself in his study upstairs

308
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,468
and took all his calls with that phone.

309
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:01,468
That's why Megumi didn't realize what was going on.

310
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:06,768
And, what was Sakihara's motive?

311
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,268
Just as you had deduced,

312
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,168
Sakihara had an intimate relationship

313
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:13,968
with Megumi's younger sister, Hiromi.

314
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,668
Sakihara seems to have thought up killing Megumi,

315
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:19,368
in order to come up with cash for opening a boutique

316
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,468
that Hiromi said she wanted to start.

317
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:22,868
Because if Megumi dies,

318
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,668
all the money that he inherits from her,

319
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,268
and the money for the insurance that she is covered by

320
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:30,168
would become his.

321
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:34,168
How cruel. Poor Megumi.

322
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:36,868
Does Megumi know about this?

323
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:40,768
Yes. Although it seems she couldn't make herself believe it at first,

324
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:44,868
all she could do after finding it to be true was cry.

325
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,168
It's understandable,

326
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:50,668
because although she wasn't involved in the crime at all,

327
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:54,268
she was backstabbed by her younger sister.

328
00:19:57,168 --> 00:20:00,268
I'll go and look in on her in a few days.

329
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:01,668
That's a good idea.

330
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:05,268
So, the case has been solved and is closed.

331
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,668
Help her out like an old friend, will you?

332
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:15,068
Yes, sure thing.

333
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:18,368
I'll see you, then, Ran.

334
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,768
Goodbye, Inspector Megure.

335
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:27,768
I wonder if everything has really been solved?

336
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,568
I have a feeling

337
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:33,368
that something is being overlooked.

338
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,868
"A few days later" -Dad!

339
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:45,068
Dad, you promised to meet Megumi at 1 pm, didn't you?

340
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:48,868
Look. We're an hour early.

341
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:50,668
Let's go have some coffee.

342
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:57,268
Isn't this the supermarket where Megumi mentioned she saw Takahashi?

343
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:58,568
Conan.

344
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,868
Hurry, come.

345
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:01,968
Okay.

346
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:07,668
Dad, isn't that Megumi?

347
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,868
What? Megumi?

348
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:16,768
Hey, Megumi!

349
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,168
Hey!

350
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,468
She's gone.

351
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:35,968
Conan?

352
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,368
She reversed out...

353
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,168
of such a narrow parking space.

354
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,768
Didn't she mentioned...

355
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:49,968
Since I'm not good at backing up,

356
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:52,668
my sister was getting the car out for me, so I could head on home.

357
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:54,368
My sister...

358
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,468
She offered to back it out for me.

359
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:59,668
But, what I saw,

360
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:02,668
doesn't look like a person who has trouble backing up the car.

361
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:07,468
Then why did Megumi ask Hiromi for substitution?

362
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:13,768
Because of that, the explosion killed Hiromi.

363
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:17,068
Can this really be an unlucky coincidence?

364
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:23,868
Maybe...

365
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:26,868
What if maybe Megumi already knew everything?

366
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:32,068
This case has not yet ended.

367
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:05,368
"Next Episode" -Are you insinuating

368
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:08,868
that Megumi has something to do with this case?

369
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:13,268
You knew her as a high school student, right, Pops?

370
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:17,468
Megumi could've changed after growing up.

371
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,968
She hasn't changed a bit!

372
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,468
She's the way she always used to be!

373
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:24,168
You want to believe so, don't you, Pops?

374
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:27,168
But, actually she's already...

375
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,468
Next Conan,

376
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,389
"The Car Explosion Case (Part 2)"

377
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,770
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,570
"Window"

379
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,870
The case will be solved in the next episode.

380
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,270
Love and deduction, we've got it made!
