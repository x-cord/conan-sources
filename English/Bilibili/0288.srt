1
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:03,524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:05,024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:06,624
The time Ran and I spent in New York

4
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,224
were days of rain and mysteries which led to fond memories.

5
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:09,724
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:11,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:13,524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:03,211
My mom takes Ran and me to see a musical in New York.

9
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,811
While we were being given the backstage tour,

10
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,311
we met an actor, Heath Flockhart,

11
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,711
who ends up getting shot to death.

12
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,011
A feather?

13
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:23,411
How'd it get stuck here?

14
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,611
I get it now.

15
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:36,611
"Shinichi In New York (Part 3)"

16
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:40,411
From this position,

17
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:45,211
it doesn't look like any of you four could have shot him from above.

18
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:48,411
Then would you mind if we changed our clothes?

19
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:52,411
Go ahead, you all have tested negative for gunpowder residue.

20
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:55,911
Which means the killer was probably someone from the outside.

21
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:59,511
Yeah. That's the only explanation.

22
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:03,711
Who turned the lights off?

23
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,811
Me, I did it!

24
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,611
Some people know me as the most beautiful actress in Japan.

25
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:15,511
Others know me as the globe-trotting mystery writer's wife.

26
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,111
But in reality, I am...

27
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:21,011
a highly intelligent female detective.

28
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,211
I am Night Baroness!

29
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:28,511
Excuse me, light man! I'm over here!

30
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,211
Yukiko.

31
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,611
That's right!

32
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:35,711
Captain, the fog has been lifted.

33
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,811
I'm talking about the fog

34
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,911
that hid the truth behind the murder of course.

35
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,511
What?

36
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:44,911
Hey mom, don't get carried away and mess up the ending.

37
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:49,311
Don't worry, I'll tell it exactly as you told me to.

38
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,411
Gosh.

39
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:54,111
Hey, are you sure you're right?

40
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:57,111
If you're wrong, your mom's going to look like a fool.

41
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,711
I'm sure.

42
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,811
Don't you think it's strange?

43
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:05,611
Heath's 6'3 tall, that's about 190 centimeters.

44
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:09,111
That's just about the height of you with the pamphlet on your head

45
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:13,111
when I measured it just now, the pamphlet stuck out over the mirror.

46
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,111
And on top of that, Heath had those wings on his back,

47
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,311
so he couldn't bend over, even if he were behind the mirror.

48
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,211
You'd be able to see the top of his head.

49
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,211
That's why the killer used that certain thing,

50
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:26,811
so his head wouldn't stick out.

51
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:29,611
Performers use it

52
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,911
to appear and disappear suddenly on stage,

53
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,311
it's called a trap door.

54
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,911
But there wasn't anything like that behind the mirror.

55
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:45,911
There was only a strange metal cover on the floor beside it.

56
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,711
Stupid.

57
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:51,911
If you see a cover, you should know there's a hole under it.

58
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:56,911
Feathers from Heath's wings were caught under the cover,

59
00:04:56,911 --> 00:05:01,211
and the blood on the floor under the lid was arc-shaped,

60
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,911
and the stage has a doughnut-shaped ditch,

61
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,011
now add the crooked curtain near the ditch

62
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,511
and you should get the picture.

63
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,611
By moving the doughnut-shaped floor like that,

64
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,711
the unseen trap-door...

65
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,711
opens right up.

66
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,611
I think if you check it, you're going to find

67
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,711
more feathers, the gunshot probably knocked more off

68
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:33,911
and you should find Heath's blood.

69
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,711
And you'll probably find the bullet casing from the gun, too.

70
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:40,711
If the bullet casing's there,

71
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:43,011
that means he was shot at close range?

72
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,011
That's right.

73
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,111
Heath was standing by under the trap door

74
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,611
the metal lid was resting against the mirror,

75
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:51,011
the killer shot him from above

76
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,611
by sticking her right hand which held the gun,

77
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,611
between the mirror and the lid.

78
00:05:57,611 --> 00:06:00,211
Are you saying the killer...

79
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:03,211
Yes. The only one capable of doing it,

80
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:06,611
under those circumstances, was the once lying beside the mirror,

81
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,111
Rose, it was you, wasn't it?

82
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:13,211
Rose?

83
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:15,811
I don't believe it. It can't be.

84
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,911
I mean, no one, not even the staff mentioned

85
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,211
the trap door would be used!

86
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,411
I'm sure that's true,

87
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,711
because...

88
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:28,011
It's not that the staff didn't tell you. They couldn't.

89
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,211
All of you believe the mirror's your guardian spirit,

90
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:33,211
they couldn't tell you that it's been damaged.

91
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:37,911
I'm pretty sure Rose did it when no one was looking.

92
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,011
When the stagehands saw the crack,

93
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,711
they removed the damaged portion.

94
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:46,111
Then adjusted the frame to cover it up.

95
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:50,711
So everyone wouldn't be upset and worry about having bad luck.

96
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,211
But since the frame was made shorter, Heath's head would show,

97
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:59,111
they knew that if they put the mirror on a stand,

98
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:02,211
everyone would be suspicious and notice it'd been damaged.

99
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:06,311
That's why they decided, on the spur of the moment,

100
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:09,311
to use the trap door so that Heath would be out of sight.

101
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,411
They only told Heath and Rose about it.

102
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,911
But why did they tell Rose?

103
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:19,411
Isn't it obvious?

104
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:22,411
By moving the doughnut-shaped floor,

105
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,711
they'd be able to hide the opening.

106
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:30,611
But unless Rose reached under the mirror to lower the lid,

107
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,211
the audience would see it.

108
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,511
Then what about the gun?

109
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:38,711
It fell from way up high.

110
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:42,611
She was lying on the floor, she couldn't have thrown it up that high.

111
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:44,111
Of course she can.

112
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:45,611
Heath the angel was going to be suspended in mid-air,

113
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:48,411
all she had to do was use him.

114
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:52,511
Remember? Heath had a burn mark on his neck.

115
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,511
I'm sure he got it when she put the gun there,

116
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:58,111
it'd just been fired so it was hot.

117
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,311
If she put the gun there in the folds of his costume

118
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:04,111
and when he stopped being lifted, the vibration would cause it to fall,

119
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,511
that was the idea.

120
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:08,311
But I don't think she ever imagined for a second

121
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,011
he'd grab her with his bloodied hand.

122
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:15,111
The reason the blood in his palm was smeared

123
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:18,411
proves that he grabbed her hand.

124
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,911
And the proof should still be there

125
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:24,211
on her right hand and on the inside of her glove.

126
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:27,511
Heath's hate-filled handprint.

127
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,111
I'm pretty sure she performed

128
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,111
with her gloves inside out.

129
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,211
And after firing the gun,

130
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:42,411
she quickly turned them back correctly.

131
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,611
So that she wouldn't test positive for gun powder residue

132
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,411
after the investigation started.

133
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:52,411
But Shinichi, when'd you realize there was blood on her glove?

134
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,711
I realized it when I saw her struggle to open the can of juice

135
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:59,811
in the dressing room.

136
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:03,311
All she had to do was take her gloves off, but she didn't.

137
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:06,811
So I figured she was hiding something under them.

138
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:11,111
But then I also got an epiphany right there

139
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:13,611
and then as to her motive for killing Heath.

140
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,811
Her motive?

141
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:18,111
Both Lila and Akane had photos on their mirrors,

142
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,711
taken with Heath.

143
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:23,211
But, not Rose, her photo...

144
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,611
The angel.

145
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:29,011
Her photo was of him in his angel costume.

146
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:32,711
You weren't in love with him,

147
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,411
you were in love with his role as the angel.

148
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,711
That's right.

149
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,911
That's why I killed him as the angel Michael.

150
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:47,911
Because I just found it unbearable.

151
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:53,711
But he was quitting because he was going to star in a movie.

152
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,711
It was his own decision, though.

153
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,311
He was responsible for Michael's death!

154
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:04,411
He knew how much I loved him as Michael and he still did it.

155
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,711
But it seems that God was watching over me.

156
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,911
When the suit armor fell, I couldn't run away

157
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,911
because my clothes were caught on a nail and God saved me.

158
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,511
Thank you, sweet angel.

159
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,611
You helped me do it.

160
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:40,411
All right, then, Shin!

161
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:44,811
I have to go to the police station and stand in when they question her,

162
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,511
so you'll have to go back to the hotel by taxi.

163
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,611
Okay.

164
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:53,211
And by the way, be careful, there's a slasher on the loose.

165
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:55,711
He's Japanese and has long hair.

166
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,311
See you later, Shin!

167
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,811
Good grief, she still treats me like a kid.

168
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:04,911
Doesn't she realizes I'm in high school already?

169
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:11,211
And then, this is what Holmes said,

170
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:14,211
"Even if the world does revolve around the moon,

171
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:18,111
it will never affect my work in any way", how'd you like that?

172
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,111
What's the matter, Ran?

173
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:25,111
You're not letting what Rose said to you back there bother you, are you?

174
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:28,311
Did she says something?

175
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:31,011
Her English was so fast, I didn't understand a word.

176
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,411
Forget it, then.

177
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:34,811
It wasn't important anyway.

178
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:36,411
Would you mind closing the window?

179
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,211
You're going to catch a cold.

180
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:41,611
Didn't you say you were feeling like of hot since this morning?

181
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,811
Oh, I'm fine already.

182
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:45,111
Besides, if I close the window,

183
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:48,411
I won't be able to see the city lights very well.

184
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:51,411
But if the rain comes in and the seat gets wet,

185
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,911
the driver's not going to be happy.

186
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,111
Don't worry.

187
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,711
I have a handkerchief. I'll wipe the wet areas before I get out.

188
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,711
Good grief.

189
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:04,611
Excuse me. Stop the car! Please, stop!

190
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:12,611
That's strange. It should be around here.

191
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,211
I wonder if it got blown away by the wind.

192
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,811
Just forget it! It's just a handkerchief.

193
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:20,611
It's not just an ordinary handkerchief!

194
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:23,311
Sharon gave it to me. It's very precious.

195
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:26,111
I guess there is no God, after all.

196
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,511
Isn't that it?

197
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:33,411
See, it's caught on the railing of those stairs that white thing.

198
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:38,211
It looks like an old abandoned building.

199
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:41,411
I'll get it for you right now. You wait for me by the taxi.

200
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:47,211
If there is a God, it wouldn't work out this unfairly.

201
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:50,011
Thank you, sweet angel.

202
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,111
You help me do it.

203
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:56,411
I wonder if Sharon knew about it?

204
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,211
That Rose will commit the crime

205
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,011
and I saved the murderer's life.

206
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:07,911
It's all my fault.

207
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,811
If I hadn't saved her, then.

208
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,611
Heath wouldn't have been killed.

209
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,311
It's all my fault.

210
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,911
It's my...

211
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:28,311
A Japanese man with long hair?

212
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,862
A gun?

213
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,062
Oh, no.

214
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,562
I... I can't move.

215
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,662
Hey, hurry up. Jump in.

216
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:58,362
He must be the serial killer! Come on!

217
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,462
Darn!

218
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:04,962
Hey. Wait!

219
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,462
Are you Japanese?

220
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,962
I asked you if you're Japanese.

221
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,062
Yes, I am.

222
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,962
Did you see a suspicious man around?

223
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,662
What?

224
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:21,962
A Japanese with long hair dyed silver and sporting a beard.

225
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,962
No, I haven't seen anyone like that.

226
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:31,362
Did you find him, sir?

227
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:35,362
No, I only found a tourist.

228
00:14:35,362 --> 00:14:38,962
I guess he wasn't on this street.

229
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,262
The shootout we had with the animal must have shaken him up.

230
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:46,062
Otherwise there's no way he'd pass up killing the girl.

231
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:48,062
This is no place for you, young lady.

232
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:51,062
Turn right at that corner and you'll be on the main street

233
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:53,062
and get a cab right away.

234
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:55,862
But wait, I have a friend.

235
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,362
I'm waiting for my friend here,

236
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:00,762
he's a boy and same age as me.

237
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:04,462
Then I'll tell you and that friend of yours one more time.

238
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:05,962
Get lost!

239
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:07,662
Get out of this area right now!

240
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:10,562
Can we leave her alone?

241
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:12,062
No problem.

242
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:16,462
Every crossing to this street is already secured.

243
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,762
So it's true...

244
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:21,062
that the serial killer's somewhere around here.

245
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,662
I've got to let Shinichi know right away and we've got get out of here.

246
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:28,062
Shinichi! Hey!

247
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:36,462
What's that? I just saw something red.

248
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,262
Blood.

249
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:42,562
It couldn't be Shinichi's, could it?

250
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:46,762
Something's happened to Shinichi.

251
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:49,962
Shinichi!

252
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:55,262
Oh, no. Is my cold coming back?

253
00:15:56,562 --> 00:16:00,462
Come on, Ran. You've got to get a hold of yourself.

254
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:05,562
Shinichi came in here because you let your handkerchief go.

255
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:09,562
That's right. It's all my fault.

256
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:12,162
It's all my fault...

257
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:15,962
Somebody's coming down.

258
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:17,662
Shinichi.

259
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,562
Silver hair.

260
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:24,562
Blood.

261
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:28,262
Ran, get away from there! That's the serial killer!

262
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,362
He's right, girlie.

263
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,562
I was hiding out in here.

264
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:37,162
But that kid found me.

265
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,562
If you're going to blame somebody, you should blame God

266
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:43,462
for putting you in this situation.

267
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:58,462
What're you doing?

268
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:01,162
Hurry! Grab my arm!

269
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:04,562
Hurry, my hand's slippery because of the rain!

270
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:08,762
Shinichi.

271
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:12,162
Good grief, you're so much trouble.

272
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:24,462
Why'd you do it? Why'd you saved me?

273
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,562
I don't understand.

274
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,562
Do we need a reason?

275
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:35,062
I don't know what makes a person kill another person

276
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:38,562
but I do know why people save each other...

277
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,662
Logical thinking, doesn't exist, does it?

278
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,362
I see.

279
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,862
That's right.

280
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,262
I should have realized it earlier.

281
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:50,962
How foolish of me.

282
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,162
Ran.

283
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:59,562
Don't do it.

284
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:03,862
I notice you're wounded, which mean the police must be close by.

285
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,962
You don't have a silencer, if you shoot,

286
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:07,962
the police will be all over the place.

287
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:12,662
Not only that, you'll be giving me the opportunity to capture you, too.

288
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:16,762
I'll let you go today,

289
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,762
but if we ever meet again, I won't be so lenient.

290
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:24,362
I'll be like the Devil and list all your sins

291
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:26,562
and look at all the evidence

292
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:29,862
then I'll send you straight to hell, so don't you forget it!

293
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:38,062
That's right. Didn't you see it on the news?

294
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:40,262
They found that serial killer.

295
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:43,362
Shin turned him in!

296
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:45,962
But when the police got there,

297
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:49,962
he'd already been shot, they say it was a suicide.

298
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,662
Yes, Ran's fine!

299
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:55,862
She had a fever last night but after a good night's rest,

300
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,662
she's back to normal.

301
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:03,162
But so many things happened yesterday.

302
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:07,362
Sharon, you knew something was going to happen, didn't you?

303
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:10,462
You knew Rose was up to something, didn't you?

304
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:14,062
Yes. I've always had a sixth sense about things like that.

305
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:17,762
But I never imagined that she'd commit murder.

306
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:20,862
By the way, will you give Ran this message?

307
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:23,962
Tell her she was right,

308
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,962
there does seem to be an angel looking out for me.

309
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:29,062
Oh, really? Has something good happened?

310
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:31,562
I guess you could say that.

311
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,362
Hey, maybe you're not over your cold yet.

312
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,762
I'm fine, really.

313
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:39,162
I'm going to check if you have a fever, don't move.

314
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,062
I'm fine!

315
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:51,762
He was right! The doctor said her fever would go down and it did.

316
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:55,362
So you're awake!

317
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,062
They said your fever was caused by exhaustion

318
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:02,062
I guess you'll have to go easy on the studying and club activities now.

319
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:06,562
The fever made you delirious and you were mumbling something.

320
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:12,362
Something about saving somebody and about logical thinking and stuff.

321
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:15,662
No, stop! Those are my private thoughts...

322
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:17,162
What?

323
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:21,362
That's right. They're private thoughts and very personal.

324
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:23,662
I don't want you to say them in your raspy voice.

325
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:25,662
What do you mean by that?

326
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,862
All right, then. I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.

327
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,662
Stay here tonight and rest up!

328
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,762
Good night, Ran!

329
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:40,762
So that's what it was. I'd forgotten all about it.

330
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:42,962
That's when it started,

331
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:47,562
that's the moment I fell in love with Shinichi.

332
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:50,762
Something's the matter with me,

333
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:54,162
how could I have forgotten such an important event.

334
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:57,062
I guess the bad memories suppressed the good ones.

335
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:01,262
I met so many people and so many things happened.

336
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:07,362
That man in the black knit cap, I wonder who he was?

337
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,162
FBI?

338
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:41,362
So you were in bed because of a fever, no wonder.

339
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:44,862
So that's why you didn't answer the mail I sent you on the cellular,

340
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,962
Shinichi, were you worried about me?

341
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:50,862
I just thought they might've stopped service to your phone.

342
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:53,262
What's that supposed to mean?

343
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:55,562
So you feeling okay now?

344
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:58,362
Yes. I'm perfectly fine.

345
00:22:58,362 --> 00:23:01,762
And thanks to the fever, I remembered what happened in New York.

346
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:06,562
That horrible case? Are you okay, though?

347
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:08,662
That case left you feeling really depressed.

348
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:12,462
Don't worry, I remembered some good things too.

349
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:15,262
By the way, what happened to Sharon's handkerchief?

350
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:20,962
Remember, you went into the abandoned building to get it for me?

351
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:24,162
Oh, that? I have it!

352
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,662
Oops. I wonder where I put it.

353
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:29,762
Two murders took place that day,

354
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:32,162
and I didn't want it to bring back those memories, so I put it away.

355
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,662
Two murders?

356
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,362
The serial killer committed suicide, didn't he?

357
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:39,762
Yes, that's what the police report said.

358
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:43,262
The blood stains and fingerprints

359
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:45,762
that should've been there had been wiped clean.

360
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:47,862
If you were going to commit suicide,

361
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:50,562
would you go through all the trouble of covering up your tracks?

362
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,562
I'm pretty sure...

363
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:55,562
somebody shot him just before he was going to make his get away.

364
00:23:57,262 --> 00:24:01,462
Somebody got to him before the police arrived.

365
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:07,162
"Next episode" -He took non-perishable food

366
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,562
and his wallet with him, that means...

367
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,862
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

368
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:17,762
We'll find him with these locator eyeglasses.

369
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:24,662
Officer Yamamura from the Gunma Prefecture Police.

370
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:29,262
We met him in Osaka, what's he doing here?

371
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,662
Next Conan,

372
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:35,762
"Mitsuhiko Lost in the Woods (Part 1)"

373
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:39,047
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,947
"Lemon Scent"

375
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,147
I'm stuck with another tough case,

376
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,847
I don't think I can get back anytime soon.

377
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,247
Never mind, I'm used to it already.
