1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,940
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,640
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,340
The mystery deepens with the second incident.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,940
It is the existence of something that's not supposed to.

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,840
This gives the evil spirit racket a boost!

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,545
We were invited to a wealthy person's residence in Shizuoka prefecture.

10
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:48,245
But the request of the client was a difficult one,

11
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:52,545
asking to scientifically explain the curse of an evil spirit.

12
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,145
At the house,

13
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,445
for the past few years,

14
00:01:56,445 --> 00:02:00,145
they say on Butsumetsu the 4th, something bad always occurs.

15
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:03,745
And on Butsumetsu of October 4th,

16
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:05,445
the misfortune befalls the first victim.

17
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:13,545
The victim is Mr. Toshimichi Sekiguchi, age 43.

18
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:17,445
Well, we can't tell whether it's suicide or homicide yet, but...

19
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:21,345
This card that reads, "I atone my sins of 13 years ago"

20
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:24,545
is sure to be the key to solving the case.

21
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,745
It was just about 13 years ago.

22
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:33,445
The master's cruiser had a marine accident.

23
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,345
Is there anybody here that is the bereaved family of a victim

24
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,245
of that accident and working here?

25
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,345
Yes.

26
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:48,845
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Suspicion)"

27
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:52,345
Will each of you introduce yourselves

28
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:56,645
and tell me of the person that died in the accident 13 years ago?

29
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,345
Let's see...

30
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,945
Then, why don't we start with Shigeko?

31
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,145
Yes.

32
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:06,945
I'm Shigeko Senzaki, the housekeeper.

33
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:10,945
I lost my husband who used to work here as a chef in the accident.

34
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:14,145
He was in charge of preparing the meals during the cruise.

35
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:19,645
My daughter and I were also scheduled to go on the cruise,

36
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:22,045
but we were both in bed with a cold.

37
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:27,345
After father died, I succeeded him and work here as a chef.

38
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:30,945
I also have succeeded my father and work here as a chauffeur.

39
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,745
I'm Masashi Watabiki.

40
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,745
I lost my father and younger brother in the accident.

41
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,545
You lost both members of your family?

42
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,545
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:44,545
My father was in charge of sailing the ship, so he had no choice.

44
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,745
But my younger brother just happened to go along.

45
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:50,145
It's truly regrettable.

46
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:56,245
The last victim was my wife who used to work as a housekeeper here.

47
00:03:56,245 --> 00:04:01,945
She was a great wife who used to help me out with my job as a steward, too.

48
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:07,045
Who would've thought that she would end up like that?

49
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,745
Akatsuka...

50
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:10,845
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

51
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,745
Forcing us to tell you what we don't want to recall!

52
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:18,745
Well, you see, I figured that maybe the one who killed Mr. Sekiguchi

53
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:21,145
could be among you guys.

54
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:23,645
After all, it's strange.

55
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:26,745
Even after seeing the card, "I am the fifth soul",

56
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:31,345
none of you mentioned anything about the marine accident 13 years ago.

57
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,645
Could it be that you already know who the killer is,

58
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:37,645
but not telling us and protecting the killer?

59
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,345
No way!

60
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,145
After all, four people died in the accident, you know!

61
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:44,545
There aren't five souls!

62
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:49,545
One, two, three, four...

63
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,545
That's true.

64
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:54,945
In the first place, the accident occurred on September 29th

65
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,045
on Taian (lucky day) 13 years ago.

66
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,645
It wasn't on the 4th, nor was it on Butsumetsu!

67
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:01,545
Oh, I see.

68
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:07,645
Besides, I don't think the chef and housekeeper could've done it.

69
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,745
Because... Look!

70
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:13,045
Mr. Sekiguchi was found hanging on the veranda.

71
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,145
I see!

72
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:17,545
Namika who has aerophobia can't go near it.

73
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:21,945
That's true, but what about Shigeko?

74
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:25,645
The killer hung Mr. Sekiguchi to make it look like suicide, right?

75
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:29,345
If so, the killer would look below before doing so, right?

76
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,645
In order to make sure that nobody is watching.

77
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:36,345
If you look below from where Mr. Sekiguchi was hung,

78
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,545
the pointed bars of the steel fence comes into view

79
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,645
and it's kind of scary.

80
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,945
I see!

81
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:45,145
Shigeko who has beloniphobia would probably avoid this place

82
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,545
and hang the victim more to the side.

83
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:49,445
Conan, way to go!

84
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,345
The chauffeur Mr. Watabiki was driving the car

85
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,345
together with Mr. and Mr. Kunitomo at the time of the murder.

86
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:59,345
So he couldn't have committed the murder.

87
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:03,745
Which means you're the only one left, Mr. Akatsuka.

88
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,345
No.

89
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,345
I don't think the steward did it either!

90
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:11,245
Look at the two cards carefully.

91
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:15,045
The writing is slanted and slightly out of place, right?

92
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,145
Come to think of it...

93
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:25,945
In other words, Mr. Akatsuka who is a meticulous perfectionist

94
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:29,645
would never write such a card.

95
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:33,245
But the killer could've pretended

96
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:37,945
to have such a habit or phobia to throw people off.

97
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:42,845
Conan...

98
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,045
Just as Conan has mentioned,

99
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:48,345
all of the habits and phobia can deliberately be acted out.

100
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:50,445
At any rate,

101
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:51,545
I would like you all to come down once

102
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,945
so that I can interrogate you individually.

103
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,845
I would like to also take your fingerprints.

104
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:59,345
Of all things,

105
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:03,145
why do we have to get our fingerprints taken, too?

106
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,545
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:07,745
I need it to make out which fingerprint is the killer's.

108
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:11,745
And? What about the alibis of the rest of the suspects?

109
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:16,445
The alibis of everyone except Mr. Watabiki are quite ambiguous.

110
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:20,245
So everyone's fingerprints were taken except for Mr. Kunitomo's,

111
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:24,745
but only Mr. Sekiguchi's fingerprints were found on the rope so far.

112
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,645
Why didn't you take the fingerprints of Mr. Kunitomo?

113
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,345
Well...

114
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:34,045
He said he won't see anybody until October 4th is over

115
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:35,745
and locked himself in the room on the third floor.

116
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:38,945
Hey, dear. Will you cut it out?

117
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:42,045
-Dear? -Well, hold your horses.

118
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,045
If something comes up, we can discuss it later, you and me.

119
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:49,445
I'll see you later.

120
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:50,445
Dear?

121
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,645
This is absurd!

122
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,745
Dear?

123
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:02,445
Don't tell me that there's somebody in there with Mr. Kunitomo?

124
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:04,345
-Huh? -It can't be!

125
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:07,145
He said that he didn't want to see anybody, didn't he?

126
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:08,645
Mrs. Kunitomo.

127
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:11,445
Where is this interphone connected to?

128
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,945
Our bedroom.

129
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:16,645
In other words, it's the room where Mr. Sekiguchi was hanging,

130
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:18,245
the room right above ours!

131
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:20,745
Conan!

132
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:38,145
Rope?

133
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,145
Hey, Conan.

134
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,945
The pill has been crushed.

135
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:00,245
There was somebody here after all.

136
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:04,445
But there are no traces of the window being forced opened.

137
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,845
He couldn't have forgotten to lock them under these circumstances.

138
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,845
How in the world

139
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:11,945
did the killer get inside?

140
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,345
We've got to call an ambulance right away.

141
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,845
Although under these circumstances, it may already be too late.

142
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:25,145
The thing that bothers me is that rope.

143
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:26,945
If my deduction is correct...

144
00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:31,145
The culprit is still...

145
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,945
What?

146
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:37,945
The boy with the glasses got into the room on the third floor?

147
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,745
There was a rope tied to the veranda where Mr. Sekiguchi was found hanging

148
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,345
so he climbed up that rope to the third floor.

149
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,145
Hey, kid!

150
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,245
-Open up! -Hey.

151
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,645
Hurry up and open the door!

152
00:09:52,245 --> 00:10:00,445
Intruder...

153
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:01,545
-A bell? -Intruder.

154
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:07,645
Intruder...

155
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:11,045
What in the world is happening?

156
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,945
What's with this alarm?

157
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,145
Did you do something?

158
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,445
Conan?

159
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:16,745
Sorry.

160
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:19,445
Dad tried to force his way in

161
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,945
and touched the fingerprint recognition device

162
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:25,845
despite that only the people who live here are allowed to touch it.

163
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:30,445
At any rate, stop the alarm and open the door.

164
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,545
Do you know where the button is?

165
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,145
I'll open the door now.

166
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:38,145
But other than Pops and Officer Yokomizo, please don't come inside.

167
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,545
But they're already...

168
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:45,445
Master!

169
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,945
Hey, hey, everybody's inside.

170
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,445
His pulse is gone and he's not breathing.

171
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,645
Dear? Why?

172
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:58,445
I'll call an ambulance!

173
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,945
I'll go inform the officer who is below about this.

174
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,245
Wait!

175
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,445
I already called the ambulance.

176
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,345
Everyone, please don't move from here.

177
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,908
Ran?

178
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:21,908
Are you still outside the door?

179
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:24,908
I'm here.

180
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:28,708
Then look out for any strange person that comes out, okay?

181
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,308
Inspector Yokomizo and Pops,

182
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,208
will you both check to see if there are traces of the windows

183
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,508
of the other rooms on the third floor having been forced opened?

184
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,708
Why?

185
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,208
Look at this.

186
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:46,408
This is a trace of pills being stepped on, right?

187
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:49,708
It means somebody was here, right?

188
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,508
Right.

189
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,908
Whoever it was probably surprised Mr. Kunitomo,

190
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:58,708
causing him to get an attack and kept him from having his medicine.

191
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,408
And this rope...

192
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:03,908
Is probably what the killer used to get away.

193
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,208
It wasn't swaying!

194
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,608
-What? -Huh?

195
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:12,108
I heard Mr. Kunitomo's loud voice from the interphone on the third floor,

196
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:15,108
so I went to the room downstairs and found the rope.

197
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,608
It didn't even take me a minute.

198
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,608
Hey. Don't tell me...

199
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:23,708
Right. Maybe the killer saw me climbing the rope

200
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,508
and decided not to run away, but came back to this room instead?

201
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:29,408
Could be.

202
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,908
If the killer surprised Mr. Kunitomo to induce a heart attack,

203
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:36,908
took the medicine bottle away, stepped on the pill and crush it

204
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:40,008
and fled after making sure that Mr. Kunitomo was dead,

205
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,108
it would take at least a minute.

206
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,708
The rope should still be swaying.

207
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,808
Which means that

208
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,808
it is very likely that the killer is still here on the third floor.

209
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,408
Why don't we split up and look for the killer?

210
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,708
Good idea!

211
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,008
That's too dangerous.

212
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:02,508
What if you run into the killer?

213
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:06,108
But if we dilly-dally, the killer will get away!

214
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:09,008
Wouldn't it be faster if we all go look for the killer together?

215
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:12,408
Okay, let's do this then.

216
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,508
We search one room at a time.

217
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:17,608
First, I'll go in an check the windows.

218
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:20,208
You all come into the room after me.

219
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,808
Mr. Mouri, please go out into the corridor

220
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:25,908
and stay on the look out for any suspicious person.

221
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,208
Okay!

222
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,208
Nothing abnormal!

223
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,408
Please come in.

224
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:42,908
Nobody's here.

225
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,308
No one here either.

226
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:46,208
Let's go on to the next room then.

227
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:53,208
We searched all the rooms, but there was no suspicious person anywhere.

228
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,208
Moreover, all the windows on the third floor were locked from the inside

229
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,908
and there were no traces of the windows being forced opened either.

230
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,508
Hey, Ran! Can you hear me?

231
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:08,508
Have you seen anyone leave from that door?

232
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:14,008
Three paramedics carrying a stretcher went in and out though.

233
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,308
Nobody besides them passed.

234
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,008
Which means that...

235
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,308
This kid is making up stories.

236
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:24,908
What's with you, man?

237
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:27,408
No, there is still another possibility.

238
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,408
Huh?

239
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,608
When Conan opened the door with the fingerprint recognition device

240
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,308
and we went inside,

241
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,408
the killer who was hiding on the third floor

242
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,608
could've joined in among us.

243
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,208
No way.

244
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,708
Wait a sec!

245
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,308
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

246
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:45,908
Well, not really.

247
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:49,708
We all ran here after hearing the alarm, you know!

248
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,708
Didn't you see us come in from behind you?

249
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:59,708
Well, I do remember that Mrs. Kunitomo was with us right through, but...

250
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,008
Mr. Mouri, do you remember?

251
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,408
Not at all.

252
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:06,708
Didn't I tell you not to let anybody else inside?

253
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:11,208
We'll appoint an officer to stand guard in front of the security door

254
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,508
and close off the third floor.

255
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:17,408
As for all of you, please let me question you once again,

256
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:18,608
understood?

257
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:25,008
In other words, when Mr. Kunitomo was heard shouting over the interphone

258
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,208
of the third floor with the fingerprint recognition device,

259
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,308
aside from Mrs. Kunitomo who was with us,

260
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:33,008
the alibis of the four of you are ambiguous.

261
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,908
Ambiguous?

262
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:39,908
We were staying still in our rooms just as the police told us to.

263
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:42,408
We all have our own rooms.

264
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,808
Why didn't you appoint an officer

265
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:46,908
to stand guard in front of our rooms then?

266
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:48,908
Oh, well...

267
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,608
The point is,

268
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,508
regardless of Mr. Kunitomo saying that

269
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:56,208
he would not see anyone until October 4th is over,

270
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,108
how did the killer enter the room?

271
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,508
Come to think of it, back then

272
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,808
along with my husband's voice through the interphone...

273
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:09,808
I'll see you later.

274
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:11,808
I think I heard what sounded like a knock.

275
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:17,408
My husband didn't seem to be surprised by that sound.

276
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,108
A knock.

277
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:25,008
And right after that, he suddenly shouted and started suffering?

278
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,608
Yes.

279
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:30,608
Don't tell me that he invited someone in on his own?

280
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:32,508
That can't be.

281
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,908
Mr. Kunitomo sent the officers who were investigating the third floor

282
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,208
on Mr. Sekiguchi's case out

283
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,408
and confined himself to his room on the third floor, you know?

284
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,008
Why would he invite someone in?

285
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,308
Even if he were to have done so,

286
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:48,008
the distance between the interphone beside the bed and the door of the room

287
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,808
is pretty far.

288
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,308
It's unthinkable that he'd have an attack

289
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:54,308
just because the killer opened the door.

290
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:56,908
Even if the killer were to have some kind of weapon on him,

291
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:58,808
if his hands were on the interphone,

292
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,708
he would probably have put his finger in the fingerprint recognition device

293
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,808
and opened the door.

294
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,608
What frightened him to the point of not even being able to do so?

295
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,508
What on earth could it be?

296
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:12,608
Let's go over all the incidents that happened so far.

297
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:16,408
Please start by telling me about the ship accident

298
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,508
that occurred 13 years ago off shore Suruga Bay.

299
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:22,308
Did anything out of the ordinary happen before it set sail?

300
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,608
I went to see everyone off at the harbour,

301
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,408
but nothing other than Mrs. Kunitomo's friend,

302
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:32,208
Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly participating happened.

303
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,808
Why did Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly decide to participate?

304
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:39,408
He had been wanting to go cruising with us from some time ago

305
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:42,308
and it just so happened that Namika and Shigeko came down with a cold

306
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,808
and the number of people boarding decreased.

307
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:48,308
If I were to mention something I thought was strange...

308
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:52,308
Mr. Sekiguchi was carrying a large bag.

309
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,908
And the contents?

310
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:59,608
I'm sure he said it was scuba diving equipment.

311
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,208
I see.

312
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,908
And the people that died back then were,

313
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:09,308
first of all, is the chef that used to work here, and Shieko's husband,

314
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,308
as well as Namika's father.

315
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:17,108
The second is Mr. Watabiki's father who worked here as a chauffeur.

316
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:20,108
The third is Mr. Watabiki's younger brother who happened to participate

317
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,208
and go on board.

318
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:28,008
And the fourth was your wife who worked here as a housekeeper, right?

319
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,408
Yes.

320
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,608
You said that Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo and Mr. Sekiguchi

321
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:37,708
were the only ones who survived, but were there other boats on board?

322
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,608
There were, but we were so desperate to save ourselves

323
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:45,208
that I have no idea whether the others got on or not.

324
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,208
I'm not even sure whether an SOS was sent out either.

325
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,908
And after that,

326
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:53,408
your husband start having nightmares, almost got into a car accident,

327
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,608
this strange card was delivered,

328
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,008
the dish cabinet falls over in the middle of the night,

329
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:01,108
and you heard strange sounds in the house.

330
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:04,308
Did anyone here realize that these things were all happening

331
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:07,208
on the 4th of Butsumetsu?

332
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,208
Well, I did realize that it was always the 4th, but...

333
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:15,508
Maybe the master was aware.

334
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:17,508
He used to be hooked on the 6-day calendar, and he used to choose

335
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,408
lucky days marked on the calendar whenever going cruising.

336
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,108
And on the day before something was bound to happen,

337
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,308
he used to always invite Mr. Sekiguchi over.

338
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,108
Then was Mr. Sekiguchi at the house

339
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,508
when Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo heard strange noises

340
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:33,708
in the house where no one else was supposed to be?

341
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,308
Yes.

342
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,108
Mrs. Kunimoto.

343
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,608
What kind of sound was it?

344
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,108
Let's see...

345
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,608
It sounded like something being hit against the wall,

346
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:46,708
like "thud", "thud".

347
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,508
And "slash", like leather being hit.

348
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:51,108
It's as if a ball is being hit against the wall

349
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,808
and being caught with a glove.

350
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,308
Is there anyone who plays baseball in this house?

351
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,708
I don't.

352
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,908
But my younger brother who died did.

353
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:05,108
Hey, hold it.

354
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:08,608
Don't tell me that it's a ghost after all.

355
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,308
What?

356
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:14,008
His nightmare is about the housekeeper that makes the bed.

357
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:16,708
The car accident is the chauffeur.

358
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,808
The dish cabinet is the chef.

359
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:22,508
And if the strange sound is baseball,

360
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:26,808
it all has to do with people who died 13 years ago.

361
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,608
Then don't tell me that the words that are written on the card,

362
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:35,308
"Atone your sins before I shall awaken. I am the fifth soul."

363
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,108
means the spirits of the dead are going to resurrect one after the other?

364
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:41,008
No!

365
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,708
Mrs. Kunitomo! Are you all right, Mrs. Kunitomo?

366
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,908
It's a curse after all.

367
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:50,708
This house is possessed by evil spirits.

368
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,308
Don't be ridiculous.

369
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:56,008
There are no such things as evil spirits in this world!

370
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,608
But a spirit could easily

371
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:01,608
go through the door with the fingerprint recognition device, couldn't it?

372
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:05,308
Right! I'm sure Mr. Kunitomo also saw that ghost!

373
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:07,208
No way!

374
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,408
Right, Inspector Yokomizo?

375
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,008
Well...

376
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:20,008
It's just that my cell phone rang at such good timing.

377
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,608
Yes. This is Yokomizo!

378
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,008
Gosh!

379
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:24,608
Oh, forensics?

380
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:29,008
What? Fingerprints were detected from the rope and medicine bottle?

381
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:31,608
Yes.

382
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,008
Yes. Then there's no mistake that the prints

383
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:38,008
are those of the person who last touched the bottle?

384
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:41,208
So it's the same as having already nabbed the killer!

385
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,808
Because all your fingerprints have already been taken.

386
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:48,108
And? Whose fingerprints did it match?

387
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,108
Well...

388
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:54,608
It doesn't match anyone who works in this house.

389
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:57,608
It's an unknown fingerprint.

390
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,708
What?

391
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,808
No way!

392
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:05,208
Then how did the killer get through that door?

393
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,808
I wonder?

394
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,408
Evil spirits.

395
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,508
It's the evil spirits after all.

396
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:18,408
Isn't it getting very interesting?

397
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:49,708
"Next Episode" -Which means that 13 years ago on September 26th,

398
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,608
the president disappeared?

399
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:56,508
So if we're done, I'd like to get back to work!

400
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,508
Was someone there or not? Which is it?

401
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,708
No one was there...

402
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:05,408
Yes, there was a suspicious figure.

403
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:10,908
Let me explain the truth of the two murders that took place here.

404
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:16,408
Next Conan, "The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Solution)"

405
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:19,476
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:21,476
"Siblings"

407
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,476
The next episode is finally the solution!

408
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:24,376
Or maybe it is the work of evil spirits after all.

409
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,276
-Hey! -I'm sorry.
