(Sadao and Toshiko Surprise Attack!
at Haunted Places!!)

00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,907
(Sadao Kowagari)
Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,809
(Sadao Kowagari)
It's Sadao Kowagari.

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,012
(Toshiko Osoreya) (Sadao Kowagari)
And Toshiko Osoreya.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,613
(Toshiko Osoreya) (Sadao Kowagari)
- And the two of us are...  - And the two of us are...

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,560
(Toshiko Osoreya) (Sadao Kowagari)
-"Oh, so scary".  -"Oh, so scary".

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,110
(Scary)
- "Oh, so scary".  - "Oh, so scary".

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,490
(Scary)

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,918
With that out of the way...

10
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,720
Tonight, we're at this abandoned hotel

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,170
where we've heard
rumours of ghosts coming out.

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,625
It sure looks like a ghost
can come out at any time.

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,128
Look this way.

14
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,131
What is that?

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,702
Someone is over there.

16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,004
But nobody was there earlier.

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,612
What are you guys watching?

18
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,314
It's Sadao and Toshiko.
You don't know them?

19
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,116
Sadao and Toshiko?

20
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,419
(Dash into haunted spots with Sadao and Toshiko)
They're a famous duo who go to haunted places

21
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,822
(Please subscribe to this channel)
and take videos of actual ghosts.

22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,525
All their videos are so scary
that I almost wet my pants.

23
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,428
They have to be fake.

24
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,430
Fake or not, I'm sure
they earn a lot of money

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,732
from all the views they're getting.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,501
All right!

27
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,805
The Youth Detective Squad
should record some ghosts

28
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,207
so that we can stuff ourselves
with broiled eel on rice!

29
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,309
- Okay!
- Okay!

30
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,610
Oh, come on.

31
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,513
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

32
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,215
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

33
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,217
A haunted place overflowing with rumours.

34
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,219
Could there be a terrifying experience
that's chilling to the bone?

35
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,720
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,622
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,025
His name is Detective Conan!

00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:19,933
"The Youth Detective Squad's Test Of Courage"

39
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,107
Maybe we should have asked Dr. Agasa
to come with us.

40
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,009
What are you saying?

41
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,211
He'd totally put a stop to it.

42
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,713
It'll be fine!

43
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,317
I'll beat up any ghosts that come out.

44
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,520
Didn't you use to say
you don't believe in ghosts?

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,823
I can't just let them go on their own, can I?

46
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,224
Guys!

47
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,726
Even if it's an abandoned building,

48
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,927
you can't just enter
without permission!

49
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,629
Tonight, we are visiting

50
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,331
an abandoned hospital
that was closed down

51
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,580
a long time ago!

52
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,001
People only started talking about
this place very recently.

53
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,903
Not many people know about it,

54
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,905
and even Sadao and Toshiko
haven't been there!

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,206
I see.

56
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,008
I heard that a huge baby red demon

57
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,811
comes crawling to you while crying!

58
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,113
No, I heard that a bandaged mummy

59
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,816
chases you in a wheelchair!

60
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,017
You're wrong!

61
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,919
It's a female doctor with long hair

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,522
who attacks you with her scalpel!

63
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,024
It's so chilling!

64
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,426
They are all rather
half-hearted rumours.

65
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,229
It doesn't matter
as long as they're excited about it.

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,812
It's pretty real.

67
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,350
Are you scared?

68
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,650
Of course, not.

69
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,417
Anyway...

70
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,319
They say there's a locked room
on the third floor

71
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,221
where a ghost is said to live.

72
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,723
It's Room 304, isn't it?

73
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,527
That's right. Let's take a video
while making our way there.

74
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,229
All right, let's go!

75
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,230
- Yes!
- Yes!

76
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,730
Don't go too fast.

77
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,500
We should go, too.

78
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,102
Good grief.

79
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,709
Someone's there!

80
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,910
It's just a scarecrow.

81
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,219
And look...

82
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,322
(Keep Out!)
It says "keep out" right here on the sign.

83
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,324
- So, how about we...
- If it says "keep out"...

84
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,726
There really might be ghosts inside.

85
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,429
Let's take loads of videos of ghosts!

86
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,530
- Yes!
- Yes!

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,533
- Let's go!
- You shouldn't go in.

88
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,401
It's dangerous to run!

89
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,805
Good grief.

90
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,500
Guys! It's dark, so watch your step.

91
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,010
Okay...

92
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,416
Everyone, we are now

93
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,410
on the first floor of the abandoned hospital.

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,524
Is this abandoned hospital
really home to ghosts?

95
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,828
Hey, ghost. Are you out there?

96
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,230
If you heard us,
you'd say something, right?

97
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,432
Why would they respond to you?

98
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,803
Did you hear that voice?

99
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,407
- Yes.
- It kind of sounds like a crying baby.

100
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,010
It has to be...

101
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,150
It's got to be...

102
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,714
The baby red demon!

103
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,016
It could be a blue demon, you know.

104
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,718
Haibara?

105
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,819
It's dangerous!

106
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,221
You're going to get cursed!

107
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,622
It's fine.

108
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,420
This has to be the place.

109
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,528
Of course, baby red demons don't...

110
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,202
- Ai?
- Haibara?

111
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,504
What's wrong, Haibara?

112
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,406
Haibara?

113
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,607
- Haibara!
- Ai!

114
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,810
Stop it! That tickles!

115
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,311
It's just a cat.

116
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,813
It's so cute.

117
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,317
So, the baby red demon is really this cat.

118
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,020
Okay, you can get off her now.
You're making me jealous.

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,122
What are you doing to Haibara?

120
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,620
That's what the so-called ghosts really are.

121
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,928
Let's get this over and done with.

122
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,230
Okay...

123
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,132
- Here you go, Conan.
- Okay...

124
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,400
Hey!

125
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,506
You don't have a collar,
so you must be a stray cat.

126
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,409
But still, you're so...

127
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,112
What are you doing?

128
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,814
We're going on ahead, Conan.

129
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,816
Just leave the cat alone.

130
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,117
I know.

131
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,033
We're now on the second floor.

132
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,402
There's a chill in the air.

133
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,704
It's only because it's colder now
that the sun has gone down.

134
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,806
Haibara.

135
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,708
She gets to the point.

136
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,611
Haibara?

137
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,812
Ai.

138
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,215
That sound. Could it be...

139
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,919
The mummy in the wheelchair?

140
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,721
Let's just go.

141
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,325
If we don't go, we won't find out
what's making that noise.

142
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,705
This is it.

143
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,319
Conan.

144
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,450
Haibara.

145
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,222
It's dangerous!

146
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,800
Are you okay?

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,302
Ai.

148
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,205
A doll?

149
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,806
But wasn't there the sound of

150
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,809
someone moving in a wheelchair?

151
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,212
This is what is making that sound.

152
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,417
I see.

153
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,719
I was scared out of my mind.

154
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,150
Still, the doll looks too brand-new.

155
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,226
When was it left here?

156
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,829
Why are all these newspapers here?

157
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,301
Is something the matter?

158
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,903
It's just that
there are several newspapers

159
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,505
from the same day six months ago.

160
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,106
(Fake University Hospital Acknowledges
Medical Error)

161
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,908
(Robbery And Murder Culprit
Runs Away After Gunfight)

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,610
( Unable to make contact
with eldest daughter (30s) )

163
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,712
It's definitely strange.

164
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,000
Hey, Haibara.

165
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,300
Was the doll facing this way before?

166
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,720
Don't say weird things like that, too.

167
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,000
Sorry about that.

168
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,232
Let's go to the next place right away.

169
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,280
Sure.

170
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,802
Goodness.

171
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,905
Next is the locked room
on the third floor, right?

172
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,108
Yes. The very one
where people say a ghost lives.

173
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,911
Let's unravel the mystery behind those rumours.

174
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,312
Okay...

175
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,419
We're on the third floor.

176
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,521
It's even more...

177
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,570
If I'm not mistaken,
it's Room 304, right?

178
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,126
The locked room, I mean.

179
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
Well, yes.

180
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,931
Room 301.

181
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,532
Room 302.

182
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,402
That's Room 303.

183
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,703
Room 304...

184
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,108
What is that?

185
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,409
Ai.

186
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,712
Goodness, it's all just a prank.

187
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,215
Haibara?

188
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,017
What's the matter, Ai?

189
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,219
Something slipped by my feet just now.

190
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,424
It's just the cat from earlier.

191
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,427
Here, kitty! Come here.

192
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,830
It walked away.

193
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,033
Hey! What's that over there?

194
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,707
Is that... It can't be!

195
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,612
Coming at us with her scalpel...

196
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,917
The ghost of a long-haired female doctor.

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,301
Is that... It can't be!

198
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,306
Coming at us with her scalpel...

199
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,611
The ghost of a long-haired female doctor.

200
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,418
She's here...

201
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,720
You guys!

202
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,721
- Let's go!
- Gosh!

203
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,501
There really was a ghost!

204
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,603
We're going to get cursed!

205
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,505
Let's get away from here.

206
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,300
Right, Conan?

207
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,109
Conan?

208
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,810
What are you looking at?

209
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,912
Did something back there catch your attention?

210
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,214
Yes.

211
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,116
You should all have a look, too.

212
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,525
Are the kids gone?

213
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,527
It looks like it.

214
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,700
Did you see the looks on their faces?

215
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,901
I did!

216
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,703
The way they screamed, "She's here!"

217
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,605
It was hilarious!

218
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,507
Do you think we scared them too much?

219
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,008
It's fine.

220
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,010
They were in the way of
what we were doing.

221
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,613
Come on, let's get the preparations done.

222
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,714
Right.

223
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,016
The looks on their faces...

224
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,519
Stop. You're going to
make me laugh from remembering...

225
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,526
They closed the window just now, right?

226
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,027
Yes.

227
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,929
So, what's that...

228
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,304
Don't mess around!

229
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,706
But I didn't even do anything.

230
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,308
Then why did that doll...

231
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,223
- It's a real ghost!
- It's a real ghost!

232
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,930
What is it this time?

233
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,231
What's going on?

234
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,309
They fainted.

235
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,212
I guess we overdid it.

236
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,814
Hey, are you okay?

237
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,417
They both fainted.

238
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,300
I wonder if they'll be all right.

239
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,522
It doesn't matter.
They both got what they deserved.

240
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,426
That was mean!

241
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,528
He's right. Isn't it too much?

242
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,331
But you're the one who scared us first.

243
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,902
We just used the things you prepared
and scared you back.

244
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,605
Besides,

245
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,809
I'm disappointed
that your videos are all fake.

246
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,611
I thought they were all real.

247
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,716
How did you figure out that it was us?

248
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,090
This is how.

249
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,418
Take a look.

250
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,421
There are two people
on the side of this frame.

251
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,323
That's you, right?

252
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,328
What?

253
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,830
Her hands...

254
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,302
What is wrong with this cat?

255
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,804
Hold on. So that means...

256
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,600
Did you two come to
this abandoned hospital alone?

257
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,111
Where's the person who always
scares you in your videos?

258
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,014
They're not here yet.

259
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,315
We always call them over

260
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,318
once we've prepared everything.

261
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,922
What's the matter?

262
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,523
It's the ghost that appeared

263
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,126
when we were on the third floor.

264
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,627
Look at their left hand.

265
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,731
There's a scar
that isn't on Toshiko's hand.

266
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,233
That's not all.

267
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,503
The cat doesn't take a liking to
Toshiko and Sadao,

268
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,606
but it was friendly to that ghost
in the video.

269
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,907
Hey!

270
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,609
Who is this?

271
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,411
It wasn't me, I swear!

272
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,815
You were all running away
before I even got to scare you.

273
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,417
Then...

274
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,419
Could this be...

275
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,421
An actual ghost?

276
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,222
Stop it, Genta!

277
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,625
But that's the only possibility we have.

278
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,027
If it's a real ghost, that's amazing!

279
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,229
It'll go viral for sure!

280
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,333
You guys...

281
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,802
Give it back!

282
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,404
Let us upload it to our channel.

283
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,807
It'll get so many views
if it's uploaded there.

284
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,008
No way!

285
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,110
It's our ghost!

286
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,713
It's mean to take from others.

287
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,915
What are you two doing?

288
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,817
They're just kids!

289
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,119
Give the camera back to them.

290
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,520
That's right!

291
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,122
Please give it back to us.

292
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,524
You shouldn't be here either.

293
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,426
Didn't you see the notice up front?

294
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,328
It said, "Keep out".

295
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,330
We're sorry...

296
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,132
Give me the camera.

297
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,400
I'll delete the video.

298
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,404
But there was a real ghost in their video.

299
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,560
You're breaking the law.

300
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,708
Wait!

301
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,716
Looks like the cat really likes you.

302
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,020
Yes. I often patrol the area, you know.

303
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,425
What's with the scar on your hand?

304
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,829
It's the same

305
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,532
as the scar on the ghost
from the third floor!

306
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,401
So, he's...

307
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,702
That's right.

308
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,404
He's the person behind that ghost.

309
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,207
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

310
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,011
What are you saying? I'm the ghost?

311
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,314
The scar seems to be from a wound
that went through the hand.

312
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,817
In other words, it's a gunshot wound.

313
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,719
It's also a scar from a wound

314
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,621
that didn't receive the proper treatment.

315
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,726
Then, the murderer in the newspapers

316
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,928
who ran away after a gunfight...

317
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,630
(Robbery And Murder Culprit
Runs Away After Gunfight)

318
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,332
So that's why there were
multiple newspapers

319
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,102
from the same day in that room.

320
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,305
It was so that he could
get more information

321
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,507
on the murder he had caused.

322
00:17:55,507 --> 00:18:00,112
That's right. And I'm sure
there's something even more unpleasant

323
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,415
behind the locked door of Room 304.

324
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,819
It could be the gun used in the incident

325
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,821
or the stolen goods he took away.

326
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,925
But the culprit was supposed to be a fat man.

327
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,828
He had short hair and clean clothes, too.

328
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,431
That was when he started hiding here
six months ago.

329
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,300
He wasn't just injured in his left hand either.

330
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,860
He was covered in blood
and writhing in pain.

331
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,605
It's the crawling baby red demon.

332
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,308
He used the bandages left
in this abandoned hospital

333
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,811
to somehow stop the bleeding.

334
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,115
That must have been the bandaged mummy!

335
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,918
I'm sure living in hiding
must have taken a toll on you.

336
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,622
Your natural black hair grew back out,

337
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,325
and you lost quite a bit of weight.

338
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,928
So that's the long-haired female doctor!

339
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,331
In other words,
none of the rumours at this hospital

340
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,433
was caused by actual ghosts.

341
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,003
They were all caused by the same human.

342
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,250
It's the runaway criminal hiding
in an abandoned hospital...

343
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,050
Junji Maruo.

344
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,108
( Junji Maruo (29) )
Junji Maruo.

345
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,000
( Junji Maruo (29) )
That's who you are.

346
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,960
While hiding, your appearance
gradually changed,

347
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,018
and that resulted in those looks.

348
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,825
The people who came here
to test their courage saw you

349
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,420
and started spreading rumours
about ghosts being here.

350
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:28,500
You chased those people out
by deliberately scaring them.

351
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,406
However, you couldn't cover up
that scar on your left hand.

352
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,810
Isn't that why you tried to delete the video?

353
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,613
That's enough.

354
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,817
I'll delete all of you instead!

355
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,922
Watch out!

356
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,426
Hey. Don't make a fuss, okay?

357
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,828
Gosh.

358
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,031
What?

359
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,133
Good grief.

360
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,601
Conan!

361
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,906
Let's see...

362
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,109
Let's run to the second floor for now!

363
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,560
Okay!

364
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,300
Where are Conan and the others?

365
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,031
What do we do?

366
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,912
Where are you guys hiding?

367
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,924
You think I'd be scared of that?

368
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,528
Why?

369
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,050
Why did you take my life?

370
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,901
That's impossible.

371
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,416
You said that you would save me!

372
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,605
- Thank goodness.
- Thank goodness.

373
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,106
We did it!

374
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:52,210
Another victory for
the Youth Detective Squad...

375
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,630
Later, we reported the incident,

376
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,832
and the runaway criminal
Junji Maruo was arrested

377
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,802
after Inspector Megure and his squad
came to the abandoned hospital.

378
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,406
Not only that,
Sadao Kowagari and Toshiko Osoreya

379
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:32,411
were questioned on
suspicions of trespassing into a building.

380
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,613
Of course, all of us also received

381
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,215
an earful from the inspector.

382
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,320
I've had enough of testing my courage.

383
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,126
(Next Episode)

384
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,128
Well, a lot of things happened,

385
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,000
so I'll tell you more
when we get there.

386
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,401
What? Yoshida has gone missing?

387
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,503
A shogi piece...

388
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,604
Hold on.

389
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,706
I've seen this bishop piece somewhere.

390
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,111
What are these long and skinny things?

391
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:14,920
Next Conan,
"The Live Coals On The Farm (Part 1)"

392
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,204
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,906
"Chickens"

394
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,909
There are two chickens in the garden.

395
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,711
Doesn't that make four chickens?
