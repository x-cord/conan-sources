1
00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:02.524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.524
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:06.024
Lost in the forest with a cold blooded killer.

4
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.124
Everyone's emotions shine brightly.

5
00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.324
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:00.011
Summer vacation is here.

9
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:03.511
Mitsuhiko has skipped the morning exercises and everyone is worried,

10
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:05.511
so we go his house to check up on him.

11
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:09.011
But according to his sister Asama,

12
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.111
he told her he was going camping with us

13
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:14.011
and he packed his backpack with sasadango and sun screen

14
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.811
then snuck out of the house early in the morning.

15
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:21.311
Thinking it suspicious, we start to ask around about him.

16
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:24.411
We finally track him to a forest in Gunma Prefecture.

17
00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:29.511
I try many times to contact him on his detective badge

18
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:31.911
but he doesn't respond.

19
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:33.311
And while we're trying to figure out what to do,

20
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:36.311
we run into Detective Yamamura of the Gunma Prefecture Police.

21
00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:39.711
The truth is...

22
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:42.011
I can't say this out loud,

23
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.011
but that veteran officer let a criminal escape

24
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.511
during the crime scene investigation.

25
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:50.111
It's that serial killer, Kiichiro Numabuchi.

26
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.311
Are you serious?

27
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.211
That killer we met in Osaka is here in this forest.

28
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:57.711
That's why you've got to hurry and leave.

29
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:00.511
But one of their friends is somewhere in here.

30
00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:02.311
Hey, Conan.

31
00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:05.611
We've got to let Mitsuhiko know about this right away.

32
00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:08.711
Gosh! Why aren't you answering, Mitsuhiko?

33
00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.511
It's beeping again.

34
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:16.011
It must be Conan.

35
00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:20.011
I knew they'd come look for me.

36
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:23.211
But if I answer them now,

37
00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:25.011
all my effort would have been in vain.

38
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:46.111
"Mitsuhiko Lost In The Woods (Part 2)"

39
00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:52.611
Still no answer from Mitsuhiko?

40
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:53.711
No.

41
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.011
Maybe he fell asleep someplace?

42
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.511
Or maybe Numabuchi's already got him.

43
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.311
Hey, don't say that, Ai!

44
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:05.411
It's not completely impossible, you know.

45
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.311
The man hiding out in these woods is a cold blooded killer.

46
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.911
He went on a three day killing spree.

47
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.711
How do you know all that?

48
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.311
There was a big article in the newspaper about it.

49
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:20.711
He murdered three people.

50
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.211
-It's four people. -Huh?

51
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.911
During the interrogation, he admitted killing four people.

52
00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.711
He said he buried the fourth victim here in this forest,

53
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:30.611
his mother is from this area.

54
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.311
So he was brought here from Osaka

55
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.611
and we were inspecting the crime scene since this morning.

56
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:37.711
But he couldn't remember where he buried the body,

57
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.811
so we had to dig and dig but we couldn't find it.

58
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.811
The detectives from Osaka left Numabuchi in our charge

59
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:48.311
and left to buy lunch, that's when it happened.

60
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.011
You let him escape.

61
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.311
I'll bet he was planning his escape all along.

62
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:59.311
But he didn't act like he intended to.

63
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.311
He was telling us about how he'd always come to this forest to play

64
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:05.311
when his mother came to visit her family.

65
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.711
What happened?

66
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.411
It's so cold!

67
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.311
It's a river.

68
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.111
Hey, are you alright?

69
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:17.311
Yes. I just got a little scratched.

70
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:19.211
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

71
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:22.111
The water that flows through this forest is clean.

72
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.111
When we were kids, we used to drink from this river.

73
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:28.611
My friends and I used to play here a lot when we were kids.

74
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:32.111
That's why I had an easy time talking to Numabuchi.

75
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:35.111
And you let him get away, you're a sorry excuse for a cop.

76
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:37.711
What a mess. We don't have a single clue.

77
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.711
How can we find him even I don't know where to start?

78
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:44.911
Well, I don't know if this will help.

79
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:47.611
You have three clues.

80
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:49.611
A lemony smell.

81
00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:51.511
The names of the generals.

82
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:53.511
And the sasadango!

83
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:55.111
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:57.311
Mitsuhiko got scolded by some strange men

85
00:05:57.311 --> 00:05:59.211
for mentioning the names of those generals.

86
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:01.411
He packed his backpack with sasadango

87
00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:04.911
and came here smelling like lemons.

88
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:07.311
Nothing you're saying makes any sense.

89
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.211
But the lemon scent is a sure clue.

90
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:14.011
The smell's probably from lemon grass or citronella.

91
00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:16.911
It's a common ingredient In insect repellant.

92
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.911
Insect repellant?

93
00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.511
Bug spray.

94
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.811
Remember what his sister Asami said?

95
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.811
She said Mitsuhiko took the sun screen

96
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:28.411
that she'd bought on the shop channel with him.

97
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:31.311
You don't see it in Japan, but in some foreign countries,

98
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:34.611
they sell insect repellant that doubles as sun screen.

99
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:38.611
I see. Mitsuhiko applied the cream

100
00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:39.811
not to protect himself against the sun,

101
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:42.811
it was to keep the bugs away.

102
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:46.911
Which means he meant to come here from the very beginning.

103
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.311
But why?

104
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:50.811
I don't understand the sasadango or the generals' names.

105
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.911
"Kibidango" would point to "Momotaro".

106
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:05.511
Nu... Numabuchi!

107
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:08.011
-Gosh! I'll get him! -Wait!

108
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:11.811
He knows this forest and besides, it's too dark.

109
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.111
We'll get lost if we go after him.

110
00:07:14.111 --> 00:07:17.011
Our first objective is to find Mitsuhiko.

111
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:18.911
Right...

112
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:21.211
I didn't feel it just now.

113
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:25.811
I didn't feel a thing.

114
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:29.311
Why?

115
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.811
Amazing. He was hiding out in a tree.

116
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.111
He's like a monkey.

117
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:39.511
Yes, he is.

118
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:41.111
When he was a child,

119
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:44.811
he told me he used to jump from tree to tree.

120
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:49.711
He said he pretended he was learning to be a ninja.

121
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:51.511
A ninja?

122
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:55.211
It couldn't be, he...

123
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.611
Dr. Agasa, look after everyone!

124
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:02.011
Huh?

125
00:08:02.011 --> 00:08:03.211
Conan!

126
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.611
Don't worry. I'll bring Mitsuhiko back with me!

127
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:07.911
Just you wait!

128
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.011
It's no use.

129
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:21.611
I can't go any further.

130
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.811
I should just give up.

131
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:28.111
Contact Conan and the others and let them know where I am.

132
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:31.211
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

133
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:32.811
That's Conan's voice!

134
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.811
I'm over here. Over here, Conan.

135
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:38.711
Conan...

136
00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:41.411
Who are you?

137
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.911
Guess we're the same.

138
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.911
-Huh? -You and I.

139
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:48.711
We're the same.

140
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.511
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

141
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:55.111
Where are you?

142
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:57.111
If you can hear my voice,

143
00:08:57.111 --> 00:08:59.911
pick up your detective badge and answer me!

144
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:01.811
It's dangerous in this forest!

145
00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:04.211
There's a killer on the loose in here!

146
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.811
Give up what you're doing and answer me!

147
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:08.611
Mitsuhiko!

148
00:09:11.811 --> 00:09:14.511
Gosh! Where are you?

149
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:18.711
If my theory's right, he's somewhere along this river.

150
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:22.411
Is it possible he's already come across that guy?

151
00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:27.511
What's this?

152
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.611
You're the kid that was talking to Yamamura just a little while ago.

153
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.311
Detective.

154
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:36.611
Didn't you leave this forest with Yamamura?

155
00:09:36.611 --> 00:09:41.711
But I think my friend's lost someplace around here.

156
00:09:41.711 --> 00:09:43.011
Your friend?

157
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:45.011
Sir!

158
00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:47.211
Sir! So here you are!

159
00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:51.711
Hey. Why didn't you report that a child was lost around here?

160
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:55.911
Well, so many things were happening all at once.

161
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:58.011
By the way, sir! Big news!

162
00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:59.311
What?

163
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:01.611
Kiichiro Numabuchi's been located!

164
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:03.711
-Really? -Are you sure?

165
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:07.411
So where is he? Has he been captured?

166
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.711
Come on.

167
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:11.911
You know I can't capture him all by myself.

168
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.011
He got away from me so easily.

169
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:19.811
So tell me, where was he hiding?

170
00:10:19.811 --> 00:10:21.911
On top of a tree.

171
00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:24.511
He climbed up the tree like a monkey.

172
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:27.311
When our eyes met, he jumped down and ran away.

173
00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:30.611
And he ran off into the forest.

174
00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:32.611
Isn't that right, Yama-san?

175
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.111
Yama-san?

176
00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:39.711
And then, Conan said he'd go after him all by himself.

177
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:42.211
I wasn't chasing him.

178
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:45.111
I just had an idea where Mitsuhiko might be.

179
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:48.411
He's somewhere along this river.

180
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:50.011
Along the river?

181
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:52.511
What's along the river?

182
00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:54.511
Are you talking about the treasure?

183
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:57.711
No. I just assumed that's where'd he be.

184
00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:00.511
Conan's right.

185
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:03.011
It looks like he was by this river,

186
00:11:03.011 --> 00:11:05.611
but I don't think we should go by that theory anymore.

187
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:09.511
See. This is the cap

188
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:12.311
I borrowed from Mitsuhiko at the last soccer game.

189
00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:16.011
He didn't stop to pick it up after he dropped it,

190
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:18.611
which means he was in a big hurry.

191
00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:21.311
You mean, Mitsuhiko's...

192
00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:23.711
That bad man's caught him.

193
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:26.811
We've got to find him!

194
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:31.311
Okay. We've got to be careful, that boy might be his hostage.

195
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:34.011
-Relay this message to the others! -Yes, sir...

196
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:36.411
This is terrible.

197
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:41.711
If Mitsuhiko's running away, how do we find him?

198
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:46.011
Well, he couldn't have gotten too far.

199
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.511
The perspiration on the cap's not dry yet,

200
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:50.411
and it's still warm.

201
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:53.511
But Conan, you were yelling to him, weren't you?

202
00:11:53.511 --> 00:11:55.911
Why didn't he answer you?

203
00:11:55.911 --> 00:11:59.411
-He probably couldn't. -What?

204
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:02.611
Mitsuhiko probably arrived here just before noon.

205
00:12:02.611 --> 00:12:06.611
We had to ask around, so we got here in the evening.

206
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:12.311
If Mitsuhiko got lost and was calling for help all that time...

207
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:17.111
I'm sure his voice would be hoarse by now.

208
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.711
He wouldn't be able to call out.

209
00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:20.411
That's terrible.

210
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:22.211
But he's got the detective badge,

211
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:24.011
he doesn't need to talk so loud.

212
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:27.911
I know. If he contacted us with the badge,

213
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:29.911
we'd have been able to find him right away.

214
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:32.511
But that's if he could use his hands.

215
00:12:32.511 --> 00:12:33.611
What?

216
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:35.811
Are you saying he's hurt his hands?

217
00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:36.911
Calm down now.

218
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:39.411
Don't get so excited. Let's find him first.

219
00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:42.911
If he's around here, I think we should start looking already.

220
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:46.411
But Mitsuhiko can't talk,

221
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:49.511
and maybe he's been captured by that bad man, right?

222
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:51.411
How're we going to find him?

223
00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:54.611
Then let's go look for that killer!

224
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:57.611
But it's so dark

225
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.111
and I didn't get a really good look at his face.

226
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:02.711
Let's see.

227
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:05.511
According to the news, Numabuchi's characteristics are...

228
00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:09.011
His thin eyebrows, sunken eyes.

229
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:13.111
Hollow cheeks, upturned nose.

230
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:17.711
His face is skeletal, just skin and bones.

231
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:19.011
His postures bad

232
00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:21.611
but he's agile and fast, like an animal.

233
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:24.911
Then all we've got to do is look for somebody who looks like a skeleton!

234
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:26.311
Guess so.

235
00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:30.311
But Ai, how do you know so much about him?

236
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.511
Hey, don't tell me Numabuchi's...

237
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:36.611
Yes. That's right.

238
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:40.511
Kiichiro Numabuchi was once a part of that group.

239
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:44.011
He was once one of your so called Men in Black.

240
00:13:57.062 --> 00:14:01.662
But then he was just one of the small potatoes.

241
00:14:01.662 --> 00:14:04.462
The organization hired him because he was agile.

242
00:14:04.462 --> 00:14:07.462
I think they intended to train him to become one of their hit men.

243
00:14:07.462 --> 00:14:09.362
But he turned out to be useless

244
00:14:09.362 --> 00:14:12.062
so they were going to send him to me

245
00:14:12.062 --> 00:14:16.462
so I could use him as a guinea pig to test my potions.

246
00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:18.062
Are you serious?

247
00:14:18.062 --> 00:14:19.862
That's why I know him so well.

248
00:14:21.162 --> 00:14:23.562
Before he became a test subject,

249
00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:28.562
they sent me his file, complete with photos and personal data.

250
00:14:32.462 --> 00:14:36.662
He escaped before being sent to me

251
00:14:36.662 --> 00:14:38.362
and since I dropped out of the organization,

252
00:14:38.362 --> 00:14:40.162
we never did get to meet though.

253
00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:41.362
He escaped?

254
00:14:41.362 --> 00:14:43.362
I guess he got scared.

255
00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:45.562
He realized how big the organization was,

256
00:14:45.562 --> 00:14:48.462
so he ran and kept running from their influence,

257
00:14:48.462 --> 00:14:50.962
afraid they'd catch up to him.

258
00:14:50.962 --> 00:14:52.862
Poor guy, he killed three people

259
00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:55.162
because he thought they were from the organization

260
00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:56.862
and they were after him.

261
00:14:56.862 --> 00:15:00.062
But then I feel no sympathy towards him

262
00:15:00.062 --> 00:15:02.662
because I heard he killed some people for fun

263
00:15:02.662 --> 00:15:04.662
before joining the organization.

264
00:15:04.662 --> 00:15:07.462
I remember when he got arrested,

265
00:15:07.462 --> 00:15:11.562
he yelled into the television cameras, "It's their fault!"

266
00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:16.162
Yes, but no one believed him

267
00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:18.762
and since he wasn't deeply involved with them,

268
00:15:18.762 --> 00:15:21.162
the organization washed their hands of him.

269
00:15:21.162 --> 00:15:23.762
But I don't understand.

270
00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:26.162
Didn't you tell me once

271
00:15:26.162 --> 00:15:27.462
that you could tell when someone from the organization

272
00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:29.162
was around because of their smell.

273
00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:32.362
That's right. That's why I'm worried.

274
00:15:32.362 --> 00:15:35.262
I didn't feel anything back there.

275
00:15:35.262 --> 00:15:40.462
My sister gave off a smell even before that incident.

276
00:15:40.462 --> 00:15:43.562
That was my only danger barometer.

277
00:15:44.762 --> 00:15:46.762
I must be losing it.

278
00:15:46.762 --> 00:15:48.862
I'm getting too accustomed to this normal life.

279
00:15:51.562 --> 00:15:55.062
I guess I'm getting soft.

280
00:15:57.262 --> 00:15:59.162
Good for you!

281
00:15:59.162 --> 00:16:00.162
What?

282
00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:03.762
That proves you're becoming a normal human being, right?

283
00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:07.662
Come on! We've got to hurry and find Mitsuhiko.

284
00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:12.362
His probably dying to see

285
00:16:12.362 --> 00:16:15.662
the smiles on you and Ayumi's normal faces.

286
00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:17.562
Me and Ayumi's?

287
00:16:17.562 --> 00:16:21.162
Yeah, because the reason he came here in the first place is...

288
00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:25.962
Listen, don't you hear that?

289
00:16:25.962 --> 00:16:27.862
That sounds like the detective badge.

290
00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:34.162
It's getting louder.

291
00:16:34.162 --> 00:16:36.362
It's getting closer.

292
00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.962
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

293
00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:47.462
Numabuchi!

294
00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:51.862
Kii...

295
00:16:51.862 --> 00:16:55.862
Kiichiro Numabuchi! I... I've got you!

296
00:17:00.762 --> 00:17:03.262
Turn all those lights off.

297
00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:07.562
Those lights are going to scare them off.

298
00:17:07.562 --> 00:17:08.962
Them?

299
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:13.562
What do you mean? Are you saying your gang's here too?

300
00:17:13.562 --> 00:17:14.762
That's right.

301
00:17:14.762 --> 00:17:17.562
Be careful, because there's a whole bunch of them.

302
00:17:17.562 --> 00:17:19.362
We're not falling for that one.

303
00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:24.662
Good grief! We were so worried.

304
00:17:24.662 --> 00:17:26.062
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:28.062
You sound bad.

306
00:17:28.062 --> 00:17:30.262
I see your badge is working.

307
00:17:30.262 --> 00:17:32.362
Why didn't you respond to our call?

308
00:17:32.362 --> 00:17:35.362
I know, but my hands...

309
00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:36.662
What's the matter?

310
00:17:36.662 --> 00:17:38.162
You're hurt or something?

311
00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:39.962
Wait!

312
00:17:48.162 --> 00:17:50.462
-A firefly? -Yes.

313
00:17:50.462 --> 00:17:54.362
A summer spectacle not seen in the city.

314
00:17:54.362 --> 00:17:58.362
The old men who were scolding Mitsuhiko at the bus stop were probably...

315
00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:02.062
the conservation group who come to this forest every Sunday

316
00:18:02.062 --> 00:18:04.262
to protect the firefly.

317
00:18:04.262 --> 00:18:05.462
Mitsuhiko probably asked them

318
00:18:05.462 --> 00:18:06.962
for the location of this forest so many times,

319
00:18:06.962 --> 00:18:08.562
they were afraid a lot of children would come

320
00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:10.062
and trample through the forest they'd worked so hard to clean up,

321
00:18:10.062 --> 00:18:11.862
that's why they got angry.

322
00:18:11.862 --> 00:18:15.262
Because fireflies only live in clean water.

323
00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:21.162
But Mitsuhiko was desperate, he had to find this place

324
00:18:21.162 --> 00:18:24.462
so he followed them.

325
00:18:24.462 --> 00:18:26.662
I see.

326
00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:30.462
That's why he was acting so suspiciously on the bus.

327
00:18:30.462 --> 00:18:34.462
He was following them.

328
00:18:35.362 --> 00:18:38.562
Yes. He inadvertently pressed the same button they did

329
00:18:38.562 --> 00:18:41.962
when buying the ticket at the train station,

330
00:18:41.962 --> 00:18:45.362
that's why he bought the adult ticket.

331
00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:48.862
But this doesn't have anything to do with any General's name.

332
00:18:48.862 --> 00:18:52.862
Remember what the girl at the florist said?

333
00:18:53.562 --> 00:18:55.762
She said it was either Uesugi and Takeda

334
00:18:55.762 --> 00:18:57.862
or Toyotomi and Tokugawa either way.

335
00:18:57.862 --> 00:19:01.162
They're rival generals, right?

336
00:19:01.162 --> 00:19:04.862
And another group of famous rival generals would be

337
00:19:04.862 --> 00:19:07.762
Genji and Heike.

338
00:19:07.762 --> 00:19:11.262
Which brings us to Genji fireflies and Heike fireflies.

339
00:19:11.262 --> 00:19:13.662
What about the sasadango then?

340
00:19:13.662 --> 00:19:16.962
He'd moisten the sasa leaves then spread them out

341
00:19:16.962 --> 00:19:19.362
in the bug container making a firefly holder.

342
00:19:19.362 --> 00:19:21.262
He was going to put the fireflies inside

343
00:19:21.262 --> 00:19:22.962
and bring them back with him.

344
00:19:26.262 --> 00:19:30.862
Mitsuhiko did indeed manage to catch some fireflies

345
00:19:30.862 --> 00:19:32.862
but he got lost.

346
00:19:35.362 --> 00:19:36.662
His badge started to beep

347
00:19:36.662 --> 00:19:39.062
and he knew we were here looking for him

348
00:19:39.062 --> 00:19:40.662
but he couldn't use his hands.

349
00:19:41.562 --> 00:19:44.162
That's why he couldn't pick the badge up.

350
00:19:47.162 --> 00:19:50.062
Isn't that right, Mitsuhiko?

351
00:19:50.062 --> 00:19:54.362
Gosh. If you were coming to catch bugs, you should've told us.

352
00:19:54.362 --> 00:19:55.562
Don't be stupid.

353
00:19:55.562 --> 00:19:56.662
He wouldn't have been able to surprise them

354
00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.162
unless he kept it a secret.

355
00:19:59.162 --> 00:20:01.162
On the way home after the fireworks display,

356
00:20:01.162 --> 00:20:03.562
Ayumi and Ai said they'd like to see fireflies

357
00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:06.462
at least once in their life.

358
00:20:06.462 --> 00:20:08.962
What? You mean he...

359
00:20:08.962 --> 00:20:11.462
He did for us.

360
00:20:14.262 --> 00:20:15.562
Thank you.

361
00:20:15.562 --> 00:20:18.062
It was beautiful!

362
00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:23.062
But why'd Numabuchi...

363
00:20:23.062 --> 00:20:28.262
He knew he'd be caught, so why'd he bring Mitsuhiko to us?

364
00:20:28.262 --> 00:20:30.262
Who knows?

365
00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:35.062
Maybe it's because he came here for the same reason Mitsuhiko did.

366
00:20:35.062 --> 00:20:36.862
What do you mean?

367
00:20:36.862 --> 00:20:40.262
He was in the tree listening to us.

368
00:20:41.162 --> 00:20:42.762
He probably figured out that

369
00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:45.562
a kid would come into the forest looking for fireflies.

370
00:20:46.862 --> 00:20:49.662
And once he saw Mitsuhiko had his hands full,

371
00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:51.262
he'd know for sure.

372
00:21:11.662 --> 00:21:17.462
He probably lied about burying the fourth victim here.

373
00:21:17.462 --> 00:21:21.262
He probably wanted to see them one more time before being executed.

374
00:21:21.262 --> 00:21:22.762
See the old friends

375
00:21:22.762 --> 00:21:26.762
he used to play with here when he was a child.

376
00:22:59.762 --> 00:23:04.162
Hey, Ai. Did you see the news on TV yesterday?

377
00:23:04.162 --> 00:23:07.562
There's so much excitement about a great discovery!

378
00:23:07.562 --> 00:23:11.162
Really? Did they find Tokugawa's hidden treasure or something?

379
00:23:11.162 --> 00:23:12.662
Of course not.

380
00:23:12.662 --> 00:23:16.962
It's a legendary animal. Somebody's seen it.

381
00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:20.162
I forget what it's called.

382
00:23:20.162 --> 00:23:24.162
It wasn't "takenoko" and it's not "kananoko".

383
00:23:25.762 --> 00:23:28.362
Tsuchinoko?

384
00:23:28.362 --> 00:23:30.062
Yes, that's it!

385
00:23:30.062 --> 00:23:32.462
I don't know what kind of animal it is

386
00:23:32.462 --> 00:23:34.862
since they switched to another subject.

387
00:23:34.862 --> 00:23:37.062
But wouldn't you like to see one too, Ai?

388
00:23:37.062 --> 00:23:38.462
I guess so.

389
00:23:38.462 --> 00:23:40.662
-Tsu... -Tsuchinoko.

390
00:23:40.662 --> 00:23:43.162
If my memory serves me right,

391
00:23:43.162 --> 00:23:44.962
there's been sightings in Gifu Prefecture

392
00:23:44.962 --> 00:23:48.362
as well as Okayama Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture.

393
00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:49.762
I just remembered!

394
00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:53.762
I'm going to go visit my uncle in Gifu soon.

395
00:23:54.762 --> 00:23:58.262
I bet you're thinking of finding one so you can look good!

396
00:23:58.262 --> 00:24:00.662
-And what's wrong with that? -Of course I do!

397
00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:02.762
I wouldn't do it if I were you.

398
00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:07.862
"Next Episode"

399
00:24:07.862 --> 00:24:11.862
The Princess sleeps not in B, but in A.

400
00:24:12.962 --> 00:24:15.362
Ms. Taira's late, I wonder where she is.

401
00:24:15.362 --> 00:24:18.162
Ms. Taira...

402
00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:27.462
Ms. Taira.

403
00:24:29.962 --> 00:24:31.562
Next Conan,

404
00:24:31.562 --> 00:24:35.762
"Princess of the Isolated Island and the Palace of the Dragon King (Part 1)"

405
00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:38.605
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:38.605 --> 00:24:40.905
"Letters in the sand"

407
00:24:40.905 --> 00:24:42.905
Together with the duo from Osaka again.

408
00:24:42.905 --> 00:24:45.005
They're so happy-go-lucky, I like them.
