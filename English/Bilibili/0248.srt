1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,040
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,840
A pension in the highlands at the end of summer.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
An impossible crime involving a one-path road.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:07,153
"Healing Forest"

10
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:11,853
Thank you for coming all this way to an inconvenient place like this.

11
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:12,953
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,553
"Shiro Murakami (32)" -This is the only road there is,

13
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,053
"Healing Forest Pension Owner" -that will take you to our pension.

14
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,853
We should be there in the next 10 minutes,

15
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:22,853
so please bear with me a while longer.

16
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:24,053
-Sure. -Sure.

17
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:28,353
Is it true that you are running the pension together with your brother?

18
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:29,453
Oh, no.

19
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,053
"Kinji Tateshiba (27)" -I just help my older brother at the pension

20
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,553
during the summer.

21
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:35,853
I see.

22
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:38,253
Come to think of it, Shiro...

23
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:40,953
We're going to be delivering watermelon to dad, aren't we?

24
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,253
No, isn't our priority to see our guests off first?

25
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:46,453
Are we going to stop over somewhere?

26
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:47,953
If so, then...

27
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:51,153
I would like to go to the restroom.

28
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,153
Yes, of course.

29
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:54,453
It's right over there across the bridge.

30
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:56,353
Oh, that's just great.

31
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:59,953
Come on, dad, you're drinking too much.

32
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,153
I only drink a little.

00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,253

"Ryuzo Murakami (60)"

35
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,653
I feel just great.

36
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,753
Well, well, this is indeed a fine vase.

37
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,453
Are you a ceramic artist, village head?

38
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:38,753
No, I'm just doing it to kill time because I live alone.

39
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:42,553
But, I got hurt yesterday and can't do anything today.

40
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:47,953
That's right. Father, this was taken from our field.

41
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,453
I hope you like it.

42
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,553
Are you trying to humor me?

43
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:54,053
Father, Shiro's doing no such thing.

44
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,553
Despite my strongly going against him marrying into his wife's family,

45
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:01,953
he went along and did so.

46
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,853
Listen, Shiro.

47
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,153
I have no intention of lending you money.

48
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:08,353
Take that and get out of here.

49
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,453
I'm sorry you had to see something so unsightly.

50
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,253
I'm very sorry.

51
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:19,453
I guess he just happened to be in a bad mood today.

52
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:22,153
No, he's always like that.

53
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,953
On top of being stubborn, his way of thinking is old fashioned.

54
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:27,753
Hello.

55
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,153
Hi, Aiko.

56
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,653
Making your rounds collecting payment?

57
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,853
"Aiko Misawa (25)" -I was going to,

58
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,053
"Milk delivery person" -but I forgot to bring the ledger.

59
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,553
Would you like me to pay for ours in advance?

60
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:41,053
Thanks, but I'll come to collect it next time,

61
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,653
because I'd like to be meticulous with money matters.

62
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,153
How do you do, Aiko?

63
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,553
I am Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

64
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:52,253
I'm planning to spend the night here,

65
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:54,153
and my room is... let me see...

66
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:56,953
I'm sorry, I've got to make deliveries,

67
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:58,253
so if you will excuse me?

68
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,153
The beauty of the healing forest.

69
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,053
My hat.

70
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,853
Be careful.

71
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:16,653
Don't go into the river because it's dangerous.

72
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,253
I'll go get it for you.

73
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:29,553
Thank God. I've got it, Miss.

74
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:31,253
Thank you so much.

75
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,253
I'm sure glad you didn't get wet?

76
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:36,353
But, you slacks got wet, Mr. Murakami.

77
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,153
No problem. But, more than that,

78
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,353
now everybody knows that I can't swim.

79
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,653
See you, then. We'll pick mountain vegetables for dinner.

80
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:49,353
We're going to go.

81
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:52,553
The part-timer inside will take care of things for you.

82
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,553
-Thank you. -Thank you.

83
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,653
Thank you.

84
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,953
Here's your additional order.

85
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,353
Thank you always.

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,753
Is a tour group or something spending the night here or something today?

87
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:06,753
Oh, well sort of.

88
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:09,553
Hey.

89
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,853
There's no more beer. Beer.

90
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,353
Gosh, dad.

91
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,653
How dare he get drunk and sack out.

92
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,353
Mr. Murakami, did you pick mountain vegetables?

93
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:48,653
Yes, well sort of.

94
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,553
I remembered that I had something to do

95
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,653
that I came back early.

96
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:53,953
I see.

97
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:56,953
But please rest assured.

98
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,853
My younger brother's taking care of gathering the mountain vegetables.

99
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:05,953
Now, where is this now?

100
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:08,153
I tell you, dad...

101
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:15,353
Mouri Detective Agency.

102
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,253
What did you say? The village head had been killed?

103
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,453
I'm back.

104
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,053
Yes. I understand,

105
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:28,753
I'll be right over, yes.

106
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:38,853
"Yoji Midorikawa (54)" -You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

107
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:41,453
"Police Officer" -I'm Midorikawa who is stationed here.

108
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,853
Good work. I'd like to see the murder site.

109
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:44,853
Yes, sir. This way please.

110
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,653
-Father. -Father.

111
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:56,553
A paper knife, so this is the murder weapon.

112
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:59,653
R.M... initials?

113
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:03,653
It's the belongings of the village head.

114
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,053
Judging from the looks of the corpse,

115
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,553
the killer was in the study

116
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,653
and probably stabbed the village head from the front.

117
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:14,053
Since the papers were scattered,

118
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:17,253
does that mean that the killer was looking for something?

119
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,653
About the method of entry,

120
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:21,153
aside from the front entrance,

121
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:23,753
all the other places are locked from the inside.

122
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:29,953
Aiko, please give us the details of when you found the village head.

123
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:30,953
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:33,253
If I remember correctly, at about 5 minutes to 4,

125
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,153
I came here to collect payment for milk.

126
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:39,953
I had him stamp this notebook back then.

127
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:44,053
And after that?

128
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:46,353
On my way to Shiro's pension,

129
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:47,953
I heard someone scream,

130
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,153
so came back here immediately,

131
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:53,153
and found the village head.

132
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,453
And, what time did you hear the scream?

133
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,053
Four o'clock.

134
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,853
I was in the middle of making my round of patrol.

135
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:03,053
I arrived at the village head's house a while after Aiko,

136
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:06,253
which was about 5 minutes after 4:00 pm.

137
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,853
Which means,

138
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:12,953
he was killed only a few minutes after Aiko left his house.

139
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,353
In other words, the killer seems to have been here

140
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:19,153
when Aiko came to collect the money.

141
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:25,453
Pops, his money and credit cards haven't been stolen.

142
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:28,053
Besides, the things on his desk just seem to have fallen on the floor,

143
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,453
that it doesn't seem to be a robbery case...

144
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,553
Ouch.

145
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:34,353
I tell you, don't touch things without permission.

146
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:38,353
It seems that the killer came to see the village head,

147
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:41,653
encountered a problem and impulsively stabbed him.

148
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:48,053
By the way, where were you two at 4:00 pm sharp?

149
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,953
I was already back at the pension.

150
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:54,653
I was probably walking along the one path road.

151
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,753
Can someone prove that for you?

152
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,653
Well...

153
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:03,353
At around 4:10 pm when Mr. Murakami got a call from Aiko,

154
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,153
he was already here at the pension.

155
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,553
And, Mr. Tateshiba came back

156
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:10,053
while Mr. Murakami was on the phone, remember?

157
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,653
And, besides...

158
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,553
Why would we want to kill our father?

159
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,453
It takes at least an hour to get from father's house

160
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,753
to this pension here on foot.

161
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:21,353
If by car it only takes about 5 minutes,

162
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:23,753
but back then I went out on foot.

163
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:27,253
The car was parked at the pension right through.

164
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,153
Any other way of transportation?

165
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:30,453
There is no other way.

166
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,653
There is only one road leading to the pension and besides,

167
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:36,253
it's a dead end street. Precipitous mountains surround the path.

168
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,753
That means it would be impossible to return to the pension

169
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:42,653
from the village head's house in 10 minutes.

170
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,853
Which means that the killer is Aiko?

171
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,553
No. Judging from the wound,

172
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:53,753
the killer would have been splattered with a large amount of blood.

173
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,453
I see.

174
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:58,253
In other words, it would've been impossible for anyone here

175
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,353
to commit the crime.

176
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:01,753
The culprit is most likely a third party,

177
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:04,053
who broke in to steal something

178
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,853
and ended up committing a murder.

179
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:09,953
Something's not right.

180
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:11,153
Something.

181
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:16,053
Will you show me that notebook?

182
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,053
You mean this?

183
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,153
Sure, sonny.

184
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,253
This is...

185
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:35,553
All the documents have to do with the village heads work

186
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:39,053
and are all dated today.

187
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,553
But...

188
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:41,753
Why?

189
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:44,853
Mr. Mouri.

190
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,753
Is it alright if we go back to the pension once?

191
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:49,853
I don't see why not.

192
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,553
The clay has decreased.

193
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:01,253
The village head whose hand was hurt couldn't have used the clay.

194
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,053
Besides, the rope that was on top is also gone.

195
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:07,053
I get it.

196
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,653
What's up, Pops?

197
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,653
-Mr. Mouri? -Dad.

198
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:22,553
It's nothing, I just figured out who the killer is.

199
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,553
The killer is among us.

200
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:41,961
But... you just finished saying a while ago

201
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,561
that it would be impossible for anyone here to commit the crime.

202
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:46,161
As far as Aiko is concerned,

203
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:48,761
she was immediately deleted from the list of suspects.

204
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:53,161
The killer would've had to get rid of the clothes

205
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:55,161
that was splattered with blood.

206
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:57,261
But, she did not change clothes,

207
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:58,461
nor did she have time to get rid of the blood

208
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,161
that would've splattered on her.

209
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:04,861
Shiro and Kinji have both changed clothes.

210
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:09,461
We both changed clothes because we got dirty picking mountain vegetables.

211
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:13,461
Either way, if one of the two were to be the killer,

212
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:17,261
how was he able to get back to the pension in 10 minutes?

213
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,761
He went down the river.

214
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,561
If go downstream the Tsunakawa

215
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:26,861
that flows near the village head's house and the pension.

216
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:31,561
Well, it'd be possible to come back to the pension in 2 to 3 minutes.

217
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,361
But, there is no scaffold in that area where you can tie a boat to.

218
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:39,861
No, there is none. Moreover, since this was murder committed on impulse,

219
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,761
no boat was prepared beforehand either.

220
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:47,461
Are you saying that the killer swam down the river?

221
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,461
Then, I'm counted out because I can't swim.

222
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,961
Then did Kinji do it?

223
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:57,861
-Don't be ridiculous! -Well, let me finish.

224
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:05,561
Most probably after the killer killed the village head on impulse,

225
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,961
he snapped back to himself

226
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,561
and realized that a lot of blood had splattered on him.

227
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:12,061
Therefore, he figured he had to get out

228
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:15,061
of the village head's residence as soon as possible

229
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,761
and wash off the blood from himself.

230
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:20,061
The method he thought of

231
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:23,361
was to use the clay and rope that was left on the dirt floor.

232
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:28,061
The clay and rope, but how?

233
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:32,561
First the killer takes off his slacks that was splattered with blood.

234
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:36,661
He then washed his slacks lightly at the water basin of the dirt floor,

235
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,761
taking the clay and rope with him.

236
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:42,961
He then turned his wet slacks inside out,

237
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,261
smearing clay on the inside of his slacks.

238
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,661
He turns his slacks right side out again,

239
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:51,461
then tied the hem of each side of his slacks with the rope.

240
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:56,161
Next, he holds the waist part of the slacks, filling it with air.

241
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,361
Then, he jumps off the bridge, into the river.

242
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:05,261
The slacks that inflated served as a float,

243
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:09,061
and the killer headed downstream.

244
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,761
Like a child usually plays when taking a bath

245
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,461
by filling the towel up with air.

246
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:17,461
It's the same principle.

247
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:22,861
Clay keeps water from entering the slacks through the seams.

248
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:26,161
All the killer had to do was leave the rest up to the flow.

249
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:28,961
Then he would reach the bank of the river beside the pension.

250
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,761
Almost all the blood that's splattered on his slacks would wash off too.

251
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,261
After arriving, the killer quickly changes clothes

252
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:40,261
and appears before us as if nothing had happened.

253
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:44,161
So, which one of them is the killer?

254
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,361
Before that, Aiko...

255
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,461
Yes.

256
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:52,461
We will be taking that notebook as evidence,

257
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:55,461
so please collect what you have to from Mr. Murakami.

258
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:00,561
Why, at a time like this?

259
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,461
Could you stamp it then...

260
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,361
It seems that you've realized what I'm trying to get at.

261
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:17,761
That notebook, Mr. Murakami...

262
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:21,461
is the very thing that is evidence of you being the killer.

263
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:23,661
-What? -What?

264
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:37,661
Please closely compare the stamps of Ryuzo and Shiro.

265
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,561
Their stamps are interchange?

266
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:44,761
-What? -What?

267
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:49,561
Look. Ryuzo's seat up to last month is stamped nicely but...

268
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:54,161
this month a part of the outer circle was chipped off.

269
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,161
You're right.

270
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,961
Shiro's is,

271
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:01,261
until last month the outer circle of the stamp was chipped off, but...

272
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,261
the stamp for this month is perfectly rounded with no chips.

273
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:05,461
I see.

274
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:06,561
Taking a good look,

275
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,761
it's obvious that the two stamps are interchange?

276
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:10,961
Right.

277
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,261
In other words, Shiro,

278
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,861
that serves as infallible evidence

279
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,161
that you were at the village head's house when the murder took place.

280
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:29,061
Shiro visited the village head's house bringing his own seal with him,

281
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,961
but got into an argument with the village head.

282
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,661
Since the stamps of both men are involved,

283
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:39,061
they must've argued on money matters.

284
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:44,061
Then, one of them threw the papers that were on the desk onto the floor,

285
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:47,461
and this was when their stamps interchanged.

286
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,361
No... It did not interchange today.

287
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,561
I'm sure it was the other day.

288
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,861
That's highly unlikely.

289
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,761
The stamps were interchanged today

290
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:58,461
just before Aiko came here.

291
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:01,461
The papers that are scattered on the floor

292
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:04,261
are all stamped with today's date on them.

293
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:06,261
Moreover, that stamp is exactly the same

294
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:11,561
as the one the village had been using up to last month.

295
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:15,461
In other words, out of all the things he stamped his seal on today,

296
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,661
the only time he stamped a different seal

297
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,961
is when Aiko came to collect payment.

298
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:24,661
He probably stamped a different seal just today.

299
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:29,361
Being that he holds an important position as the village head,

300
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,861
he would never suddenly change his seal.

301
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,361
Besides, whether the seal is real or fake,

302
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:37,361
as well as the fingerprints on the seal can easily be verified.

303
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:43,561
-This could never serve as evidence. -Mr. Murakami.

304
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:48,061
Conan told me that before you went mountain vegetable picking,

305
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,861
you stamped your seal for the liquor man who came to make delivery.

306
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:57,561
If we check which seal that was, then...

307
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:04,761
It's not true, is it, Shiro?

308
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:09,861
Why would you have to kill our father?

309
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,461
Say something, Shiro!

310
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,461
Tell me that it's not true!

311
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:18,161
Father hated me.

312
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,261
I was always being compared with my kid brother

313
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,661
who excelled in everything.

314
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,061
Shiro.

315
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,861
Financial woes because of the sluggish economy.

316
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:35,061
I needed money badly

317
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,361
so I went to ask him for financial aid.

318
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:42,161
Please, father.

319
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,661
At least be my warranter.

320
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:48,361
Enough! When I say I can't, I can't!

321
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,261
Hello, village head,

322
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:09,461
it's sure hot today too, isn't it?

323
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:18,961
You're still there brooding. You're nothing but trouble.

324
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,861
You should have left this house instead of Kinji!

325
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,761
That one phrase...

326
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:29,661
triggered all the anger I felt towards father and I exploded.

327
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:52,061
And,

328
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,061
I quickly wiped my fingerprints off the knife,

329
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:55,761
picked up the IOU and the seal

330
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:57,061
and left the room.

331
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:04,361
The rest is just as Mr. Mouri had explained.

332
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,161
Shiro.

333
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:12,261
Shiro.

334
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,761
Though it was a trick, you thought out a way to go downstream,

335
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:20,061
despite not being able to swim.

336
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:24,961
Therefore, don't you think

337
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,061
that there may have been another way to get around

338
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:29,561
the ill feelings you had against your father?

339
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,361
Whether you make an effort to find a way or not,

340
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,161
is what divides fate.

341
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:20,761
This is supposed to be a Healing Forest and yet.

342
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:22,661
Is pops up?

343
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,461
He's sulky and just pretending to sleep.

344
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:28,561
He's upset because Aiko didn't come to see him off.

345
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:30,761
She can't help it because she's working today and then.

346
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,361
Mr. Mouri!

347
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:35,761
Mr. Mouri.

348
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:39,461
Conan! Ran!

349
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,761
- It's Aiko. -It's Aiko.

350
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:43,261
Aiko!

351
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:45,861
My beautiful Aiko!

352
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:51,161
Please come again for a relaxing tour again someday.

353
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:53,061
I'll give you my word that I'll come again someday!

354
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:57,961
The only thing that can heal me is your smile!

355
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:03,861
We've awakened a sleeping child.

356

00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,861
the person playing the role of Detective Samonji.

The door's not locked.

359
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:20,361
Blood stains.

360
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,461
They lead to the front entrance.

361
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:25,961
Don't tell me that...

362
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:28,161
Mr. Kenzaki, open the door.

363
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,261
Hurry.

364
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,361
