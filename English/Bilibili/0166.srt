1
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.066
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.766
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.466
Today's setting is Trick Ridge.

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.866
A spider's thread eerily tangles in the case.

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.366
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:59.904
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 1)"

9
00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:03.704
"Tottori Prefecture. Trick Ridge"

10
00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:06.904
How strange.

11
00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:10.404
I feel like we're going around in circles.

12
00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:12.104
Hey, Heiji.

13
00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:15.504
Could we be lost?

14
00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:19.804
There hasn't been a person or car that's passed by.

15
00:02:19.804 --> 00:02:21.004
I've forgotten my cellular phone,

16
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:22.804
and we can't call anyone

17
00:02:22.804 --> 00:02:25.504
and to top it off, the bike is out of gas.

18
00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:28.704
We should've caught a taxi after all.

19
00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:29.804
Be quiet!

20
00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:31.904
If it's the map of this area, just leave it to me.

21
00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:33.904
Aren't you the one who forced your way

22
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.104
onto the back of my bike?

23
00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:39.404
But, what're you going to do?

24
00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:41.004
Didn't that letter say for us

25
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.604
to reach that Mr. Takeda's house by tonight?

26
00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:46.104
That's right.

27
00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:49.204
He doesn't write a phone number to contact

28
00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:51.004
and he sends money along with a request

29
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.904
to check out a strange case.

30
00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:55.904
I've have to return the money to that idiot.

31
00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.904
Thought I'd solve that case while I'm at it.

32
00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:00.204
The sun is setting.

33
00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:02.204
Looks like we're going to have to camp out.

34
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:04.604
Camp out? I don't want to!

35
00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:07.304
In a forest like this, without a tent or blankets!

36
00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:09.804
It won't be funny if we catch a cold!

37
00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:12.604
We can get through the night

38
00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:14.304
if we wear a lot of the clothes we brought along

39
00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:16.904
and sleep close together.

40
00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:19.904
Sleep close together?

41
00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:24.704
But, don't get any strange ideas.

42
00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.404
That's my line!

43
00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:30.104
Hey, hey. Don't start a fight.

44
00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:38.004
Kazuha, let's go.

45
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:39.504
Pretend you didn't see it.

46
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:40.904
You're right.

47
00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:43.004
Wait a minute.

48
00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.004
It's just a joke. A joke!

49
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:49.104
My name is Robert Taylor. I'm American.

50
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:53.404
A cameraman who loves the nature of Japan!

51
00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:57.104
I was just taking this beloved forest.

52
00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.904
I haven't been here

53
00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:01.804
since receiving Mr. Takeda's indebtedness.

54
00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:05.104
Takeda? Do you know the house?

55
00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:08.404
Yes. I was just about to go visit him.

56
00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:10.704
Oh, so were we.

57
00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:13.104
Then, will you show us the way?

58
00:04:13.104 --> 00:04:17.304
Well, looks like I got overly taken in by the scenery and...

59
00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:22.104
You wouldn't be lost, would you?

60
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:25.904
But, aren't you going to Mr. Takeda's house too?

61
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.404
Looks like it's a camp out after all.

62
00:04:29.404 --> 00:04:31.604
No, I don't want to!

63
00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:35.004
What can we do? Nobody's passing by.

64
00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:39.404
Hey! Wait a minute!

65
00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:43.104
I said to wait! Didn't I?

66
00:04:46.404 --> 00:04:47.804
It stopped!

67
00:04:51.504 --> 00:04:53.604
What do you think you're doing? Darn it!

68
00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:57.404
Sorry, sorry, didn't think it'd hit you for real...

69
00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:01.004
You're...

70
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:04.204
Oh, Hattori, it's you!

71
00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.404
Which means...

72
00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:11.904
I had a bad hunch something was going to happen.

73
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.104
What's that?

74
00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:16.104
You've received a request on the case

75
00:05:16.104 --> 00:05:18.104
and you're on your way to Mr. Takeda's place too?

76
00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:19.104
Yes.

77
00:05:19.104 --> 00:05:22.404
But, mine is different from yours.

78
00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:24.004
It's official.

79
00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:25.104
The request came from

80
00:05:25.104 --> 00:05:28.504
the present master of the Takeda household, Nobukazu Takeda!

81
00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:30.904
And, I've already received a nice lump of $5,000

82
00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:33.104
on the investigation fee.

83
00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:37.204
Then, what is this request that came to me?

84
00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:41.004
Is there another house by the name of Takeda around here?

85
00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:43.404
Hey, let me have a look at that.

86
00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:44.804
Sure.

87
00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:47.204
Let's see.

88
00:05:47.204 --> 00:05:50.904
"Next Saturday, please come to the Takeda home"

89
00:05:50.904 --> 00:05:54.504
"at Trick Ridge before the sun sets."

90
00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:57.104
"If you don't, another living doll"

91
00:05:57.104 --> 00:06:00.104
"will probably become the victim of the spider."

92
00:06:00.104 --> 00:06:01.504
Victim of the spider?

93
00:06:01.504 --> 00:06:04.704
That's definitely about us.

94
00:06:04.704 --> 00:06:06.804
Nasty things have been going on

95
00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:11.804
and that's how the folks in this area call us.

96
00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:14.404
The spider mansion of Trick Ridge.

97
00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:15.804
If you don't want to be cursed,

98
00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:19.004
stay away, that's what they say.

99
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.104
Trick Ridge?

100
00:06:21.104 --> 00:06:22.904
Spider Mansion?

101
00:06:26.204 --> 00:06:30.204
What? Misa passed away 3 years ago?

102
00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:32.504
Why?

103
00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:36.704
Two to three days after you left here,

104
00:06:36.704 --> 00:06:39.304
she was found hanging on the second floor of the doll storehouse.

105
00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:40.904
Was it a suicide?

106
00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:42.204
Yes.

107
00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:45.704
And soon after that, next was her sister.

108
00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:48.904
Even Misa's mother was found hanging in the same place.

109
00:06:48.904 --> 00:06:50.604
But why...

110
00:06:50.604 --> 00:06:52.804
Well, I don't know.

111
00:06:52.804 --> 00:06:55.804
And, that's not all.

112
00:06:55.804 --> 00:06:58.104
There's still more?

113
00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:00.604
Yes, just the other day.

114
00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:05.404
Negishi, whom brother was indebted to,

115
00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:09.904
was found in the barn in the same way

116
00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:13.904
while we were out, he quietly...

117
00:07:13.904 --> 00:07:17.804
Did that person come in and out of here quite often?

118
00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:18.904
Yes.

119
00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:20.504
Brother is a doll master

120
00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:24.204
and Mr. Negishi sold and transported the dolls.

121
00:07:24.204 --> 00:07:26.904
It's about that Mr. Negishi's incident.

122
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:29.004
The mystery that my brother wants you to solve.

123
00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:30.604
Dear.

124
00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:33.704
I'm Ryuji Takeda, second son in this house.

125
00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:38.204
You haven't got an accent, have you?

126
00:07:38.204 --> 00:07:41.704
Yes, that's because we're always in Tokyo.

127
00:07:41.704 --> 00:07:43.804
We came back on vacation,

128
00:07:43.804 --> 00:07:45.804
but Mr. Negishi's incident came up,

129
00:07:45.804 --> 00:07:50.404
and brother told us not to leave before the detective got here.

130
00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:52.904
Detective Mouri.

131
00:07:52.904 --> 00:07:55.904
I'm Nobukazu Takeda, the one who requested you.

132
00:07:55.904 --> 00:07:59.004
Sorry to have you come all the way out here in the mountains.

133
00:07:59.004 --> 00:08:00.604
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

134
00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:02.504
And, Mr. Detective,

135
00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:04.204
to be honest,

136
00:08:04.204 --> 00:08:08.804
I think Mr. Negishi was killed by someone in this house.

137
00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:10.304
That's the situation.

138
00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:14.904
If you find out who the murderer is, only tell me who he is.

139
00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:20.704
Are the four in the back your children?

140
00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:24.004
If I'm not mistaken, I heard you had only two.

141
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.104
Oh, well, you see...

142
00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:29.604
Nobukazu, it's been a while since we met.

143
00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:31.104
Oh, Robert.

144
00:08:31.104 --> 00:08:32.804
It's been a while.

145
00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:36.104
Haven't seen you since summer vacation three years ago.

146
00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:39.204
I came to see you to thank you, but...

147
00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.204
Well, come in.

148
00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:45.604
Your good friends, Sae and Emi have just come home too.

149
00:08:45.604 --> 00:08:48.404
Oh, you're there.

150
00:08:48.404 --> 00:08:50.804
Oh, Sae. Emi.

151
00:08:50.804 --> 00:08:52.504
You've grown so big.

152
00:08:52.504 --> 00:08:55.104
Murderer.

153
00:08:55.104 --> 00:08:57.104
"Sae Takeda, Emi Takeda" -He came to kill again.

154
00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:58.104
"Daughters of Ryuji and Yuko" -He sure has.

155
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.804
-It's frightening. -Frightening...

156
00:09:00.804 --> 00:09:03.604
You two! What are you saying?

157
00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:06.804
Mother is frightening too!

158
00:09:06.804 --> 00:09:08.104
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:09.904
Oh, don't worry about it.

160
00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:15.604
"Chie Takeda (71), Takeda brothers' mother"

161
00:09:24.504 --> 00:09:25.604
Hey, mother,

162
00:09:25.604 --> 00:09:28.904
why does Emi and I have only half a fish each?

163
00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:30.204
Why?

164
00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:34.304
I'm sorry. I only bought just enough fish

165
00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:36.304
and so I was short two.

166
00:09:36.304 --> 00:09:38.104
Please bear with it.

167
00:09:38.804 --> 00:09:41.004
Then, have this.

168
00:09:41.004 --> 00:09:42.004
What's the matter, Kazuha?

169
00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:45.804
If you don't like fish, I'll take it.

170
00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:47.604
Hey, you.

171
00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:49.204
Delicious.

172
00:09:52.704 --> 00:09:56.004
Huh? Where are you taking that?

173
00:09:56.004 --> 00:09:58.404
"Miyuki Shioya (26), Housekeeper" -To grandmother.

174
00:09:58.404 --> 00:10:01.104
Ever since the Negishi incident, she says it's a curse

175
00:10:01.104 --> 00:10:04.704
and won't come out of her room, so I'm taking it to her.

176
00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:05.904
Is that so?

177
00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:08.004
All right!

178
00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:10.904
I'd better get started in putting the finishing touches

179
00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:12.504
to that unfinished doll!

180
00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:14.004
Well then, Mr. Mouri.

181
00:10:14.004 --> 00:10:15.004
Huh?

182
00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:18.504
Please do a good job on that investigation from tomorrow.

183
00:10:18.504 --> 00:10:20.304
Yes, sure!

184
00:10:20.304 --> 00:10:22.504
Well then, relax and enjoy yourself.

185
00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:23.604
Hey, Yuzo.

186
00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:26.404
Don't you have to go and help brother?

187
00:10:26.404 --> 00:10:28.704
Hold on to your horses.

188
00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.904
I'll have this one last drink.

189
00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:33.404
Can I borrow your car?

190
00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:36.004
I'd like to go and visit Misa's grave.

191
00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:37.404
At this hour?

192
00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:39.704
Yes, if I go now,

193
00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:41.804
the moon would be peeking over the mountain

194
00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:43.504
on the way to the grave.

195
00:10:43.504 --> 00:10:45.604
The moon over the mountain?

196
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:47.404
May I go along too?

197
00:10:47.404 --> 00:10:48.404
Of course!

198
00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:50.704
Hey, Ran. Would you like to go too?

199
00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:52.204
Sure!

200
00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:54.404
Sister Ran.

201
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.404
Conan want to go too?

202
00:10:56.404 --> 00:10:58.104
Take this along with you.

203
00:10:58.104 --> 00:11:00.104
You'd be in trouble if something happened.

204
00:11:00.104 --> 00:11:02.604
-Here! -If something happened?

205
00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:04.004
Take it along!

206
00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:05.504
I don't know what it is,

207
00:11:05.504 --> 00:11:08.504
but that kid is showing first-class jealousy!

208
00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:11.504
Idiot! That's not it.

209
00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.504
Well, then.

210
00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:17.304
Then, dear.

211
00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:20.004
We're going to take a bath first

212
00:11:20.004 --> 00:11:21.904
so please watch the firewood.

213
00:11:35.004 --> 00:11:37.504
Those two are suspicious, aren't they?

214
00:11:37.504 --> 00:11:39.404
You're right.

215
00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:42.104
Hey! Brother!

216
00:11:42.104 --> 00:11:44.204
Brother!

217
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.704
Yuzo, what's the matter?

218
00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:49.304
Brother isn't around! In the workshop or anywhere else!

219
00:11:49.304 --> 00:11:51.104
-What? -What's that?

220
00:11:51.104 --> 00:11:52.104
What about the barn?

221
00:11:52.104 --> 00:11:53.304
Did you look in the storehouse?

222
00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:56.004
I looked in both places, but he wasn't there.

223
00:11:56.004 --> 00:11:57.304
How about the second floor of the storehouse?

224
00:11:57.304 --> 00:11:58.704
No.

225
00:11:59.904 --> 00:12:01.204
Something's wrong.

226
00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:03.204
The second floor window of the storehouse is open.

227
00:12:03.204 --> 00:12:05.304
Two people have committed suicide there

228
00:12:05.304 --> 00:12:09.004
and no one wants to go close to that place, but...

229
00:12:14.204 --> 00:12:16.104
The stairs are over there!

230
00:12:16.104 --> 00:12:17.504
Hey.

231
00:12:20.204 --> 00:12:23.104
It won't open! It's locked from inside!

232
00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:25.504
Somebody, bring an axe or something!

233
00:12:25.504 --> 00:12:27.004
Sure.

234
00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:41.704
This is...

235
00:12:49.293 --> 00:12:51.593
Brother.

236
00:12:51.593 --> 00:12:52.993
That's right...

237
00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:54.293
Hurry, call an ambulance!

238
00:12:54.293 --> 00:12:55.493
Yes!

239
00:12:55.493 --> 00:12:57.293
That's not what you need.

240
00:12:57.293 --> 00:13:00.893
You've to call the police, not an ambulance.

241
00:13:00.893 --> 00:13:02.793
He's already cold.

242
00:13:02.793 --> 00:13:05.593
I'd say it's about an hour since he died.

243
00:13:05.593 --> 00:13:07.593
-What? -What are you talking about?

244
00:13:07.593 --> 00:13:09.593
Don't come in!

245
00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:12.393
This may be the site of a murder.

246
00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:14.293
Murder?

247
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.893
I received a letter,

248
00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:18.093
"A live doll will be"

249
00:13:18.093 --> 00:13:21.093
"the victim of the spider here again tonight".

250
00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:23.793
A letter that forecasted this murder!

251
00:13:24.493 --> 00:13:28.493
"Again" means an incident has happened before.

252
00:13:28.493 --> 00:13:30.593
That's why I came to stop the murder tonight

253
00:13:30.593 --> 00:13:34.093
and to solve the mystery of the previous ones.

254
00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:35.993
But, it was boldly done in front of me.

255
00:13:35.993 --> 00:13:38.793
Who are you, anyway?

256
00:13:38.793 --> 00:13:40.493
Heiji Hattori!

257
00:13:40.493 --> 00:13:43.493
A pretty well-known detective in the Kansai area!

258
00:13:43.493 --> 00:13:45.193
Detective?

259
00:13:45.193 --> 00:13:47.193
I think I've heard about it.

260
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:52.293
The story of a really sharp young detective in the Osaka area.

261
00:13:52.293 --> 00:13:55.093
Huh? But, is it all right?

262
00:13:55.093 --> 00:13:57.493
That kid is in the room too.

263
00:13:57.493 --> 00:13:59.193
Oh, never mind!

264
00:13:59.193 --> 00:14:02.693
That kid is like my assistant.

265
00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:07.893
A thumbtack?

266
00:14:10.893 --> 00:14:14.493
The surface is rusty, but the needle is new.

267
00:14:14.493 --> 00:14:16.893
Looks like it just came loose.

268
00:14:18.393 --> 00:14:21.293
But, why is it here?

269
00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:24.393
Anyway, please hurry and call the police.

270
00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:25.993
Oh, yes.

271
00:14:27.293 --> 00:14:29.593
But, if this is a murder,

272
00:14:29.593 --> 00:14:32.593
how did the murderer get out from here?

273
00:14:32.593 --> 00:14:34.793
It must be that small window.

274
00:14:34.793 --> 00:14:36.693
He probably used a rope or something.

275
00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:39.193
That's impossible.

276
00:14:39.193 --> 00:14:43.493
That window is only big enough to barely let a child through.

277
00:14:43.493 --> 00:14:45.093
-Huh? -What?

278
00:14:45.993 --> 00:14:47.293
Wait a minute.

279
00:14:47.293 --> 00:14:49.593
The door was locked from the inside,

280
00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:52.793
so we broke the door down and came in.

281
00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:56.893
And, if a person can't get out of that window...

282
00:14:56.893 --> 00:15:00.693
Then, this is a murder in a sealed room.

283
00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:03.793
It's Her Excellency.

284
00:15:03.793 --> 00:15:06.693
The Spider Empress used her six long legs

285
00:15:06.693 --> 00:15:08.693
to climb the storehouse wall and from the window,

286
00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:12.693
she strangled Nobukazu with her thread.

287
00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:15.193
She wanted to get even with Nobukazu

288
00:15:15.193 --> 00:15:17.793
for building a storehouse here.

289
00:15:17.793 --> 00:15:19.993
Frightening, frightening.

290
00:15:19.993 --> 00:15:23.493
You're detectives. If you keep calling it a murder,

291
00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:27.293
Her Excellency will curse you too.

292
00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.593
What's the Spider Empress?

293
00:15:29.593 --> 00:15:33.393
It's an ancient tale of this area.

294
00:15:33.393 --> 00:15:35.393
Long ago, at this ridge,

295
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:39.093
there was a woman as beautiful as an angel.

296
00:15:39.093 --> 00:15:41.393
She stopped travelers who passed this ridge

297
00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:43.393
and asked them riddles.

298
00:15:43.393 --> 00:15:45.193
"Do you think there's a heaven?"

299
00:15:45.193 --> 00:15:48.493
"Would you like to go there?"

300
00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:49.493
All the travelers

301
00:15:49.493 --> 00:15:52.093
were taken by the strange beauty of the woman

302
00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:53.993
and replied, "yes".

303
00:15:53.993 --> 00:15:58.393
They were taken deep into the forest and were never seen again.

304
00:15:58.393 --> 00:16:01.493
A doll master heard of the rumor

305
00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.993
and put a human-sized puppet

306
00:16:02.993 --> 00:16:06.093
on the road of the ridge and watched.

307
00:16:07.493 --> 00:16:10.293
As expected, the woman appeared and asked her riddle,

308
00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:12.693
but the doll did not reply.

309
00:16:12.693 --> 00:16:14.293
The woman became angry,

310
00:16:14.293 --> 00:16:17.193
showing her true identity as a giant spider.

311
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:19.593
She attacked the puppet.

312
00:16:20.993 --> 00:16:22.593
The doll master who was watching,

313
00:16:22.593 --> 00:16:24.993
shot a fire arrow that he brought

314
00:16:24.993 --> 00:16:26.493
and the giant spider who was engulfed in flames

315
00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:28.893
escaped into the forest.

316
00:16:29.993 --> 00:16:32.093
The doll master followed the spider

317
00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:36.593
and found it burnt to death with her children in their nest.

318
00:16:38.493 --> 00:16:41.193
After that, the village people who feared a curse

319
00:16:41.193 --> 00:16:43.193
built a small shrine on that nest

320
00:16:43.193 --> 00:16:45.293
calling it the "Spider Empress"

321
00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:49.093
and, they came to call this ridge, "Trick Ridge".

322
00:16:49.093 --> 00:16:51.893
It's just a fairy tale.

323
00:16:51.893 --> 00:16:54.093
Why does there have to be a curse with that?

324
00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:58.793
This storehouse stands where that shrine used to be.

325
00:16:58.793 --> 00:17:00.293
The shrine was broken down?

326
00:17:00.293 --> 00:17:01.593
Yes.

327
00:17:01.593 --> 00:17:04.093
Father was a doll master and, after brother took after him,

328
00:17:04.093 --> 00:17:05.393
he built this storehouse

329
00:17:05.393 --> 00:17:08.193
against the wishes of the village people.

330
00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.893
Three years after the storehouse was built,

331
00:17:09.893 --> 00:17:13.593
Misa, brother's daughter and his wife, Kinuyo

332
00:17:13.593 --> 00:17:16.893
was found having committed suicide.

333
00:17:16.893 --> 00:17:22.193
The two were found pitifully tangled up in a spider's web.

334
00:17:22.193 --> 00:17:25.193
And, again, three years later, the other day.

335
00:17:25.193 --> 00:17:28.093
This time Mr. Negishi was found in the strings in the barn.

336
00:17:28.093 --> 00:17:29.293
Strings?

337
00:17:29.293 --> 00:17:33.493
They were tangled around Mr. Negishi's hands and legs.

338
00:17:33.493 --> 00:17:35.793
Strings used for marionettes.

339
00:17:35.793 --> 00:17:38.093
Just as brother was.

340
00:17:38.093 --> 00:17:41.693
As if they were wrapped in a spider's threads.

341
00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.093
I see.

342
00:17:43.093 --> 00:17:46.393
That's why it's called the spider mansion of Trick Ridge.

343
00:17:46.393 --> 00:17:49.593
Somebody's using that curse

344
00:17:49.593 --> 00:17:52.793
to commit these murders.

345
00:17:52.793 --> 00:17:55.293
Come to think of it, the area around the grave,

346
00:17:55.293 --> 00:17:56.993
where Robert and the others went,

347
00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:01.293
used to be the place where the Spider Empress appeared.

348
00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:02.493
Could it be?

349
00:18:04.493 --> 00:18:06.093
Making Ran take that cellular phone

350
00:18:06.093 --> 00:18:07.993
was the right thing to do after all.

351
00:18:07.993 --> 00:18:10.493
Darn, the house phone is in use.

352
00:18:11.193 --> 00:18:12.993
Hey, Uncle!

353
00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:14.493
Lend me your cellular phone! Hey!

354
00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.293
-Uncle! -Here!

355
00:18:17.893 --> 00:18:19.493
The cellular phone I borrowed!

356
00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:20.393
Who are you going to call?

357
00:18:20.393 --> 00:18:22.793
Kazuha...

358
00:18:22.793 --> 00:18:24.393
You were back.

359
00:18:24.393 --> 00:18:26.893
What's the matter? You're out of breath.

360
00:18:26.893 --> 00:18:28.793
I told them that the place that you went to

361
00:18:28.793 --> 00:18:30.593
had a mysterious past

362
00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:32.793
and they turned pale and went flying out.

363
00:18:32.793 --> 00:18:35.393
Oh, you were worried?

364
00:18:35.393 --> 00:18:38.193
Idiot. That's not it.

365
00:18:38.193 --> 00:18:41.993
It suddenly started raining, so we came back early.

366
00:18:41.993 --> 00:18:44.993
A lot of landslides occur in this area.

367
00:18:44.993 --> 00:18:48.093
Dear, what's all the noise about?

368
00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:51.193
Well, actually...

369
00:18:51.193 --> 00:18:54.593
Nobukazu has died?

370
00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:56.793
On the second floor of that storehouse again?

371
00:18:56.793 --> 00:18:58.293
Dear, is that really true?

372
00:18:58.293 --> 00:19:00.893
Yes, and the door was locked.

373
00:19:00.893 --> 00:19:03.093
And the police?

374
00:19:03.093 --> 00:19:05.393
Miyuki is calling them now.

375
00:19:05.393 --> 00:19:07.193
It's terrible!

376
00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:08.993
There's been a landslide

377
00:19:08.993 --> 00:19:11.693
and the police won't be here until tomorrow.

378
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:12.693
What?

379
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:14.293
Can't help it.

380
00:19:14.293 --> 00:19:17.793
Robert, can I borrow your camera?

381
00:19:17.793 --> 00:19:19.293
Sure.

382
00:19:19.293 --> 00:19:21.793
What're you going to do with a camera?

383
00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:25.993
What else? We're going to do the investigations.

384
00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:29.393
We can't wait until daybreak.

385
00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:30.893
Who's "we"?

386
00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:33.593
Who else could there be?

387
00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:37.593
Me and this old man, right?

388
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:38.793
Then, everyone.

389
00:19:38.793 --> 00:19:42.893
Until the police arrive tomorrow, please rest in your rooms!

390
00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:46.493
Please don't undertake any activity on your own!

391
00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:51.293
That's strange.

392
00:19:51.293 --> 00:19:52.593
What's the matter?

393
00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:55.693
The mascot that was on my pouch is gone.

394
00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:58.793
I thought I had it before I got in the car but...

395
00:19:58.793 --> 00:20:01.393
Then, maybe it's in the car?

396
00:20:01.393 --> 00:20:04.093
Then, I guess I'll have to go and find it tomorrow.

397
00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:09.493
Do you want to go look for it now?

398
00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:14.393
Yuzo has forgotten the car keys that he had lent to Robert

399
00:20:14.393 --> 00:20:17.393
and I have a pen-light.

400
00:20:17.393 --> 00:20:22.293
But, Father said not to leave the room.

401
00:20:22.293 --> 00:20:24.593
It wouldn't hurt to just take a peek.

402
00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:40.593
How is it? Is it there?

403
00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:43.093
Nope, looks like not.

404
00:20:44.393 --> 00:20:46.693
I probably dropped it in the mountain.

405
00:20:46.693 --> 00:20:48.093
Darn it.

406
00:20:48.093 --> 00:20:51.293
Maybe it was before you got in the car.

407
00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:52.793
Remember, you dropped your pouch

408
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.893
and picked it up in a hurry!

409
00:20:54.893 --> 00:20:57.293
It was probably then.

410
00:20:57.293 --> 00:20:59.993
Was that mascot that important?

411
00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:05.093
It was that Kudo who bought that mascot, wasn't it?

412
00:21:05.093 --> 00:21:06.793
It's no good trying to hide it.

413
00:21:06.793 --> 00:21:09.193
It's written all over your face.

414
00:21:10.793 --> 00:21:14.493
Boy, I envy that guy Kudo.

415
00:21:14.493 --> 00:21:17.693
You think about him so much,

416
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:20.593
and where has he gone?

417
00:21:20.593 --> 00:21:26.193
If I were a man, I'd take you away from a cold guy like him!

418
00:21:26.193 --> 00:21:29.793
I tell you, Shinichi isn't my guy.

419
00:21:29.793 --> 00:21:32.793
And, he isn't cold.

420
00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:36.093
He always seems to be looking over me.

421
00:21:36.093 --> 00:21:38.693
Huh? Is he close by?

422
00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:42.193
Nope. I just feel that way.

423
00:21:42.193 --> 00:21:44.293
If I'm not mistaken, it was in this area.

424
00:21:44.293 --> 00:21:48.793
Robert parked the car and we came running over.

425
00:21:48.793 --> 00:21:50.993
Ryuji called out to us.

426
00:21:50.993 --> 00:21:53.793
I dropped my pouch when I turned around.

427
00:21:55.093 --> 00:21:57.593
Oh, no! I'm almost out of battery!

428
00:21:57.593 --> 00:22:00.693
If it's batteries, there's some in my CD player.

429
00:22:00.693 --> 00:22:02.393
I'll go get them.

430
00:22:05.093 --> 00:22:07.193
She's really a nice girl.

431
00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:10.493
Leaving a nice girl like that all alone...

432
00:22:10.493 --> 00:22:14.293
That Kudo, where could he be roaming around?

433
00:22:15.493 --> 00:22:17.693
What's this? This white ball.

434
00:22:21.093 --> 00:22:22.493
It's come after all.

435
00:22:22.493 --> 00:22:24.793
It sure has.

436
00:22:24.793 --> 00:22:26.193
We saw it, didn't we?

437
00:22:26.193 --> 00:22:28.393
We did. The spider's thread.

438
00:22:28.393 --> 00:22:29.993
It's frightening, isn't it?

439
00:22:29.993 --> 00:22:31.793
Frightening, frightening.

440
00:24:04.093 --> 00:24:06.693
Hey, what's that sound?

441
00:24:06.693 --> 00:24:07.793
It's the stairs.

442
00:24:09.793 --> 00:24:12.993
Heavy feet. It's not Ran.

443
00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:15.993
Who could it be?

444
00:24:17.493 --> 00:24:19.193
Kazuha! Where are you?

445
00:24:24.393 --> 00:24:26.493
Kazuha!

446
00:24:27.993 --> 00:24:29.393
