1
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.640
Oh no! I'm late!

2
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.840
You're late.

3
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.940
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.940
Where're Genta and Mitsuhiko?

5
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.640
Oh boy.

6
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.240
-What the? That hurts! -I'm sorry!

7
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.540
My hand slipped.

8
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.640
It's because you twirl it around exerting too much strength.

9
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.440
I've only got two more days to go,

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.640
so that's why I get a bit carried away!

11
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.840
The renovation of the flower clock that took quite a while

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.540
has finally been completed

13
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.440
and an event celebrating the renovated flower clock being displayed

14
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.140
is going to be held.

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.140
Ayumi was chosen as

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.240
one of the grade school baton twirlers to perform there.

17
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.640
That's why she practices like this every morning.

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.140
It's him.

19
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.040
Like the fog clears.

20
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.140
Let's see through love and crime as well.

21
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.940
A mysterious incident that occurs at a park.

22
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.840
The flower clock knows the truth.

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.740
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.740
"The Flower Clock Knows"

27
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.940
-So, he's the stalker? -Yep.

28
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.040
He was here yesterday and the day before yesterday, too.

29
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.540
I'm glad we came to serve as your bodyguards!

30
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.840
-Yes. -You can count on us!

31
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.740
Hey, hey. Cut it out, will you?

32
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.840
Ayumi's afraid, can't you see?

33
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.040
Be careful!

34
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.340
You don't know what kind of person he could be.

35
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.340
He stinks of liquor!

36
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.340
What's wrong?

37
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.040
Are you okay?

38
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.540
If he climbs up some place like that drunk...

39
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.240
Is he drunk?

40
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.140
Yeah, he really smelled of liquor.

41
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.940
If he falls from that height,

42
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.740
he's gonna be more than wounded.

43
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.540
I'm sorry, everybody.

44
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.340
For making you get up so early.

45
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.640
It's okay

46
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.940
because we all agreed to do so.

47
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.240
Besides, we can't let you go to a place

48
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.040
where a man like that appears all by yourself, you know.

49
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040
Thank you, Ai.

50
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.540
I know I've seen that cap and coat somewhere before.

51
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.040
Do you know him?

52
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.340
I can't really say.

53
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.840
I'm sure I could tell if I saw his face, though.

54
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.740
Didn't you get to see his face when he exhaled on you?

55
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.840
He was wearing his cap deeply over his head, you see.

56
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.340
"The next day" -I wonder if he's coming today, too.

57
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.540
If he comes, I'll make sure we disclose his identity today!

58
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.940
Sure thing!

59
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.140
Isn't he the one?

60
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.740
Is he dead?

61
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.240
Yeah.

62
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.440
A scratch wound on his cheek.

63
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.140
Did he get it cut by the tip of the needle?

64
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.940
He sure is skinny, isn't he?

65
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.940
Paint?

66
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.540
So, he was a stalker!

67
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.540
He was after Ayumi who was practicing from early morning!

68
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.440
He came yesterday, too!

69
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440
He seemed totally wasted!

70
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.840
And he climbed this arch.

71
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.440
He climbed this arch drunk?

72
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.040
He almost dangerously fell off.

73
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.540
The dead body was pretty stink with liquor, too.

74
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.940
Inspector!

75
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.840
He's the security guard who made rounds around this park last night.

76
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.340
Thank you for coming.

77
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.740
About what time did you make your rounds around this flower clock?

78
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.240
I start my rounds from 3:00 a.m.

79
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.840
I came and checked the area around this flower clock

80
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.140
about 3:50 a.m.

81
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.740
Did you see the dead body then?

82
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.440
No, it wasn't there.

83
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.140
There were no signs of the flowers being messed up either.

84
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.540
This is an accident.

85
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.840
Mr. Mouri.

86
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.040
What brings you here?

87
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.740
Ran told me to come get Conan

88
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.240
because he hasn't come home yet, so...

89
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.240
The stone that stands for "6" on the face of the clock

90
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.340
is located right below the arch.

91
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.940
In other words, he climbed the arch drunk, fell

92
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.040
and hit his head on this stone.

93
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.840
I guess that's what roughly happened.

94
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.340
It looks to be so.

95
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.640
And the man died between 03:50 to 04:30.

96
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.940
Since the man had a scratch wound on his cheek

97
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.240
that was made by the long hand of the clock,

98
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.040
I think that after the man fell,

99
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.540
the hand of the clock pointed to 30 minutes.

100
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.840
What time did you all come here?

101
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.640
Let's see...

102
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.640
About 05:20.

103
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.440
In other words, the man got wounded on his cheek at 04:30.

104
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.540
Okay, then Mr. Mouri,

105
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.240
will you take the children home?

106
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.540
Huh? You mean you want me to take them home?

107
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.640
You came to pick them up, didn't you?

108
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.140
This case is an accident,

109
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.240
so all I have left to do is to confirm the man's identity.

110
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.340
I've got a rough idea who is he already anyway.

111
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.240
Huh? What's that?

112
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.740
Isn't he a painter?

113
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.540
He had paint traces on his hand.

114
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.040
He could've got something like that on himself anywhere.

115
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.240
But he had old paint stains

116
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.040
that were deep into the wrinkles of his palm too,

117
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.940
so I'm sure he's somebody that used paint all the time.

118
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.240
It's just as Conan says.

119
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.340
Well, that's the way it is.

120
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.540
So, there's no need for Sleeping Kogoro

121
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.840
to come to the scene this time.

122
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.640
I guess not.

123
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.740
Okay, you guys, let's head home!

124
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.040
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

125
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.140
What is it all of a sudden?

126
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.140
I remember now!

127
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.840
I remember where I met that man.

128
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.840
He came over to our store once to buy liquor!

129
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.940
Thanks to Genta's father's testimony,

130
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.740
we found out that the man was a factory worker

131
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.940
at a sign factory in the neighborhood.

132
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.240
No doubt about it.

133
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.840
This is Shosaku Yoda, who works for us.

134
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.240
So, he got drunk and died.

135
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.840
Just as would be expected of him.

136
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.940
Did he have a bad habit with liquor to begin with?

137
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.940
Yeah.

138
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.340
When drunk, he used to feel brave and get violent.

139
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.940
Super awesome!

140
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.640
That's Yoda's last work.

141
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.440
Huh? It's broken.

142
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.640
The other day, Yoda tried to put the sign up while drunk

143
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.940
and fell along with the sign.

144
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.140
Ever since then, he became afraid of high places,

145
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.740
rested work and soaked himself in liquor.

146
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.440
Afraid of high places?

147
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.940
But he...

148
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.640
Will you please give us the details?

149
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.340
The culprit got the better of us.

150
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.240
Just what do you mean, Conan?

151
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.240
Mr. Yoda was afraid of heights.

152
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.140
How could a person like that climb up the arch?

153
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.040
Then, who was it that appeared before us?

154
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.140
Most probably the culprit.

155
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.540
Without knowing that Mr. Yoda had become afraid of heights,

156
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.640
he pretended to be Mr. Yoda and repeated weird actions.

157
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.940
By doing so, he wanted to make a homicide look like an accident.

158
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.940
No way.

159
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.940
He probably used Ayumi who was practicing

160
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.540
to set her up as an eye-witness.

161
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.740
How ruthless!

162
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.240
How dare he use Ayumi for something like that.

163
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.340
-He can't be forgiven! -Right!

164
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.340
Let's find the culprit for her sake!

165
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.340
Yes!

166
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.340
Check the scene of the crime 100 times.

167
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.540
That's the basis of an investigation!

168
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.940
Right.

169
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.040
Hide!

170
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.340
"Kyoichiro Kawaguchi (30), PE teacher" -Mr. Kyoichiro Kawaguchi.

171
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.740
You're a PE teacher at a high school in Niigata, aren't you?

172
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.740
Yes, that's right.

173
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.840
You know Mr. Shosaku Yoda, don't you?

174
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.140
Of course, I know him well.

175
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.640
He's one person I can't stop hating.

176
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.140
Mr. Yoda who was working as an art teacher

177
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.140
at the same high school as you three years ago,

178
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.540
fell in love with your lover who was also

179
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.140
an English teacher at the same high school

180
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.740
and took her away from you.

181
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.340
Mr. Yoda who aggressively made her go driving with him one day,

182
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.040
got into an accident along the way

183
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.740
and only she ended up dead.

184
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.040
That was no accident.

185
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.840
Yoda made it look like an accident

186
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.040
and killed my lover!

187
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.240
You've been staying over at a business hotel

188
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.240
in front of Haido Station since a week ago, haven't you?

189
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.940
I came to look for Yoda

190
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.140
because I heard rumors that he was in this area.

191
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.840
By the way, where were you

192
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.640
between the hours of 03:50 to 04:30 last night?

193
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.340
You want my alibi?

194
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.140
I sure am lucky.

195
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.040
What do you mean?

196
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.140
Please contact 119

197
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.640
and ask them when I called the ambulance.

198
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.140
Ambulance?

199
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.240
I'm a scatterbrain, you see.

200
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.140
I mistakenly drank a button type battery

201
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.040
along with the medicine tablet I took.

202
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.340
That's why I called an ambulance.

203
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.040
Well, but after I was examined at the hospital,

204
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.140
it turned out that I just drank a plain button so all was well.

205
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.740
Pretty sure it was about 3:30

206
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.640
when they transported me to the hospital.

207
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.740
And it was after 4:30 when they discharged me.

208
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.340
From that hospital to this park,

209
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.140
no matter how I hard I try, it would take 20 minutes.

210
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.240
You can also confirm with the hospital.

211
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.840
By doing so, you'll find that

212
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.840
it was impossible for me to commit the crime.

213
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.340
Please check well.

214
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.140
That man has an alibi

215
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.840
that he was at the hospital from 03:30 to 04:30.

216
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.940
He put the victim to sleep using sleeping pills

217
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.140
and wounded the cheek of his victim

218
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.240
with the hand of the clock beforehand.

219
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.640
After leaving the hospital,

220
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.940
he could've hit the head of the victim using the stone

221
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.940
that is used on the face of the clock and killed him.

222
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.940
No.

223
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.540
His estimated time of death is between 04:00 and 05:00,

224
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.640
so time wise it's possible.

225
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.740
But, as for the wound on his cheek,

226
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.840
it seems there's no doubt that it was put there after he died,

227
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.540
so it would be impossible.

228
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.840
Is that so?

229
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.840
In addition, it seems that

230
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.540
small pieces of the stone were found on the wound,

231
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.140
so there's probably no doubt that the crime was committed here.

232
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.040
You sure do know a lot.

233
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.440
No. Well, Pops got the information from the police.

234
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.740
So, you used Detective Mouri's voice again

235
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.840
and got information from the police, huh?

236
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.240
The paint that was on the victim's hand,

237
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.540
wasn't there anything characteristic about it?

238
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.140
No, I was told that

239
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.240
it was ordinary paint that you could find anywhere.

240
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.340
Since he was a sign maker,

241
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.840
I guess there's nothing strange about him

242
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.540
having paint on his hands, is there?

243
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.540
It seems that he'd been absent from work recently.

244
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.740
Despite that it bothers me

245
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.340
that he had new paint traces on his hands.

246
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.040
I see.

247
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.040
What's this door?

248
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.340
The device room of the clock, right?

249
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.140
What's the matter, Conan?

250
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.040
The chain sealing the door off has been broken into.

251
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.840
What's going on?

252
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.940
Hey, hey!

253
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.240
Just what're you doing there?

254
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.240
This chain's been broken.

255
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.640
What?

256
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.740
True. Who'd do something like this?

257
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.140
This is the clock's device room, right?

258
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.440
Right. But when they renovated the flower clock,

259
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.640
they started using a thing called "moveless drive"

260
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.140
in which the movable parts are built in,

261
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.040
so it should be empty inside.

262
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.040
It's being used as storage space.

263
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.240
Paint is spilt on the floor.

264
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.140
It's the same color as the one that was on the victim's hands.

265
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.240
It's dried.

266
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.040
So, this isn't where he got the paint on.

267
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.040
Hey, what's going on?

268
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.640
Hey!

269
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.540
This is...

270
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.240
Are you all right, all of you?

271
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.540
Conan?

272
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.940
Sonny, let's go.

273
00:14:43.145 --> 00:14:45.045
Did you figure something out?

274
00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:46.145
Yeah.

275
00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:49.645
I'm pretty sure that the guy called Kawaguchi is the culprit.

276
00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:52.445
But he's got an alibi, you know?

277
00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:56.145
I hear that the stones on the face of the clock are fixed on tightly,

278
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.345
so I'm sure that the crime was committed near the flower clock.

279
00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:02.445
And the only time the culprit could've committed the crime

280
00:15:02.445 --> 00:15:05.145
without messing up the flowers on the face of the clock

281
00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:07.045
and wound the victim with the needle of the clock is around "30..."

282
00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:08.145
However...

283
00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:10.345
The only time he could've committed the crime would've been 04:30,

284
00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:13.845
but he had just left the hospital around that time.

285
00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:15.945
Let's play see-saw next!

286
00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:19.245
Genta!

287
00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:20.845
Are you all right?

288
00:15:20.845 --> 00:15:22.445
Ouch, ouch...

289
00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:24.945
I hit my head.

290
00:15:24.945 --> 00:15:26.945
You scraped your cheek.

291
00:15:26.945 --> 00:15:28.445
I get it!

292
00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:31.345
That's how he did it!

293
00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:32.845
Conan!

294
00:15:32.845 --> 00:15:34.845
Let's go after him!

295
00:15:48.245 --> 00:15:49.745
It's just as I thought.

296
00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:52.445
Conan, what's wrong?

297
00:15:52.445 --> 00:15:54.545
Did you figure something out?

298
00:15:54.545 --> 00:15:57.245
-Yeah. -Hey, you guys!

299
00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:59.245
What're you doing there?

300
00:15:59.245 --> 00:16:02.145
Just the right timing to get here, Pops.

301
00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:05.245
Hurry on home and do your homework!

302
00:16:05.245 --> 00:16:07.145
And, Mr. Mouri,

303
00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:10.145
what is it you wanted to talk to us about?

304
00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:13.845
A drinking friend of mine knows Mr. Yoda

305
00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:17.045
and told me something unexpected about him.

306
00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:19.045
Something unexpected?

307
00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:23.945
The fact is, last month while putting up a sign, Mr. Yoda fell down

308
00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:27.545
and since then have had a fear of heights!

309
00:16:27.545 --> 00:16:30.145
I've heard about that already.

310
00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:34.145
Huh? Then, what about the traffic accident

311
00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:36.545
when he ended up killing a woman?

312
00:16:36.545 --> 00:16:38.645
I've got a report on that, too.

313
00:16:38.645 --> 00:16:42.645
That woman was my lover.

314
00:16:43.745 --> 00:16:45.545
Who could you be?

315
00:16:45.545 --> 00:16:47.145
My name's Kawaguchi.

316
00:16:47.145 --> 00:16:50.245
I'm a prime suspect for now.

317
00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:52.345
Is that correct?

318
00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.445
Now all the performers have gathered.

319
00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:57.745
Mr. Kawaguchi, what brings you here?

320
00:16:57.745 --> 00:16:59.545
I figured that I'd come to see

321
00:16:59.545 --> 00:17:03.445
the place where Yoda died before leaving for Niigata.

322
00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:06.345
No, I can't let you leave yet.

323
00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:09.545
But you did confirm with the hospital, didn't you?

324
00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:13.345
If so, you must've found out that I'm not the culprit, correct?

325
00:17:13.345 --> 00:17:16.245
So, if you will excuse me.

326
00:17:16.245 --> 00:17:18.645
Hold it!

327
00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:21.145
No, I said nothing.

328
00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:25.545
I'm spinning, spinning.

329
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.345
Round and round...

330
00:17:28.845 --> 00:17:31.845
I'm not finished with my story yet, Mr. Kawaguchi.

331
00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:36.145
So, you're the famous Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

332
00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:38.645
What more do you have to say?

333
00:17:38.645 --> 00:17:39.845
Inspector.

334
00:17:39.845 --> 00:17:44.045
Would you please let me hear Mr. Kawaguchi's alibi?

335
00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:46.745
Okay. He was at the hospital

336
00:17:46.745 --> 00:17:49.245
between the hours of 03:30 to 04:30 last night.

337
00:17:49.245 --> 00:17:52.645
From that hospital to here it takes 20 minutes.

338
00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:55.045
In other words, I couldn't have committed the crime.

339
00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:58.345
Which means, you could've come here by 05:00.

340
00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:00.945
Even if I came here at 05:00, I couldn't have done anything.

341
00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:02.445
No.

342
00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:06.545
You locked Mr. Yoda up in the device room of the flower clock

343
00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:09.545
and came back at 05:00 to kill him!

344
00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:11.945
What?

345
00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:13.545
Don't be ridiculous.

346
00:18:13.545 --> 00:18:17.045
Otherwise, there would be no wound on the cheek of the victim.

347
00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:19.345
It's 5:00 sharp right now.

348
00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:24.145
Just 12 hours ago, Mr. Kawaguchi hit Mr. Yoda's head against the stone

349
00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:27.645
by the "6" of the flower clock and killed him.

350
00:18:27.645 --> 00:18:30.445
Then, with the long hand that indicated "12",

351
00:18:30.445 --> 00:18:32.145
he wounded the cheek of the victim

352
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:35.245
and lay the dead body near the "6".

353
00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:39.645
How can I go to "12" without messing up the flowers?

354
00:18:39.645 --> 00:18:41.745
If to the "5" on the face of the clock,

355
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:45.845
you could step over it without messing up the flowers.

356
00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:48.745
You carried Mr. Yoda's dead body

357
00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:51.145
and walked on the needle of the flower clock,

358
00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:54.845
went over to the long hand that was on the "12"

359
00:18:54.845 --> 00:18:57.945
and made the wound on Mr. Yoda's cheek.

360
00:18:57.945 --> 00:19:01.445
Then, you walked back on the needle and returned.

361
00:19:01.445 --> 00:19:03.045
Do you have proof?

362
00:19:03.045 --> 00:19:04.245
You know, evidence!

363
00:19:04.245 --> 00:19:06.545
No use bluffing courage

364
00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:10.545
because the flower clock saw all that you did,

365
00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:13.045
and told me about it.

366
00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:14.545
What?

367
00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:18.645
There is a slight blood stain on the place "12".

368
00:19:18.645 --> 00:19:20.245
What?

369
00:19:21.845 --> 00:19:24.945
Actually, the stone and the needle do not touch each other,

370
00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:26.045
but since you walked on the needle

371
00:19:26.045 --> 00:19:27.845
in addition to carrying Mr. Yoda while you did so,

372
00:19:27.845 --> 00:19:31.145
the needle bent and now touches the stone.

373
00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:34.045
And the blood of Mr. Yoda's cheek that you wounded

374
00:19:34.045 --> 00:19:35.845
flowed through the needle

375
00:19:35.845 --> 00:19:38.345
and stained the stone.

376
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:42.545
If we inspect it, I'm sure it'll match Mr. Yoda's blood.

377
00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:46.145
But that doesn't prove that I did it, does it?

378
00:19:46.145 --> 00:19:47.845
If we check the shoe prints on the needle,

379
00:19:47.845 --> 00:19:51.245
your shoe prints are sure to be detected.

380
00:19:51.245 --> 00:19:52.845
Not talking of the short hand,

381
00:19:52.845 --> 00:19:55.045
as far as the long hand is concerned,

382
00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:57.645
the amount of time the stone can support a person's weight

383
00:19:57.645 --> 00:19:59.545
without squashing the flowers is but a minute.

384
00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:01.345
It would've been impossible for you

385
00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:03.845
to make a round trip to wound Mr. Yoda's cheek

386
00:20:03.845 --> 00:20:07.445
and more so to erase your shoe prints.

387
00:20:07.445 --> 00:20:09.545
Well...

388
00:20:09.545 --> 00:20:10.845
Mr. Kawaguchi.

389
00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:13.145
Although you're not aware of it,

390
00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:17.645
Mr. Yoda left a message saying that you killed him.

391
00:20:17.645 --> 00:20:19.945
That's ridiculous.

392
00:20:19.945 --> 00:20:22.445
Conan! Show the Inspector the way!

393
00:20:22.445 --> 00:20:24.045
Yes, sir!

394
00:20:24.045 --> 00:20:25.945
Follow me!

395
00:20:27.345 --> 00:20:29.445
You too, Mr. Kawaguchi!

396
00:20:33.245 --> 00:20:37.645
Is Mr. Yoda's message left behind here?

397
00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:39.445
I don't see anything like that around.

398
00:20:39.445 --> 00:20:41.845
He's right!

399
00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:46.045
What...

400
00:20:48.845 --> 00:20:50.445
This is...

401
00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:54.145
Florescent paint was spilt on the floor.

402
00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:57.245
It started to shine after it got pitch dark.

403
00:20:57.245 --> 00:20:58.845
What did you say?

404
00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:01.045
Pops told me that

405
00:21:01.045 --> 00:21:03.945
florescent paint doesn't shine in the dark

406
00:21:03.945 --> 00:21:06.045
unless you first shine light on it.

407
00:21:06.045 --> 00:21:08.045
He went on to say that since this place was dark all the while,

408
00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:10.845
during the time that Mr. Yoda was being confined by Mr. Kawaguchi,

409
00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:12.645
it didn't shine.

410
00:21:12.645 --> 00:21:13.945
I see.

411
00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:15.245
Since he went in and out only at night,

412
00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:17.245
so no one would see him,

413
00:21:17.245 --> 00:21:20.345
no light came in even if he opened the door!

414
00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:23.845
But, where is the message?

415
00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:25.645
Over there!

416
00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:28.645
This is...

417
00:21:28.645 --> 00:21:30.945
The culprit is...

418
00:21:30.945 --> 00:21:32.645
Kawaguchi!

419
00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:35.245
Mr. Yoda, who was confined here,

420
00:21:35.245 --> 00:21:37.645
noticed that paint was spilt,

421
00:21:37.645 --> 00:21:39.945
and left behind his final message.

422
00:21:39.945 --> 00:21:42.545
However, it was coincidentally the same color paint

423
00:21:42.545 --> 00:21:45.845
as the florescent paint that was spilt on the floor.

424
00:21:45.845 --> 00:21:51.845
Therefore, Mr. Yoda's message became invisible in bright light.

425
00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:54.745
We will investigate this room thoroughly.

426
00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:57.045
We'll look for evidence of Mr. Yoda's confinement

427
00:21:57.045 --> 00:22:00.445
as well as the traces of you having gone in and out of this room too.

428
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.745
Darn it!

429
00:22:02.745 --> 00:22:05.545
I thought that this was a perfect plan, and yet!

430
00:22:05.545 --> 00:22:07.945
This can't be! It just can't be!

431
00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:39.345
The display ceremony of the flower clock

432
00:23:39.345 --> 00:23:42.745
was held a week later than scheduled.
