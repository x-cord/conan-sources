1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.190
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.470
Conan's logic works wonders on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.720
Today's finally the last chapter!

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.220
An unexpected
culprit beneath the mask!

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.350
He sees the single truth
for what it is,

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.520
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.930
His name?

8
00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:38.299
Ran, the old man, and I attended
the Izu Mystery Tour

9
00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.639
in place of Professor Agasa, his friend,
and his friend's granddaughter.

10
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.719
Whoever determines the organizer's
identity gets to stay for free

11
00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.149
and receives floppy disks
containing a certain program.

12
00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.029
But then Ebara-san-- dressed as
the Night Baron-- fell to his death!

13
00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.829
It was clearly a murder!

14
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.249
How did the killer leave after
pushing Ebara-san off his veranda?

15
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.959
He then knocked out a karate
expert guarding the body

16
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.549
and appeared before us
as the Night Baron!

17
00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.419
Ran's kicks were useless.

18
00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.929
Could the killer be--

19
00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.949
The Night Baron Murder Case (The Solution).

20
00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:34.439
Was that policeman
really a karate expert?!

21
00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.929
Yeah, third-level black belt.

22
00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:37.609
For reals?!

23
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.069
Who could've done that?

24
00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.199
Come to think of it, he did
dodge all of Ran's kicks!

25
00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.039
The only suspect capable
of reading her attacks is...

26
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.819
...the karate champ, Maeda Satoru!

27
00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.679
So that's why neither of
them ran after the Night Baron!

28
00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.309
They had both realized it was him!

29
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:05.419
Ran...

30
00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.939
What would Shinichi
do in this situation?

31
00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.489
If I knew the culprit?

32
00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.369
Yeah. Like what if it
was Professor Agasa?

33
00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:20.589
I'd turn him in.

34
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.259
You would?!

35
00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.989
Yeah. I'd flat out say,
"You did it!"

36
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.039
So you can look cool, huh?

37
00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.389
Nope.

38
00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.839
I'd probably be dead tired by then...

39
00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.839
I'd have tried my utmost to
prove that they didn't do it first...

40
00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.259
Alright!

41
00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.809
Sorry, Satoru. If only I
hadn't recommended this tour...

42
00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.149
It's okay. I came along
because I wanted to.

43
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:55.109
This is all the Night Baron's fault...

44
00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.819
Satoru. Don't tell me you--

45
00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.949
No, it's nothing!

46
00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.769
I'm going to bed. Good night.

47
00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:04.659
Good night.

48
00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.829
Interrogation Room

49
00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.509
Detective Yokomizo.

50
00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.389
We have a lost item
from the victim's room.

51
00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.549
You do?

52
00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.969
There's something odd
on the security lock.

53
00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:20.989
What?

54
00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.799
Let me see.

55
00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.689
Yes. This is cellophane tape.

56
00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:36.399
Huh?

57
00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.349
Conan-kun!

58
00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.319
Alright, who set the security lock?!

59
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.279
I locked it from the outside!

60
00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:47.199
Using this cellophane tape!

61
00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.539
First, you cut yourself
an appropriate length

62
00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.079
and then fold it in two, leaving
a few centimeters of the sticky part.

63
00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:01.299
Then you align the lock perpendicularly,
place the tape on it,

64
00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.759
and close the door.

65
00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.219
One tug of the tape and--

66
00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:10.259
It locked!
It locked!

67
00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.059
Pull it more, and... the tape comes
off and the evidence disappears.

68
00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:17.309
See?

69
00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:22.639
I dunno... Don't these
rooms have auto-locks?

70
00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.029
That's okay!

71
00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.589
You can use a room key to see
if a room is locked or not,

72
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.739
and you can peel
the tape off if need be!

73
00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.369
But this tip would've been
in the killer's blind spot!

74
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.629
So he must not have noticed
this tape left behind!

75
00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.759
Say, wasn't the key lying with
his clothes near the door?

76
00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.089
Oh, yeah! That's right!

77
00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:53.389
After the killer took his key,
dressed him up, and threw him over,

78
00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.019
he left the room and set the
security lock using this trick!

79
00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:04.039
Then, after double-checking the lock,
he tossed the key into the room!

80
00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.409
That would seal the room
and make it look like an accident!

81
00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.929
How'd you figure out that trick?

82
00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:15.119
I saw it on a mystery show.

83
00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.089
So the issue now is in the
alibis of our six suspects!

84
00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:24.049
Maeda-san, who was
with Ran and Conan...

85
00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:27.009
Sayama-san, who was watching TV...

86
00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.929
Konno-san, who was in his
room reading his e-mail...

87
00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:34.889
Kamijo-san, who was in
the pub with Mori-san...

88
00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.349
And Kaneshiro-san and Hayashi-san,
who were in the outside restaurant.

89
00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:43.259
I know Sayama-san's alibi.

90
00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.429
She said she called
the front desk at 10:00.

91
00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:50.449
Yes, she did ask for a
wake-up call at 10:00.

92
00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.659
I remember her call well. It was right
after I heard people screaming.

93
00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:02.259
The victim was in Room 2101.
She couldn't have done it...

94
00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:06.429
Plus she was with Ran and Conan
when they ran into the Night Baron.

95
00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:07.589
She's in the clear.

96
00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:14.309
But why did the killer do that?
Or even steal the costume?

97
00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:17.639
They were probably worried when
we realized it was a murder!

98
00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.099
That's gotta be it!

99
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:24.019
Do you have records of
Konno-san in Room 2002?

100
00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:29.719
He supposedly used the phone
for online access until after 10:00.

101
00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:34.739
Yes. He used it from
9:45 until 10:06.

102
00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:39.389
But that doesn't mean
he spoke with anyone!

103
00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:40.709
Sounds suspicious to me...

104
00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:44.709
Kamijo-san is suspicious too.

105
00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:46.919
Darn him!

106
00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.879
Princess Hotel 2F Pub Emerald

107
00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:52.339
She put pills in my drink?!

108
00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.309
Yes. You fell asleep afterward...

109
00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:59.969
I knew it! Those were
sleeping pills she had!

110
00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:02.519
Did she drug him
to create an alibi?

111
00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:04.479
What about her?

112
00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:09.439
She went to the restroom,
but returned five minutes later.

113
00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:13.069
So she was here when
the murder occurred?

114
00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:16.029
Yes. She left when she
heard the commotion.

115
00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:21.669
Were those old folks really here?

116
00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:27.129
Yes. They rushed to the front of
the crowd after hearing someone fell.

117
00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:29.169
The front?

118
00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:31.679
Darn! I suspected them!

119
00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.599
It's okay. We've narrowed
it down to two suspects now!

120
00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:37.509
That's true.

121
00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.179
The only ones with unconfirmed alibis

122
00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.009
are Konno-san and Maeda-san.

123
00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:48.389
Maeda-san was with us in
the observation lounge,

124
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:52.069
but he's the one who checked
the time, so he could've lied.

125
00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:58.409
And considering that the knocked-out
officer was a karate expert,

126
00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:02.719
Maeda-san must be the one who--

127
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:03.709
Conan-kun!

128
00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:05.929
Ran-neechan!

129
00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:08.459
Where's Dad?

130
00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:10.799
Over there. What happened?

131
00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:14.009
I found an alibi for Maeda-san!

132
00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:20.059
After he left us, he met some
fans at the lounge entrance!

133
00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:24.979
They even asked for the date
and time with his autographs!

134
00:09:25.469 --> 00:09:27.469
The time was 10:03!

135
00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:30.939
They're sure of it, because they
even checked their own watches!

136
00:09:31.349 --> 00:09:33.899
Shouldn't you bring them here, then?

137
00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:36.869
Right! I'll go get them!

138
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:41.179
Ah! So Maeda-san
wasn't the killer!

139
00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:41.829
Wait a minute!

140
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:44.919
Then why didn't he mention
it when he was questioned?!

141
00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:47.669
It's an airtight alibi!

142
00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:50.129
Maybe he couldn't mention it?

143
00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:51.719
But why?

144
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:57.259
It's the pen I dropped.
It's leaking ink from the shock...

145
00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:01.889
Not surprising; it did fall from
Ebara-san's room on the 21st floor...

146
00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:02.719
Huh?

147
00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:07.459
That's odd. He fell off the same
veranda but hit the statue...

148
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:10.729
I know! The wind blew it over...

149
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:11.989
The wind?!

150
00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:15.389
Hey, waitress lady!

151
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:16.149
Yes?

152
00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:19.119
Was the wind blowing
when that person fell?

153
00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:23.079
Come to think of it,
there was a strong wind...

154
00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:26.389
It constantly blows at
night this time of the year.

155
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:29.039
From the left of that
statue to the right.

156
00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:31.999
It's our famous 'Princess Wind'!

157
00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:34.969
It's a lot stronger higher up, though!

158
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:36.339
Hold on a second!

159
00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:39.299
There's one place where the wind is--

160
00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:47.549
I can't believe I didn't
realize something this simple...

161
00:10:47.549 --> 00:10:50.439
No question about it!
That person is the killer!

162
00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:54.399
What?! The knocked-out
officer was a karate expert?!

163
00:10:55.469 --> 00:10:58.009
Okay! Now I know who did it!

164
00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:02.329
I will now begin my explanation!
Gather all the suspects here!

165
00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.679
Right!

166
00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:04.869
Not good...

167
00:11:04.869 --> 00:11:06.569
Officers!

168
00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:12.719
The detective wants you to do
this stuff in the suspects' rooms.

169
00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:14.129
What is this?

170
00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:16.139
Says it's an experiment!

171
00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:18.639
And that it'll prove who did it!

172
00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:28.969
Concerning your alibis for
when the victim fell at 10:00...

173
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:34.049
The alibis of Kaneshiro-san, Hayashi-san,
Sayama-san, and Kamijo-san

174
00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:37.599
have been confirmed.

175
00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:40.479
Darn it! Where's the signal?!

176
00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:43.089
The only ones with vague alibis

177
00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:46.469
are Maeda-san, who was in
the observation lounge,

178
00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:48.909
and Konno-san, who was in his room,

179
00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:53.629
but after murdering the victim,
the killer stupidly stole the costume

180
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:56.079
from the office where the body was

181
00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.579
and then ran into
Sayama-san and the others...

182
00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:04.549
...unaware that the officer he
knocked out was a karate expert!

183
00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:07.299
A karate expert?!

184
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:08.299
Yes.

185
00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:11.509
The only one capable of knocking
such a person out in one blow...

186
00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:16.169
...is the former Japanese karate
champion, Maeda Satoru-san--

187
00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:18.559
Wait, Dad!

188
00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:21.179
Maeda-san didn't do it!

189
00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:26.859
He was with them
when it happened!

190
00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:28.529
It's true!
It's true!

191
00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:30.489
No way!

192
00:12:30.489 --> 00:12:32.979
Then who did it?

193
00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:34.999
Will you get serious?!

194
00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:37.919
That's it!

195
00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:41.629
The killer is the
alibi-less Konno Shiro!

196
00:12:42.469 --> 00:12:45.089
Don't be fooled by
his looks, everyone!

197
00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:49.889
Hide it as he may, this man
is actually a karate expert!

198
00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:54.179
Or not...

199
00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:55.969
Quit fooling around!

200
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:58.439
There it is! The signal!

201
00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:01.149
Who's the killer?!

202
00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:04.479
Mori-san! Can you tell us already?

203
00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:07.949
Are you really a skilled detective?!

204
00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:10.339
Like I said, the killer is--

205
00:13:13.969 --> 00:13:15.129
Mori-san!

206
00:13:16.469 --> 00:13:18.999
Well, enough of this foolishness.

207
00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.549
Will you ever get serious?!

208
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:25.219
Hold on. This is the pose he
takes when he starts analyzing.

209
00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:26.779
Right, Ran-san?

210
00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:27.419
Yes!

211
00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:34.579
Before I begin, please step away
from the statue and out of harm's way.

212
00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.389
What are you going to do?

213
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:39.689
An experiment.

214
00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:52.409
What are these?!

215
00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:56.869
Blankets that I had dressed up
as people and dropped from above.

216
00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:01.789
Dropped from each of the suspects' rooms,
with their numbers on them.

217
00:14:01.789 --> 00:14:03.749
Room 2101!

218
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:08.299
This is from Ebara Tokio-san's room,
where the murder occurred!

219
00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:12.259
But he fell directly
onto that statue!

220
00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:15.719
It couldn't have been carried
this far by the wind.

221
00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:18.389
But it was. By the 'Princess Wind'.

222
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:19.219
Statue
Princess Wind

223
00:14:19.219 --> 00:14:21.299
This strong wind blows past the
Statue
Princess Wind

224
00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:25.549
hotel at nights this time of year...
Statue
Princess Wind

225
00:14:25.549 --> 00:14:27.089
From the left of
Statue
Princess Wind

226
00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:28.399
the statue to the right.
Statue
Princess Wind

227
00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:34.319
It was also blowing when the
victim fell. Correct, Miss?

228
00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:38.789
Yes! I think it was blowing
even harder than it is now!

229
00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:44.749
Moreover, he was wearing
an outfit with high air resistance.

230
00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:49.379
If he had been pushed
off his own veranda,

231
00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:53.759
I doubt he would've fallen
onto the statue directly below.

232
00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:57.129
Even the blanket dropped from
Kaneshiro-san's room one floor below

233
00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:00.219
is lying far off to the side.

234
00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:01.469
Now I see!

235
00:15:01.469 --> 00:15:06.899
We were fooled by the glove on the
veranda and the locked room trick!

236
00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:10.979
Those weren't meant to simply
make it look like an accident--

237
00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:13.949
they were also traps to make it
look like that's where it happened!

238
00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:19.219
Correct. The killer didn't
lock the room after the murder;

239
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:23.119
he locked it before committing
the murder in his own room!

240
00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:27.629
Meaning the most suspect are...
the blankets lying by the statue!

241
00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:36.549
Room 2102's Kamijo-san,
Room 2002's Konno-san, and--

242
00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:49.399
--Room 1901's Sayama-san!

243
00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:54.359
It's just coincidence! After all,
everyone else's are by the statue, too!

244
00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:57.969
It's indeed a coincidence
that it was pierced,

245
00:15:57.969 --> 00:15:59.829
but it's no coincidence
that it fell there!

246
00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:04.289
Besides, the killer is neither
Kamijo-san nor Konno-san!

247
00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:09.669
Their windows are off to
the side of the victim's veranda.

248
00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:13.669
Looking at the point of impact,
it would be instantly obvious

249
00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:16.089
that he didn't fall from there.

250
00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:19.759
But Sayama-san's room is
directly below theirs!

251
00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:22.809
Her room's blanket must've
just happened to land there--

252
00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:25.069
It didn't just 'happen to.'

253
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.519
Huh?

254
00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:28.049
There's a spot...

255
00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:34.149
One directly below the victim's
veranda where there's almost no wind!

256
00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:39.549
The call she made to the
front desk to create an alibi

257
00:16:39.549 --> 00:16:43.659
conversely proves that she was
in the room at the time of the murder.

258
00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.619
So then the killer is--

259
00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:52.589
No! I did it! I pushed him off!

260
00:16:52.589 --> 00:16:56.549
She has nothing to do with it!
She even ran into the killer...

261
00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:59.679
...me, dressed as the Night Baron!

262
00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:02.629
Yes, it was me! I did it all alone--

263
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:03.469
Satoru.
Yes, it was me! I did it all alone--

264
00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:08.389
So it was you who did
that to cover for me...

265
00:17:08.389 --> 00:17:09.889
Cover for you?!

266
00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:11.009
Indeed.

267
00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:16.129
Maeda-san stole the Night Baron
costume and ran into her

268
00:17:16.129 --> 00:17:18.819
to rid her of all suspicion.

269
00:17:19.219 --> 00:17:21.629
But he was not an accomplice.

270
00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:26.379
He did it of his own accord when
he realized who the killer was.

271
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:30.079
Yes. Upon seeing the
necktie's knot, for example.

272
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:34.039
It's unclear if that was the
killer's own style or not,

273
00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:37.509
but Maeda-san did find
something in his room.

274
00:17:37.509 --> 00:17:40.219
Something that was floating
in the pool later...

275
00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:41.679
The wig!

276
00:17:41.969 --> 00:17:43.379
Yes.

277
00:17:43.379 --> 00:17:47.559
He was likely convinced when
he found it among the killer's things...

278
00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:50.059
Convinced that she was the killer!

279
00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:51.349
That can't be!

280
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:54.669
The wig was in the room because
Ebara-san and the Night Baron

281
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:58.319
happened to have the same
hairstyle, making it unnecessary!

282
00:17:58.669 --> 00:18:01.509
So that's why he
risked running into her

283
00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:05.279
with the stolen costume
and the wig on!

284
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:07.989
Yes. And he was prepared to be caught.

285
00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:12.459
The reason he kept quiet about
having people to vouch for his alibi

286
00:18:12.879 --> 00:18:16.169
was because it would cause
problems if he were caught.

287
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:22.129
He planned to take the fall in place
of Akiko-san if it came down to it!

288
00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:24.429
Don't make me laugh.

289
00:18:25.219 --> 00:18:28.919
Thanks to you,
my perfect crime was ruined!

290
00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:29.889
Akiko!

291
00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:33.849
That's right, I did it!
I killed him!

292
00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:37.819
To avenge my brother who he
murdered three years ago!

293
00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:40.339
Murdered?!

294
00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:42.469
Pretty much!

295
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:46.869
He hacked the 'Workshop' software
my brother bet the company on!

296
00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:48.579
Workshop?!

297
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:49.839
You know about it?!

298
00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:53.579
Yes, it's the software Ebara
sold me three years ago!

299
00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:57.539
Had I known it was stolen,
I would've taken it off the market!

300
00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:02.009
My brother jumped off the
company building before that!

301
00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:05.969
I've lived to avenge
him ever since...

302
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:09.759
...and then I came up
with this Mystery Tour.

303
00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:14.439
My lure was the infamous
'Night Baron' virus.

304
00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:19.899
He immediately took the bait...
unaware that it didn't exist...

305
00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:25.469
Yes. After I drove Satoru off,
the bait I used to lure Ebara

306
00:19:25.469 --> 00:19:27.989
into our room was
once again the virus.

307
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:30.329
He rushed over immediately,

308
00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:33.359
once he got a whiff of
the virus's location.

309
00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:39.669
Then I put sleeping pills in his drink,
locked his room as planned,

310
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:42.759
then sent him plummeting from my room!

311
00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:44.469
Just like my brother!

312
00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:50.429
My only oversight was that you,
Mori Kogoro, would be on the tour!

313
00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:56.849
But you didn't even blink
after I pushed Conan-kun into the pool.

314
00:19:57.379 --> 00:20:01.219
Satoru. This is the
kind of woman I am.

315
00:20:01.219 --> 00:20:03.419
So hurry and forget about me!

316
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:16.249
I'll be waiting.

317
00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:19.249
I'll be waiting until you get out!

318
00:20:20.629 --> 00:20:22.089
You dummy...

319
00:20:23.469 --> 00:20:28.969
After that, Akiko-san slightly
nodded and got into the police car.

320
00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:34.429
Maeda-san was taken into
another car for police obstruction,

321
00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:39.349
but Detective Yokomizo says he may
get off on mitigating circumstances.

322
00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:43.589
As we watched the cars leave,

323
00:20:43.589 --> 00:20:46.979
only the Princess Wind
cried sadly around us.

324
00:22:14.469 --> 00:22:17.619
So that's why you drugged his drink...

325
00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:18.469
That's right.

326
00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:23.119
I figured I could check his notes
to find out who the Night Baron was.

327
00:22:23.419 --> 00:22:26.299
But his notebook was blank.

328
00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:28.089
Why would you go that far?

329
00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:33.669
I only wanted the virus
so I could make a vaccine.

330
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:37.219
It looks like they wanted
it for bad reasons, though.

331
00:22:37.219 --> 00:22:39.019
How uncouth.

332
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:42.799
I simply wished to punish
the owner of the virus

333
00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:48.979
that ruined my beloved
software 'son' four years ago!

334
00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:51.289
And you even faked your bad eyesight?

335
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:53.719
Oh, you knew?

336
00:22:53.719 --> 00:22:56.989
I had hoped to keep people off guard...

337
00:22:56.989 --> 00:23:00.339
What kind of software was it?

338
00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:02.659
I believe it was--

339
00:23:02.659 --> 00:23:07.089
--'Project: High School Girl Paradise', sir.

340
00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:09.379
Oh, that's right!

341
00:23:10.219 --> 00:23:15.509
That reminds me, I heard
you scoured the entire hotel

342
00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:17.839
to prove Maeda-san's alibi!

343
00:23:17.839 --> 00:23:19.349
I really looked up to him!

344
00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:24.939
Plus 'he' taught me
that you can't ever give up...

345
00:23:24.939 --> 00:23:25.849
'He'?

346
00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:28.199
Oh? You called your boyfriend?

347
00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:29.859
No, that's not what I mean!

348
00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.799
Who is 'he'?!

349
00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:33.779
Not you too, Conan-kun!

350
00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:38.119
You know who!
That wandering mystery geek!

351
00:23:38.119 --> 00:23:38.939
Eh?!

352
00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:46.619
Come on! Hang in there!

353
00:23:46.619 --> 00:23:48.619
Hey, look!

354
00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:49.619
Guts-Man!

355
00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:52.119
Hey! Did you drink that?!

356
00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:56.789
Say, there's a seal on that Guts-Man!

357
00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:02.289
It's for a special campaign,
but it ended three days ago!

358
00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:05.339
As proof, there aren't
any on your bottles.

359
00:24:06.499 --> 00:24:07.639
No, there aren't.

360
00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:09.829
On the next Conan--

361
00:24:09.829 --> 00:24:11.829
The Stalker Murder Case.

362
00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:16.442
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:24:16.442 --> 00:24:18.092
Glue.
