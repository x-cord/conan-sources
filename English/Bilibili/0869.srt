1
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.910
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.710
I wasn't told you'd be killing anyone.

3
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.110
They ignored my warning

4
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.810
that I'd kill them if they resisted.

5
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.910
They got what they deserved.

6
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.610
I... I want out.

7
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.110
I wasn't told you'd be coping out.

8
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.310
It's a breach of contract.

9
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.210
A betrayal.

10
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.610
You've got to pay for this.

11
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.710
Hey, you guys!

12
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.910
What are you doing there?

13
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.510
Hey!

14
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.110
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

15
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.610
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

16
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.610
The secret maneuvers of the criminals behind the scene.

17
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.810
Is the Detective Squad going come in contact with them?

18
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.610
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.010
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.709
"Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 1)"

22
00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.909
People have fallen victim

23
00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.609
to serial arsonist and robber aka Zorro,

24
00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.509
who killed three residents of the house he broke into.

25
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.109
He also seriously injured a police officer

26
00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.609
who attended the scene after report of the fire,

27
00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.209
and is now on the run.

28
00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.109
According to the other police officer who was also at the scene...

29
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.209
-Jerk. -the perpetrator...

30
00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.909
fired his crossbow without warning.

31
00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.509
He targets only the residents of celebrities.

32
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:12.209
They will do all they can to pursue the perpetrator.

33
00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.709
He's not what his name, Zorro implies.

34
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.509
He's a vicious, heinous and brutal criminal.

35
00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.409
I know it's your day off,

36
00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.609
but it's still day time, so don't drink too much, Dad.

37
00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:28.609
I know!

38
00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:32.209
Where did he go?

39
00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.009
The shrimpy smart aleck

40
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.409
that always says his piece when seeing news like these?

41
00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.109
Conan went out with Ai and the other kids.

42
00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:42.509
Did you forget?

43
00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.409
I envy kids because they're so carefree.

44
00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.409
Dad, I envy you

45
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.109
because you're so carefree, too.

46
00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:53.509
Well, I'm not wrong about that.

47
00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:57.209
Here goes...

48
00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:58.809
-Eels over rice! -Pudding!

49
00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:01.209
So, did you figure it out, Conan?

50
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:05.209
Anmitsu, pudding and eels over rice.

51
00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:06.609
Correct!

52
00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:07.809
Amazing!

53
00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.009
How did you figure it out?

54
00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.309
Who wouldn't?

55
00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.109
So next, it's the subjects we like!

56
00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:17.809
I'll figure that out right away too, though.

57
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.809
Okay, we're almost there.

58
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.309
How fantastic!

59
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.609
To think that we can sleep over at a place like this.

60
00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:33.109
We're celebrities!

61
00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:37.209
I'm sure they have top-notch eels over rice, too!

62
00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:39.109
I wonder about that.

63
00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:40.809
I hate to disappoint you,

64
00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:45.009
but we have to cook for ourselves here, Genta.

65
00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.809
No... No way.

66
00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.909
But Doc sure has some impressive personal connections.

67
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.109
You even know someone who owns a villa like this.

68
00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:58.009
I wonder if Doc has any friends

69
00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.809
who own an eels restaurant?

70
00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:02.309
No.

71
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.809
You don't have to be so blunt.

72
00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:14.209
What's wrong, Ayumi?

73
00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:22.309
Hey. Who is he?

74
00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.409
He's alive.

75
00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:33.409
He's seriously hurt, but still breathing.

76
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.309
Ai, call an ambulance.

77
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:36.609
Understood.

78
00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.509
What a shock as soon as we get here.

79
00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.209
I wonder who and where he came from

80
00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:05.909
and what happened to him?

81
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.909
I wonder if we've got a case?

82
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.509
Maybe he's just a burglar.

83
00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.909
He snuck in, goofed and hurt himself.

84
00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:17.309
Well, it's possible

85
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:21.309
if he could shoot his own arm with a crossbow.

86
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:22.909
Crossbow?

87
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.509
If I remember correctly, yesterday's...

88
00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.309
Where's Conan?

89
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:30.309
He was here just a minute ago.

90
00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:52.309
Did the man drop this?

91
00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.509
What's this?

92
00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:01.809
I think they're either IDs or passwords.

93
00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:03.009
Ai.

94
00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:05.709
They're both different.

95
00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:07.309
What are you going to do with it?

96
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:08.509
Are you turning it in?

97
00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:10.909
Well, I guess.

98
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:14.309
Tell the others what you have to.

99
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:17.409
What I have to?

100
00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:21.409
"Misakihama Clinic"

101
00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:31.909
A crossbow was used in yesterday's robbery case.

102
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:33.809
I wanted to ask him about it,

103
00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.709
but I guess I still can't.

104
00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:09.409
Military boots?

105
00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:49.309
What?

106
00:09:56.109 --> 00:09:58.709
All I have to do now is to call the police.

107
00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:09.409
Inspector Megure.

108
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:12.909
Does this mean it has something to do with yesterday's case?

109
00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:19.109
Darn!

110
00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:20.809
Conan?

111
00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:22.809
A suspicious person fled out through the window!

112
00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:24.009
Check the back door!

113
00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:25.409
What?

114
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.609
This is no good.

115
00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:37.609
He got away.

116
00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:40.209
I found this in the trash dump by the back door.

117
00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:44.009
So the wounded person

118
00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:46.709
is a member of Zorro's group?

119
00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:49.209
Rather, it seems that he's hiring people to work with him

120
00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:52.109
each time he comes up with a new job.

121
00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:54.909
"Yuji Isehara (28), Hacker" -Yuji Isehara, 28 years old.

122
00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.209
He's a proficient hacker

123
00:10:57.209 --> 00:11:00.209
who even our cyber crime division was looking for.

124
00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:03.509
It seems he hacks the target's security information

125
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:05.709
and manipulates it.

126
00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:07.809
We got an identification report from Kanagawa Police Department

127
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:12.409
saying that they have a man who fits the description in custody.

128
00:11:12.409 --> 00:11:14.909
So we came here.

129
00:11:14.909 --> 00:11:16.509
Is this enough information?

130
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.209
Thank you very much.

131
00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:22.209
I can report this to Pops Kogoro now.

132
00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:25.009
What? Isehara is missing too?

133
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:26.509
What?

134
00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:33.809
Dispatch a search immediately!

135
00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:34.909
Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

136
00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:45.609
I see.

137
00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:47.109
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Thank you

138
00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:49.809
for reporting it to me, Inspector.

139
00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.709
One of the robber's in yesterday's case

140
00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:53.809
showed up at the villa where Conan and the others are?

141
00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:55.209
Yeah.

142
00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:57.209
Apparently, they found him wounded

143
00:11:57.209 --> 00:11:59.409
and hiding in the yard.

144
00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:02.609
I wonder if Conan's okay.

145
00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:04.409
The inspector and the others are there,

146
00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:06.109
so there is nothing to worry about.

147
00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:08.109
It's not that.

148
00:12:09.909 --> 00:12:11.109
"Misakihama Clinic"

149
00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:14.609
I'm glad I took a picture, just in case.

150
00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:16.609
Let's see.

151
00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:38.376
"Mouri Detective Agency"

152
00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:42.976
How long are you going to keep on drinking, Dad?

153
00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:45.176
-Let's go. -What?

154
00:12:45.176 --> 00:12:46.376
It's apparent that Conan's

155
00:12:46.376 --> 00:12:49.776
not going to just sit there and do nothing.

156
00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:53.076
I'm sure he's going to get involved in something dangerous.

157
00:12:53.076 --> 00:12:56.876
But I wasn't even asked to take care of the crime or anything.

158
00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.976
-What are you talking about? -There's no reason for me,

159
00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:01.076
-the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri... -Come on.

160
00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:02.976
-Let's go. -to go out there and...

161
00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:03.976
Ouch...

162
00:13:03.976 --> 00:13:05.176
We're leaving.

163
00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:07.176
It hurts...

164
00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:17.576
Okay, I'm close.

165
00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:28.376
Conan's not being fair.

166
00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:31.676
He's got to tell us if something comes up.

167
00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:35.676
The Youth Detective Squad is not a one man team.

168
00:13:35.676 --> 00:13:38.776
I'm hungry.

169
00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:06.776
Where did Conan go?

170
00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:08.876
That's strange.

171
00:14:08.876 --> 00:14:11.376
He was in view till just a while ago.

172
00:14:11.376 --> 00:14:14.076
It's getting kind of dark.

173
00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:17.476
I wonder if Conan is going to be okay?

174
00:14:17.476 --> 00:14:19.276
That goes for us as well.

175
00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:21.776
Don't... Don't tell me...

176
00:14:21.776 --> 00:14:25.576
It sort of looks as if we're lost.

177
00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:27.676
What? No way.

178
00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:30.276
What about dinner?

179
00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:32.376
Dinner.

180
00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:36.576
The sun is setting over that side,

181
00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:39.076
so the sea is on this side.

182
00:14:39.076 --> 00:14:41.776
If we go back now, I can tell the direction.

183
00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:44.676
So if you want to, we can start going back right away.

184
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.176
Really, Ai?

185
00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:48.376
You're really something, Ai.

186
00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:50.376
So, we won't be missing dinner?

187
00:14:50.376 --> 00:14:54.576
That's right, so why don't we go a little farther?

188
00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:58.676
If I keep going this way...

189
00:14:58.676 --> 00:15:00.476
Where is this?

190
00:15:00.476 --> 00:15:03.476
The sunset's over that side,

191
00:15:03.476 --> 00:15:05.776
and the sea's on this side, so...

192
00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:10.176
This is...

193
00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:12.176
I'm inside a cave.

194
00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:19.276
Sea breeze?

195
00:15:19.276 --> 00:15:22.776
Does that mean I can pass through?

196
00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:29.376
Of course not.

197
00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:38.476
This looks impressive.

198
00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:43.776
I don't have time to waste.

199
00:15:50.976 --> 00:15:53.276
I finally made it back,

200
00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:55.676
but it's all dark already.

201
00:16:09.476 --> 00:16:11.876
Am I lost again?

202
00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:14.876
I guess I'll have to backtrack again.

203
00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.176
What's that?

204
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:34.076
I found it.

205
00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:01.876
What an idiot.

206
00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:04.676
What are we going to do with him, Zorro?

207
00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:08.876
"Go Mizorogi (35), Armed Robber Zorro" -I see right through you, Isehara.

208
00:17:08.876 --> 00:17:11.876
I know exactly where you're headed for.

209
00:17:16.576 --> 00:17:18.076
It's him!

210
00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:22.176
Spare... Spare me.

211
00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:25.476
Please spare me.

212
00:17:25.476 --> 00:17:28.276
For your wife and child?

213
00:17:28.276 --> 00:17:30.576
What a soap opera.

214
00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:35.776
You talked, didn't you?

215
00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:39.676
I... I didn't say anything!

216
00:17:39.676 --> 00:17:42.576
I'll let you choose, then.

217
00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:45.776
Either you let me get rid of your wife and child

218
00:17:45.776 --> 00:17:48.476
or die here alone.

219
00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:50.676
Whichever you like.

220
00:17:52.576 --> 00:17:53.876
Come on.

221
00:18:35.376 --> 00:18:36.376
Who's there?

222
00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:44.076
Isehara!

223
00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:51.476
This way!

224
00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:52.876
Who are you?

225
00:18:52.876 --> 00:18:55.476
Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.

226
00:18:55.476 --> 00:18:56.976
A detective?

227
00:18:56.976 --> 00:18:58.176
Where did he go?

228
00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:00.276
Hurry!

229
00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:03.776
A child?

230
00:19:16.776 --> 00:19:18.976
Darn it.

231
00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:20.776
Where did they go?

232
00:19:24.676 --> 00:19:27.476
They... They're going to kill me!

233
00:19:27.476 --> 00:19:29.076
You'll be fine.

234
00:19:29.076 --> 00:19:31.876
They haven't figured out where we are.

235
00:19:41.676 --> 00:19:43.676
No! I don't want to die!

236
00:19:45.076 --> 00:19:46.276
This way!

237
00:19:49.176 --> 00:19:50.476
Wait.

238
00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:16.476
This is...

239
00:20:38.276 --> 00:20:39.876
Conan!

240
00:20:39.876 --> 00:20:42.376
What? Conan?

241
00:20:42.376 --> 00:20:43.676
Conan!

242
00:20:50.876 --> 00:20:53.576
One more drink. No, two more.

243
00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:57.776
Why do I have this bad premonition?

244
00:20:57.776 --> 00:20:59.976
Excuse me. Please hurry!

245
00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:05.976
Dad, get up already.

246
00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:11.676
Spare... Spare me.

247
00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:13.076
Please.

248
00:21:13.076 --> 00:21:16.076
You're causing us so much trouble.

249
00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:18.076
Traitor.

250
00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:30.176
Die!

251
00:21:54.376 --> 00:21:56.676
Conan!

252
00:22:03.976 --> 00:22:06.076
Dr. Agasa.

253
00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:09.376
Thank you for coming out to see us.

254
00:22:09.376 --> 00:22:12.776
Did something happen to Conan and the rest?

255
00:22:12.776 --> 00:22:14.376
Well, the thing is

256
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.176
I just got a call from the kids.

257
00:22:19.176 --> 00:22:21.576
What did you say?

258
00:22:21.576 --> 00:22:22.676
Conan's...

259
00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:24.576
Don't tell me...

260
00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:27.476
-No! -Ran!

261
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:28.876
Ran!

262
00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:56.576
"Next Episode" -Conan's...

263
00:23:56.576 --> 00:23:57.876
It can't be true.

264
00:23:57.876 --> 00:24:01.076
But we saw it, didn't we?

265
00:24:01.076 --> 00:24:03.976
I won't let them do something like that ever.

266
00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:05.376
Inspector.

267
00:24:05.376 --> 00:24:08.076
What? Ai's missing, too?

268
00:24:09.176 --> 00:24:11.876
I came alone just like you told me to.

269
00:24:14.076 --> 00:24:15.276
Let's go.

270
00:24:19.176 --> 00:24:20.776
Next Conan,

271
00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:24.376
"Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 2)"

272
00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:27.519
Next Conan's Hint:

273
00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:29.519
"Password"

274
00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:32.019
-Conan, no way. -No. This can't be!

275
00:24:32.019 --> 00:24:33.719
Make sure to tune in next week.
