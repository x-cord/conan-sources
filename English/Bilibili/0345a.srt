1
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,140
Hey, Gin. Today feels different.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,240
Yeah.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,940
Because it's a two hour and a half special.

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,440
Hi.

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,340
We wish everyone...

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,740
-happy new year! -Happy new year!

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Detective Conan staff will work harder to improve

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,940
-the TV episodes... -the TV episodes,

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,940
movies and Shonen Sunday!

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,840
And me, Sonoko Suzuki.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,240
And me, Ran Mouri.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,940
Hey... What are you two talking about?

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,640
-Please keep supporting us! -Please keep supporting us!

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,240
Did we make it?

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,640
"Dear"

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,440
"Mr. Conan Edogawa"

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
An eerie atmosphere, the mysterious twosome.

18
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
An enveloping attack that closes in on Conan and Haibara.

19
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
They seek not to protect their own lives if for the sake of others.

20
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,740
A breathtaking 2 hours and a half is about to begin.

21
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,340
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,540
"The Confrontation with the Black Organization"

25
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,940
"The Coincidence of the Two Enemies on a Night with a Full Moon"

26
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,540
An Off-season Halloween party?

27
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,340
Just what month do they think it is?

28
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,940
Isn't Halloween on October 31st?

29
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,940
That's why it's written "off-season", isn't it?

30
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,040
What's written on the invitation card?

31
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,740
On the letter it says,

32
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,340
"Incapable Detective, Kogoro Mouri."

33
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,540
"On the night the full moon cometh,"

34
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,140
"I shall invite thee to this hideous night banquet."

35
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,740
"To the blood smeared party on the ship."

36
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,840
"Be it known that whether thou attend or not,"

37
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,040
"the pitiful lamb that goes passing shall curse its own fate,"

38
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,340
"and the sinner shall be ecstatic over the agonies of death."

39
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,140
So this is a letter challenging

40
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,640
the Famous Detective Kogoro Mouri!

41
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,140
Who on earth would've sent this invitation card to me?

42
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,040
Maybe a foreigner,

43
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
because the name of the sender is in english.

44
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,540
V. E. R. M. O. U. T. H.

45
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,240
Vermouth?

46
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,368
Vermouth?

47
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,368
I'm sorry, Ran.

48
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:59,268
But I've never heard that name before.

49
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,568
I see.

50
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,868
I wonder who sent us this invitation card?

51
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,168
Besides...

52
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:07,968
Isn't Kogoro going to the evening party?

53
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,268
It's tomorrow, isn't it?

54
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,568
Yes.

55
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,568
He says that brave Tokyo people should take on challenges.

56
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:15,768
Father's making preparations for it

57
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,868
and having Sonoko put on all kinds of makeup on him,

58
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:19,768
although he's still undecided which makeup he wants to go with.

59
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,768
-Makeup? -Yes.

60
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,368
It says on the invitation card that

61
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:25,868
since it's a Halloween party,

62
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,768
all participants must disguise themselves as monsters

63
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:32,568
and come dressed in formal black suits and dresses.

64
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:34,168
Of course anyone who comes as a companion must do likewise.

65
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,468
What? Companion?

66
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:38,668
You mean, you're going with him too?

67
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:42,768
Of course I'm not going to such a monster-filled party!

68
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,868
I guessed so.

69
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:49,068
And...

70
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:52,168
I have a favor to ask you, Dr. Agasa.

71
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,868
What is it?

72
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:57,868
If this invitation came to dad,

73
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,468
it could be that...

74
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:04,668
he got one too?

75
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,768
Oh, yeah. You mean Shinichi too?

76
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:11,368
Yes. So could you check the mailbox?

77
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,468
Unless you tell him about mail like these,

78
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:16,768
I'm sure he'll complain later.

79
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,468
Oh, okay.

80
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:21,668
If it's here, I'll call you back.

81
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:25,268
Well, I don't think he got one, though.

82
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:30,168
Oh, and please keep this a secret from Conan.

83
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,068
Because every time he goes to places like these,

84
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:36,268
he tends to stick his nose into dangerous things.

85
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:37,768
Besides...

86
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:44,768
Besides, what?

87
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,068
Oh, nothing.

88
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,968
And tell him that school will start soon

89
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,968
so to make sure to comes home

90
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:54,168
and that he shouldn't go here and there till then.

91
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,468
Yeah, okay.

92
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:56,868
I'll give him your message.

93
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:57,968
Bye.

94
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,068
Yeah.

95
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,568
How about this?

96
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,468
This is a masterpiece produced by Sonoko Suzuki!

97
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:16,868
I have this feeling that

98
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:19,768
I don't look much different from how I usually look.

99
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,168
What're you talking about?

100
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,968
You don't want it to look too drastic, do you?

101
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,768
If I cover you with heavy makeup and goofed,

102
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,968
there'd be no way out!

103
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,168
Well, that's true, but...

104
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,368
Isn't it fantastic?

105
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:35,168
You look really good, dad!

106
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:37,068
That amount of makeup is just enough

107
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:40,368
to bring out the good looks in you, Dad!

108
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,768
Do you think so?

109
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:49,168
What about you?

110
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:52,368
What kind of makeup did you decide to go as, Sonoko?

111
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:54,868
About that... Of course!

112
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,568
I'm going to go in a super cute mini skirt

113
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,168
and knock the monsters out!

114
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,368
Knock the monsters out, my gosh.

115
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:07,868
Who knows? Maybe there'll be super good-looking monsters?

116
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,768
No way, no chance.

117
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,168
So what?

118
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:15,668
I'll bet you're after some super whopper body vampire

119
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,568
or something too. Won't you, Pops?

120
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,668
And?

121
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,768
Are you planning to board the phantom ship too?

122
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:33,868
Yeah.

123
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:37,468
The sender's name kind of bothers me so...

124
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:40,268
Do you have an idea of who the sender is or something?

125
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:41,268
No.

126
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,868
Shouldn't you're the one who has an idea, Haibara?

127
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,568
Because Vermouth, like Gin and Vodka,

128
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,668
are names of liquor.

129
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:50,768
Beats me.

130
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,768
Never heard of it.

131
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:55,468
Besides, I don't know much about liquor.

132
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:58,268
It's liquor from Italy.

133
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:01,468
Vermouth is the English spelling.

134
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:05,168
In Japan it's called...

135
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,568
"Bermutto".

136
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,368
Just as I thought.

137
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:25,368
It's written on your face that the name sounds familiar.

138
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:29,068
I guess it's the code name of one of The Black Organization members.

139
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:31,268
Then you mean that invitation card is from?

140
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,868
Yeah.

141
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:37,268
An invitation from Vermouth who is one of them.

142
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,368
I don't know if they're ready to take us on

143
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:43,068
or if they just got tired of waiting

144
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,968
but I can't pass up this opportunity.

145
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,968
Don't go.

146
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:48,668
Don't go! Stop, I tell you!

147
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,968
It's a trap and if you go you'll be killed...

148
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,368
Yeah. It could be...

149
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,668
Then...

150
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,568
Then, why?

151
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:08,268
Hey, Shinichi.

152
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,068
You didn't have to do that.

153
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,568
Sorry, Haibara.

154
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:21,668
With things as they are,

155
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,168
I'm stuck and can't move on.

156
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:32,868
But,

157
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,868
I wonder if it's okay for you to leave Ai here like this

158
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,368
and leave just like that.

159
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,068
Look at the address, Dr. Agasa.

160
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:40,668
On the envelope that was delivered to my house,

161
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,568
and the invitation card in it,

162
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,868
both were addressed to the name Shinichi Kudo.

163
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,768
But the name on the letter that came with it is addressed to...

164
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:56,668
Dear Mr. Conan Edogawa?

165
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:59,968
Hey, Shinichi! This...

166
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:03,468
Yeah. Everything's out in the open.

167
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:04,868
My true identity,

168
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:08,268
the fact that my body shrunk because of Apoptoxin 4869,

169
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,568
as well as the fact that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

170
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,168
And they most probably

171
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,168
know that Haibara is the Sherry,

172
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,768
who used to be one of them.

173
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:24,368
But, isn't it strange?

174
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,468
If they have that much information already,

175
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,968
why aren't they here raiding us?

176
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:30,768
Beats me.

177
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,168
I don't know the reason

178
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:35,468
but I have a hunch

179
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:38,368
about one of the causes.

180
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:45,068
Hey. Don't tell me that you caught Ai's cold.

181
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,568
I'm fine.

182
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,468
What is that?

183
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:52,968
The telephone?

184
00:12:57,868 --> 00:12:59,168
Mail?

185
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:03,568
Okay.

186
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,068
The only problem left is...

187
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:24,368
A Halloween Party?

188
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,568
Yeah.

189
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:29,568
It's going to start tomorrow night at 19:00.

190
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,268
But, Gin,

191
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,668
why do I have to go to a crazy place like that?

192
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:36,168
Vermouth is in this.

193
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,268
We've got orders to go check out the internal affairs.

194
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:42,768
I was just about getting fed up

195
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:45,868
with that lady's secretiveness too.

196
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,268
I didn't get the go-sign, but who cares.

197
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:53,668
If she acts up,

198
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,668
I'll show no mercy.

199
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:00,568
Even if she's that person's favourite...

200
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,068
Strange.

201
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,068
It's strange after all.

202
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:24,068
Compared to when I came here to check the mailbox,

203
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:26,568
the water meter as well as the gas meter has moved,

204
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,568
although it's really slight.

205
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:36,668
Who is inside

206
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,768
this house?

207
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:48,068
I guess this is the best place to watch me and Haibara.

208
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:56,868
I know I can handle two men,

209
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,268
but what if there are more than three?

210
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,268
Cool head.

211
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:08,868
Judging from the meter,

212
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:11,068
the most that would be in here is one or two of them.

213
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,568
Besides...

214
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:04,622
What a full moon.

215
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:08,722
Really, it's so appropriate for "A Blood-smeared Party on Board"!

216
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:09,722
All right.

217
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,922
I'm getting excited!

218
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,622
I'm feeling a positive turbulent rush of blood.

219
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:16,222
Hey, Pops.

220
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,722
Isn't the werewolf the one who feels a positive

221
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,222
turbulent rush of blood when the full moon is out?

222
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:22,022
You're Dracula, you know, Pops.

223
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,322
Shut up.

224
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:26,822
I mean I'm getting a positive turbulent rush of blood as a detective!

225
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,922
Excuse me?

226
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,022
Are you two also going to be attending

227
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:34,822
the Off-season Halloween Party too?

228
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,522
Right.

229
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:37,922
I thought it was ridiculous

230
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:40,422
because it's a costume party, but...

231
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:43,122
Well, the thing is...

232
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,322
I'm going there too!

233
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:09,322
I wonder if it's going to be okay

234
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:12,322
leaving Ai like that by herself.

235
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,122
Yeah.

236
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,422
I left the room warm.

237
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,322
I also left food and water behind with her too,

238
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,722
so I don't think there'll be any problems.

239
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:27,422
I can't wait to play

240
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,122
that new game you were saying you created.

241
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:32,022
Do you want to try it?

242
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,622
The position of the things in the drawer

243
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,322
is also slightly out of place.

244
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:03,622
You looked for it

245
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:05,722
all by yourself

246
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:07,922
in order to confront them.

247
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,122
Look at them!

248
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:18,622
Werewolf.

249
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,822
Frankenstein.

250
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,522
Mummy.

251
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,922
Even Jiangshi is here!

252
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,222
It's full of monsters!

253
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,422
Really! How exciting!

254
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:32,922
Are you sure it's okay

255
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,922
for the daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group

256
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:37,422
to be mixed up among guys like this?

257
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:39,122
It's fine...

258
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:42,422
Unlike Ran, I kind of like stuff like this!

259
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,122
By the way, Sonoko?

260
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,722
Just what are you disguised as?

261
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:48,022
How rude!

262
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:49,922
I'm a witch!

263
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,222
Don't you see that I've got a broom?

264
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,922
What's with him?

265
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:05,822
Hey, Pops?

266
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:07,322
Maybe he's saying move over

267
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:09,322
because the front seats are open?

268
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:11,922
Darn it.

269
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:15,222
Then why don't you say so in a way I understand.

270
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,422
He's just really trying to be the character

271
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,922
that he's disguised as.

272
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:24,122
My... What a beautiful witch you are.

273
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,922
Thank you.

274
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:29,222
But, I'm...

275
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:31,022
not a witch.

276
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:33,222
Medusa?

277
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:36,522
I'll turn you into stone.

278
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:40,222
Will the next person show us your invitation card!

279
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,622
Sure...

280
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:48,422
You're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

281
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,722
So, you saw through my disguise?

282
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,522
Oh, no.

283
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:55,422
Your name's written on the invitation card, see?

284
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:57,422
Then, please fill in your name.

285
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:58,622
Yeah.

286
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:03,522
Kogoro. Mouri.

287
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,222
By the way...

288
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:10,422
I hope you're not planning to really commit a murder here, are you?

289
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:14,022
Well, together with this invitation card,

290
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:18,322
there was a letter hinting that a crime may be committed here!

291
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:22,222
It's true that this invitation card is what we made,

292
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,422
but I know nothing of this letter or the envelope.

293
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:27,122
Really?

294
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,222
There will be a "guess who the criminal is" game

295
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,522
played during the party though.

296
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,922
Could it be

297
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:35,922
the producer decided to do a little extra

298
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:37,322
to make sure he'll come here.

299
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:39,122
Producer?

300
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:42,022
Oh, no, it's nothing.

301
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:44,822
But, we're sure that you'll enjoy the cursed banquet.

302
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:46,122
Come on, Pops!

303
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:48,322
Let's hurry and go!

304
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,322
Oh, Hey, you!

305
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,722
Next guest please!

306
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,522
Your invitation card, please.

307
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:12,822
Aren't you by chance

308
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:14,622
the high school detective?

309
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:18,122
"Shinichi Kudo"

310
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,186
Thank you.

311
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,386
But, they sure got a lot of them gathered here.

312
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:55,586
You can say that again.

313
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:56,686
What?

314
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:04,086
It's finally going to start.

315
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:05,186
Yeah.

316
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,986
You devilish diabolic monsters

317
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:13,086
who wander through the nether world,

318
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:17,886
welcome to our haunted ship named Phantom.

319
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:23,586
I am Captain Gold and I will be navigating this phantom ship.

320
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:26,386
There's only an hour more to go before the party.

321
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:30,486
Please pick your comrades who will be sharing fate with you.

322
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:35,786
Seven comrades who have received the same seal as yourself.

323
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:37,286
The same seal?

324
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:38,786
The tarot card!

325
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:41,486
You got one when you came on board too, didn't you?

326
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,786
I think we're going to team up with people who got the same card

327
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:47,286
and play a game or something.

328
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:52,186
You mean this XV that's written here,

329
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:54,486
the card of the goat.

330
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,686
Which means we're on the goat team?

331
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:59,486
That's not a goat.

332
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,986
In Roman Numerals XV is the figure 15.

333
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:05,586
The name of the card is The Devil.

334
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,386
The card of the devil.

335
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,286
Oh, is that right?

336
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:11,486
Besides, we weren't divided in groups

337
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:14,486
just to play a game.

338
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:18,386
This party is also an audition for a role in a movie too.

339
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:19,986
An audition?

340
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,386
You know, don't you?

341
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:22,786
The movie that's played every summer called

342
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:26,086
"The Diary of Captain Ghost's Voyage".

343
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:27,486
Yeah.

344
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,886
The one about a load of monsters riding a phantom ship

345
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:33,586
and coming to get people who performed evil deeds.

346
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:34,786
Which means if things work out,

347
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,986
I may appear in the movie too?

348
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,286
Yes.

349
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:41,786
This seems to be the fourth time this party's been held,

350
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:42,986
and each year the movie staff

351
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,086
seem to be mixed among everyone here

352
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:47,386
to judge carefully for the cast.

353
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:50,786
I see.

354
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:53,686
Everyone wants to play the part of popular monster roles,

355
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:56,986
so they divide people into teams to make choosing easier.

356
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,286
That's why everyone's

357
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:01,086
trying to put out their best, right?

358
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:04,486
The Werewolf who roars towards the moon.

359
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,586
The Frankenstein that moves like a robot

360
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,886
and does pantomime.

361
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:13,686
The Mummy who keeps his silence no matter who talks to him.

362
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,986
Well, although they're going to appear in the movie,

363
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:18,086
they're no more than supporting actors

364
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,986
who will appear behind the main stars.

365
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:22,386
Since it'll cost an enormous amount of money

366
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,686
if the film company has to cover makeup fees

367
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:26,086
and everything for all the supporting actors,

368
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:29,086
so they let horror fans appear in their best outfits

369
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:31,986
and put on their best act.

370
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:36,886
Besides, holding an event on the this ship that was used in the movie

371
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:39,086
will serve as an advertisement for the movie too.

372
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,586
All right, all of you!

373
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,686
The time to set sail has come!

374
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:53,786
We shall cross the seven cursed seas

375
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,486
and show the conceited humans our power

376
00:24:56,486 --> 00:25:00,986
as well as teach them a lesson!

377
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:08,286
Don't tell me this ship is...

378
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:09,586
really going to move?

379
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:17,986
Is there anyone who has the card of Death?

380
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:19,386
Hermit!

381
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:22,186
Anybody around who has the card of the Hermit?

382
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:31,486
What? Shinichi Kudo?

383
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:34,186
You mean that high school detective is on this ship?

384
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:35,686
Right...

385
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:38,686
But I heard that he was involved in some kind of incident

386
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:40,486
and was killed.

387
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:43,786
No way! That's nothing but lies!

388
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:46,586
And? What kind of disguise was he in?

389
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,086
He was bandaged up,

390
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:49,386
so maybe a mummy?

391
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,486
A mummy detective.

392
00:25:50,486 --> 00:25:52,486
That would be so handsome!

393
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:58,886
Okay!

394
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,686
All seven of us are here!

395
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,486
They're the people we saw just a while ago.

396
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,786
Now our names...

397
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:08,386
This is Medusa.

398
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:12,386
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy.

399
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:17,886
And can we call you Mummy 2?

400
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:23,686
What? Do you want to shake hands?

401
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,386
I see.

402
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:34,786
You're Invisible Man.

403
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:36,286
So...

404
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:40,486
I wonder what the seven of us are going to do?

405
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:43,686
They did say that this was a catch the culprit sort of game.

406
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:54,586
How do you like the game I made this time?

407
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:55,986
It's pretty cool, don't you think?

408
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:58,186
Yeah. It's a masterpiece!

409
00:26:58,186 --> 00:26:59,886
Right!

410
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:02,786
-I'm sure this'll satisfy them. -Yes, Agasa residence.

411
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:04,186
-I'll call them first thing tomorrow. -I'm sorry for calling this late.

412
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:05,486
This is Dr. Araide.

413
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,086
-Is Dr. Agasa there? -I'll have them monitor it!

414
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:08,586
He's not in.

415
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,586
I think he went out somewhere with Edogawa.

416
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,786
What? But I hear their voices.

417
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:16,386
This?

418
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,786
It's their recorded voices.

419
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,986
I don't know what prank they're up to.

420
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:25,386
But it's been playing for some time now.

421
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:27,386
So, what's up?

422
00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:29,186
Oh, yeah.

423
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:31,986
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

424
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:36,286
Well, your cold's taking a while to get better, right?

425
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:40,986
So I figured you should be checked at a hospital with good facilities,

426
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:43,486
and asked a friend doctor of mine,

427
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,186
but was told that he has to go on a business trip,

428
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:47,786
so he's only available tonight.

429
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:49,186
That is why...

430
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:51,086
I know this is really sudden

431
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,486
but can I go pick you up now?

432
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:57,786
I'll notify Dr. Agasa later for you.

433
00:27:57,786 --> 00:28:00,686
Well, I don't want to force you though.

434
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,386
It doesn't bother me.

435
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:06,486
I was kind of angry anyway because they're doing their own thing.

436
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:09,286
Besides, it's boring staying home alone.

437
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:11,986
Great.

438
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:14,086
Then, okay.

439
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:16,486
I'll be there in about an hour

440
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,786
so will you get ready to leave as soon as I get there?

441
00:28:19,786 --> 00:28:20,886
Okay.

442
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:22,486
I'll see you in an hour then.

443
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:43,781
All right! All seven of us have finally gathered!

444
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:46,381
What dense guys.

445
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,181
Pops?

446
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:54,081
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy are nowhere in sight.

447
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,281
What?

448
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:56,781
I wonder if they went to the toilet.

449
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,581
I guess so?

450
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,981
If that is the case, let's go see.

451
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:05,281
The party is about to begin too.

452
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,381
Yeah.

453
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:11,981
It's over here.

454
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,681
Oh, there he is!

455
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:15,881
I tell you, Frankenstein!

456
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:19,381
We looked all over for you!

457
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:22,881
What a toilet this is, though.

458
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:25,081
It's dimly lit and full of spider webs,

459
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,981
even the mirror is cracked.

460
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:29,581
Not only that, men and women have to use the toilet together!

461
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,181
After all, we're all monsters,

462
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:35,581
so I guess there's no need to differentiate between men and women.

463
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:37,581
It won't come off.

464
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:41,181
The blood on my hands won't come off.

465
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:44,881
It won't come off even if I wash my hands.

466
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:48,781
Hey, acting your part even in the toilet too?

467
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:50,281
Excuse me.

468
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:54,381
Are Werewolf and Mummy here?

469
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:58,981
They don't seem to be here.

470
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,081
Yeah.

471
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,581
What was that?

472
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:31,981
Hey, boss! What's up?

473
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:33,181
Bartender.

474
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,981
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

475
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:38,281
Silver Bullet?

476
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:41,181
White Lady for me then, please.

477
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:42,781
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,581
Hey, you don't look too hot.

479
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:48,081
Are you bummed out or something?

480
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,281
Hey.

481
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:56,381
What is it?

482
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:58,581
Is he looking for somebody?

483
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:05,781
I wonder where Mummy disappeared to?

484
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,481
How should I know? Geez...

485
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:11,781
Of all things! Talk about not being able to work in groups.

486
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:14,381
An hour has already gone by.

487
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:16,981
-What? -What's...

488
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:20,081
The party has started.

489
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,681
Listen, you monsters.

490
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:30,081
I've got good news for all of you.

491
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,981
The bait's been set.

492
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,681
It seems that there is a human

493
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:38,081
among us at this party

494
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,481
that is neither ugly nor possesses evil power.

495
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,981
Go now and join hands with the seven comrades

496
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:46,381
that you will share your fate with.

497
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:49,581
Find the good-for-nothing, tear its meat apart,

498
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:51,381
pull out its guts

499
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:54,481
and drink up to the last drop the blood

500
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,881
that comes flowing out!

501
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,081
Okay!

502
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,081
If it's looking for the culprit, there's none other than I,

503
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:04,381
Kogoro Mouri, more suited for the job!

504
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,681
But, not all seven of us are here yet.

505
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,281
Who cares!

506
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:11,281
If I figure out who the culprit is,

507
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:13,881
I'm sure they'll come walking out from their side!

508
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:19,281
I have the keyword which is the hint to who it is.

509
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:21,481
If you want to get hold of the treasure

510
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,081
that is to be your reward,

511
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:25,181
come out to deck and receive my revelation...

512
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,481
What's that?

513
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,681
What's the matter?

514
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:51,481
I'm sorry, the load that was on the construction truck fell off.

515
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:53,481
We'll clear it up right away,

516
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,681
so please give us a moment.

517
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,381
I'm in a bit of a rush,

518
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:58,681
so I'm going to go around.

519
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,181
I'm sorry.

520
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,081
I'm sorry.

521
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,081
Thank you for waiting.

522
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,781
You may go through now.

523
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,881
Thank you. Goodbye.

524
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,181
Take care!

525
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:35,181
He just went through.

526
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,381
What's that?

527
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:40,881
That's...

528
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:46,281
Captain of the phantom ship?

529
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:50,781
What a grand performance.

530
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:59,181
This is real blood.

531
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:00,181
What?

532
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:01,281
Hurry!

533
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:03,381
Hurry, somebody get him down!

534
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,181
Yes...

535
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,481
Hi.

536
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:00,571
Hi.

537
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:10,471
Oh, I'm sorry to have surprised you.

538
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:13,271
I'm an English teacher of Teitan High School,

539
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:16,171
where Dr. Araide is in charge of.

540
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:20,471
His car broke down on his way here.

541
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:24,371
That's why I've come to pick you up instead!

542
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:30,571
If it's okay with you, will you please unchain the door?

543
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,871
I'm really late.

544
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,071
Jodie.

545
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,971
His chest is pierced through with an arrow of a bow gun.

546
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,171
Moreover,

547
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:21,271
the card of the devil is here too.

548
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:26,471
So, the devil's the guide to the world beyond?

549
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,271
I don't think he needed any guide to take him

550
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:31,271
to the world beyond though,

551
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,571
because he seemed to have died on the spot.

552
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,071
True.

553
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:37,571
And as for the bow gun that fired the arrow,

554
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:41,171
it's probably been disposed of somewhere in this vast Pacific Ocean

555
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,771
so virtually will not be found.

556
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:47,671
So, I wonder if there's a camera on this ship?

557
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,871
I'd like to take a picture of the scene.

558
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:52,371
We have a digital camera

559
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:54,471
that we are using to take pictures of this party.

560
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:56,971
Well, it's something that will serve as evidence

561
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:58,971
so I'd prefer something on film, but...

562
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,071
Pops,

563
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:03,171
I've got a disposable camera on me.

564
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,871
See.

565
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:07,371
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

566
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:18,771
I'll take a look at his face then.

567
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:24,271
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

568
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:28,871
Isn't he a movie producer that appears a lot on TV?

569
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,671
I think his name was Senzo Fukuura.

570
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:35,071
I think he became famous

571
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:38,371
after producing the Unlucky Days series,

572
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:40,571
before the Phantom Ship Captain series.

573
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:44,671
Are you saying that the producer appeared in the movie in person

574
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:46,271
and acted the role of the captain of Phantom Ship?

575
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:50,971
No, the movie was filmed using a real actor.

576
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:54,371
Mr. Fukuura loved the captain of the Phantom Ship,

577
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:56,871
so he used to play the role of his own initiative every year

578
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:58,671
at the party on board.

579
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:01,571
Mr. Fukuura is the one who planned the performance of

580
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,171
appearing on the mast with the light shining on him

581
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,371
and giving out hints to the quiz.

582
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,671
Yeah.

583
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:11,771
You mean that quiz about humans being mixed up here among the monsters.

584
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:15,571
There's a microphone attached to the inside of the mask.

585
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:22,071
It seems he was talking directly into this microphone.

586
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:24,771
And?

587
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:27,171
What's the answer to this quiz?

588
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,771
Well, the quizzes and hints

589
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,571
were decide on by Mr. Fukuura alone,

590
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,771
so we, the staff know nothing about them.

591
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:38,071
We heard that the first group to solve the quiz

592
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:42,771
would receive an invitation to the preview of the movie, though.

593
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:44,371
Well,

594
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:49,371
it seems quite definite that one of you among the staff is the killer.

595
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,271
First of all,

596
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,971
Mr. Fukuura who was disguised as the captain of the phantom ship

597
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:58,271
started suffering while he was announcing the quiz.

598
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:02,771
He was probably struck by the bow gun then.

599
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:04,471
However, back then,

600
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:06,171
we, the passengers,

601
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:09,471
were still inside the ship at the party hall.

602
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,571
It would've been impossible for us

603
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,171
to fire the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

604
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:14,771
who was on the top of the mast.

605
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,571
So high chances the person who killed him

606
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,471
is the one who prepared the lighting

607
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:22,071
and audio devices when he announce the quiz,

608
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:24,571
which is one of the staff.

609
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,071
Secondly, this card of the devil.

610
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:30,071
The killer probably wanted to mislead people into thinking

611
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:32,771
that one of the passengers who boarded this ship

612
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,071
that received this card is the killer.

613
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:37,871
Since you're the ones who prepared the cards,

614
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:40,171
you probably could make as many of these cards as you wanted to.

615
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:41,271
No.

616
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:45,671
These cards were made by Mr. Fukuura to avoid foul play.

617
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:47,771
So, it would have been impossible for any of the staff

618
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:49,171
to prepare these cards.

619
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,671
Last year he used playing cards.

620
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:55,471
Besides there was a passenger who was on deck

621
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:57,471
before the quiz was announced too.

622
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:59,671
Saying that he wanted to look at the ocean.

623
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:02,871
I don't remember who exactly that person was

624
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:05,071
since it was dark though.

625
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,271
Oh, is that right?

626
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,471
I see.

627
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,971
Which means the possibility of the killer being among us

628
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:17,171
who has received the card of the devil is high!

629
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,271
Are you okay?

630
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:37,971
The doctor that we're going to see is very efficient!

631
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:40,771
So, your cold will be cured right away

632
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,171
and you'll feel better in no time at all.

633
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,171
By the way,

634
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,271
when is this ship returning to the harbor?

635
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:08,171
I think it'll be another hour or so.

636
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:09,371
I see.

637
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:11,671
Then, shall we go inside the ship

638
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:13,871
and investigate the case?

639
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,871
Mr. Sleeping Vampire?

640
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,371
Oh, okay.

641
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:26,671
What's up, Pops?

642
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:28,971
It seems we're going to be late

643
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:30,771
so I thought I'd let Ran know.

644
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,271
She's not answering.

645
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:53,571
Maybe she's taking a bath?

646
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:57,371
