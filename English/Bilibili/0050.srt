1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,210
As times change, difficult
cases will increase in number!

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,190
Today's stage is a library at night!

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,100
Its books smell of crime!

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,940
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,100
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,430
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,260
Hattori Heiji showed up,
and then I drank his alcohol...

8
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,980
That's gotta be it!

9
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,600
Drinking that alcohol
turned me back to normal!

10
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,310
If I drink this all,
I can turn back completely!

11
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,190
Hey, you!

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,280
You know you shouldn't drink alcohol!

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,240
Your friends are here!

14
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,850
Once I drink that alcohol and
turn back into a high school student,

15
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,880
I might never get to
hang out with them again...

16
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,210
The Library Murder Case.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,300
Beika Library

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,350
Geez, they're all such lame books...

19
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm supposed to
do a book report on this?

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,350
And what's with this
awkward arrangement?!

21
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,140
Well, guess it can't be helped.

22
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,850
This is the children's section and all...

23
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,680
An imported foreign book...

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,830
Huh? It's shrink-wrapped
in its case backwards...

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,880
Now, now. This isn't
a book for children.

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Oh, I'm sorry!

27
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,840
Conan-kun! Look! Police cars!

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,510
Eh?!

29
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,510
What do you suppose happened?

30
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,470
Maybe it's a case!

31
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,260
Used Books

32
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
Sir! There are policemen downstairs!

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,840
Eh? Oh, I see. I'll be right there.

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,060
I'm gonna check it out!

35
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,740
Eh?

36
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,200
H-Hey, wait up, Conan!

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,380
Hold the elevator!

38
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,430
Max Capacity: 7 people, 450 kg

39
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,050
We're over the passenger limit.
Max Capacity: 7 people, 450 kg

40
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,720
Maximum capacity is seven people.
Max Capacity: 7 people, 450 kg

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,460
One!
Max Capacity: 7 people, 450 kg

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,210
Two! Three! Four!
Five! Six! Seven!

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,630
There's only seven people in here!

44
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,800
You didn't count yourself!

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,880
Told you! Genta-kun doesn't catch colds--

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,640
Quiet!

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,480
No choice!
Let's take the stairs!

48
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,180
You're the director
of this library, yes?

49
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,530
Yes. My name is Tsugawa.

50
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,010
I'm here about this fellow,

51
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,370
a librarian named
Tamada Kazuo-san.

52
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,830
Oh, yes. He's been taking
unapproved leave since yesterday.

53
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,010
Hey, Inspector! What's going on?

54
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,040
Did something happen to him?

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,010
Actually, Tamada-san has
been missing since two nights ago.

56
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,590
Eh?! Y-You can't be serious!

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,050
I hear he worked overtime
with you two nights ago...

58
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,350
Yes...

59
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,840
But I left before he did,

60
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,010
so I'm not sure
what happened afterward...

61
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,810
Say, then why are you
checking the library's storeroom?

62
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,340
He might've been abducted
on his way home, you know.

63
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,680
It's just to be on the safe side.

64
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,090
Tamada-san is a meticulous person;

65
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,300
he always called his wife

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,660
from this library
before leaving for home.

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,840
But he didn't two nights ago.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,340
In short, he was either taken away,

69
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,090
or is still inside this library.

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,340
But if he is here,

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,930
then there's a good chance
he's already been killed!

72
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,180
Inspector. We checked all
inconspicuous places,

73
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,130
but found nothing...

74
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,020
I guess that means he left...

75
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,930
Alright! Let's go!

76
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,930
I apologize for the inconvenience!

77
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,240
Not at all...

78
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,880
Alright! Everyone's gone!

79
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,720
Geez, I told you to go home!

80
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,260
What now, Conan-kun?!

81
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,900
We find the body.

82
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,980
Eh?! But the police said...

83
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,270
Something stinks about this library...

84
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,750
Stinks?

85
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,880
Huh?

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
The elevator!
Someone's coming up!

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Hide!

88
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,710
That's Tsugawa-san,
the library director!

89
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,860
What's he up to at this hour?

90
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,300
That's where that
weird foreign book was...

91
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,510
Tamada was such a fool.

92
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,010
If only he hadn't looked inside this,

93
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,140
he wouldn't have had to die.

94
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
And the police are the police.

95
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,230
They left so easily...

96
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,550
Little did they know Tamada
is resting inside this very library...

97
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,280
Just as I thought!

98
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,500
Tamada-san's body is
inside this library!

99
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,960
And it was the library
director who killed him!

100
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,960
But where is the body?

101
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,380
That's the weird book that was
shrink-wrapped backwards in its case...

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,220
It's too dark to see anything!

103
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,810
Who's there?!

104
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,190
Is someone there?!

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
In here?!

106
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,600
I don't think we should
leave for a while...

107
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,130
C'mon, Conan, I'm hungry.
I want an eel boxed lunch...

108
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,030
Alright! He's gone!

109
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,610
I'll start with the
strange books in that box...

110
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,750
Huh? They're empty!

111
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,510
He must've put the contents
in his bag before he left!

112
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,180
I doubt it.

113
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,510
Look at all these cases!

114
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,760
His bag couldn't have fit it all!

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,470
The ones he couldn't fit,

116
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,140
he must've hid
somewhere in this room.

117
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,600
Looks like we'll hafta look for the
books before we look for the body.

118
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,690
So it's finally time for the Junior
Detective League to do its stuff?!

119
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,130
Y-Yeah...

120
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,840
Let's start with this bookcase!

121
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,910
Let's split up and
check both sides!

122
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,580
Alright!

123
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,790
I-Idiot! Don't turn the lights on!

124
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,460
But it was dark...

125
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,510
What if he sees?!

126
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,930
Don't worry!

127
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,350
I'm sure he's already long gone!

128
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,630
I sure hope so...

129
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,850
Looks like he's really gone...

130
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,680
Any strange books?

131
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,400
Nope, nothing.

132
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,180
Looks like they're
not in this bookcase.

133
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,330
We took out most of the books.

134
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,950
What the--?! They haven't
taken any of their books out!

135
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,750
Hey! Genta!

136
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,760
Oh, Conan-kun...

137
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,830
What're you guys doing?!

138
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,550
We took out all our books!

139
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
Eh?!

140
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,180
That's strange!

141
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,010
We took all ours out, too!

142
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,640
W-What's with this book!?

143
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,430
There's no spine!

144
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,600
You're right!

145
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,810
H-Hey! All these books are like that!

146
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,680
I get it! These books weren't
backwards in their cases;

147
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,970
they never had spines to begin with!

148
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,010
Eh? What do you mean?

149
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,840
Basically, the director put these books

150
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,800
between the ones on the shelves

151
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,550
to make three rows.

152
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,210
So if someone took out a book,

153
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,680
they would see open pages behind it.

154
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,330
They would think it's
a book on the other side,

155
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,220
and not realize the truth.

156
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,800
This is the children's corner,
which makes it all the more believable.

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,770
The books were all skewed
because the middle books pushed them.

158
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,430
But why do that?

159
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,630
The fact these weird books
are imported from overseas

160
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,660
probably means
they contain guns, or...

161
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,660
...drugs!

162
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,880
T-There's some in here, too!

163
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,960
And here!

164
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,840
So basically, that library
director is smuggling drugs?!

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,680
Yeah. He would store the drugs here,

166
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,220
and then sell them off slowly.

167
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,010
Tamada-san probably discovered this,

168
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,220
and was killed.

169
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,720
By Director Tsugawa...

170
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,570
Huh? That's strange.
I can't get through...

171
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,510
Is it out of order?

172
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,070
Yeah. Our only option now is
to leave and tell the police directly.

173
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,070
Then let's find the
body too while we're at it!

174
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,130
Yeah! Good thinking!
That'll double our achievement!

175
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,370
I agree!

176
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,250
Oh, geez...

177
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,840
Once we find the body,
we'll be so famous!

178
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,590
This is so exciting!

179
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,390
My shoe came untied...

180
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,350
It's hard to tie it in the dark...

181
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,680
Ayumi-chan!

182
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,660
What're you doing?!

183
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,850
My shoe...

184
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,820
That's what you get for
wearing those annoying shoes!

185
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,340
You're mean!

186
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,350
These are my favorite ones, you know!

187
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,800
I guess nobody would
hide a body in a bookcase, huh?

188
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,460
But the police did say they
searched all inconspicuous places!

189
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,180
There's no place left to look...

190
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,680
Hey! There are weird
bookcases in the back!

191
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,600
See?! They got weird handles!

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,590
Oh! These are mobile bookcases!

193
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,730
Mobile?

194
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,480
Yes!

195
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,110
Turn this handle, and... See?

196
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,610
Awesome!

197
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,490
I dunno... It would be easy for
someone to discover the body here...

198
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,220
This is fun!

199
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,750
Darn it!
What's wrong, Genta?

200
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,210
The handle's too hard to turn!

201
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,410
It couldn't be!

202
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,720
Mitsuhiko! Ayumi-chan!
Help me move this!

203
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
Okay!

204
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,880
Ready... go!

205
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,400
Huh? There's nothing here...

206
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,100
And there's
nothing strange here...

207
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,470
Which means the
reason it wouldn't move...

208
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,510
...was because you're heavy, Genta!

209
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,870
W-Well, excuse me!

210
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,510
You're too fat, Genta-kun!

211
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,510
How much do you weigh?!

212
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,330
F-Forty kilograms!

213
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,880
That's exactly twice my weight!

214
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,680
Man, I can't stand this...

215
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,970
Just endure it! Today's my last
day hanging out with these kids!

216
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,330
Once I drink that alcohol
and return to being a high schooler...

217
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,720
Return?

218
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,510
I'm only 15 kilograms!
You need to diet more!

219
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,850
S-Shut up!

220
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,770
Oh, yeah! I forgot! I'm a kid now!

221
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,030
Hold on! I was 18 kg
when I last weighed myself!

222
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,860
Hold the elevator!

223
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,040
I know where the body is hidden!

224
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,580
Hey, Conan! Wait up!

225
00:14:57,093 --> 00:15:00,183
Hey, Conan! Where are you?!

226
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,843
Conan-kun! Say something!

227
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,413
Conan-kun!

228
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,603
Where were you?!

229
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,703
Just up in the machinery room.

230
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,983
Was the body in there?!

231
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:20,963
No, I only went there to switch
these elevator doors to manual.

232
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,483
The body... is probably in here!

233
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,083
You're sure it's in here?

234
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,183
Yep.

235
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,813
The proof is the overload
buzzer that went off

236
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:36,353
when we all got on
the elevator this afternoon.

237
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,353
Eh?

238
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,853
Of course it went off;

239
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:41,653
there were 8 people
in the elevator...

240
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,063
Don't be stupid! We're kids!

241
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:46,353
All together,
we weigh at most 100 kg!

242
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,693
An adult and a half!

243
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:51,663
Even with the weight
of the adults and the box,

244
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,623
there was one whole person
missing for the buzzer to go off!

245
00:15:55,623 --> 00:16:00,523
Yes. Someone was riding
this elevator from the very start.

246
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:03,343
Somewhere where nobody
could see him...

247
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:04,973
...on the roof!

248
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:14,103
It would seem he was thrown
down this shaft after being strangled.

249
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,523
It was all Director Tsugawa's doing.

250
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:19,443
Now let's go tell the police!

251
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:22,193
What's wrong?

252
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,353
A-A--

253
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:24,523
T-Tsu--

254
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:25,563
D-Dir--

255
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:27,233
Atsudir?

256
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,663
D-Director Tsugawa!

257
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:39,913
What are you kiddos
doing here at this hour?

258
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,023
Come now.

259
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:45,343
Let's all leave together...

260
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:46,673
Come...

261
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:50,683
Listen. Do exactly as I say.

262
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,353
What are you discussing?

263
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:56,063
Let's leave now...

264
00:16:57,193 --> 00:17:00,813
Don't underestimate us just
because we're kids, Director!

265
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,313
What?

266
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,523
We've got the evidence.

267
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,283
The bookcase trick,
the hidden drugs,

268
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:13,453
and the fact you killed
Tamada-san after he found out!

269
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:18,043
Who... Who are you?!

270
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:21,373
Edogawa Conan! A detective!

271
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,993
D-Detective?!

272
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,633
Oh, no, you don't!

273
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:34,923
He slides, he's safe!

274
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,473
We did it!

275
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,893
Damn you brats!
You can't escape me!

276
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:50,063
I made it!

277
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:52,813
It's time to die...

278
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,973
...brats!

279
00:17:57,063 --> 00:18:00,833
T-They're gone?
Did they get off?

280
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:06,313
No matter. With the elevator off,

281
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:07,923
they're trapped like rats...

282
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:12,193
Just you wait, little rats.

283
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:15,183
I'll kill each and every one of you!

284
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:20,353
Hey! Where are you, kiddos?!

285
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,443
I'm sorry about earlier!

286
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:27,393
I won't try to hurt you now!
Come on out!

287
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,493
In here?

288
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:43,663
Do they honestly think
this is a barricade?

289
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,343
It's leaning...

290
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:56,303
Ah! They stuck books under it...

291
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,063
Now!

292
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:12,033
Kids have such shallow cleverness.

293
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:16,073
Don't worry. You won't be lonely...

294
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:21,553
Because I'm about to send
all four of you to the afterlife!

295
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,753
We did it!

296
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:34,063
It worked perfectly!

297
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:42,143
After our call, the police rushed
over and arrested Director Tsugawa.

298
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:47,153
They also recovered Tamada-san's
body and all the drugs.

299
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:54,073
And so Edogawa Conan's
final case came to an end.

300
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,943
That was so scary!

301
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,063
I thought we were goners!

302
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,913
Get real! Good always wins!

303
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:03,873
So now it's goodbye to this body...

304
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,453
Let's do that again sometime, Conan-kun!

305
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:07,543
Eh?

306
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,813
The detective club!

307
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:13,523
Together, the four of us
can solve any case easily!

308
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:15,853
Alright! Let's try
hard next time, too!

309
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:16,963
Yeah!

310
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:21,903
And... goodbye to them, too...

311
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,393
C-Conan-kun?

312
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,103
See you!

313
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:35,483
It's like he's leaving somehow...

314
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,153
Yeah...

315
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:40,823
That's right! I'm turning
back into my normal body!

316
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:43,703
Into high school student,
Kudo Shinichi!

317
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:48,723
With this alcohol...
I can finally be me again!

318
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,023
Conan-kun? Did you just get home?

319
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:56,213
What were you doing this late at--

320
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,263
Conan-kun?

321
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,933
What?! Your body reverted?!

322
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,933
Yeah! After one drink of this alcohol!

323
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,273
You can't be serious...

324
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:13,393
If you don't believe me,
then just watch!

325
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:14,363
H-Hey!

326
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:21,173
Here it comes!
My body's warming up!

327
00:22:55,523 --> 00:23:00,773
C'mon, Doc!
I haven't turned back one bit!

328
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:04,523
You probably built up an immunity...

329
00:23:04,523 --> 00:23:05,593
Immunity?

330
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:11,263
Basically, the alcohol somehow
turned you back the first time,

331
00:23:11,263 --> 00:23:16,023
but your body started to produce
a substance to counteract the alcohol,

332
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:18,313
thus rendering it ineffective.

333
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,943
Yeah, right!
I just haven't had enough yet!

334
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,393
H-Hey, stop it, Shinichi!

335
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:25,593
Gulp, gulp!

336
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:27,393
Stop it!

337
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:35,853
What's wrong, Conan-kun?!

338
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:38,023
You don't look so good...

339
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,633
Is it another cold?

340
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:45,063
Don't be dumb.
It's just a hangover...

341
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:49,923
Another miss?

342
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:52,393
Twenty in a row...

343
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:54,283
He sure sucks at golf...

344
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:58,393
Yeah, he says he's not good
at any sports that use equipment.

345
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,953
Then what was that metallic sound?!

346
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:05,983
That's it!

347
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:08,313
This is a trick the killer set!

348
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,113
That person definitely did it!

349
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,123
On the next Conan--

350
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:15,063
"The Golf Range Murder Case."
