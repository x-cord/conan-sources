1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:03,066
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:04,766
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,566
In today's episode, the mysterious key is the key.

4
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,666
A surprise behind locked doors.

5
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,166
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,166
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,766
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,979
I'm sure it was around here.

9
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,179
Did you say Hikari Souda?

10
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,979
Yeah, it's a rundown old apartment building

11
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,279
that looks like it'll fall any minute.

12
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,679
Hey.

13
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,979
I think, this might be it.

14
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,679
Maison Hikari.

15
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,979
I don't believe it.

16
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,879
"Case Of The Key Underwater In A Locked Room"

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,379
"Mitsue Souda (73) Landlord" -Oh, I'm so sorry,

18
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,979
I had this place rebuilt this Spring into a condominium.

19
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:35,379
Gee... I didn't know that, what a shock.

20
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:38,779
It's a lot different from the apartment you stayed in

21
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,479
when you were a student, isn't it?

22
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,779
It sure is, like night and day.

23
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:46,379
As a matter of fact, you left here after only 6 months

24
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,779
to get away from your nagging landlord, didn't you?

25
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,179
I... I don't remember.

26
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,079
Hey, Ma'am, do you live here all alone?

27
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,079
That's right, my children have moved away.

28
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,679
But my grandson lives on this floor.

29
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,979
Here you go, eat up...

30
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,179
Wow, looks delicious.

31
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:12,679
You're not so lonely then.

32
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,979
No, I'm not, since Makoto is staying here with me.

33
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,479
He is studying construction at Jyonan University

34
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,779
but lately, he's been so depressed.

35
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,879
I asked why but he won't tell me.

36
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,179
So I thought a famous private detective like you

37
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:31,179
would be able to get him to talk.

38
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,679
Is that why you called me?

39
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:38,379
He said he'd drop by around 8pm.

40
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,279
Go check on him.

41
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,879
Only he and I live on the 4th floor.

42
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,879
I'm only renting out the rooms on the 1st to 3rd floors.

43
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,979
"Makoto Souda"

44
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,879
That's odd.

45
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,779
He might be sleeping.

46
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,679
I will open the door with my key.

47
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:01,079
Do you think we should go in without his permission?

48
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,579
It's all right, he's my grandson.

49
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,579
Makoto, are you in?

50
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,979
Good grief, what a mess.

51
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:17,579
What is this?

52
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,179
Excuse me.

53
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,779
Sir.

54
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,279
Is that what I think it is?

55
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,579
No, it's just crayon.

56
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,479
Oh, no.

57
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,579
Even over here.

58
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,679
Monument in the water?

59
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,479
What in the world is this?

60
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,779
-How awful. -Makoto?

61
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,079
There's a key in the water.

62
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,279
Makoto?

63
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,979
Makoto!

64
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,879
Makoto?

65
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,379
Makoto?

66
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,279
Makoto!

67
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,779
What's wrong?

68
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,279
Makoto? Wake up!

69
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,079
Makoto?

70
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,079
Makoto!

71
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,679
On the inside of his left wrist...

72
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,779
No hesitation cuts.

73
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,579
Hurry, call an ambulance.

74
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:00,779
-No. It's too late. -That's ridiculous!

75
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,179
Oh, I know, call Kido!

76
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,179
Kido?

77
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:06,579
He's a medical student, he lives on the 3rd floor.

78
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,879
He and Makoto are friends!

79
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,179
But your grandson is already...

80
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,679
Never mind, just get him!

81
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,079
I'll go get him!

82
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,879
"Yoshihiko Kido"

83
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,879
Mr. Kido!

84
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,979
Mr. Kido!

85
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,579
Mr. Kido?

86
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,679
Mr. Kido.

87
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,279
How smelly.

88
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,879
Oh, he's only in a drunken sleep.

89
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,879
Just look at this place.

90
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,279
Who're you?

91
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,379
Mr. Kido! Something's happened to Makoto!

92
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,579
Come quick!

93
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,879
Makoto!

94
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,079
The deceased is Makoto Souda, 22 years old.

95
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,779
He was a senior at Jyonan University,

96
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,179
majoring in construction in the engineering department.

97
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,979
Cause of death is assumed to be loss of blood

98
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,979
due to the severed artery of the upper arm.

99
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,979
Judging from rigor mortis of the neck region,

100
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,779
it looks like he's been dead for 2-3 hours.

101
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:49,579
Which puts the time of death between 6 and 7pm, is that correct?

102
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,679
Inspector, this is clearly a suicide.

103
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,579
A suicide?

104
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,479
Yes, please follow me.

105
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,679
-Look at this! -And what is this?

106
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,979
A model the deceased made.

107
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,279
Notice there's a key in the lake.

108
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,079
It's the key to this apartment,

109
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,679
it's a specially made key

110
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:14,579
so duplication is impossible.

111
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,979
And there are only 2 spares.

112
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,579
His grandmother has 1 and the other

113
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,879
is kept by the management company.

114
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,279
When you got here, the door was...

115
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,679
It was locked.

116
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,079
Which means the apartment was completely sealed off.

117
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,079
I see, so that's why you concluded it was suicide.

118
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,379
You're wrong!

119
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,279
He would never commit suicide!

120
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,979
When I brought him juice this evening,

121
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,479
he said he wanted to eat pumpkin for dinner.

122
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,879
What time was that?

123
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,179
Just about 5pm.

124
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,579
I went out right after that.

125
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,079
He was killed while I was gone.

126
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,779
What kind of juice was it?

127
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,179
It's my own blend to prevent summer heat fatigue.

128
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,379
It has some honey, garlic, banana in it.

129
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,379
And anyway, he showed no signs of wanting to kill himself,

130
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,179
besides, he had no reason.

131
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,179
Makoto was troubled.

132
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,779
In what way?

133
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,579
He said the design he was working on for his graduation project

134
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,579
wasn't coming along.

135
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,679
I knew it.

136
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,779
Maybe that's why he was so depressed.

137
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,779
And judging from the red crayon scratches on the wall

138
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,579
and the mess in the room,

139
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:36,079
he must have been in a very unstable state of mind.

140
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,479
Excuse me, Inspector.

141
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:41,279
What is this white thing attached to the key?

142
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,879
Huh?

143
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,379
You're right, what could it be?

144
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,279
Oh!

145
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,179
What are you doing, you fool?

146
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:51,779
I think this is toilet paper.

147
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,879
Toilet paper?

148
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,779
Yes. Tissue and other kinds of paper

149
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,379
won't disintegrate so easily when wet.

150
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,379
I'll bet someone cut the toilet paper really thin

151
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,879
then rolled it to make string

152
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,779
but why would they put it on a key?

153
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,679
Well, he could be rather strange at times.

154
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,879
It was probably just due to curiosity!

155
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,879
At any rate, this place was completely locked...

156
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,379
No, it wasn't.

157
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,579
What?

158
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,979
See, over there.

159
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:25,779
The ventilation ducts open.

160
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:26,979
You dummy,

161
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:29,079
do you think someone can get in and out

162
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,179
through that tiny space?

163
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,279
Take a look. The duct only about 15cm wide.

164
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,779
All the other keys are accounted for,

165
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,379
this was definitely a locked room...

166
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,579
But I still think it's strange to be a suicide.

167
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,779
It was pitch dark,

168
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,279
you couldn't cut the artery with such precision, could you?

169
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,879
Pitch dark?

170
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,379
There the lights off then you came in here?

171
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:59,679
Yes, but the bathroom...

172
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,079
The light in the bathroom was also off.

173
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,379
I turned it on and then went in.

174
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,979
It's still light outside at 5-6pm which is

175
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,579
the estimated time of death

176
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,479
but there're no windows in the bathroom.

177
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,979
Without the light on,

178
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:17,479
you wouldn't be able to see past your hands.

179
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,079
The killer may have inadvertently

180
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,479
turned the lights off when he was done.

181
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,979
If this was murder,

182
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:26,779
could the crayon markings on the wall

183
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,779
be to cover the crime?

184
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,879
The question is this key.

185
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,479
How was the killer able to leave the key here in the water.

186
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,379
There are 2 more mysteries.

187
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,379
Why did the killer mark not only the wall

188
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,879
but also the edge of the pillar

189
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,879
and the lock on the front door with crayon

190
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,979
and that ventilation duct,

191
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,479
it was open from the start,

192
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:58,779
I doubt the killer would have overlooked it.

193
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,279
Wait a minute,

194
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,579
that's not the only place that was open.

195
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,079
I've got it!

196
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,579
I've solved the case!

197
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,879
Forget what I said before, this is a murder!

198
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,879
Just follow me.

199
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,179
The key to solving this case is...

200
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:22,479
that mailbox.

201
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,879
First, the killer

202
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,779
threaded some string under the bridge,

203
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,679
pulls it to the front door,

204
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,279
passes it through the mailbox,

205
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,079
goes outside and locks the door.

206
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,379
And then, puts the key on one end of the string,

207
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,779
when the other thread is pulled,

208
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,279
the key moves toward the model.

209
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,479
And when it passes under the bridge, the paper string breaks

210
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,979
and the key falls into the water.

211
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:53,579
What do you think?

212
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,179
That solves the mystery of the locked room.

213
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:59,679
Yes, I see! Brilliant deduction, Mouri!

214
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,079
That's it! I've got it!

215
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,279
Sir, I don't understand.

216
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
This entrance and the living room

217
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,079
are at a right angle, isn't that right?

218
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,679
Huh? What about it?

219
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,679
If you pulled the thread from outside the door,

220
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,879
the thread would rub against the pillar at the earner

221
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,979
and leave a mark, wouldn't it?

222
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,779
It's not here.

223
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:29,879
I wanted them to see the killer deliberately

224
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,679
colored the edge of the pillar

225
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,279
and that this trick had nothing to do with thread.

226
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,879
Now for this.

227
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,179
That's it! Got it!

228
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:45,179
The killer locked the door through the mailbox rigging it.

229
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,979
The marks are... not here.

230
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,879
That's it! The ventilation duct!

231
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,379
The killer used the trick I explained

232
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,679
but with the ventilation duct...

233
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,279
Theoretically, it is possible.

234
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,779
No, it's impossible.

235
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:11,079
See, there's a dog in the house on the other side.

236
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,179
That is a wonderful watchdog,

237
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:16,679
he won't let anyone except his master get close.

238
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,079
Isn't that right, Kido?

239
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,279
Yes, it always barks at me too.

240
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,179
This place is in plain view of that yard.

241
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,979
If someone was doing something suspicious,

242
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:30,579
that dog would bark like crazy and everybody'd look outside.

243
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,679
I guess I missed on this one too.

244
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,579
It must've been suicide after all, Inspector.

245
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,479
No. It is murder!

246
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,879
And the killer...

247
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,379
The victim's wound shows no hesitation cut,

248
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:52,679
the gash is perfectly straight and deep.

249
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,379
The only ones capable of such precision

250
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:57,579
would be a doctor or a medical student.

251
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,279
But what trick did he use?

252
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:06,679
The buglight?

253
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,079
Wait a minute,

254
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,979
the sweater in the entrance.

255
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,979
The crayon markings all over the apartment.

256
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,379
And...

257
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,579
that's it!

258
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,879
That's why that duct was left open just so much,

259
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,979
making this place an almost sealed room.

260
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,468
Now to prove it...

261
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,868
There has to be something.

262
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:31,268
There has to be...

263
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,168
What's this?

264
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,868
That is this smell...

265
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:41,368
The smell's coming from here.

266
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:43,068
I wonder...

267
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,068
There it is!

268
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,668
Excuse me, Ma'am!

269
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:56,068
Is that the cup you brought the juice in?

270
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,368
Yes, it is.

271
00:15:57,368 --> 00:16:01,068
How unusual, he washed it.

272
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:05,168
I knew it. Now I have the proof!

273
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,668
Thank you for all your co-operation.

274
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,168
That's all for today.

275
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,368
I got it!

276
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:14,668
I figured out the trick the killer used!

277
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:17,168
-What? -Are you sure, Conan?

278
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,568
Yes. I'll demonstrate.

279
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,268
Ma'am, may I borrow your key?

280
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:24,568
You dummy, how would you know?

281
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,968
Here, kid, you need the key, right?

282
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:29,768
-Take it. -Thank you.

283
00:16:29,768 --> 00:16:31,568
Wait here for a while.

284
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,268
What in the world are you doing?

285
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,968
Never mind, just watch.

286
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:50,668
And now Ma'am, when I go out the door,

287
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,568
I want you to turn all the lights off.

288
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:55,268
All right.

289
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:59,668
Okay? I'm going to start, everyone watch quietly.

290
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,268
How cocky.

291
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,168
Something fell.

292
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:22,268
A beetle.

293
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,468
A male beetle.

294
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,868
What?

295
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:36,068
A buglight...

296
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:38,768
How did it go?

297
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,968
Conan.

298
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:44,868
I see, so this is how the killer did it.

299
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,368
But why did the beetle come here?

300
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:49,368
The smell.

301
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:51,768
It was lured here because the top of monument

302
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,468
was coated with the scent of something it liked.

303
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,868
And what about the sweater on the threshold?

304
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:02,768
The killer put it there so the beetle would be able to walk easily.

305
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:07,068
Beetles have a hard time walking on wood flooring and tile.

306
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:10,668
This hallway and the living room are carpeted.

307
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:15,068
The conditions were ideal for the killer.

308
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:17,268
Good work, Conan.

309
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:20,668
But where did you get the beetle you used?

310
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:23,068
Oh, I just took one of the ones

311
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:25,468
Mr. Kido is raising in his room.

312
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,668
I didn't ask permission, sorry, Mr. Kido, I let one get away!

313
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,468
Oh, forget it.

314
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,568
By the way, Mr. Kido,

315
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,768
were you here in this apartment tonight before I went to get you?

316
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,768
No, I didn't come here.

317
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,168
Really?

318
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:41,768
Are you sure?

319
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:45,068
Of course, I'm sure! Why're you asking that?

320
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,568
Then why does your handkerchief

321
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:50,968
smell like the juice Ma'am made?

322
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:59,568
Ma'am brought the juice to him at about 5 this evening.

323
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:03,168
Mr. Kido. After Makoto drank the juice,

324
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,968
you washed the cup, didn't you?

325
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,868
And the juice that dripped to the floor,

326
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:11,068
you wiped it up with your handkerchief, didn't you?

327
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:13,568
Why did he do it...

328
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,468
The reason is...

329
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:18,468
the male beetle might be lured by the juice

330
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,768
being its smell is stronger that the female beetle's scent,

331
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:24,468
so it might climb something other than the monument.

332
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:28,868
You coated the monument

333
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:32,568
with the female's scent, didn't you?

334
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:35,768
Kido, you didn't...

335
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:43,768
Let me see your handkerchief.

336
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,868
Boy, I goofed.

337
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:51,168
I was so relieved I shut him up,

338
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,068
I forgot to get rid of the handkerchief,

339
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:56,868
all because I got drunk celebrating and fell asleep.

340
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,368
Why did you do it?

341
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,968
About a year ago, he came to me with a proposition

342
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,568
and I stole some sleeping pills from the university's hospital.

343
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,468
We sold them.

344
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:12,468
But recently, he told me he wanted to quit.

345
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,768
He told me you were coming here tonight.

346
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:18,668
I was afraid he'd tell you about it and get arrested.

347
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,568
Why you...

348
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:28,568
I'm sure Makoto

349
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:30,968
regretted what he did

350
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:34,368
and was prepared to be punished.

351
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:37,368
This comes late, the crime's been committed

352
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:44,168
but a life is a burden heavier than you could ever imagine.

353
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:48,568
Delve on that burden while you're in prison!

354
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:53,168
You'll have a lot of time to think about it!

355
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,768
"Mouri Detective Agency"

356
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,768
I feel so sorry for Mrs. Mitsue.

357
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,068
Yes.

358
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:32,068
You can't replace her grandson,

359
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:34,868
but why don't the two of you visit her from time to time?

360
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:36,668
Okay.

361
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:39,668
By the way, Conan, you were so sharp tonight.

362
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,568
I was amazed.

363
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:46,468
That's because I always get to see the famous Mr. Mouri in action.

364
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,068
Like they say, learn by watching, without being taught!

365
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:51,668
