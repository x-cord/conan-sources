1
00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:06.924
So, that's the story. It's 4, 5, 6...

2
00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:09.724
It's my 6th this month! 6 cases!

3
00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:12.024
How about you, Shinichi?

4
00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:15.124
Me? I solved 7 cases.

5
00:00:15.124 --> 00:00:17.924
Oh boy, I lost again.

6
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.924
But, Shinichi. Aren't there a bit too many cases around you?

7
00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:23.724
Well, if you want to do something about your successive losses,

8
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:26.124
maybe you should change your name?

9
00:00:26.124 --> 00:00:29.824
After all, my name's Shin-ichi, like in "ichiban"

10
00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:32.524
Idiot. You're number 2.

11
00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:34.824
-Number 2? -Yeah.

12
00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:37.324
There was one guy in the past.

13
00:00:37.324 --> 00:00:40.724
A guy who was really intelligent.

14
00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:42.724
A detective.

15
00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.224
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

16
00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:49.224
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

17
00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:51.224
Intermediate school detectives, Heiji and Shinichi.

18
00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:52.724
A deduction battle is launched at the ski slope.

19
00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:54.224
Solve the mystery that is on the lift!

20
00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:55.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:57.324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.324
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.810
"Deduction Confrontation at the Ski Slope!"

24
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.710
Kazuha, are you okay?

25
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.610
If your sprained ankle is hurting,

26
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.110
maybe you should go back to the hotel?

27
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.810
I'm fine! Just fine!

28
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110
It's no fun staying back at the hotel alone

29
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.410
and besides, it's fun watching all of you ski.

30
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.810
Moreover...

31
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.810
Sorry! Sorry!

32
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.810
I thought that an unattractive statue was sitting in the snow,

33
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.710
but it turns out to be a person.

34
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.710
What's with you? This is the fifth time!

35
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.410
Apologize nicely to Kazuha!

36
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.410
Why should I apologize?

37
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.910
I splattered snow on her to cool her sprained ankle

38
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.010
so that it would heal faster.

39
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.810
Teacher, Heiji is being nasty to girls again!

40
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.310
Just what do you think you're saying?

41
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.110
-Don't pick on us! -Don't pick on us!

42
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.910
The old ladies are angry!

43
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.810
-Old ladies, how dare? -Old ladies, how dare?

44
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.010
Hey.

45
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.910
Kazuha.

46
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.310
Don't push yourself and go back to the hotel.

47
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.410
You'll catch cold.

48
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.810
Yeah.

49
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.510
Why are boys all that way?

50
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.210
I wish the Snow Woman in these mountains eat you up!

51
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.410
Snow Woman?

52
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.610
Teacher said that there's a folk tale in these mountains

53
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.110
called "Legend of Snow Woman's Silver Clothing."

54
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.610
Long ago, in these mountains...

55
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.010
There was a super beautiful woman

56
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.710
wearing silver clothing of dazzling white.

57
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.410
She used to lay her eyes on handsome men that set foot in the mountains

58
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.010
and call out in a blizzardlike voice, and enchant them.

59
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.810
She would say, "Please exchange my clothing

60
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.310
for something that is precious to you."

61
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.110
Foolish men are taken in by her beautiful white skin under her clothes

62
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.510
and listen to her!

63
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.910
And then?

64
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.310
The man wraps the clothes he gets from her in a cloth wrapper and asks...

65
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.610
"The only thing precious that I have on me is this rifle."

66
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.410
"But is this what you want?"

67
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.310
The woman answers from behind the man, "No."

68
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.710
"Then, is it money?"

69
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.210
"No."

70
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.510
"Is it this hat?"

71
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.110
"No."

72
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.210
The man's asks the woman, "Then what is it?"

73
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.310
She then, stark naked clings on to the man from behind.

74
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.310
"It's not something cold that I want."

75
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.310
"What I want really badly is...

76
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.410
your warm, very warm...

77
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.610
blood dripping...

78
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.710
heart!"

79
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.210
See.

80
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.510
After that, the man is found dead.

81
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.510
And inside the cloth wrapper, there is no silver clothing,

82
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.310
but rather... a lot of snow. That's the story.

83
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.910
They say that when a blizzard hits these mountains,

84
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.410
many fall victim.

85
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.510
And even 4 years ago,

86
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.910
there seemed to have been a case very similar to this one.

87
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.010
Hey, students of Kaiho Academy intermediate class!

88
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.310
It's lunchtime!

89
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.910
It's already past two o'clock!

90
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.410
Huh? Really?

91
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.510
No wonder I'm hungry.

92
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.110
It seems that there are students from other schools staying here too.

93
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.410
That's why they seem to have shifted lunchtime

94
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.310
to prevent the dining room from becoming crowded.

95
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.710
Isn't that the actor...

96
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.510
"Shohei Minowa (32), actor" -called Shohei Minowa?

97
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.110
What's he doing?

98
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.010
That's right! I saw on TV that they're shooting a movie

99
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.810
after a real case that happened in a snowy mountain.

100
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.010
Huh? I heard that it was a thriller having to do with Snow Woman.

101
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.010
Nonsense.

102
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.810
Well, at any rate, Shohei Minowa's the star of the show

103
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.510
and the fact that he's a detective pursuing some mysterious case

104
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.110
is no mistake.

105
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.110
A detective.

106
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.310
Is it true that this series will be a three-part completed series?

107
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.310
Yeah.

108
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.010
Is it also true that this movie is made

109
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.910
after a case that really happened?

110
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.110
That's true, too.

111
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.210
The guy who died was a friend stuntman of mine.

112
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.710
I was at the scene of the crime, too.

113
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.410
Hey, Mr. Minowa.

114
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.610
I don't want you saying too much about the late Mr. Jiro.

115
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.810
Just what're you talking about?

116
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.110
You're the one who's shooting a movie

117
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.910
using your dead friend as bait.

118
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.310
"Morizo Oyama (56), movie director" -Hey, hey.

119
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.110
This is a movie that was made as a tribute to him.

120
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.410
Well, all is well.

121
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.910
Nothing will bring a dead person back to life.

122
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.910
We can insert something like "A Tribute to Jiro Mikami"

123
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.310
at the end of the movie or something,

124
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.010
"Kosuke Mimata (27), stuntman" -to bring tears to the eyes of the viewers.

125
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.610
And if the movie is a hit, nothing could be better!

126
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.510
Let's be thankful for Mr. Mikami's death

127
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.310
and make a good movie.

128
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.110
Thanks to his death,

129
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.010
you too got to succeed the position you have now.

130
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.810
Well, I warn you, be careful.

131
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.410
You're going to have to do the stunt

132
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.210
"Shizuku Tateishi (31)" -that the late Mikami was supposed to do.

133
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.810
"Special make-up artist" -Let's hope that Snow Woman doesn't seduce you.

134
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.010
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.410
But I still don't understand

136
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.010
why Mizukami would leave a fiance like you behind

137
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.310
and take his own life.

138
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.110
Who knows?

139
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.410
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

140
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.810
I'm sure one of you killed him.

141
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.910
What?

142
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.310
You again, Officer.

143
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.510
No. I heard that you already quit your job as an officer.

144
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.010
Yeah. I was fired working on this case

145
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.810
that was under the jurisdiction of another prefecture.

146
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.710
"Rikuto Katashima (35), detective" -I work as a measly detective now.

147
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.910
I mean, no matter how you look at it, he committed suicide.

148
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.510
True.

149
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.210
4 years ago, a man who rides the lift of this skiing ground alone

150
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.210
had a bullet shot through his head

151
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.110
and was dead when he came down.

152
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.510
He was holding a gun in his right hand,

153
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.210
and on his sleeve there were traces of gunpowder.

154
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.210
Normally, it would look like nothing

155
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.910
more than suicide by shooting oneself,

156
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.410
but something bothers me.

157
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.110
Why was there a load of snow packed

158
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.810
inside the bag that was beside him?

159
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.010
That's because he killed himself

160
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.310
according to the legend of the Snow Woman.

161
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.110
Absurd. I know that guy since childhood,

162
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.310
but he had no interest whatsoever in spook stories.

163
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.410
Besides, even if it were to be so,

164
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.510
I don't understand why he would do something like that.

165
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.210
Who knows?

166
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.410
We'll never know unless we ask the dead man himself.

167
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.610
But this, we know for sure...

168
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.710
if it were a murder case,

169
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.110
it is a case that was impossible for any human to carry out.

170
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.210
Yes, if anyone were to be able to do it,

171
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.610
only the beautiful evil spirit of the mountains,

172
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.610
Snow Woman could've done it.

173
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.610
Idiot.

174
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.910
It's called homicide because some human did it.

175
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.110
Besides, nothing is impossible!

176
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.810
You idiot!

177
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.010
We met a young man like you just a while ago too.

178
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.910
Who said what you just said about this story.

179
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.410
He looked to be your age, an intermediate school student like you.

180
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.610
An intermediate school student?

181
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.310
Heiji!

182
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.510
Maybe somebody's talking about me.

183
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.010
Right.

184
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.510
I mean, you really put on a grand front in the dining room,

185
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.910
so I'm sure somebody's making fun of you now.

186
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.310
Idiot!

187
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.210
I was just trying to wake you up

188
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.710
from that Snow Woman story you were so panicked out about.

189
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.210
I... I wasn't panicked out or anything.

190
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.210
I just thought that maybe it could be true!

191
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.210
That Snow Woman story...

192
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.910
It's sad and there are many similar stories like it.

193
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.610
Yeah. It's true that it's mysterious.

194
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.510
In Japan, they call the monster

195
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.310
that appears in the most famous Snow Woman story is called...

196
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.810
"Woman of the Snow".

197
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.510
English? I thought that Snow Woman was a Japanese story.

198
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.110
Yeah, it's a Japanese folk tale.

199
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.510
But a man called Lafacadio Hern

200
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.410
who was working as an English teacher in Japan heard about it,

201
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.210
and published it in English.

202
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.610
You know him, don't you, Yagumo Koizumi?

203
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.010
That's his pen name!

204
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.710
Yes, yes. You are so knowledgeable, Shinichi.

205
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.310
But thank you anyway.

206
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.310
You said what you did to put me at ease, right?

207
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.910
That's not all I did it for.

208
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.010
I thought I had to say so, to keep out of hot water.

209
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.510
I didn't want a storm to start.

210
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.510
I have this ominous premonition.

211
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.272
What're you going to do if Snow Woman really appears?

212
00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:13.572
Idiot! If such a woman exists,

213
00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.172
I sure would like to meet her.

214
00:11:15.172 --> 00:11:16.872
Heiji.

215
00:11:16.872 --> 00:11:18.572
In order to solve the case of 4 years ago,

216
00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:21.572
first I've to check the lift in question!

217
00:11:21.572 --> 00:11:22.672
And I've got to do it,

218
00:11:22.672 --> 00:11:24.672
before some intermediate school brat beats me to it!

219
00:11:24.672 --> 00:11:26.972
What's the big deal?

220
00:11:26.972 --> 00:11:30.272
It's just that somebody else thinks like you.

221
00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:32.172
That's why I don't want to lose!

222
00:11:32.172 --> 00:11:33.572
I've got to win,

223
00:11:33.572 --> 00:11:36.172
or people will think that I'm only intermediate level too.

224
00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:37.872
I mean, you're only in intermediate school too, after all.

225
00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:40.972
Ugh, really! Always so lovey-dovey.

226
00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:43.372
You idiot! Don't get us wrong.

227
00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:47.772
The snow's going to melt with the spur that you guys make!

228
00:11:47.772 --> 00:11:50.172
She's talking about somebody else.

229
00:11:50.172 --> 00:11:51.872
Well, you still have time

230
00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:54.772
to check the lift after this blizzard subsides.

231
00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:57.772
Well, I guess so. But before that...

232
00:12:00.472 --> 00:12:01.572
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:01.572 --> 00:12:03.472
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

234
00:12:05.772 --> 00:12:07.472
Heiji?

235
00:12:07.472 --> 00:12:10.072
Hey! Will you cut it out?

236
00:12:10.072 --> 00:12:12.072
Taking pictures left and right from some time ago.

237
00:12:12.072 --> 00:12:13.872
Heiji! What's the problem?

238
00:12:13.872 --> 00:12:17.072
She could just be taking pictures of this snowy scenery.

239
00:12:17.072 --> 00:12:21.372
No! No! This lady is taking pictures of me!

240
00:12:21.372 --> 00:12:23.272
She's my mom!

241
00:12:23.272 --> 00:12:24.972
What?

242
00:12:26.972 --> 00:12:28.972
Just as would be expected of you, Heiji!

243
00:12:28.972 --> 00:12:32.072
You've got keen senses just like your dad, Heizo!

244
00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:34.672
What brings you here?

245
00:12:34.672 --> 00:12:37.472
I was worried sick over Heiji

246
00:12:37.472 --> 00:12:39.272
because he's rarely come to the Tohoku district.

247
00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:40.672
Oh, give me a break!

248
00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:42.472
All you want to do is make additions to the growth video

249
00:12:42.472 --> 00:12:46.372
that you've been taking of me since I was born!

250
00:12:46.372 --> 00:12:48.172
I'd like to see it.

251
00:12:48.172 --> 00:12:51.572
It was a bad blizzard back then, too.

252
00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:55.472
4 years ago, the day Mizukami died.

253
00:12:55.472 --> 00:12:56.772
On that day, just like now,

254
00:12:56.772 --> 00:12:59.172
while we were waiting to shoot the film,

255
00:12:59.172 --> 00:13:01.772
Minowa was surrounded by his fans.

256
00:13:03.572 --> 00:13:06.172
It seems the blizzard is subsiding!

257
00:13:06.172 --> 00:13:07.472
Is that right?

258
00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:10.572
Please show us your skiing then!

259
00:13:10.572 --> 00:13:12.372
The awesome ski techniques that you used in

260
00:13:12.372 --> 00:13:14.172
"Love of Snow Woman" and "Mystery!"

261
00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:15.472
Please!

262
00:13:15.472 --> 00:13:19.272
Oh boy. I've got to shoot a film from now, you see.

263
00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:20.772
No! No!

264
00:13:20.772 --> 00:13:21.972
Ever since we've got here,

265
00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:23.872
fans like you have asked him to ski

266
00:13:23.872 --> 00:13:26.172
and he's already skied three times!

267
00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:30.272
If you want to see him ski, please watch his movie!

268
00:13:30.272 --> 00:13:31.872
What shall I do?

269
00:13:31.872 --> 00:13:33.372
Well, we do have a tight schedule,

270
00:13:33.372 --> 00:13:36.172
but we've got to treat the fans nicely, too.

271
00:13:36.172 --> 00:13:38.772
I think this is what Mizukami would've said.

272
00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:41.372
"It'll work out somehow!"

273
00:13:41.372 --> 00:13:44.072
Oh goodness, he's not here anymore!

274
00:13:44.072 --> 00:13:45.572
Will you please cut it out already?

275
00:13:45.572 --> 00:13:46.972
I'm sorry

276
00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:51.072
that I got you involved in making a movie based on the late Mr. Mizukami

277
00:13:51.072 --> 00:13:53.372
who was supposed to have become your husband.

278
00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:55.572
Don't be. After all,

279
00:13:55.572 --> 00:13:57.272
I'm the one who asked you to let me participate.

280
00:13:57.272 --> 00:14:01.872
I sort of felt that if this movie is completed,

281
00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:03.772
the truth of his death would be revealed.

282
00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:11.772
Two places...

283
00:14:11.772 --> 00:14:13.872
I looked from below

284
00:14:13.872 --> 00:14:17.472
there are two places where this lift and ski slope come close together.

285
00:14:17.472 --> 00:14:20.072
You mean you can jump onto the lift from below?

286
00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:21.872
No. They come close,

287
00:14:21.872 --> 00:14:23.672
but there's a space of more than 3 meters.

288
00:14:23.672 --> 00:14:24.872
It'd would be impossible to jump on

289
00:14:24.872 --> 00:14:26.172
unless you use a trampoline or something.

290
00:14:30.972 --> 00:14:33.672
Isn't that Shoehei Minowa that was at the hotel?

291
00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.572
He's good!

292
00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:49.172
Encore...

293
00:14:49.172 --> 00:14:52.372
No, no! Just this once for today!

294
00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:55.572
Watch the movie if you want to see more skiing!

295
00:14:55.572 --> 00:14:57.372
It's already 4:00!

296
00:14:57.372 --> 00:15:00.072
We've got to shoot the ski slope above quickly.

297
00:15:00.072 --> 00:15:03.272
Okay, I'll get myself on the lift first!

298
00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:05.272
Because it'll get pitch dark after 5:00.

299
00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.172
Hey, Director.

300
00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.972
The special make-up artist woman

301
00:15:08.972 --> 00:15:12.672
and the stuntman is nowhere in sight.

302
00:15:12.672 --> 00:15:15.472
They both said that they'd go up before everyone.

303
00:15:17.872 --> 00:15:19.772
Something's fishy.

304
00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:22.472
There sure is something fishy about this lift.

305
00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:25.472
Heiji, this lift is scary.

306
00:15:25.472 --> 00:15:27.372
Kazuha.

307
00:15:27.372 --> 00:15:28.872
You belong to the advance group,

308
00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:31.172
and yet you've never rode a lift?

309
00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:34.372
I have. But it was a different kind.

310
00:15:37.072 --> 00:15:39.672
Gosh. It starting to get windy again.

311
00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.772
I can't see the figure of the detective's

312
00:15:41.772 --> 00:15:43.272
who's riding the lift up ahead too clearly.

313
00:15:43.272 --> 00:15:45.272
Hey, Ms. Tateishi!

314
00:15:45.272 --> 00:15:47.072
Oh, Mr. Mimata.

315
00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:50.172
What're you doing? That lift's going down.

316
00:15:50.172 --> 00:15:52.472
I missed the lift.

317
00:15:52.472 --> 00:15:54.672
I'm not good at things like this.

318
00:16:03.372 --> 00:16:05.072
Shinichi!

319
00:16:05.072 --> 00:16:06.872
What was that sound just now?

320
00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:08.372
The sound of a gunshot.

321
00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:10.172
The ones on the lift were...

322
00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:11.872
Director Oyama,

323
00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:13.872
the actor, Minowa,

324
00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:16.472
the detective, in that order if I remember correctly.

325
00:16:17.872 --> 00:16:20.272
Did something happen?

326
00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:21.672
It's you.

327
00:16:21.672 --> 00:16:25.672
Beats me. I just got off now.

328
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:47.126
The lift stopped.

329
00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:48.226
What's going on?

330
00:16:48.226 --> 00:16:49.726
The thing that sounded like gunfire just a while ago,

331
00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:51.526
and now that scream.

332
00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:54.026
The lift, gun fire...

333
00:16:54.026 --> 00:16:55.026
Don't tell me that

334
00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:58.626
the same thing as the case 4 years ago has happened again.

335
00:16:58.626 --> 00:17:01.426
We are sorry for the inconvenience!

336
00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:04.326
Please allow a little more time for the lift to resume operation!

337
00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:06.526
What is the meaning of this?

338
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.626
It's almost like what happened back then.

339
00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.326
You can say that again.

340
00:17:09.326 --> 00:17:13.626
Just like the time when Mr. Mizukami shot himself to death.

341
00:17:13.626 --> 00:17:15.826
Mizukami.

342
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:18.926
The gun right as his temple and bang!

343
00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:19.926
This is suicide.

344
00:17:19.926 --> 00:17:23.026
Yes. He is after all holding the gun in his right hand.

345
00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:27.026
The problem is this bag that's beside the victim.

346
00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:28.526
If it's just as my ominous premonition tells me,

347
00:17:28.526 --> 00:17:30.726
I'm sure that the contents of the bag is...

348
00:17:30.726 --> 00:17:32.826
Snow, just as I thought.

349
00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:35.926
God. It's the same as 4 years ago.

350
00:17:37.926 --> 00:17:41.426
I think I heard that they were shooting a such a movie here.

351
00:17:41.426 --> 00:17:42.426
Yes.

352
00:17:42.426 --> 00:17:44.026
We were shooting a movie having to do with that legend

353
00:17:44.026 --> 00:17:46.226
and what happened here 4 years ago,

354
00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:49.326
but now after what happened to Mr. Minowa, the star of the show...

355
00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:51.326
Huh? Is Minowa an actor?

356
00:17:51.326 --> 00:17:53.026
If I remember correctly, you were here

357
00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:54.626
when that incident happened 4 years ago too, weren't you?

358
00:17:54.626 --> 00:17:57.026
I am the director of the movie, Oyama.

359
00:17:57.026 --> 00:17:59.426
I was on the left one ahead of him.

360
00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:01.526
Then, I heard a gunshot.

361
00:18:01.526 --> 00:18:03.726
That young man who came along when I got off the lift,

362
00:18:03.726 --> 00:18:06.526
noticed that something was wrong with Mr. Minowa.

363
00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:10.026
Hey, kid! Just what do you think you're doing?

364
00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:12.726
We're going to have to get the lift moving soon

365
00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:14.126
-or the skiers will... -Okay.

366
00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:15.926
After the corpse and his belongings are carried off the lift,

367
00:18:15.926 --> 00:18:18.326
you may move it!

368
00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:21.626
-Do you need help? -No, it's pretty light.

369
00:18:21.626 --> 00:18:23.826
He was slimmer than he looked.

370
00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:25.726
He didn't even weigh 60 kilograms.

371
00:18:25.726 --> 00:18:28.926
That's why he used to only appear in winter dramas and movies.

372
00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:31.826
He didn't want anybody to see how thin he was.

373
00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:37.126
I wonder why he out his skis in the back

374
00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.026
instead of wearing them?

375
00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:40.626
Why not?

376
00:18:40.626 --> 00:18:43.626
He was holding a bag filled with snow, you know.

377
00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:45.526
It may have been packed with snow,

378
00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:48.826
but it's just big enough to fit a child inside.

379
00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:51.626
Okay! You can go ahead and move the lift!

380
00:18:51.626 --> 00:18:53.726
Oh, officer.

381
00:18:53.726 --> 00:18:56.026
There are three things that are bothering me.

382
00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:02.526
It finally moved.

383
00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:05.026
Look at the crowd.

384
00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:06.426
It's frightening.

385
00:19:06.426 --> 00:19:09.326
Idiot! My blood's starting to boil!

386
00:19:09.326 --> 00:19:12.226
Unauthorized personnel stand back! Stand back!

387
00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:14.926
What is it? What on earth happened?

388
00:19:14.926 --> 00:19:16.226
It's you.

389
00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:18.126
It's something just I heard briefly,

390
00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:19.826
but it seems to be exactly the same

391
00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.526
as the incident that happened 4 years ago.

392
00:19:21.526 --> 00:19:23.626
It seems that a man who was riding the lift alone

393
00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:25.926
had a bag filled with snow beside him

394
00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:28.726
and killed himself with a gun.

395
00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:31.726
It's as if he were possessed by the Snow Woman!

396
00:19:31.726 --> 00:19:33.626
Hey, not you again.

397
00:19:33.626 --> 00:19:35.826
This isn't your jurisdiction, is it?

398
00:19:35.826 --> 00:19:39.826
No. I'm not an officer anymore, but a detective.

399
00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:44.126
Besides, I was riding the lift right behind this victim, you know.

400
00:19:44.126 --> 00:19:47.426
Don't you want to ask me questions, officer?

401
00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:49.826
Victim? He committed suicide!

402
00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:52.226
No. I think it's too soon to conclude so yet.

403
00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:55.126
Hey, Heiji! Help!

404
00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:57.426
Just what're you doing? Hurry and get off!

405
00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.526
Yeah, but I don't know how to get off.

406
00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:01.326
Okay then, when you reach the bottom,

407
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:04.026
I'll have them stop the lift, so make sure you get off!

408
00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:05.426
Okay.

409
00:20:05.426 --> 00:20:06.726
That idiot.

410
00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:08.826
That's why I told her not to come along.

411
00:20:08.826 --> 00:20:09.826
Come to think of it,

412
00:20:09.826 --> 00:20:12.326
there was another person who couldn't get off a while ago.

413
00:20:12.326 --> 00:20:14.526
-Really? -Yes.

414
00:20:14.526 --> 00:20:17.826
She was a pretty lady who had her hair all tied in the back.

415
00:20:19.026 --> 00:20:22.126
No. Mr. Minowa committed suicide?

416
00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:23.326
Why?

417
00:20:23.326 --> 00:20:26.826
Before asking why, will you answer my question?

418
00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:30.026
Why did you want to get off the lift here a while ago?

419
00:20:30.026 --> 00:20:31.726
I couldn't get off!

420
00:20:31.726 --> 00:20:33.326
I'm not at home with these things.

421
00:20:33.326 --> 00:20:35.326
That's strange.

422
00:20:35.326 --> 00:20:39.026
You came here 4 years ago too, to shoot a movie, right?

423
00:20:39.026 --> 00:20:41.426
Back then, I had Mr. Mizukami ride with me.

424
00:20:41.426 --> 00:20:43.826
This time I had Mr. Mimata ride with me.

425
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.526
She's not very physically inclined, you see.

426
00:20:45.526 --> 00:20:50.626
Huh? The director told me that you would be going up ahead.

427
00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:53.226
Why are you riding the lift with her?

428
00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:55.926
Standby for the shooting is was all set,

429
00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:58.926
but the director and main star didn't come up the slope

430
00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:01.326
so I skied down here to come get them!

431
00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:05.326
Then, I saw her coming down on the lift,

432
00:21:05.326 --> 00:21:07.726
so I called out to her, and that's when I heard the gun shot.

433
00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.826
I had this bad feeling

434
00:21:09.826 --> 00:21:14.426
so had him ride the lift with me and went back up again!

435
00:21:14.426 --> 00:21:16.926
I mean, the thing about 4 years ago was bothering me, too.

436
00:21:16.926 --> 00:21:18.526
Then, the lift stopped

437
00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:20.626
and I finally got to come down a while ago!

438
00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:22.726
I see. In other words...

439
00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:26.626
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa,

440
00:21:26.626 --> 00:21:29.926
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was behind,

441
00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:33.226
Ms. Tateishi, who passed him on the lift going down

442
00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:36.126
and Mr. Mimata who was on the ski slope...

443
00:21:36.126 --> 00:21:40.026
All could've shot at Mr. Minowa.

444
00:21:40.026 --> 00:21:41.826
-Hey. -Hey, now.

445
00:21:41.826 --> 00:21:43.826
Weren't you listening to what we were just saying?

446
00:21:43.826 --> 00:21:46.926
I was with Mr. Mimata when the gunshot was heard.

447
00:21:46.926 --> 00:21:48.926
If that gunshot was fake,

448
00:21:48.926 --> 00:21:50.626
the murder would've been possible.

449
00:21:50.626 --> 00:21:52.926
Is this what you want to say, sonny?

450
00:21:52.926 --> 00:21:54.926
Yeah, right!

451
00:21:54.926 --> 00:21:58.426
But Mr. Minowa was holding the gun in his hand, you know.

452
00:21:58.426 --> 00:21:59.726
It would be impossible to make him to that

453
00:21:59.726 --> 00:22:01.026
if you're some distance away, right?

454
00:22:01.026 --> 00:22:03.226
You can't tell him to hold the gun

455
00:22:03.226 --> 00:22:06.026
because you're going to be shooting him, can you?

456
00:22:06.026 --> 00:22:09.126
Besides, the blizzard was pretty bad back then.

457
00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:10.426
You'd have to be a darn good shooter

458
00:22:10.426 --> 00:22:12.626
to shoot down the target at that time.

459
00:22:12.626 --> 00:22:14.426
Well, I'm not too sure of this yet,

460
00:22:14.426 --> 00:22:16.926
but there's something I realized.

461
00:22:16.926 --> 00:22:19.426
First, the ski poles that Mr. Minowa

462
00:22:19.426 --> 00:22:20.726
is said to have put on the lift!

463
00:22:20.726 --> 00:22:25.026
The loops on both tips of the poles are both upside down.

464
00:22:25.626 --> 00:22:28.826
It's proof that the poles were used for something!

465
00:22:28.826 --> 00:22:32.126
Next is the lift that Mr. Minowa was on.

466
00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:37.026
There is what looks to be a crack on the left edge of the plastic seat.

467
00:22:37.026 --> 00:22:39.826
I'm sure that this is the result of some trick that was used, too.

468
00:22:39.826 --> 00:22:41.326
And last,

469
00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.126
is this cloth bag filled with snow

470
00:22:43.126 --> 00:22:46.526
that Mr. Minowa had placed beside himself.

471
00:22:46.526 --> 00:22:49.626
I don't know why but it's frozen stiff.

472
00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:52.026
No, no, don't touch his belongings.

473
00:22:52.026 --> 00:22:57.526
But you intermediate school kids nowadays sure are full of curiosity.

474
00:22:57.526 --> 00:23:00.526
There was another one just like you, an intermediate school student,

475
00:23:00.526 --> 00:23:02.426
who boastfully told we the police

476
00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:04.426
the three points you just mentioned, too.

477
00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:06.026
What?

478
00:23:06.026 --> 00:23:08.126
He was here until just before you got here.

479
00:23:09.026 --> 00:23:11.226
I've finally made it down.

480
00:23:11.226 --> 00:23:14.026
I'll never ride a lift ever again.

481
00:23:14.026 --> 00:23:15.826
-Kazuha. -Kazuha.

482
00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:19.126
You're not supposed to be in advance ski class, are you?

483
00:23:19.126 --> 00:23:21.126
You don't even know how to get off a lift!

484
00:23:21.126 --> 00:23:22.726
Be honest!

485
00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:24.226
You just wanted to be in the advance class

486
00:23:24.226 --> 00:23:26.026
because Heiji was there, right?

487
00:23:26.026 --> 00:23:28.926
I'll bet your sprained leg is fake, too.

488
00:23:28.926 --> 00:23:30.326
Oh, no.

489
00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:31.726
Don't worry.

490
00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:33.526
-We won't tell Heiji about it. -Excuse me!

491
00:23:33.526 --> 00:23:35.726
-I'm really sorry. -Is there anyone here

492
00:23:35.726 --> 00:23:38.026
who took a video Mr. Minowa riding the lift a while ago?

493
00:23:38.026 --> 00:23:40.626
If you don't mind, I've taken him with mine.

494
00:23:41.926 --> 00:23:44.226
Thank you so much!

495
00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:46.526
You sure took nice pictures.

496
00:23:46.526 --> 00:23:47.626
If you're Mr. Minowa's fan,

497
00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:49.326
you could've just kept to shooting videos of him only and yet.

498
00:23:49.326 --> 00:23:51.626
Well, my son asked me to.

499
00:23:51.626 --> 00:23:53.826
He told me to take pictures of the boarding gate of the lift

500
00:23:53.826 --> 00:23:54.826
because he wanted to use it as reference

501
00:23:54.826 --> 00:23:56.326
for the incident that happened 4 years ago.

502
00:23:56.326 --> 00:23:58.326
Is your son a police officer or something?

503
00:23:58.326 --> 00:24:00.626
He's a mere intermediate school student.

504
00:24:00.626 --> 00:24:03.926
Although he thinks he's a detective.

505
00:24:03.926 --> 00:24:06.626
A detective? Just like me.

506
00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:10.326
My, Shinichi is chatting with a beautiful madam.

507
00:24:10.326 --> 00:24:12.626
Really, I wonder who he took after.

508
00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:15.926
No, he's wearing the facial expression of a detective.

509
00:24:15.926 --> 00:24:17.726
He's still green.

510
00:24:17.726 --> 00:24:21.426
And? Has the self-proclaimed world renown mystery novel writer

511
00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.626
solved this case?

512
00:24:23.626 --> 00:24:26.126
Yukiko. What a silly question.

513
00:24:26.126 --> 00:24:28.726
What? Have you figured it out, Yusaku?

514
00:24:28.726 --> 00:24:32.126
I came all the way here because I wanted to write a novel

515
00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:33.926
based on what happened 4 years ago,

516
00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:36.426
but to think that a movie based on it was already being made,

517
00:24:36.426 --> 00:24:39.626
and that a similar incident is happening right now...

518
00:24:39.626 --> 00:24:41.526
If you've figured out who the culprit is,

519
00:24:41.526 --> 00:24:42.726
why don't you contact the police right away?

520
00:24:42.726 --> 00:24:45.226
No. Let's leave things to the young ones for a while

521
00:24:45.226 --> 00:24:46.826
and watch how things turn out.

522
00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:49.926
Well, at least give me a hint then.

523
00:24:49.926 --> 00:24:51.426
Do you know?

524
00:24:51.426 --> 00:24:53.226
That there is another Snow Woman silver clothing legend

525
00:24:53.226 --> 00:24:56.526
that exists in these mountains.

526
00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:59.926
It is a heartbreaking and sad story.
