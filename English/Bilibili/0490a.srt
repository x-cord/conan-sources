1
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,995
So, that's the story. It's 4, 5, 6...

2
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:14,798
It's my 6th this month! 6 cases!

3
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,100
How about you, Shinichi?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,204
Me? I solved 7 cases.

5
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:23,006
Oh boy, I lost again.

6
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:27,010
But, Shinichi. Aren't there a bit too many cases around you?

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,812
Well, if you want to do something about your successive losses,

8
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:31,215
maybe you should change your name?

9
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,918
After all, my name's Shin-ichi, like in "ichiban"

10
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:37,621
Idiot. You're number 2.

11
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,923
-Number 2? -Yeah.

12
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,426
There was one guy in the past.

13
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:45,796
A guy who was really intelligent.

14
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,798
A detective.

15
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,302
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,304
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
Intermediate school detectives, Heiji and Shinichi.

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,808
A deduction battle is launched at the ski slope.

19
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,309
Solve the mystery that is on the lift!

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,711
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:02,412
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:04,414
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,705
"Heiji Hattori vs. Shinichi Kudo!"

24
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,107
"Deduction Confrontation at the Ski Slope!"

25
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,982
Kazuha, are you okay?

26
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,884
If your sprained ankle is hurting,

27
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,387
maybe you should go back to the hotel?

28
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,090
I'm fine! Just fine!

29
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,392
It's no fun staying back at the hotel alone

30
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,695
and besides, it's fun watching all of you ski.

31
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,097
Moreover...

32
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,101
Sorry! Sorry!

33
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,104
I thought that an unattractive statue was sitting in the snow,

34
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,005
but it turns out to be a person.

35
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,008
What's with you? This is the fifth time!

36
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,710
Apologize nicely to Kazuha!

37
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
Why should I apologize?

38
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
I splattered snow on her to cool her sprained ankle

39
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,283
so that it would heal faster.

40
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:43,089
Teacher, Heiji is being nasty to girls again!

41
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,591
Just what do you think you're saying?

42
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,392
-Don't pick on us! -Don't pick on us!

43
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,194
The old ladies are angry!

44
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,096
-Old ladies, how dare? -Old ladies, how dare?

45
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,297
Hey.

46
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,199
Kazuha.

47
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,602
Don't push yourself and go back to the hotel.

48
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,704
You'll catch cold.

49
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,105
Yeah.

50
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,808
Why are boys all that way?

51
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:05,512
I wish the Snow Woman in these mountains eat you up!

52
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,713
Snow Woman?

53
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,883
Teacher said that there's a folk tale in these mountains

54
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,384
called "Legend of Snow Woman's Silver Clothing."

55
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,886
Long ago, in these mountains...

56
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,287
There was a super beautiful woman

57
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,991
wearing silver clothing of dazzling white.

58
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,693
She used to lay her eyes on handsome men that set foot in the mountains

59
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,297
and call out in a blizzardlike voice, and enchant them.

60
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,100
She would say, "Please exchange my clothing

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,602
for something that is precious to you."

62
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,406
Foolish men are taken in by her beautiful white skin under her clothes

63
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,809
and listen to her!

64
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,210
And then?

65
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,614
The man wraps the clothes he gets from her in a cloth wrapper and asks...

66
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,884
"The only thing precious that I have on me is this rifle."

67
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,686
"But is this what you want?"

68
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,590
The woman answers from behind the man, "No."

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,991
"Then, is it money?"

70
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,493
"No."

71
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,794
"Is it this hat?"

72
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,396
"No."

73
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,500
The man's asks the woman, "Then what is it?"

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,603
She then, stark naked clings on to the man from behind.

75
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,606
"It's not something cold that I want."

76
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,609
"What I want really badly is...

77
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,711
your warm, very warm...

78
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,913
blood dripping...

79
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,983
heart!"

80
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,485
See.

81
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,788
After that, the man is found dead.

82
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,791
And inside the cloth wrapper, there is no silver clothing,

83
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,595
but rather... a lot of snow. That's the story.

84
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,196
They say that when a blizzard hits these mountains,

85
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,698
many fall victim.

86
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,799
And even 4 years ago,

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,202
there seemed to have been a case very similar to this one.

88
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,305
Hey, students of Kaiho Academy intermediate class!

89
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,607
It's lunchtime!

90
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,210
It's already past two o'clock!

91
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,712
Huh? Really?

92
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,814
No wonder I'm hungry.

93
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,384
It seems that there are students from other schools staying here too.

94
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,686
That's why they seem to have shifted lunchtime

95
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,588
to prevent the dining room from becoming crowded.

96
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,994
Isn't that the actor...

97
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,795
"Shohei Minowa (32), actor" -called Shohei Minowa?

98
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,397
What's he doing?

99
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:09,302
That's right! I saw on TV that they're shooting a movie

100
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,104
after a real case that happened in a snowy mountain.

101
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,308
Huh? I heard that it was a thriller having to do with Snow Woman.

102
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,310
Nonsense.

103
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,114
Well, at any rate, Shohei Minowa's the star of the show

104
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,784
and the fact that he's a detective pursuing some mysterious case

105
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,387
is no mistake.

106
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
A detective.

107
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,594
Is it true that this series will be a three-part completed series?

108
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,595
Yeah.

109
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,297
Is it also true that this movie is made

110
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,198
after a case that really happened?

111
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,401
That's true, too.

112
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,504
The guy who died was a friend stuntman of mine.

113
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,006
I was at the scene of the crime, too.

114
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,708
Hey, Mr. Minowa.

115
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,912
I don't want you saying too much about the late Mr. Jiro.

116
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,114
Just what're you talking about?

117
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,382
You're the one who's shooting a movie

118
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,184
using your dead friend as bait.

119
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,586
"Morizo Oyama (56), movie director" -Hey, hey.

120
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,388
This is a movie that was made as a tribute to him.

121
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,691
Well, all is well.

122
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,194
Nothing will bring a dead person back to life.

123
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,196
We can insert something like "A Tribute to Jiro Mikami"

124
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,597
at the end of the movie or something,

125
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,300
"Kosuke Mimata (27), stuntman" -to bring tears to the eyes of the viewers.

126
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,903
And if the movie is a hit, nothing could be better!

127
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,805
Let's be thankful for Mr. Mikami's death

128
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,606
and make a good movie.

129
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,409
Thanks to his death,

130
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,312
you too got to succeed the position you have now.

131
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,082
Well, I warn you, be careful.

132
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,683
You're going to have to do the stunt

133
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,486
"Shizuku Tateishi (31)" -that the late Mikami was supposed to do.

134
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,089
"Special make-up artist" -Let's hope that Snow Woman doesn't seduce you.

135
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,290
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,692
But I still don't understand

137
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,296
why Mizukami would leave a fiance like you behind

138
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,598
and take his own life.

139
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,400
Who knows?

140
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,703
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

141
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,107
I'm sure one of you killed him.

142
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,208
What?

143
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,610
You again, Officer.

144
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,813
No. I heard that you already quit your job as an officer.

145
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,283
Yeah. I was fired working on this case

146
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,085
that was under the jurisdiction of another prefecture.

147
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,988
"Rikuto Katashima (35), detective" -I work as a measly detective now.

148
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,191
I mean, no matter how you look at it, he committed suicide.

149
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,793
True.

150
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,497
4 years ago, a man who rides the lift of this skiing ground alone

151
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,500
had a bullet shot through his head

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,402
and was dead when he came down.

153
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,803
He was holding a gun in his right hand,

154
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,506
and on his sleeve there were traces of gunpowder.

155
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,507
Normally, it would look like nothing

156
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,209
more than suicide by shooting oneself,

157
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,711
but something bothers me.

158
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,414
Why was there a load of snow packed

159
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:38,084
inside the bag that was beside him?

160
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,287
That's because he killed himself

161
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,589
according to the legend of the Snow Woman.

162
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,393
Absurd. I know that guy since childhood,

163
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,596
but he had no interest whatsoever in spook stories.

164
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,698
Besides, even if it were to be so,

165
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,801
I don't understand why he would do something like that.

166
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,502
Who knows?

167
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,706
We'll never know unless we ask the dead man himself.

168
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,908
But this, we know for sure...

169
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,010
if it were a murder case,

170
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,413
it is a case that was impossible for any human to carry out.

171
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,482
Yes, if anyone were to be able to do it,

172
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,884
only the beautiful evil spirit of the mountains,

173
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,886
Snow Woman could've done it.

174
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,888
Idiot.

175
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,191
It's called homicide because some human did it.

176
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,393
Besides, nothing is impossible!

177
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,095
You idiot!

178
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,301
We met a young man like you just a while ago too.

179
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,205
Who said what you just said about this story.

180
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,707
He looked to be your age, an intermediate school student like you.

181
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,909
An intermediate school student?

182
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,611
Heiji!

183
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,787
Maybe somebody's talking about me.

184
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,288
Right.

185
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,791
I mean, you really put on a grand front in the dining room,

186
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,193
so I'm sure somebody's making fun of you now.

187
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,595
Idiot!

188
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,498
I was just trying to wake you up

189
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,001
from that Snow Woman story you were so panicked out about.

190
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,504
I... I wasn't panicked out or anything.

191
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,507
I just thought that maybe it could be true!

192
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,509
That Snow Woman story...

193
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,211
It's sad and there are many similar stories like it.

194
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,882
Yeah. It's true that it's mysterious.

195
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,784
In Japan, they call the monster

196
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,587
that appears in the most famous Snow Woman story is called...

197
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:25,091
"Woman of the Snow".

198
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,794
English? I thought that Snow Woman was a Japanese story.

199
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,397
Yeah, it's a Japanese folk tale.

200
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,799
But a man called Lafacadio Hern

201
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,701
who was working as an English teacher in Japan heard about it,

202
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,503
and published it in English.

203
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,906
You know him, don't you, Yagumo Koizumi?

204
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,307
That's his pen name!

205
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,012
Yes, yes. You are so knowledgeable, Shinichi.

206
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,613
But thank you anyway.

207
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,584
You said what you did to put me at ease, right?

208
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,186
That's not all I did it for.

209
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,289
I thought I had to say so, to keep out of hot water.

210
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,791
I didn't want a storm to start.

211
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,793
I have this ominous premonition.

212
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,414
Hey, Heiji!

213
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:16,517
What're you going to do if Snow Woman really appears?

214
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:18,819
Idiot! If such a woman exists,

215
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,421
I sure would like to meet her.

216
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:22,123
Heiji.

217
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:23,824
In order to solve the case of 4 years ago,

218
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:26,827
first I've to check the lift in question!

219
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:27,929
And I've got to do it,

220
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,931
before some intermediate school brat beats me to it!

221
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:32,233
What's the big deal?

222
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,536
It's just that somebody else thinks like you.

223
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,438
That's why I don't want to lose!

224
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,839
I've got to win,

225
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,442
or people will think that I'm only intermediate level too.

226
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,110
I mean, you're only in intermediate school too, after all.

227
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,213
Ugh, really! Always so lovey-dovey.

228
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,616
You idiot! Don't get us wrong.

229
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:53,020
The snow's going to melt with the spur that you guys make!

230
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,423
She's talking about somebody else.

231
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,124
Well, you still have time

232
00:11:57,124 --> 00:12:00,027
to check the lift after this blizzard subsides.

233
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:03,030
Well, I guess so. But before that...

234
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,834
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,736
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

236
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:12,740
Heiji?

237
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,343
Hey! Will you cut it out?

238
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:17,311
Taking pictures left and right from some time ago.

239
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:19,113
Heiji! What's the problem?

240
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,316
She could just be taking pictures of this snowy scenery.

241
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:26,620
No! No! This lady is taking pictures of me!

242
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,522
She's my mom!

243
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,224
What?

244
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,228
Just as would be expected of you, Heiji!

245
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:37,331
You've got keen senses just like your dad, Heizo!

246
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,934
What brings you here?

247
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:42,737
I was worried sick over Heiji

248
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,538
because he's rarely come to the Tohoku district.

249
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:45,940
Oh, give me a break!

250
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,742
All you want to do is make additions to the growth video

251
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:51,612
that you've been taking of me since I was born!

252
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,414
I'd like to see it.

253
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,817
It was a bad blizzard back then, too.

254
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,721
4 years ago, the day Mizukami died.

255
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:02,023
On that day, just like now,

256
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,425
while we were waiting to shoot the film,

257
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:07,028
Minowa was surrounded by his fans.

258
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,432
It seems the blizzard is subsiding!

259
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:12,733
Is that right?

260
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,836
Please show us your skiing then!

261
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,638
The awesome ski techniques that you used in

262
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:19,440
"Love of Snow Woman" and "Mystery!"

263
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,741
Please!

264
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:24,512
Oh boy. I've got to shoot a film from now, you see.

265
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,013
No! No!

266
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,214
Ever since we've got here,

267
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,116
fans like you have asked him to ski

268
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:31,419
and he's already skied three times!

269
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:35,523
If you want to see him ski, please watch his movie!

270
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,124
What shall I do?

271
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:38,626
Well, we do have a tight schedule,

272
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:41,429
but we've got to treat the fans nicely, too.

273
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:44,031
I think this is what Mizukami would've said.

274
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,634
"It'll work out somehow!"

275
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:49,336
Oh goodness, he's not here anymore!

276
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:50,838
Will you please cut it out already?

277
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,239
I'm sorry

278
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:56,310
that I got you involved in making a movie based on the late Mr. Mizukami

279
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,612
who was supposed to have become your husband.

280
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,815
Don't be. After all,

281
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:02,516
I'm the one who asked you to let me participate.

282
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:07,121
I sort of felt that if this movie is completed,

283
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,023
the truth of his death would be revealed.

284
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,031
Two places...

285
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,133
I looked from below

286
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,736
there are two places where this lift and ski slope come close together.

287
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,339
You mean you can jump onto the lift from below?

288
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,141
No. They come close,

289
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,943
but there's a space of more than 3 meters.

290
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:30,111
It'd would be impossible to jump on

291
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,412
unless you use a trampoline or something.

292
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:38,919
Isn't that Shoehei Minowa that was at the hotel?

293
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,821
He's good!

294
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:54,435
Encore...

295
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,638
No, no! Just this once for today!

296
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,841
Watch the movie if you want to see more skiing!

297
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,643
It's already 4:00!

298
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:05,312
We've got to shoot the ski slope above quickly.

299
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:08,516
Okay, I'll get myself on the lift first!

300
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,518
Because it'll get pitch dark after 5:00.

301
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:12,419
Hey, Director.

302
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,221
The special make-up artist woman

303
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:17,925
and the stuntman is nowhere in sight.

304
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:20,728
They both said that they'd go up before everyone.

305
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,032
Something's fishy.

306
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:27,735
There sure is something fishy about this lift.

307
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:30,738
Heiji, this lift is scary.

308
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:32,640
Kazuha.

309
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,141
You belong to the advance group,

310
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,410
and yet you've never rode a lift?

311
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,613
I have. But it was a different kind.

312
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,919
Gosh. It starting to get windy again.

313
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,021
I can't see the figure of the detective's

314
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,522
who's riding the lift up ahead too clearly.

315
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,524
Hey, Ms. Tateishi!

316
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,326
Oh, Mr. Mimata.

317
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,429
What're you doing? That lift's going down.

318
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,731
I missed the lift.

319
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:59,934
I'm not good at things like this.

320
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:10,311
Shinichi!

321
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:12,112
What was that sound just now?

322
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:13,614
The sound of a gunshot.

323
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,416
The ones on the lift were...

324
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,117
Director Oyama,

325
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,119
the actor, Minowa,

326
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,722
the detective, in that order if I remember correctly.

327
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:25,526
Did something happen?

328
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,927
It's you.

329
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:30,931
Beats me. I just got off now.

330
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,468
Stop the lift!

331
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,969
Can't you tell?

332
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,372
Look at that!

333
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,074
Just stop the lift right this minute, will you?

334
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,475
Then call the police and paramedics!

335
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,778
What? What? Shinichi? Is something wrong?

336
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,246
Don't look, Ran!

337
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,051
The lift stopped.

338
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,152
What's going on?

339
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,654
The thing that sounded like gunfire just a while ago,

340
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,456
and now that scream.

341
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:13,958
The lift, gun fire...

342
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,959
Don't tell me that

343
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,563
the same thing as the case 4 years ago has happened again.

344
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:21,366
We are sorry for the inconvenience!

345
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:24,268
Please allow a little more time for the lift to resume operation!

346
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,471
What is the meaning of this?

347
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,572
It's almost like what happened back then.

348
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,273
You can say that again.

349
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:33,578
Just like the time when Mr. Mizukami shot himself to death.

350
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:35,747
Mizukami.

351
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:38,850
The gun right as his temple and bang!

352
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,851
This is suicide.

353
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,954
Yes. He is after all holding the gun in his right hand.

354
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:46,958
The problem is this bag that's beside the victim.

355
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,459
If it's just as my ominous premonition tells me,

356
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:50,661
I'm sure that the contents of the bag is...

357
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:52,764
Snow, just as I thought.

358
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:55,867
God. It's the same as 4 years ago.

359
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:01,372
I think I heard that they were shooting a such a movie here.

360
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,373
Yes.

361
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,975
We were shooting a movie having to do with that legend

362
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:06,177
and what happened here 4 years ago,

363
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:09,247
but now after what happened to Mr. Minowa, the star of the show...

364
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,249
Huh? Is Minowa an actor?

365
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,950
If I remember correctly, you were here

366
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,552
when that incident happened 4 years ago too, weren't you?

367
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,954
I am the director of the movie, Oyama.

368
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,357
I was on the left one ahead of him.

369
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,459
Then, I heard a gunshot.

370
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,661
That young man who came along when I got off the lift,

371
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:26,464
noticed that something was wrong with Mr. Minowa.

372
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:29,967
Hey, kid! Just what do you think you're doing?

373
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:32,670
We're going to have to get the lift moving soon

374
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,072
-or the skiers will... -Okay.

375
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,873
After the corpse and his belongings are carried off the lift,

376
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,276
you may move it!

377
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:41,546
-Do you need help? -No, it's pretty light.

378
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:43,748
He was slimmer than he looked.

379
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,650
He didn't even weigh 60 kilograms.

380
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,853
That's why he used to only appear in winter dramas and movies.

381
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:51,756
He didn't want anybody to see how thin he was.

382
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,061
I wonder why he out his skis in the back

383
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,963
instead of wearing them?

384
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,565
Why not?

385
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:03,568
He was holding a bag filled with snow, you know.

386
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,470
It may have been packed with snow,

387
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,773
but it's just big enough to fit a child inside.

388
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,576
Okay! You can go ahead and move the lift!

389
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,678
Oh, officer.

390
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:15,947
There are three things that are bothering me.

391
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:22,453
It finally moved.

392
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,956
Look at the crowd.

393
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,357
It's frightening.

394
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:29,260
Idiot! My blood's starting to boil!

395
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,163
Unauthorized personnel stand back! Stand back!

396
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,866
What is it? What on earth happened?

397
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,167
It's you.

398
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,069
It's something just I heard briefly,

399
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,770
but it seems to be exactly the same

400
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,472
as the incident that happened 4 years ago.

401
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,574
It seems that a man who was riding the lift alone

402
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,877
had a bag filled with snow beside him

403
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:48,646
and killed himself with a gun.

404
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,649
It's as if he were possessed by the Snow Woman!

405
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,551
Hey, not you again.

406
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,753
This isn't your jurisdiction, is it?

407
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:59,757
No. I'm not an officer anymore, but a detective.

408
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:04,061
Besides, I was riding the lift right behind this victim, you know.

409
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,365
Don't you want to ask me questions, officer?

410
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,767
Victim? He committed suicide!

411
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,170
No. I think it's too soon to conclude so yet.

412
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,072
Hey, Heiji! Help!

413
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:17,375
Just what're you doing? Hurry and get off!

414
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,477
Yeah, but I don't know how to get off.

415
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:21,279
Okay then, when you reach the bottom,

416
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,948
I'll have them stop the lift, so make sure you get off!

417
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,349
Okay.

418
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,651
That idiot.

419
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,753
That's why I told her not to come along.

420
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:29,754
Come to think of it,

421
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,256
there was another person who couldn't get off a while ago.

422
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:34,458
-Really? -Yes.

423
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,762
She was a pretty lady who had her hair all tied in the back.

424
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:42,066
No. Mr. Minowa committed suicide?

425
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,267
Why?

426
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,771
Before asking why, will you answer my question?

427
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:49,974
Why did you want to get off the lift here a while ago?

428
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,676
I couldn't get off!

429
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:53,277
I'm not at home with these things.

430
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:55,246
That's strange.

431
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,950
You came here 4 years ago too, to shoot a movie, right?

432
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,352
Back then, I had Mr. Mizukami ride with me.

433
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:03,754
This time I had Mr. Mimata ride with me.

434
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:05,456
She's not very physically inclined, you see.

435
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:10,561
Huh? The director told me that you would be going up ahead.

436
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,164
Why are you riding the lift with her?

437
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:15,866
Standby for the shooting is was all set,

438
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,869
but the director and main star didn't come up the slope

439
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:21,272
so I skied down here to come get them!

440
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:25,276
Then, I saw her coming down on the lift,

441
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,678
so I called out to her, and that's when I heard the gun shot.

442
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:29,747
I had this bad feeling

443
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:34,352
so had him ride the lift with me and went back up again!

444
00:21:34,352 --> 00:21:36,854
I mean, the thing about 4 years ago was bothering me, too.

445
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,456
Then, the lift stopped

446
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:40,558
and I finally got to come down a while ago!

447
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,660
I see. In other words...

448
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,564
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa,

449
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:49,867
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was behind,

450
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:53,170
Ms. Tateishi, who passed him on the lift going down

451
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,073
and Mr. Mimata who was on the ski slope...

452
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:59,977
All could've shot at Mr. Minowa.

453
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,746
-Hey. -Hey, now.

454
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,748
Weren't you listening to what we were just saying?

455
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:06,851
I was with Mr. Mimata when the gunshot was heard.

456
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,853
If that gunshot was fake,

457
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,554
the murder would've been possible.

458
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:12,857
Is this what you want to say, sonny?

459
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:14,859
Yeah, right!

460
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:18,362
But Mr. Minowa was holding the gun in his hand, you know.

461
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:19,664
It would be impossible to make him to that

462
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:20,965
if you're some distance away, right?

463
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,167
You can't tell him to hold the gun

464
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,970
because you're going to be shooting him, can you?

465
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,073
Besides, the blizzard was pretty bad back then.

466
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:30,374
You'd have to be a darn good shooter

467
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:32,576
to shoot down the target at that time.

468
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,378
Well, I'm not too sure of this yet,

469
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:36,847
but there's something I realized.

470
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:39,350
First, the ski poles that Mr. Minowa

471
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,651
is said to have put on the lift!

472
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,955
The loops on both tips of the poles are both upside down.

473
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:48,759
It's proof that the poles were used for something!

474
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,063
Next is the lift that Mr. Minowa was on.

475
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:56,967
There is what looks to be a crack on the left edge of the plastic seat.

476
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,770
I'm sure that this is the result of some trick that was used, too.

477
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,272
And last,

478
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,074
is this cloth bag filled with snow

479
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:06,477
that Mr. Minowa had placed beside himself.

480
00:23:06,477 --> 00:23:09,547
I don't know why but it's frozen stiff.

481
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,949
No, no, don't touch his belongings.

482
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:17,455
But you intermediate school kids nowadays sure are full of curiosity.

483
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:20,458
There was another one just like you, an intermediate school student,

484
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,360
who boastfully told we the police

485
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,362
the three points you just mentioned, too.

486
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,963
What?

487
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:28,065
He was here until just before you got here.

488
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:31,168
I've finally made it down.

489
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,971
I'll never ride a lift ever again.

490
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,773
-Kazuha. -Kazuha.

491
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:39,076
You're not supposed to be in advance ski class, are you?

492
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,078
You don't even know how to get off a lift!

493
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:42,646
Be honest!

494
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:44,148
You just wanted to be in the advance class

495
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:45,950
because Heiji was there, right?

496
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,853
I'll bet your sprained leg is fake, too.

497
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:50,254
Oh, no.

498
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,655
Don't worry.

499
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,457
-We won't tell Heiji about it. -Excuse me!

500
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,659
-I'm really sorry. -Is there anyone here

501
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,962
who took a video Mr. Minowa riding the lift a while ago?

502
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:00,564
If you don't mind, I've taken him with mine.

503
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:04,168
Thank you so much!

504
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:06,470
You sure took nice pictures.

505
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,571
If you're Mr. Minowa's fan,

506
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,273
you could've just kept to shooting videos of him only and yet.

507
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,575
Well, my son asked me to.

508
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,778
He told me to take pictures of the boarding gate of the lift

509
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:14,779
because he wanted to use it as reference

510
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,247
for the incident that happened 4 years ago.

511
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,249
Is your son a police officer or something?

512
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,551
He's a mere intermediate school student.

513
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:23,854
Although he thinks he's a detective.

514
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:26,557
A detective? Just like me.

515
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:30,261
My, Shinichi is chatting with a beautiful madam.

516
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,563
Really, I wonder who he took after.

517
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:35,866
No, he's wearing the facial expression of a detective.

518
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,668
He's still green.

519
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:41,372
And? Has the self-proclaimed world renown mystery novel writer

520
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:43,574
solved this case?

521
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:46,076
Yukiko. What a silly question.

522
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:48,646
What? Have you figured it out, Yusaku?

523
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:52,049
I came all the way here because I wanted to write a novel

524
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,851
based on what happened 4 years ago,

525
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:56,353
but to think that a movie based on it was already being made,

526
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:59,557
and that a similar incident is happening right now...

527
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:01,458
If you've figured out who the culprit is,

528
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,660
why don't you contact the police right away?

529
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,162
No. Let's leave things to the young ones for a while

530
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,764
and watch how things turn out.

531
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:09,867
Well, at least give me a hint then.

532
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,368
Do you know?

533
00:25:11,368 --> 00:25:13,170
That there is another Snow Woman silver clothing legend

534
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,474
that exists in these mountains.

535
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,877
It is a heartbreaking and sad story.
