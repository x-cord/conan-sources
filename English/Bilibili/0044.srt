1
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:07,283
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:11,623
Today's case involves three siblings!
Mysteries upon mysteries!

3
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:13,503
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

4
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:15,963
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

5
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:18,463
His name? Detective Conan!

6
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:55,798
The Three Hotta Siblings Murder Case.

7
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:07,838
Ugh! And I came all this way
because he said it was a big incident...

8
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:10,128
You should've just taken the case!

9
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,338
Yeah, right! I'm not gonna search
for some lousy missing iguana!

10
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,758
Sounds perfect for you...

11
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,978
What seems to be the matter?

12
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:30,478
My car broke down on me.
Could I ask for a lift to my villa up ahead?

13
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:34,168
I'll compensate you, of course.

14
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:36,408
I'd be glad to give you a lift!

15
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:40,118
Thank you. My name is Hotta.

16
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,128
It's nice to meet you!
Thank you. My name is Hotta.

17
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:42,128
It's nice to meet you!

18
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,788
H-Hotta Industries!

19
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,578
You run that huge corporation?!

20
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,608
Hey, Yamauchi.

21
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,148
S-Sir!

22
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,958
What happened?!

23
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,908
My car broke down.
These folks gave me a ride.

24
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:24,918
Is that so? I'm Yamauchi,
the caretaker of this villa.

25
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,368
Thank you for helping him.

26
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:31,338
It's nothing! I'm sure
he would've done the same!

27
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:34,168
Are Koichi and
the others already here?

28
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:39,298
Yes. Everyone is worried
because you're late.

29
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,218
I wonder. I bet they hope
I died in an accident...

30
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:51,418
Say, Mori-san.
Tonight is my birthday party.

31
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:53,998
I'd like to invite you, as thanks...

32
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:55,948
Oh, but...

33
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,448
You don't mind, do you?

34
00:03:57,448 --> 00:04:00,038
Don't mind if I do!

35
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,958
You didn't arrive on time,
Father, so we were worried

36
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,708
you had gotten in an
accident along the way.

37
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,298
Yes! Hotta Industries is
nothing without you, Father!

38
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,008
For sure! The company needs you
to stay well for a long time to come!

39
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:32,938
Chateau Petrus, 1979.
From Koichi-sama.

40
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,728
Hey. Is that expensive wine?

41
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:40,168
Yes. Eye-poppingly expensive.

42
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:43,398
It's the king of red wine!

43
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:59,878
Now then, let us toast
to Father's 58th birthday.

44
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,178
Hold it!

45
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:05,678
Why don't you drink first, big brother?

46
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:07,928
What is that supposed to mean?!

47
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,848
Just figured it wouldn't be
funny if there was poison in it...

48
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:15,598
How rude, Ryoji-san!

49
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:18,148
I've heard the rumors.

50
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:23,458
The overseas branch has taken
big hits because of your poor forecasts.

51
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:29,578
And I hear you're going to be
dismissed and sent to a subsidiary.

52
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,538
You're suggesting I'm
planning to kill Father over that?!

53
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:37,498
I hear you've racked up some
heavy-duty gambling debts lately!

54
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:39,458
M-Mind your own business!

55
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,178
Enough!

56
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:45,678
My dinner...

57
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,178
I've had just about enough of this!

58
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,978
I see my brothers are as close as ever.

59
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,458
Eldest Daughter- Hotta Fumiko (30)
Sis!

60
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,628
Fumiko!
Eldest Daughter- Hotta Fumiko (30)

61
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:57,438
Eldest Daughter- Hotta Fumiko (30)

62
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,148
Why are you here?

63
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:04,858
What a harsh hello,
after sending an invitation yourself.

64
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:09,578
We severed all ties five years ago!
I'd never send you an invitation!

65
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,408
I don't want to see your face! Get out!

66
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,378
You're the one who called
me here to tell me something!

67
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,338
I have nothing to say to you!

68
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:25,418
Tonight was supposed
to be a feast, too...

69
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,258
Oh, Dad.

70
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:31,578
Say, what happened between
Hotta-san and Fumiko-san?

71
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:36,288
Good question. I've only been
their caretaker for two years,

72
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:38,858
so I don't know
what happened long ago.

73
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,368
Whiskey, huh?
Whose present is this?

74
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,878
W-W-What the--

75
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,288
S-Sir!

76
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,878
A bomb...

77
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,288
W-What the--

78
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:12,458
Call the police!

79
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,508
R-Right!

80
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:21,208
Looks like I can assume
a bomb was planted in here.

81
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,528
That's absurd!

82
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:27,608
Stay out! Please wait outside
until the police arrive!

83
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:30,618
And just who are you?!

84
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:35,828
The world's greatest detective,
Mori Kogoro!

85
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:38,058
Mori Kogoro?!

86
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,918
The famous detective?!

87
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,998
This was dynamite...

88
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:51,328
Doesn't smell like dynamite to me.

89
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,578
Trying to butt in again, huh?!

90
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,228
He has wood and glass fragments in him!

91
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,148
Stupid kid! Oww!

92
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,458
This is a whiskey display box!

93
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,398
Ah! The glass stuck
in him is from a bottle!

94
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,458
What's that?

95
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,628
The bomb was inside the whiskey box!

96
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:15,488
That's why there are
fragments all over Hotta-san's body!

97
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:17,498
I see--

98
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:23,038
I don't need you to tell me!
I realized that long before you!

99
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:26,628
Yeesh...

100
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,588
Dirt? What's it doing in here?

101
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,498
Dad!

102
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:35,888
Where's Yamauchi-san?

103
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:38,928
He says the phone is out...

104
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,638
Say what?!

105
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:48,438
If anyone here holds a grudge
against Father... it's you, Fumiko!

106
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:52,568
Yeah! You hadn't spoken in five years!

107
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:58,748
Suddenly showing up now without
an invitation is undeniably strange!

108
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:05,628
Yes. I did hate him.
Enough to want to kill him!

109
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:13,138
But I didn't do it.
Though I do thank whoever did.

110
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,428
I assume you all feel the same.

111
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,918
What horrible siblings...

112
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,888
How are the phone lines?!

113
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:25,558
They've been cut
by a knife or something...

114
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:26,728
A knife?!

115
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:29,378
What should we do, Mori-san?

116
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,148
What's this?

117
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,658
The bomb was planted
inside a whiskey box.

118
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,908
Eh? T-This display box was--

119
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:40,688
You recognize it?!

120
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:41,878
Well...

121
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,748
Out with it!

122
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:48,208
I believe it was a present
Ryoji-sama gave to him...

123
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,928
I remember because
I took it to his room.

124
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,948
R- Ryoji did it?!

125
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,888
Say, where is Ryoji-san?!

126
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,518
He ran off...

127
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:06,858
That can't be!

128
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,148
A knife!

129
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:17,738
This is Ryoji-sama's car.

130
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,628
He hasn't gotten far,
if he left his car behind...

131
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:26,208
Eh? Does that mean
he's still lurking about?!

132
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,298
What's this?! It's been slashed!

133
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,288
Mori-san. What do we do now?

134
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:38,328
It's probably best
to leave in our cars.

135
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,728
Not an option.

136
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:40,638
What?!

137
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:44,598
All four of these
cars have slashed tires.

138
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,568
What?! Does that mean
we can't leave this villa?!

139
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:54,568
Ryoji did this. There's
rubber stuck on his knife!

140
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,578
How did you get here?

141
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,368
We can't drive, so we took a limo...

142
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:02,498
Are there any other cars?

143
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:08,288
There's my car. But it's broken
and hardly in a usable state...

144
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:13,758
Say, if Ryoji-san is the killer,
why would he slash his own tires?

145
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:17,788
Isn't it obvious? If his tires
were the only ones not slashed,

146
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:22,468
the police would suspect
him right off the bat.

147
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:27,748
That's strange. He would still
be suspected right off the bat

148
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:32,318
if his whiskey exploded
and he disappeared right after!

149
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,038
Ryoji-san didn't do this.

150
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:39,668
But if the killer's goal was actually
to trap everyone inside this villa...

151
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:41,528
...something else might happen!

152
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:45,788
In any event, Ryoji-san
is still lurking around here.

153
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,998
Make sure to stay
together and not go off alone!

154
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:52,458
Screw that! I'm going back to my room!

155
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:56,668
Geez, right after I warn her...

156
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:59,288
Let us all go back inside.

157
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:00,548
Right...

158
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:04,628
Mori-san. I'll try to fix my car...

159
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,958
Be extremely careful.

160
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,848
Hey, kid! Let's go!

161
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:10,978
Okay!

162
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:18,148
Fumiko-san's pendant...

163
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:26,948
Fumiko-san.

164
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,918
Quiet! I'm busy right now!

165
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,888
Are you looking for this?

166
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:32,628
Eh?

167
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:35,548
Give that back!

168
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:50,938
Thanks, little boy. This is
the most important thing to me.

169
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:52,658
Is that your lover?

170
00:12:53,788 --> 00:13:00,948
He died, five years ago. Suicide--
no, it was more like murder.

171
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,578
By Hotta Kosaku, my father!

172
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:10,948
That's why I left.
I couldn't forgive my father...

173
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:18,858
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess there's
no point in telling this to a little kid...

174
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,418
Fumiko-san held a
grudge against Hotta-san.

175
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:32,888
But did she have a chance to
plant the bomb in the whiskey box?

176
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:38,188
What's this?!

177
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:38,958
Chemical Fertilizer

178
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,398
Chemical fertilizer!
Could that bomb have been...
Chemical Fertilizer

179
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,978
Chemical fertilizer!
Could that bomb have been...

180
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:48,658
Just as I thought!

181
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:49,418
Sulfur

182
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:52,868
Sulfur and chemicals!
And that chemical fertilizer!
Sulfur

183
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,288
No doubt about it!
That person is the killer!

184
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:02,598
This person is--!

185
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,889
Is it fixed?

186
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,789
Eh? Oh, Conan-kun...

187
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:24,749
That car sure is old!

188
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:27,359
It's the first one I ever designed.

189
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,489
You were a car designer?

190
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,619
Yes, until five years ago.

191
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,819
I quit after something happened...

192
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,539
I've never seen
a car like this before!

193
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,959
Huh? It's an old-style car,
but it has an airbag...

194
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,119
Uhh, Conan-kun,
could you go get Fumiko-san?

195
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,169
What for?

196
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:55,139
To get the police. Everyone feels
uneasy with just Mori-san, right?

197
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,349
What about you?

198
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:02,329
I'm the caretaker. I have
a responsibility to stay here.

199
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:03,649
Okay!

200
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:10,169
Ah, time for food!

201
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,669
Where's Conan-kun?

202
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:15,119
Probably off playing somewhere.

203
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:18,699
What a lost cause. I'll go find him.

204
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,199
My food...

205
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:30,049
There's no need to be shocked.
This photograph was in your room.

206
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:34,259
You went into my
room without permission?!

207
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,549
I found something
interesting in there...

208
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,479
Sulfur and other chemicals,
hidden inside a cabinet.

209
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,669
The explosive wasn't dynamite.
It was a homemade bomb

210
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,859
made of chemical fertilizer,
sulfur, and other chemicals!

211
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:54,089
You can make a bomb out of that?!

212
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:55,569
Indeed, you can.

213
00:15:55,569 --> 00:16:02,539
If mixed properly, it can produce
an explosive as powerful as dynamite.

214
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:08,249
Ridiculous! Why would I want
to kill the master of the house?!

215
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:13,759
This incident was entirely to
avenge the person in that photograph.

216
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,429
Hotta-san drove him
to suicide five years ago.

217
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,389
Eh?

218
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,099
And he was your son,
Yamauchi-san.

219
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,059
Eh?!
Eh?!

220
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:28,459
You were the one who
took Ryoji-san's whiskey

221
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:31,729
and delivered it
to Hotta-san's room.

222
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:39,749
That's when you placed the
homemade explosive inside the box,

223
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,779
an igniter under the lid,

224
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,039
and easily-ignited
phosphorous in the bomb.

225
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,079
It was basically like striking a match.

226
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:54,509
But it wasn't meant
to be a perfect crime.

227
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,329
Because you needed to
distance yourself from suspicion

228
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,469
until your next crime.

229
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,469
His next crime?

230
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,389
Fumiko-san?

231
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,109
Well done, Mori-san.
It is just as you say.

232
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:22,659
My son Kentaro was an extraordinary
pianist with a bright future.

233
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:27,709
He had dated a girl for a long time,
but because of his paltry income,

234
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,379
he was unable to propose to her.

235
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:38,749
But five years ago, he won a
competition and finally earned appraisal.

236
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:44,559
And then Kentaro
proposed to her. But...

237
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,019
...the woman's father--
Hotta-san-- was against it.

238
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:54,289
S-So that woman was Fumiko-san?!

239
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,739
Kentaro met with Hotta to
get permission to marry her.

240
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:04,659
But Hotta not only refused,
but he ruined Kentaro's fingers as well!

241
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:12,789
The piano was Kentaro's life!
And he had it stolen away forever!

242
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:17,009
What's more, the woman ran off,
leaving him behind devastated!

243
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,959
So the poor boy...

244
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:38,189
Upon learning all of this after his funeral,
I was shocked to realize

245
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:44,699
that as a company man,
I had known nothing about my own son...

246
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:48,199
And that's why you
decided to get revenge...

247
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,329
Yes. After quitting the company,
I investigated Hotta

248
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:58,209
and became his caretaker to
find a chance to exact revenge.

249
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:05,139
But Fumiko had left the family,
and it took me two years to locate her.

250
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:10,669
Then you chose Hotta-san's
birthday party as the stage for revenge

251
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,599
and sent Fumiko-san an invitation.

252
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,569
Yes. Now I will have no regrets in life.

253
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,029
But Fumiko-san is safe
and sound in the car--

254
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:29,709
The moment I got her to step
into that car, my revenge succeeded.

255
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,999
There's a trap in the car, you see.

256
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:37,919
The airbag is set to go off
when she steps hard on the brakes.

257
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,169
As we speak, she's probably...

258
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,499
You really don't know anything, do you?

259
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:51,389
Eh?

260
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:55,709
Why do you think Fumiko-san
is still single, after all this time?

261
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,979
Because even now,
she continues to love Kentaro-san!

262
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:05,739
Absurd! A rude woman disowned
by her father would never do that!

263
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,209
She wasn't disowned!
She left on her own!

264
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,699
She couldn't forgive her father
for what he did to Kentaro-san!

265
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,499
That's a lie! It's nonsense!

266
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,209
She abandoned Kentaro!

267
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:24,839
What's this?

268
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:31,009
That's Fumiko-san's treasure.

269
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:35,289
A treasure chest filled with
her memories with Kentaro-san,

270
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,369
and her feelings for him.

271
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:42,939
Fumiko-san always
wears it at all times.

272
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:49,089
Even now, Kentaro-san is the
dearest person to her, Yamauchi-san!

273
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:54,669
W-What have I done?!

274
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,039
I've killed the person
who loved my son that much!

275
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,919
Fumiko-san! Didn't the airbag deploy?!

276
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:21,749
No. Mori-san had Conan-kun
tell me to come back right away...

277
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:24,359
Fumiko-san... I'm...

278
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:29,319
I hated my father, too.
Enough to want to kill him.

279
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,039
But I can't forgive
Kentaro-san, either.

280
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:45,519
He left me all alone...
And drove his own father to do this...

281
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:50,429
He really is sinful...

282
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:40,449
Ryoji-san had been
locked up in the basement.

283
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,959
Oww!

284
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:46,629
Huh?

285
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:50,549
Huh?! Where did everyone go?!

286
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:57,509
Man, I'm hungry. Oh, that's right!
We're about to have breakfast!

287
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,469
Yamauchi-san! Breakfast, please!

288
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,669
I'm so hungry I could die!
Anything'll do, just please hurry!

289
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,789
Yamauchi-san!

290
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,489
Dad!

291
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:25,079
It's strange!
Something isn't right!

292
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,179
That's weird.

293
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:26,869
Eh?

294
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:31,459
You're supposed to wash makeup
off before applying a face pack!

295
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:35,969
T-That's it! That person
really is the killer!

296
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,249
On the next Conan--

297
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,979
"The Face Pack Murder Case."

298
00:24:58,614 --> 00:25:01,428
Next Conan's Hint:

299
00:25:01,428 --> 00:25:01,432
Next Conan's Hint:
Lipstick.

300
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,058
Lipstick.
