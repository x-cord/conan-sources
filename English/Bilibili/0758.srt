1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.340
Pops Mouri and I encountered a comedian called Rokusuke Dodonpa,

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.540
who came to turn himself in,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.640
at a police box in front of Beika Station.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.540
He claimed to have killed Hideki Tendo,

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.540
the president of his talent agency.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.840
However, the police investigation

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640
turned up inconsistencies with the murder weapon,

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.240
time of death, and contradictions in his testimony.

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.840
When a witness to his alibi named Izumi Suda was discovered,

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.640
it was eventually disclosed that he lied and turned himself in

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.640
because he wanted to be thought of as the killer who committed the crime.

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.740
With that, all charges against Mr. Rokusuke Dodonpa was dropped.

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.940
I'm sorry, everyone.

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540
I, Rokusuke Dodonpa, in order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.840
of the one who I owe my life to

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.940
wanted to take the place of the killer.

17
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840
For this single reason, I lied and turned myself in.

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.740
I am really sorry.

19
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.940
How did you all find out that Mr. Dodonpa turned himself in?

20
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.440
We were informed.

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.740
We each received an anonymous call at our company.

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.940
Who'd leak out such information?

23
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.640
The ones who knew were...

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.540
What?

25
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.140
It's unthinkable that police officer would leak the info.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.040
It's neither Pops nor me.

27
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.540
Maybe his real motive

28
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.640
wasn't becoming the killer of a case that he didn't even commit

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.340
but to make everyone think he did.

30
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.840
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

31
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

32
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.640
A popular sitcom performer.

33
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.540
His alibi is shattered by unexpected sharpness.

34
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.440
His name is Detective Conan.

37
00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:45.212
"The Comedian Who Turned Himself In (Part 2)"

38
00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:48.512
Pops, breakfast's ready.

39
00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.512
Where's Ran?

40
00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:55.412
She left early this morning because she had a karate match to go to.

41
00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:58.512
Don't you have to go to school?

42
00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:00.212
Today's a holiday.

43
00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.112
Oh, I see.

44
00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:05.412
I'm sorry, everyone.

45
00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:11.312
In order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

46
00:04:11.312 --> 00:04:14.412
I wanted to take the place of the killer.

47
00:04:14.412 --> 00:04:17.412
For this single reason, I lied and turned myself in.

48
00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:20.612
I am really sorry.

49
00:04:20.612 --> 00:04:23.812
A fluke resulting from misfortune, I guess.

50
00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:25.912
He's suddenly got the attention of everyone,

51
00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:28.412
and became the "man of the times".

52
00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:32.512
But why on earth did he go out of his way to turn himself in like that?

53
00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:36.912
I thought till now that he was a nasty guy with a bad habit.

54
00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:39.712
But, I guess he was in fact a very good person.

55
00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:42.912
His likability will skyrocket.

56
00:04:42.912 --> 00:04:45.012
He'll be offered job after job.

57
00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:47.812
He's going to make millions.

58
00:04:47.812 --> 00:04:50.912
I'm telling you, it's true everybody!

59
00:04:50.912 --> 00:04:54.912
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

60
00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.612
Officer Takagi.

61
00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:15.612
Oh, Conan.

62
00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:18.912
Pops asked me to check out the crime scene.

63
00:05:18.912 --> 00:05:22.412
I think he's a bit bothered about this case after all.

64
00:05:22.412 --> 00:05:26.912
Did the killer use this emergency stairs to go in and out?

65
00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:31.812
Yes. The manager didn't see any suspicious people.

66
00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:36.612
He was also bothered about the murder weapon, the steel pipe.

67
00:05:36.612 --> 00:05:40.212
There was a construction site on the way here from Beika Station,

68
00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:43.412
and it seems to have been brought from there.

69
00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:44.812
Officer Takagi,

70
00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:46.612
no matter who we ask,

71
00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.812
everyone says that the victim Hideki Tendo had a good reputation

72
00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:51.312
and is not someone who would extort anyone.

73
00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:54.012
But then...

74
00:05:54.012 --> 00:05:58.712
Then it differs drastically from what Mr. Dodonpa's been saying.

75
00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:03.612
Yes, Takagi here.

76
00:06:04.212 --> 00:06:08.512
What? You got a call from the killer?

77
00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:09.512
Yes.

78
00:06:09.512 --> 00:06:13.912
Just now I got a call at The Metropolitan Police Department from the killer

79
00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:16.212
saying that he had been blackmailed by Mr. Tendo.

80
00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:20.012
It's because that guy Tendo kept blackmailing me!

81
00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.912
I couldn't take it anymore, that's why.

82
00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:23.512
I understand how you feel.

83
00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:27.312
But first, tell me your name.

84
00:06:28.812 --> 00:06:31.412
Hello. Hello.

85
00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:33.312
The call was from public phone booth

86
00:06:33.312 --> 00:06:35.712
so the officers are headed over

87
00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:37.812
but from the way that she talked...

88
00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:39.312
It was a woman.

89
00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:40.812
I got it.

90
00:06:42.612 --> 00:06:44.612
The killer's female?

91
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.712
It's a woman?

92
00:06:46.712 --> 00:06:48.212
Mr. Dodonpa.

93
00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:51.712
I wanted some clues on the killer.

94
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.912
Left as is, Mr. Tendo could never rest in peace.

95
00:06:55.912 --> 00:06:58.512
But... I think it'll be fine.

96
00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:02.312
Pops says he already has an idea of who the real killer is, you see.

97
00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:06.212
He said that all he had left to do was to get a hold of evidence.

98
00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:08.512
Really? Conan?

99
00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:11.012
Can I believe you?

100
00:07:11.012 --> 00:07:13.512
He is a famed detective, after all.

101
00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:15.312
I guess so.

102
00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:18.112
The Sleeping Kogoro is famous so...

103
00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:23.412
Mr. Dodonpa, you dropped this.

104
00:07:23.412 --> 00:07:26.512
It's tissue from the pachinko parlor.

105
00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:27.912
Thank you.

106
00:07:27.912 --> 00:07:31.112
I'm convinced that the killer is a woman.

107
00:07:31.112 --> 00:07:33.812
It was probably easy to blackmail her.

108
00:07:35.112 --> 00:07:38.212
What? The Kogoro Mouri did?

109
00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:40.312
He asked me to confirm.

110
00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:42.912
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

111
00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:45.712
Exactly, it was always like that.

112
00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:48.912
I asked him why too.

113
00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:53.612
You always come shopping around this time.

114
00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:55.312
At a little before 8 am.

115
00:07:56.412 --> 00:07:57.912
I got a habit of eating

116
00:07:57.912 --> 00:08:00.512
while watching the morning show that starts at 8 am, you see.

117
00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.212
The girl MC announcer is so cute.

118
00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:04.912
Oh, I see.

119
00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:08.112
You watch the girl announcer while you eat, eh.

120
00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:10.612
I'd do the same for that girl announcer.

121
00:08:10.612 --> 00:08:12.512
Thank you, sir.

122
00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:14.912
Just as I thought.

123
00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:18.112
His breakfast time was set.

124
00:08:18.112 --> 00:08:19.412
What?

125
00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:20.812
You?

126
00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:24.412
You're running an errand for Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

127
00:08:24.412 --> 00:08:28.612
And? Who is Kogoro Mouri?

128
00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:30.812
He's a famous great detective.

129
00:08:30.812 --> 00:08:34.012
Oh. I don't know him.

130
00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:36.712
Tell him that if he wants to ask me something,

131
00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:39.012
don't send a child over

132
00:08:39.012 --> 00:08:43.512
but come here himself!

133
00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:44.912
I see.

134
00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:47.312
She's a bit out of this world.

135
00:08:47.312 --> 00:08:51.712
That's probably why she was used to scheme establishing the alibi too.

136
00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:55.412
Mr. Mouri?

137
00:08:55.412 --> 00:08:56.912
Megure here.

138
00:08:56.912 --> 00:09:00.612
Inspector, why are you asking me to do it?

139
00:09:00.612 --> 00:09:01.712
I mean...

140
00:09:01.712 --> 00:09:06.712
What meaning is there asking her at this point?

141
00:09:08.612 --> 00:09:11.512
Why are you here?

142
00:09:13.712 --> 00:09:18.512
Then you're not too concerned about things like time, right, Ms. Suda?

143
00:09:18.512 --> 00:09:20.912
I don't give a hoot at all.

144
00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:23.712
Once I confine myself to this atelier,

145
00:09:23.712 --> 00:09:26.612
all I do is draw.

146
00:09:26.612 --> 00:09:30.212
And, if I get sleepy I knock myself out to sleep over there!

147
00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:32.812
That's my life.

148
00:09:34.412 --> 00:09:37.212
And, about yesterday...

149
00:09:37.212 --> 00:09:41.912
Since you don't have a TV, radio, or cell phone,

150
00:09:41.912 --> 00:09:43.912
in order to tell time

151
00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:47.012
all you have is that wall clock, right?

152
00:09:47.012 --> 00:09:48.012
That's right.

153
00:09:48.012 --> 00:09:51.012
That one clock is more than enough for me.

154
00:09:51.012 --> 00:09:52.612
And...

155
00:09:54.112 --> 00:09:55.912
Shut up, will you?

156
00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:58.712
I'd like to ask you about yesterday.

157
00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:02.112
It's like I told the cop.

158
00:10:02.612 --> 00:10:03.712
The night before last,

159
00:10:03.712 --> 00:10:05.012
I got a call from Dodonpa saying that

160
00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:08.212
he'd be coming here the next day at 9 am,

161
00:10:08.212 --> 00:10:11.312
and like he said, he came here yesterday.

162
00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:14.912
Did you confirm the time with that clock at that time?

163
00:10:14.912 --> 00:10:18.512
I did. It was 9 sharp like he promised.

164
00:10:18.512 --> 00:10:20.212
All right.

165
00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:22.712
That's all I need to confirm.

166
00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:24.012
Let's go.

167
00:10:24.012 --> 00:10:25.212
Wait.

168
00:10:25.212 --> 00:10:28.612
When the cops came yesterday...

169
00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:34.712
Who's asking?

170
00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:36.312
Are you still resting?

171
00:10:36.312 --> 00:10:39.612
It seems that you were sleeping back then,

172
00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.512
but do you always take an afternoon nap?

173
00:10:41.512 --> 00:10:43.712
Yesterday was special.

174
00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:45.912
I must've been really tired.

175
00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:48.012
While I was eating the cake that Dodonpa brought over

176
00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:50.712
and was chatting with him,

177
00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:53.212
I sort of got sleepy.

178
00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:54.612
I see.

179
00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.312
And...

180
00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:58.912
I'm telling you, let's go, you brat!

181
00:10:58.912 --> 00:11:00.612
Just one more thing!

182
00:11:00.612 --> 00:11:05.012
Do you lock the door of this atelier before you go to bed at night?

183
00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:06.512
Not at all!

184
00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:09.512
There's nothing in here to steal.

185
00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:19.112
There's no room for doubt at all.

186
00:11:21.112 --> 00:11:23.612
You. Why were you there?

187
00:11:23.612 --> 00:11:24.612
What?

188
00:11:24.612 --> 00:11:27.012
That's because...

189
00:11:27.012 --> 00:11:28.912
Something's strange.

190
00:11:28.912 --> 00:11:31.112
What're you up to?

191
00:11:31.112 --> 00:11:33.212
Thank you.

192
00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:35.312
"Paradise Hall"?

193
00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:38.512
Hey, do the balls come out easily?

194
00:11:38.512 --> 00:11:40.112
Of course.

195
00:11:40.112 --> 00:11:44.412
So much that you want them to stop...

196
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.612
It's right ahead, right?

197
00:11:45.612 --> 00:11:47.212
Here I come.

198
00:11:47.212 --> 00:11:48.912
Thank you for your patronage.

199
00:11:48.912 --> 00:11:50.512
Hey, sir.

200
00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:53.212
What is it, sonny?

201
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.912
Were passing those tissues out yesterday too?

202
00:11:55.912 --> 00:11:57.012
Yes.

203
00:11:57.012 --> 00:12:00.712
I was passing them out yesterday from around just before 10 am.

204
00:12:00.712 --> 00:12:02.012
Didn't you give a pocket tissue

205
00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:05.612
to somebody that you've seen on TV back then too?

206
00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:06.712
What?

207
00:12:12.012 --> 00:12:13.512
Officer!

208
00:12:13.512 --> 00:12:16.212
I hear you've found the killer?

209
00:12:16.212 --> 00:12:19.012
-Were you asked to come too? -Yes.

210
00:12:19.012 --> 00:12:23.012
Just as I was about to go to work I got a call from Mr. Mouri.

211
00:12:23.012 --> 00:12:26.112
Darn it. I'm broke.

212
00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:27.712
That tissue guy!

213
00:12:27.712 --> 00:12:30.912
"So much that I want them to stop." My foot!

214
00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:33.112
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mouri.

215
00:12:33.112 --> 00:12:35.512
Oh, Inspector.

216
00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.512
I hear you've found the killer.

217
00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:40.312
Aren't you the one who called us?

218
00:12:47.512 --> 00:12:50.212
This is the much rumoured Sleeping Kogoro, I see.

219
00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:53.212
So... I shall start by telling you

220
00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:55.712
the truth about the murder case of

221
00:12:55.712 --> 00:12:58.312
the president of the talent agency, Mr. Hideki Tendo!

222
00:13:08.271 --> 00:13:12.671
I know that the one he was blackmailing was probably a woman but...

223
00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:15.271
Oh... You're talking about the call?

224
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:18.371
That was just a diversionary tactic

225
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.271
to keep the eyes of the police off of the real killer.

226
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:26.471
The story about Mr. Tendo blackmailing people itself is a lie.

227
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:28.671
Isn't that right, Mr. Dodonpa?

228
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:34.171
Because you're the one who killed Mr. Tendo.

229
00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:36.171
Me?

230
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:39.271
Above all, you turned yourself in,

231
00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:40.771
saying that you committed the murder.

232
00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:45.871
So, as to that, we've already cleared that, haven't we?

233
00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:47.871
I'm sad.

234
00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:51.271
That my feelings of wanting to protect Mr. Tendo's reputation

235
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:54.971
despite having to turn myself in for a crime that I didn't even commit,

236
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:57.471
cannot be understood.

237
00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:59.671
I don't think anybody will understand that sort of feeling.

238
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:05.171
Because you, yourself, had no such feelings at all.

239
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:09.271
If so, why would I turn myself in?

240
00:14:09.271 --> 00:14:12.771
I have an alibi for yesterday at 9 am

241
00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:16.171
when the president was murdered.

242
00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:17.271
Am I right?

243
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:19.371
-Yes. -What? Yes.

244
00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:22.271
That's why all charges were dropped.

245
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:23.671
Exactly.

246
00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:26.371
A shrewd guy...

247
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:28.271
To think that you would use

248
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:30.071
the investigation of the police to your advantage!

249
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:35.871
Yesterday morning, you came secretly here to Beika City.

250
00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:38.271
At about 8:30 am.

251
00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:40.671
You stole a steel pipe from the construction site

252
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.671
where no one was around.

253
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:44.471
You put it into a golf case

254
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:49.271
and used the emergency stairs to come to this office around 9 am.

255
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:51.071
Good morning.

256
00:14:51.071 --> 00:14:52.871
Dodonpa's here.

257
00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:55.771
Morning. You're early today.

258
00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:57.771
Where's your guitar?

259
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:02.971
I guess you ate your breakfast around 8 am as usual too, didn't you?

260
00:15:02.971 --> 00:15:05.871
Yes. What about it?

261
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.671
That's of great importance,

262
00:15:08.671 --> 00:15:13.771
when the estimated time of death is to be concluded after the autopsy.

263
00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:16.471
Hey. What're you talking about?

264
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.171
After committing the crime,

265
00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:26.171
you hid the murder weapon in back of the condominium,

266
00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:28.471
rushed back to Akebono City

267
00:15:28.471 --> 00:15:32.071
and visited Ms. Suda's atelier.

268
00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:34.171
At 10 am.

269
00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:35.771
At 10 am?

270
00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:38.671
I... I visited her at 9 am!

271
00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:42.071
Yes. Ms. Suda also said he came at 9 am.

272
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:45.371
She testified that there's no mistake because she looked at the clock.

273
00:15:45.371 --> 00:15:49.671
What if that clock was delayed an hour?

274
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:50.671
How about it?

275
00:15:50.671 --> 00:15:52.071
Not possible.

276
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:55.071
We confirmed when we went to question her.

277
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:59.071
Yes. Mr. Dodonpa came at 9 am sharp.

278
00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:04.171
That's because the clock that was delayed an hour

279
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:06.171
was turned back to the correct time

280
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:08.371
before the police came to confirm.

281
00:16:08.371 --> 00:16:09.771
No way.

282
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:12.071
Probably the night before last.

283
00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.071
After waiting for Ms. Suda to fall asleep,

284
00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:16.971
you snuck into her atelier.

285
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:19.671
Ms. Suda who doesn't give a hoot about time to begin with,

286
00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:23.671
wouldn't have noticed if the time was delayed an hour.

287
00:16:23.671 --> 00:16:27.071
Did I come at the wrong time?

288
00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:29.171
What?

289
00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:31.271
No, you're right on time.

290
00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:33.571
Come on in, will you?

291
00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:38.271
You made Ms. Suda believe that you came to visit her at 9 am.

292
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:40.471
Moreover, I'll bet you laced some sleeping drug

293
00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:43.571
on the cake that you took to her as a gift.

294
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.271
What's the matter, Ms. Suda?

295
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:53.071
Sorry. I'm suddenly sort of sleepy.

296
00:16:53.071 --> 00:16:54.771
I'm sure you're tired.

297
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:56.571
Please rest.

298
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:59.171
I'll leave on my own.

299
00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:03.171
You turned back the clock that you temporarily delayed to normal.

300
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:05.471
That's why when I went to confirm the time,

301
00:17:05.471 --> 00:17:07.871
it was correct.

302
00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:12.971
I'll use this as a material for my comedy, Mr. Mouri.

303
00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:15.971
The deduction show of a great detective full of lies.

304
00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:18.671
I'm sure that this'll become popular.

305
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:22.271
Yesterday morning,

306
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:24.971
You got into trouble with somebody

307
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:27.571
near Ms. Suda's atelier, didn't you?

308
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:33.471
Paradise Hall.

309
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:36.071
Thank you.

310
00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:38.471
Paradise Hall.

311
00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:42.271
Oh, you're Mr. Rokusuke Dodonpa, aren't you?

312
00:17:42.271 --> 00:17:43.571
Wrong!

313
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:45.771
Please give me your autograph!

314
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.871
You've got the wrong person, I tell you!

315
00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:52.971
It was a little before 10 am.

316
00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:56.371
You had the drawing collection with you back then

317
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:58.971
so you returned it after this incident.

318
00:17:58.971 --> 00:18:02.471
It wasn't me, who got into trouble.

319
00:18:02.471 --> 00:18:06.271
I'm sure there are a lot of other people who have drawing collections.

320
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:07.771
I wonder?

321
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:09.471
Everything will be clear

322
00:18:09.471 --> 00:18:11.471
once we check the prints on the drawing collection, you know.

323
00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:14.271
It's only natural that my print would be on it

324
00:18:14.271 --> 00:18:17.471
because I borrowed it from her, right?

325
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.971
Not yours.

326
00:18:19.971 --> 00:18:22.871
The prints of the guy who was passing out the tissues!

327
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:28.071
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

328
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:33.671
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:35.071
Sure.

330
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:38.571
You sure look like him.

331
00:18:38.571 --> 00:18:41.871
Oh, no. It's almost 10 am.

332
00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:47.471
His prints wouldn't be on the drawing collection,

333
00:18:47.471 --> 00:18:50.171
unless it was when he got into an argument with you

334
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:53.971
and picked them up from the street, Mr. Dodonpa.

335
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:57.571
You visited Ms. Suda after the argument.

336
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:00.271
Not at 9 am but actually at 10 am.

337
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:02.771
It also very unnatural that Ms. Suda would get sleepy

338
00:19:02.771 --> 00:19:06.271
right after she ate the cake that you brought to her as a gift.

339
00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:11.371
After making up a fake alibi,

340
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:15.271
you headed off for the Beika City again.

341
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:18.571
You left Beika Station at 11 am.

342
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:22.271
You set the metal bat up as a fake murder weapon,

343
00:19:22.271 --> 00:19:25.871
and turned yourself in at the police box at 11:30 am.

344
00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:28.571
In addition to turning yourself in saying that you committed the murder,

345
00:19:28.571 --> 00:19:30.771
you waited for the real murder weapon

346
00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:34.471
and alibi witness to be found.

347
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:38.871
You waited for the investigation of the police to turn things over.

348
00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:40.971
You tried to make us think that you were the killer at first

349
00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:44.371
and schemed for us turn that over for you.

350
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:47.971
But, why did you go out of your way to do something like that?

351
00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:51.771
You wanted to catch two birds with one stone.

352
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:52.871
The press told us

353
00:19:52.871 --> 00:19:56.571
that they found out that you killed President Tendo

354
00:19:56.571 --> 00:20:00.171
and turned yourself in through an anonymous informant.

355
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:04.671
But, the only one who could've leaked such information at that point...

356
00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:06.171
is you, Mr. Dodonpa!

357
00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.171
You're the only person who could've done it.

358
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:12.371
Right. When you're on the way to turning yourself in...

359
00:20:12.371 --> 00:20:17.871
Yes, it seems that the comedian Mr. Rokusuke Dodonpa turned himself in!

360
00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:23.071
You explained earnestly to the press that gathered there.

361
00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:27.171
In order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

362
00:20:27.171 --> 00:20:30.571
I wanted to take the place of the killer.

363
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:33.671
You made people think that you were a nice person,

364
00:20:33.671 --> 00:20:35.571
and in order to gain attention,

365
00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:40.871
you deliberately schemed an unthinkable trick of turning yourself in.

366
00:20:45.771 --> 00:20:47.071
Bull's eye!

367
00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:49.271
Right to the point!

368
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:51.771
That president was too old fashioned.

369
00:20:51.771 --> 00:20:53.771
He used to say performers should only take jobs

370
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:56.371
where they can display their talents.

371
00:20:56.371 --> 00:20:58.071
We, the performers want to make loads of cash

372
00:20:58.071 --> 00:21:00.771
no matter what we have to do, you see?

373
00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:04.071
He got in my way, so I got rid of him.

374
00:21:04.071 --> 00:21:07.071
Like you said, I wanted to kill two birds with one stone!

375
00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:09.571
It worked out just as I planned!

376
00:21:09.571 --> 00:21:11.771
I got job offers after job offers!

377
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.271
After all, my likability has skyrocketed

378
00:21:14.271 --> 00:21:16.271
and I am now the man of the times, you see.

379
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.971
I'm telling you, it's true everybody!

380
00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:27.971
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

381
00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:31.071
Cut it out!

382
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:37.471
Why you!

383
00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:41.271
How dare you so thoughtlessly take someone's life?

384
00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:47.871
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:47.871 --> 00:21:51.871
I told you that I was the real killer.

386
00:21:51.871 --> 00:21:53.871
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:25.671 --> 00:23:30.371
What's with that "Dodonpa never lies" bit?

388
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:32.871
Yes, I never lie..

389
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:36.871
Balls keep coming out so much that you want them to stop.

390
00:23:39.171 --> 00:23:40.871
You're full of lies!

391
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:42.171
Out! Out!

392
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:45.871
Out with the balls!

393
00:23:45.871 --> 00:23:48.671
It doesn't look good for a famed detective

394
00:23:48.671 --> 00:23:50.271
to fall for such a cheap lie.

395
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:54.471
Keigo Hiura!

396
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:58.371
I'm a so-called writer of romantic novels.

397
00:23:58.371 --> 00:24:01.471
Ma'am, are you all right? Ma'am?

398
00:24:01.471 --> 00:24:04.271
The clear echoing of this voice.

399
00:24:05.671 --> 00:24:07.471
Ms. Minazuki!

400
00:24:16.471 --> 00:24:17.871
Next Conan,

401
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:21.971
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 1)"

402
00:24:37.271 --> 00:24:39.371
Next Conan's Hint

403
00:24:39.371 --> 00:24:41.871
"Room service".

404
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:43.871
I don't read romantic novels.

405
00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:46.871
In the next episode, romance turns into mystery!
