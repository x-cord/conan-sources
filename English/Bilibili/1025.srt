1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.790
The message Ran received from Ooka Momiji
pit me against Hattori in a code breaking race.

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.780
However, we solved the code at the same time.

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.710
Following the decoded message, we
headed to a warehouse at Haido Harbor.

4
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.550
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

5
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.390
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

6
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.140
One of the brothers is the culprit!

7
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750
How will the mystery-solving
contest conclude?

8
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.440
Always determining the one truth

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.210
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

10
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.070
his name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.470
Ooka Momiji's Challenge (Part Two)

12
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.120
Ooka Momiji's Challenge (Part Two)
"Ooka Momiji's Challenge, Part Two!"

13
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.990
Ooka Momiji's Challenge (Part Two)

14
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.250
The deceased is Hamana
Benzo-san, 42 years old.

15
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.190
He worked as a department store buyer.

16
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.750
So he fell to his death.

17
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.800
Looks like he fell from up there.

18
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.630
Yes. We don't know yet if it was
an accident or suicide.

19
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.800
It was murder.

20
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.710
What?

21
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.450
Look closely.

22
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.620
Those metal-frame glasses are
lying crooked on his face.

23
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.020
It doesn't make sense that the right
side of his face is uninjured.

24
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.440
It doesn't make sense that the right
side of his face is uninjured.
Hamana Benzo (42)
Department Store Buyer

25
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.560
It doesn't make sense that the right
side of his face is uninjured.

26
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.980
You're right.

27
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.690
Wouldn't that mean

28
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.200
the victim's glasses fell off when he fell,

29
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.450
and the culprit put them back on
the body's head for some reason?

30
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.300
Right, Shinichi-niichan?

31
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.330
He's on the phone with Kudo-kun?

32
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.780
Apparently those three men were
already here when you arrived,

33
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.140
but why did you come here?

34
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.470
Because of the code.

35
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.770
One indicating where the treasure is hidden.

36
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.030
The treasure?

37
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.720
Yes.

38
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.200
Their mother, who worked as a
housekeeper at a certain mansion,

39
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.980
received a treasure from the master
of the house before her death.

40
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.350
She expressed the treasure's
hiding place in four codes

41
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.490
and gave one to each brother.

42
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.920
However, after the brothers shared
their codes with each other,

43
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120
they suddenly lost contact with
the eldest brother Benzo-san.

44
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.840
Since the Ooka family has a relationship
with said master of the house,

45
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.010
he asked us to solve the code, and I
asked Heiji-kun and Kudo-kun for help.

46
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.800
When we came here after solving the code,

47
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.010
these three were already here,

48
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.640
and that body was lying on
the ground at their feet.

49
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.150
All three of them claim they came here
because their murdered eldest brother texted them.

50
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.390
Normally you'd assume whoever arrived first
pushed the eldest brother and killed him.

51
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.130
Who arrived first?

52
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.870
Well...

53
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.850
Kashiwagi Suguru (39)
Bank Employee (Second Brother)

54
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.650
Kashiwagi Suguru (39)
Bank Employee (Second Brother)
It was...

55
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.000
Kashiwagi Suguru (39)
Bank Employee (Second Brother)
It's true that I seem to have arrived first,

56
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.810
It's true that I seem to have arrived first,

57
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.500
but our brother was already dead on
the floor like that by that point.

58
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.580
Isn't that right?

59
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.340
Isn't that right?
Kanda Katsunobu (38)
Bike Shop Employee (Third Brother)

60
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.800
Kanda Katsunobu (38)
Bike Shop Employee (Third Brother)
I don't know about that.

61
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.810
I don't know about that.

62
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.380
All I can say is that this guy was
already here by the time I arrived,

63
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.260
and that our brother was dead.

64
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.720
Jinya Saisuke (36)
Part-time Worker (Fourth Brother)

65
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.020
Jinya Saisuke (36)
Part-time Worker (Fourth Brother)
S-Since I arrived after these guys,
that means I'm not the culprit, right?

66
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.300
S-Since I arrived after these guys,
that means I'm not the culprit, right?

67
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.160
Not necessarily.

68
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.360
After killing the eldest brother Benzo-san,

69
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.290
you could've hid in the area

70
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.490
and waited for someone to discover
the body before popping out.

71
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.060
Anyway, you seem rather standoffish for
brothers, calling each other "this guy."

72
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.750
Of course we are.

73
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.160
We were put up for adoption 30 years ago.

74
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.480
We hadn't met since then.

75
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.510
We're practically meeting for the first time.

76
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.820
Come to think of it, they don't
really resemble each other.

77
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.270
Are they really brothers?

78
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.130
Hold on.

79
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.710
We've got the photo to prove it.

80
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.310
Take a look.

81
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.230
See?

82
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.860
All three of them have got the same photo?

83
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.420
But they're such young kids in the photo.

84
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.870
It's hard to tell if they look like them.

85
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.410
I don't know what to say to that.

86
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.620
This is the only photo we have.

87
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.000
And it was 30 years old.

88
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.040
Excuse me, detective.

89
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.920
Was there a burn scar on the body's hand?

90
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.400
A burn scar?

91
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.260
There's an oddly-shaped burn
scar on the body's right palm.

92
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.850
If they're really brothers, then they
should all have the same burn scar.

93
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.730
Could you show us your hands?

94
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.150
Could those burn scars have come from...

95
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.750
Coupon
Jingisukan Beika

96
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.780
Coupon
Jingisukan Beika
...a Jingisukan pot?

97
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.920
Yeah.

98
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.830
Before we were put up for adoption,

99
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:40.790
we were invited to the mansion where
our mother worked and had Jingisukan.

100
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.780
I still remember how that lamb tasted.

101
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.930
While we were cleaning up after we finished
eating, someone flipped the pot over.

102
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.930
Our mother was about to get burnt, so we
reflexively stuck out our hands and ended up like this.

103
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.450
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

104
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.730
It was heavy, and our hands
were there for a long time.

105
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.320
Yeah. On top of that, we cooked
a ton of meat that day.

106
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.740
That's right. I'm impressed we were
able to catch it since it was so hot.

107
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.050
Speaking of Jingisukan, apparently there
was a Jingisukan pot inside a plastic bag.

108
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.370
Where?

109
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.550
Around that area where we believe
the victim was pushed from.

110
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.380
What? The order in which I
escorted them to Warehouse 4?

111
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.890
I remember the bearded man arrived first,

112
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.300
but I don't remember the order
in which the other three arrived.

113
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.300
I-I see.

114
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.970
Can I go now?

115
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.570
There are a lot of people here today.

116
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.620
I need to keep things organized.

117
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.250
Is something happening?

118
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.650
Apparently today's the day for great social
media posts that happens once a year.

119
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.860
I-It's what?

120
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.530
What?

121
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.380
Tell me all about it.

122
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.750
Momiji-ojosama, we have
a rather serious problem.

123
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.330
Look at this.

124
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.130
A lovely spot for great social media
posts that happens once a year?

125
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.590
Today, here at this harbor?

126
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.820
How marvelous.

127
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.480
According to the information I gathered,

128
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.180
Hattori-sama is waiting for the opportunity to
confess his feelings in front of a picturesque view.

129
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.920
If he defeats Kudo-sama in
the mystery-solving contest,

130
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.940
he may confess his feelings to Kazuha-sama
before he realizes how attractive you are.

131
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.820
We'll have to do something about that.

132
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.740
Kudo-kun must win, no matter what.

133
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.690
Kudo-kun must win, no matter what.
It's so hot.

134
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.370
It's so hot.

135
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.360
Conan-kun, want some water?

136
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.580
Yeah, thanks.

137
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.330
There's not much we can do if we don't know
the order in which the three brothers arrived.

138
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.250
Yes. It's not clear why they suddenly
lost contact with the victim either.

139
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.460
It's because he lost his phone while
traveling abroad on a business trip.

140
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.360
He wrote in his message that he found it
at the airport when he returned to Japan.

141
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.790
He was surprised to find a ton of
messages from us in his history

142
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.180
that we sent while his phone was lost.

143
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.610
I'm not sure exactly why he asked
us to meet him here today though.

144
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.440
So you often exchange
messages with Benzo-san.

145
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.620
Yes. Not only that, but we
frequently sent each other gifts.

146
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.360
The other day, he gave me his
favorite watch with a leather band.

147
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.250
Apparently he didn't need it anymore.

148
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.790
He gave me a leather jacket.

149
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:39.260
But I was surprised when he returned my gift
of chocolate and nuts he liked as a kid.

150
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.460
The same thing happened to me.

151
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.960
Since he used to like crab,
I sent him canned crab,

152
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.270
but for some reason he returned all of them.

153
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.420
Huh?

154
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.190
Something just caught my attention.

155
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.180
What was it?

156
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.050
Hey, Conan-kun.

157
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.690
Huh?

158
00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.410
Are you keeping Kudo-kun
updated on the situation?

159
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.450
Y-Yeah.

160
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.630
If you'd like, Iori would be willing
to discuss things with you.

161
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.840
What do you think?

162
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.500
I-I'm fine.

163
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.010
That's what Shinichi-niichan said.

164
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.630
Momiji's helping Kudo-kun.

165
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.370
Heiji, you can do it!

166
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.980
Heck yeah.

167
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.970
If I beat Kudo, I'll ride that
momentum to the lovely spot

168
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.860
and confess my feelings to Kazuha!

169
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.710
What's going on?

170
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.650
I'm only getting a bad feeling from him.

171
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.840
Speaking of crab, he sends me
crab-flavored crackers all the time.

172
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.570
Says he recommends them.

173
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.570
Then it's not as though he
doesn't like crab anymore.

174
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.170
Crackers...

175
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.960
What's wrong, Genta-kun?

176
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.160
Are you itchy?

177
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.580
I suddenly started feeling itchy
after eating these crackers.

178
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.790
Kojima-kun, you might be
allergic to shellfish.

179
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.940
You shouldn't eat any more of those crackers.

180
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.470
I see. So that's how it is.

181
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.970
That's why the culprit was forced to do that.

182
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.480
Looks like Hattori hasn't solved it yet.

183
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.480
Ran seems to be rooting for me, too.

184
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.780
Huh? Wait a minute.

185
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.500
Isn't that face...?

186
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.910
These donuts are good.

187
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.910
Yeah.

188
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.760
It's okay. You can have it, Shinichi.

189
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.880
Okay, thanks.

190
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.450
Actually, you can have it, Ran.

191
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.060
I'm full anyway.

192
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.780
Really? Thanks.

193
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.440
She's making the same face she did back then.

194
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.030
Which means what she really wants is...

195
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.710
Hey, Conan-kun.

196
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.340
Didn't Kudo-kun just explain the truth
behind the case to you over the phone?

197
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.200
What?

198
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.830
Iori says your expression changed.

199
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.460
No, it wasn't about that.

200
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.790
He said he noticed something
about the victim Benzo-san.

201
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.150
Benzo-san probably developed a crab allergy.

202
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:32.770
Benzo-san used to like crab, but he
returned the gift of canned crab, right?

203
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.150
Then what about my chocolate and nuts?

204
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.700
Maybe it's a snack allergy or something.

205
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.930
What? I've never heard of that allergy.

206
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.570
He's allergic to metal.

207
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.820
What?

208
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.450
Canned goods absorb metal from their cans.

209
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.500
Canned goods absorb metal from their cans.
Red King Crab
Canned

210
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.120
Red King Crab
Canned
Chocolate and nuts contain metals
such as nickel and cobalt.

211
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.830
Chocolate and nuts contain metals
such as nickel and cobalt.

212
00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:02.300
And fluid chrome is applied to leather
products to make them more flexible.

213
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.620
I see.

214
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.050
But why does that matter?

215
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.810
Don't you think it's strange?

216
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:13.160
There were metal-frame
glasses on Benzo-san's head.

217
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.940
You're right. If he were allergic to
metal, he'd avoid wearing those, so why?

218
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.650
Those were the culprit's glasses.

219
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.530
Benzo-san grabbed the culprit's
glasses when he was pushed.

220
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.780
They broke when they fell.

221
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.330
The culprit was forced to
wear Benzo-san's glasses.

222
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.870
After all, the brothers he invited
there would be arriving soon.

223
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.100
In other words, the culprit who
made Benzo-san fall to his death

224
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.260
is the only one of the
suspects wearing glasses.

225
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.130
Jinya Saisuke-san.

226
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.880
You're the only one.

227
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.030
Wh-Why would I kill my brother?

228
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.640
We were finally reunited after 30 years!

229
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.900
And remember what I showed you earlier?

230
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.820
This burn I suffered while protecting our
mom as a child proves we're brothers!

231
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:11.580
You said someone flipped over the Jingisukan
pot while you were cleaning up, right?

232
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.880
Yeah.

233
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.870
The pot was about to burn our mom,

234
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.720
so we reached out to
catch the piping hot pot.

235
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.590
What?

236
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.110
No, that's wrong.

237
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.730
It was actually the pot that
had fallen on the floor.

238
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.500
Your mom was about to fall onto it,

239
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.680
so you slid your hands between
her and the pot to protect her.

240
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.730
Isn't that right?

241
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.940
Yeah.

242
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.290
That's how we got these burns.

243
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.020
Our hands were pressed against
the pot until she got up.

244
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.400
What? But you said it was heavy.

245
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.000
I was referring to mom's weight.

246
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.410
She was pretty fat back then.

247
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.970
Oh, right. I remembered it wrong.

248
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.870
But as you can see, I've
got a burn scar, too.

249
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.420
I'm sorry. I spilled my water.

250
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.510
Jeez.

251
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.800
Huh?

252
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.060
I thought it was water, but
it was actually lemon juice!

253
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.810
What? Hey, wait!

254
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.970
I need to wipe that off quickly!

255
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.720
Since you're panicking, you
must've made that burn scar

256
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.360
by applying citrus juice to your
skin and exposing it to sunlight.

257
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.360
Oh, it was actually water after all.

258
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.730
What?

259
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.440
You thought you'd use the
photosynthetic chemicals

260
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.740
in fruit juice react to UV light
and cause phytophotodermatitis.

261
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.690
And besides, your large unattached earlobes
tell us you're not one of the brothers.

262
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.830
What?

263
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.180
Those earlobes are a dominant gene.

264
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.230
People are rarely born with them unless
one of their parents have them.

265
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.230
You probably talked to the real brother
and decided to use what you learned.

266
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.660
You thought you'd get some of the
treasure by pretending to be him.

267
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.230
Yeah.

268
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.110
I gave myself this burn scar
because I thought it was cool

269
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.710
when I met Saisuke and copied him.

270
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.080
We were both in edgy bands during college.

271
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.550
You didn't hurt Saisuke because
you wanted the treasure, did you?

272
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.750
I didn't do anything like that!

273
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.090
Saisuke died of an illness
just the other day.

274
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:31.760
Before he died, he told me about
the code and your mom's treasure.

275
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.870
He said he wanted to see his brothers again,

276
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.640
but doubted you'd remember him.

277
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.400
While I was organizing his
possessions after his death,

278
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.740
his phone received a message from Benzo-san.

279
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.970
It said, "The treasure is in
Haido Harbor Warehouse 4."

280
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.820
"I'll be waiting there. Let
me know if you can come."

281
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.440
Our faces were similar, and
I had this burn scar, too.

282
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.790
I thought I'd get a share of the treasure
if I pretended to be him, so I showed up.

283
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.040
See? We got these when we caught the pot.

284
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.740
Who are you?

285
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.920
You're not my brother Saisuke.

286
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:14.790
What?

287
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.390
What did you do with Saisuke?

288
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.900
Uh, I...

289
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.430
Hold on. I'm calling the cops.

290
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.520
The police?

291
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.980
My brothers will show up later. We're
going to lay into you, you con artist!

292
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.980
N-No, wait! I can explain!

293
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.690
What are you doing? Let go!

294
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.280
So I didn't meant to kill him!

295
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.960
I just thought it'd be nice if I
got a little bit of the treasure...

296
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.340
There's no splitting that treasure.

297
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:57.840
Wh-What? But I heard she received
it from a wealthy man.

298
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.070
Yeah.

299
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.660
It's the memento that gave the
brothers their honorable injury

300
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.530
when they protected their mother.

301
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:11.950
The Jingisukan pot Benzo-san
was holding before he fell.

302
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.610
What?

303
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.930
Your mom probably intended
for you to remember

304
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.870
how close you were as a family 30 years ago

305
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.160
if you ate Jingisukan from
that pot again as brothers.

306
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.130
Then the reason our brother
invited us here...

307
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.130
...was so we could eat Jingisukan together.

308
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:38.160
Not realizing that, you ended up
burning yourself out of greed,

309
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.060
with the serious burn of murder.

310
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.140
Heiji...

311
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.890
He's so cool.

312
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.400
I knew my future husband could do it.

313
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.150
In that case, Iori, as
per our arrangements...

314
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.150
Yes, Momiji-ojosama.

315
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.410
All right. I've still got time.

316
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.200
Kazuha, this way!

317
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.040
What?

318
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.410
Hey, wait! Heiji?

319
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.500
Hey, Heiji! Where are we going?

320
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.080
Heiji!

321
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.560
Wow, what a pretty sunset.

322
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.310
You dummy.

323
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:55.310
Look closely at the two passenger
ships in front of the setting sun.

324
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.840
The white ship in front and the
ship with the red chimney behind it

325
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.800
are only both at this harbor once a year.

326
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:10.330
In other words, today's the only day
those ships line up to form a heart.

327
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.740
Which makes today a heart's day to remember.

328
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:20.040
Kazuha, I'm about to spill my
heart to you, so listen closely.

329
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.550
K-Kazuha?

330
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.330
Wh-Where did you go, Kazuha?

331
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.500
Hattori.

332
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.300
K-Kudo?

333
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:33.310
Kazuha-chan just headed down the stairs
after that Iori guy whispered something in her ear.

334
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.480
What are you doing here?

335
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.570
I came to let you know since it
seemed like you hadn't noticed.

336
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.330
What? Jeez.

337
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.980
There she is. Over there.

338
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.580
Lovely!

339
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.120
Let's take another picture.

340
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.440
Iori said he'd invite
Heiji, but he's not here.

341
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.130
I doubt boys are interested in lovely spots.

342
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.140
What's Kazuha doing? I was going to...

343
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.760
"Heart's day to remember."

344
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.600
I-I-I-It's not what it sounds like!
I was just caught up in the moment!

345
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.810
Yeah, it was a joke!
Pretty funny joke, right?

346
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.270
What a pain in the ass.

347
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.500
Well, whatever. Seems like you let
me have all the glory this time.

348
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.480
Yeah, I owed you for the school trip.

349
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.790
Anyway, I don't understand women.

350
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.230
The less we understand something...

351
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.720
The more detectives want to solve it.

352
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.340
Yup.

353
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:53.700
Anyway, I wonder whose mansion
their mother was working at.

354
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.050
Iori the butler told me.

355
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.150
It's the mansion of a famous
guy you're quite familiar with.

356
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.440
A famous guy?

357
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.760
The hextuple crown shogi player.

358
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.190
It's the home of Haneda Shukichi's family.

359
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.210
What?

360
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.270
Apparently the rest of the world
doesn't know about it yet.

361
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.870
I-I see.

362
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.740
Isn't Haneda Akai-san's younger
brother and Sera's older brother?

363
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.960
17 years ago, his brother-in-law Haneda Koji

364
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:33.930
was force fed APTX 4869
by someone in America.

365
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.040
In other words, the quadruple
crown shogi player Haneda Koji

366
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.670
was the son of a wealthy family.

380
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.970
The Unspeakable Witness

381

Next Conan's hint!

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.520

383
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:34.910

384
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.010
