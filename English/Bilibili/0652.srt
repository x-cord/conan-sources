1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,540
Huh? You got a letter from a dead person?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,340
-For Heiji? -Yeah.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,040
That person is my mother's acquaintance.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,640
A person named Wakamatsu

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,740
who is the president of a design company in Tokyo.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,340
I've met him several times before too,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,040
but it seems he was killed at a villa in Karuizawa.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,740
-Killed? -Yeah.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,040
But it just so happened that

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,940
we were having a birthday party for Mr. Wakamatsu's wife

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,740
that day at the villa.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,040
The local police seems to think that

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,240
a robber who broke into the villa encountered Mr. Wakamatsu,

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,440
and as a result ended up killing him.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,940
But, why would he send you a letter, Heiji?

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,240
Don't tell me that he sent it out before he was killed?

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
No.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,940
That letter is post marked 10 days after the crime,

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
so I don't think he's the one who sent it out.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,540
The name of the sender is Kohei Wakamatsu,

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,140
but the contents of the letter

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,540
seems to have been written by the culprit who killed him.

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,640
-The culprit? -Yeah.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,340
This is what is written in the letter.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,340
"Dear Heiji Hattori.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
I would like to see you, Mr. High School Detective

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,540
and confess the crime that I have committed.

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,640
But, even if I were to meet you,

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,340
I feel slightly doubtful whether you'd be able to visibly see me or not.

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,540
Why? Because I am a warped entity

31
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,240
that you people have made up on your own.

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,540
I'm an illusionary figure

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,940
that one cannot visibly see under normal circumstances.

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,740
Despite this, if you'd still like to see me,

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,840
I'll be waiting for you at the residence of the man

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
that I have killed during the night of the next full moon.

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,640
And, at the end of the letter,

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Mr. Wakamatsu's address in Osaka is written."

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,340
And along with...

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,940
the key of the house was inside, too!

41
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,640
If all cases were men,

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,240
all hidden mysteries are women.

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Heiji receives a letter and a key.

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
The mystery of the word that is carved on the tile!

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,840
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:58,501
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Eye)"

49
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:01,601
And?

50
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,701
Did you go to the house

51
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,801
where that ghost-like guy was waiting for you?

52
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:08,101
Of course I was planning to go and disclose his identity.

53
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,101
But I caught a cold.

54
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:12,801
Then she, without my permission took the key.

55
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,101
I went there in your place, Heiji!

56
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,901
-What? -You mean you went to

57
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,701
the haunted house all by yourself, Kazuha?

58
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,801
No. I took three friends along with me!

59
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:22,901
I persuaded them to come

60
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,901
saying that it was a game to test their courage.

61
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:27,901
Besides, it wasn't anything like a haunted house!

62
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,301
It seems that the late president

63
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,901
used to return to the house when he came back to Osaka.

64
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,101
The house was clean and neat, too.

65
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,301
The electricity was usable, too.

66
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,801
And? Was somebody waiting at that house?

67
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,801
Nope, there was no answer when we rang the doorbell.

68
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,001
So having no choice, I opened the door using the key

69
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,401
that I had with me and went inside,

70
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:50,001
but it was really fancy inside.

71
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,301
So although we went there thinking that

72
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,801
we were going to be testing our courage,

73
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,201
it turned out to be a visit to a gorgeous villa!

74
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,601
We decided to check out what the bath room looked like

75
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:00,101
and went to see it.

76
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,701
You took a look and?

77
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,401
An eerie looking long-haired person

78
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:07,501
was leaning against the wall of the bath room and sitting down!

79
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,901
What?

80
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,001
Did you talk to that person?

81
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,801
Before I even got a chance to talk to that person,

82
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,801
the lights went out.

83
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:17,501
I was talking over with my friends

84
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,101
whether we should call the police or not.

85
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,301
Then, we heard an eerie rustling noise.

86
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,601
We got scared and decided to leave the house right away then,

87
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,501
the lights suddenly turned back on.

88
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:31,101
And the person who there a moment ago was gone!

89
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,901
I'm sure the guy got away

90
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,001
after turning the lights off with remote control or something.

91
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:40,401
Well, if he's the only one who disappeared,

92
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,101
I wouldn't have come all the way to Tokyo!

93
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:44,601
There was a letter left behind at the bath room

94
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,401
where the guy disappeared.

95
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,701
A letter?

96
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:51,501
This is what seems to have been typed by a word processor.

97
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,801
"The only thing that disappeared is your physical body

98
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,201
and not the words!"

99
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,901
Words? What do you mean?

100
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,501
On the tile wall that the guy was leaning against, near his head,

101
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:05,401
it seems that there was a carving by a knife of something.

102
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,701
-Isn't that right? -Yep.

103
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,801
It was written in three letter of the alphabet.

104
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,401
Spelled "E-Y-E" was written largely!

105
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,901
E-Y-E?

106
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,701
Eye.

107
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,301
Eye...

108
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,101
Those letters disappeared along with the person,

109
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:24,101
and yet on the piece of paper it was written

110
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,001
that the word didn't disappear.

111
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,601
Then, maybe the tile was switched with a tile

112
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,901
from another place where there was no carving?

113
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:35,801
There were a lot of scratches on the bottom part of the tile wall.

114
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,301
Although I thought the same thing at first...

115
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,301
As for that tile,

116
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,601
the more you go from the top of the wall to below,

117
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,601
the color gradually got paler.

118
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,601
So if you switched the top tiles to those below,

119
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:49,201
it'd be obvious because the color would be different!

120
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,501
Did you go to see the tile too, Heiji?

121
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,701
Yeah.

122
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,801
But that house was scheduled for rebuilding construction from that day

123
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,801
and there were a lot of workers there.

124
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,201
They wouldn't let me inside the house.

125
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:06,201
Then, how long were the lights out in that house?

126
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,901
I think it lasted only less than 5 minutes.

127
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:12,701
If so, maybe a tile of the same color as the one

128
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,901
with the word carved on it was prepared beforehand.

129
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,801
I guess it'd be appropriate to think that

130
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:19,601
the guy switched the tiles in the dark

131
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:23,301
and took the tile with the word on it away with him.

132
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,401
But, why try such a stupid trick?

133
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,201
It's only natural to think that way, right?

134
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,901
But now we're getting to the main issue.

135
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:33,701
Mr. Wakamatsu who was stabbed to death in Karuizawa

136
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:36,401
was also found in a bath room with the same kind of tile,

137
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,901
but when he was first found,

138
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:42,901
there was a dying message that he had written in his own blood.

139
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:46,401
However, it seems when the police got there, it was gone.

140
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,601
A dying message disappeared?

141
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,301
There was blood on Mr. Wakamatsu's fingers

142
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,901
and it's obvious that he had written something,

143
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,701
so don't you think it's strange?

144
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:59,801
Could it be that the culprit who noticed it,

145
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:02,201
snuck back and wiped it off?

146
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:04,901
If so, there luminol reaction should've been found from the tiles

147
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,301
around Mr. Wakamatsu's fingers, right?

148
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:10,201
Then, maybe like the person that Kazuha and her friends saw,

149
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,901
the tiles were switched with ones that had no blood on them?

150
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,401
Well, just at that time,

151
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:18,401
Mr. Wakamatsu was in the midst of redoing the tiles himself,

152
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:21,101
and the glue didn't seem to have dried completely yet.

153
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,701
So, the tiles could've been switched.

154
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,801
But there it was the same as what Kazuha saw,

155
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:29,001
and the tiles gradually got paler towards the bottom.

156
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:33,001
So, if they were switched, it would be readily visible.

157
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:37,001
If that culprit erased the word using the same trick that Kazuha saw,

158
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:40,001
-wouldn't that be of concern? -Yes! It would!

159
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:44,101
So, I had Mom get me to go to Mr. Wakamatsu's main house in Tokyo

160
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:48,301
to ask about the incident,

161
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,001
but would you guy like to come along too?

162
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:52,201
Then, can I come along too?

163
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:55,601
Sorry, I promised that only five of us would go!

164
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,301
What?

165
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,201
It's better for you this way, right?

166
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,901
Sort of.

167
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,701
-Shoots. -Sorry about that.

168
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,401
My...

169
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:13,001
So, you're Shizuka's son, Heiji?

170
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:15,001
Is this the first time we've met?

171
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,301
Yeah.

172
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:20,101
My husband's always told me about you.

173
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,501
He used to say that you're really sharp despite your age.

174
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:26,001
He said that you're probably a good match

175
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:29,001
with another high school detective called Shinichi Kudo!

176
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:36,801
Well, if you ask me, this famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

177
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:40,401
their battle is like the kettle calling the black pot!

178
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,601
Hey, is dinner ready yet?

179
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,901
Ikuro.

180
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,901
I'm famished and on the verge of starving to death,

181
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:50,801
where's dinner?

182
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:52,801
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,201
The housekeeper went out to get some soy sauce,

184
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,001
so wait a little while more, okay?

185
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,101
Then, tell her this when she gets back!

186
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,901
To give me a bigger serving of dinner than the others!

187
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,901
-Is he your son? -Yes.

188
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:10,701
But I'm his step-mother, you see.

189
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:13,101
We remarried.

190
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:17,501
Oh? Guests?

191
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,701
He's the detective I told you about the other day

192
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,801
and his company.

193
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,801
I see.

194
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:25,901
But so many...

195
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,401
Is anything wrong?

196
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,901
Oh, no.

197
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:33,301
I bought some baumkuchen that's the president's favorite,

198
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,401
but I don't think there are enough pieces.

199
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,301
I guess it'll be fine,

200
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:41,201
because the president's dead and not here anymore.

201
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,301
I tasted a bit of it a while ago,

202
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,601
so I don't want any either.

203
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,501
Hey, Fujinami!

204
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,801
Uh, who are these people?

205
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,901
This is Mr. Masashige Shiina,

206
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,101
the head of our business affairs office

207
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:57,001
and chief designer, Mr. Sumio Fujinami!

208
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,701
Is Ms. Satake here?

209
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,901
Oh, yes.

210
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:04,201
Ikuro seems to be annoyed because he's hungry.

211
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:06,801
I think having some baumkuchen may calm him down,

212
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,501
so could you serve us some tea?

213
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,201
Sure.

214
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,601
Will the Prince of Wales brand

215
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:15,401
that the president used to like be all right?

216
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,801
Yes, that'll be fine.

217
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,801
I'll do so right away, ma'am.

218
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,101
Who is that woman?

219
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,801
She's Ms. Yoshimi Satake,

220
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,601
who used to be my husband's secretary.

221
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,801
But she works as my secretary now.

222
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:31,601
Since everyone who was at the villa

223
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:34,601
when my husband died is here except for the housekeeper,

224
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:38,601
so shall we talk over the day of the incident in the living room?

225
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,501
Did your husband like to do Sunday carpentry?

226
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,401
Yes. That's why despite my birthday party that day,

227
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:51,901
he said since they were tiles that he designed himself

228
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,401
and special ordered that he wanted to redo it himself.

229
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,901
Well, I don't think that president even imagined

230
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,801
something like that would happen to him, though.

231
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,501
Mr. Fujinami!

232
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,201
Yes, siree.

233
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,701
And, who first discovered his body?

234
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,501
That was...

235
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,901
Me!

236
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:12,001
I went to the bath room thinking to help master,

237
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,301
and found him lying on the floor smeared with blood.

238
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,701
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,301
I heard voices, so...

240
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:20,401
She's the housekeeper, Ms. Yonehara.

241
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:24,101
Then, you're the one who also saw the dying message in question?

242
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,901
Yes, sir.

243
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,601
And? What was written?

244
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,401
If you saw it before it disappeared, you remember, don't you?

245
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,001
Yes. If I remember correctly, it was written in alphabet.

246
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,401
Enough of that already!

247
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,701
It's going to spoil the taste of the baumkuchen!

248
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:41,401
Come on, cut it for me, will you?

249
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,201
Yes, sir.

250
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:45,201
I'm the one who should be doing the cutting!

251
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,201
Then, you cut the pieces, Ms. Yonehara.

252
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,501
And I'll put them on the plate.

253
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,301
-More than that... -Yes.

254
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:53,501
Since all the major members of the company are here,

255
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,101
let's talk about the next would-be president!

256
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,901
Right now, Mom,

257
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:03,501
the vice-president is serving as temporary substitute president,

258
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:07,201
but how about jumping a flight of stairs and appointing me as president?

259
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:09,001
Although I'm just an ordinary employee now,

260
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,901
I'm going to eventually take after my Dad

261
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:14,801
and become the president.

262
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,801
That's right, isn't it, Mother?

263
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,501
Yes.

264
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,101
No problem, then!

265
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:27,101
Make me president!

266
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:30,901
That's most likely what my late Dad wants too.

267
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,901
Hey! Don't eat it before it's put on the plate.

268
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,701
Idiot! Eating it like this is...

269
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,601
Ikuro!

270
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,201
Ikuro!

271
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,401
Don't move!

272
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,501
Until I, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri tell you it's okay,

273
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,801
don't anybody move!

274
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,201
But...

275
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:07,401
these two young men have already...

276
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:09,901
No good. He's already dead.

277
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,401
-What? -What?

278
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:14,201
It seems to be a cyanide hydrogen type of toxin.

279
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,501
Which means that

280
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:19,201
it could've been in the baumkuchen that he ate a while ago.

281
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:20,901
Ran and the others!

282
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,701
Don't eat the baumkuchen that was served a while ago, okay?

283
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:25,601
Yeah.

284
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,001
Kazuha, get on the phone!

285
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,801
-And call the police? -Yeah!

286
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,701
Tell them that the idiot who had the nerve to kill a person

287
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,701
right in front of a detective is here!

288
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,910
The victim is Ikuro Wakamatsu, age 25.

289
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,910
He's the son of company president Kyohei Wakamatsu

290
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,510
of a design company who died last month in Karuizawa.

291
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,910
Is that correct?

292
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,110
Yes.

293
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,710
But, just when was the poison put into the baumkuchen?

294
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,710
I don't know when,

295
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,410
but it seems that the poison was put into a capsule.

296
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,510
-Huh? -See.

297
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,310
There's a capsule like thing at the bottom of the teacup!

298
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,110
Though it's pretty melted.

299
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,810
The culprit probably cracked the capsule

300
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,510
and sprinkled the poison onto the baumkuchen,

301
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,810
and while we were distracted by the corpse,

302
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,310
he sunk the capsule into the teacup.

303
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,710
Once it melts, you can't get fingerprints from it.

304
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,010
Which means that

305
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,610
the person who was near the teacup is the culprit?

306
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,410
But when everyone was told to stay away from the corpse,

307
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,410
everybody gathered over to this table.

308
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,310
So anybody who was in this room at that time

309
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,510
could've put the capsule with the poison inside the cup, no?

310
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,510
It... It's not me!

311
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,510
I didn't go near the baumkuchen even once.

312
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,510
Moreover, that teacup is mine.

313
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,110
Then, who cut the baumkuchen into divided pieces?

314
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,910
I'm the one who cut it.

315
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,310
As for putting the pieces on the plate,

316
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,810
I had Ms. Satake help me.

317
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,110
I cut the baumkuchen into 8 pieces as she told me.

318
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,210
Divide into eight?

319
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,710
I wanted it divided into eight because there are 5 guests,

320
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,310
Mrs. Wakamatsu, and her son Ikuro.

321
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,910
Plus Mr. Shiina, the managing director who loves sweets.

322
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,010
The managing director's the one who bought the baumkuchen,

323
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,810
and I thought that if we cut it into more pieces,

324
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,610
the pieces would be too small.

325
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,510
So you're the one who bought it?

326
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,010
Yes, sir.

327
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,610
The late president and I loved the baumkuchen of that shop,

328
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,010
so I always bring it along when I come here.

329
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,410
I had Mr. Fujinami stop by

330
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,710
at the shop on our way here by car today, too.

331
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,110
Come to think of it,

332
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,810
you were saying that you picked on the baumkuchen, didn't you?

333
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,710
I just took a really small piece!

334
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,410
I was in the car and waiting in front of the cake shop

335
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,710
when the managing director handed me the box of baumkuchen

336
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,110
saying that he forgot to get the receipt

337
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,710
and went back into the shop.

338
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,010
So, I just got a bit playful while waiting

339
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,210
-and picked on a little piece. -Right!

340
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,410
Mine was a little broken off!

341
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,610
In other words,

342
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,910
you could've sprinkled poison on the entire baumkuchen?

343
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,310
Then, are you saying that the poison

344
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,310
was sprinkled on the entire baumkuchen,

345
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,910
and that Ikuro just happened to eat it before the others?

346
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,910
No, it was a logical consequence!

347
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,610
It seems that Ikuro was really hungry, you see.

348
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,310
But even if it were to be so,

349
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,610
it wouldn't be necessary to drop the capsule into the teacup then.

350
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,610
-It's fake! -Fake?

351
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,110
It was set to make it look as if the poison was sprinkled on here,

352
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,610
so that the one who couldn't come near the baumkuchen

353
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,110
wouldn't be suspected.

354
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,510
Isn't that right?

355
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,910
If so, would I from my side go

356
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,610
and tell you that I picked on it?

357
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,010
Besides, after we got here and I was parking the car into the garage,

358
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,410
the managing director took the baumkuchen into the house first,

359
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,110
so he also had the chance to lace it with poison.

360
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,310
In the first place,

361
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,710
we didn't know that the stupid brat was hungry,

362
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,410
so why would we do something as crazy as

363
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,810
to sprinkle poison over the entire baumkuchen?

364
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,610
I mean, if someone else ate it first,

365
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,610
that person would die, right?

366
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,010
By the way, why was Ikuro so hungry?

367
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,910
I went out to buy soy sauce that we ran out of,

368
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,410
so dinner was delayed.

369
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,210
Who else knew that he was hungry?

370
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,010
The secretary Ms. Satake, Ms. Yonehara the housekeeper,

371
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,010
and I could've all figured out that he was hungry, no?

372
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,710
Yes.

373
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,710
If I remember correctly, Ikuro grabbed 1 piece of baumkuchen

374
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,410
out of the two that were on the tray and ate it.

375
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,710
-But does he always eat like that? -Yes.

376
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,410
He says that it tastes better that way.

377
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,010
So he doesn't use a fork even when he eats shortcake.

378
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,110
Don't tell me that somebody who wanted

379
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,310
to make Ikuro who was greedy over food,

380
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,610
take a big piece, cut a bit piece

381
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,010
and sprinkled poison on that piece?

382
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,510
I cut it into 8 even pieces!

383
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,910
The pieces that I served all of you

384
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,010
were cut into same size pieces, weren't they?

385
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,210
At any rate, we're going to be checking

386
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,110
the left-over baumkuchen and teacups in detail from now,

387
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,610
so after you're done having your body checked,

388
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,310
please wait in another room.

389
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,710
But, what shall I do?

390
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,410
The deadline for the orders of the designs we received

391
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,610
is at the end of this month,

392
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,410
and yet after what happened to Ikuro...

393
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,910
At this rate, I guess we won't be able to go home tonight.

394
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,210
No joke.

395
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,510
And I've still got unfinished work to take care of.

396
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,110
I also have a document

397
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,610
that I need you to sign and seal, vice-president.

398
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,810
And I sent the characters, colors and designs

399
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,410
that were chosen to the computer here,

400
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,310
but did you take a look at it?

401
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,810
I told you to print things like that out

402
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,510
and then show it to me, didn't I?

403
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,110
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,610
The president used to tell me to do so, that's why I...

405
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,710
The computer here has a different operating system from mine,

406
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,910
so I can't use it.

407
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,410
Well, I'll look at it on the monitor together

408
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,910
with the managing director later,

409
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,410
so let me know which file it is!

410
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,310
-Yes, ma'am. -Talking of the president...

411
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,310
What that stupid son of his said a while ago, was he serious?

412
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,910
About him taking over the company eventually

413
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,810
because he was blood related to the president?

414
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,810
-I was also surprised. -Me too.

415
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,310
I wonder... I think he just believed that it would be so.

416
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,010
Either way, I had no intention

417
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,410
to work under that stupid son, so thank God.

418
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,910
Hey, you guys!

419
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,010
Please, that's enough!

420
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,510
A person has passed away, you know!

421
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,910
It's true that Ikuro wasn't much liked by everyone,

422
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,910
but it's a fact that he was killed by someone!

423
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,510
Moreover, the one who killed him could be among us, do you get it?

424
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,610
Will you all please be more considerate of

425
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,410
the situation that we're under right now?

426
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,710
Do you understand the situation at all?

427
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,310
Serving everyone tea again

428
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,510
when somebody was poisoned to death.

429
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,110
I served the tea while the officer was looking on!

430
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,410
If you still think that there's poison in it, don't drink it!

431
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,610
Why you...

432
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,110
We were only part way through that story in question.

433
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,410
The story in question?

434
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,310
The one about the case last month where the president was killed

435
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,710
and found in the bath room of his villa in Karuizawa.

436
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,510
You were the first one to find him, weren't you?

437
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,310
Yes.

438
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,210
Back then, there should've been a dying message

439
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,910
that the president wrote with his own blood.

440
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,310
But when the police got there, it was gone, right?

441
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,810
If I remember correctly,

442
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,310
you said that you remember that word that disappeared.

443
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,510
I remember you said something about it being an alphabet.

444
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,610
Don't tell me that the alphabets were...

445
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,010
"E-Y-E"?

446
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,010
E-Y-E?

447
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,410
It's probably referring to "eyes"!

448
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,910
I saw it, too!

449
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,410
I was contacted by the culprit who said he killed the president,

450
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,910
who told me to come to the president's residence in Osaka.

451
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,710
That's when I saw the eerie three letters that disappeared!

452
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,510
My... At that house in Osaka?

453
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,110
That's why we came all the way out here to hear more about it.

454
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,610
But, what I saw was...

455
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,810
the alphabet "S"!

456
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,810
There seemed to be continuation of something else,

457
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,310
but it covered by his hand and I couldn't see it.

458
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,210
"S", was it?

459
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,010
Hey! Hold it!

460
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,610
The managing director Mr. Masashige Shiina

461
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,510
as well as Chief designer Mr. Masuo Fujinami,

462
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,610
the secretary Ms. Yoshiimi Satake,

463
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,610
and the president's wife Mrs. Serika Wakamatsu,

464
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,010
all have either names or last names

465
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,910
starting with the letter "S"!

466
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,510
My name is Sakurako, so it also starts with "S".

467
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,910
What?

468
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,110
The dying message that disappeared...

469
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,810
The letter "S" written with blood,

470
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,510
what on earth are they indicating?

471
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,210
"Next Episode" -Isn't the officer with the wounded eye

472
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,910
that we met during the Fuurinkazan incident there?

473
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,910
Oh, you mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

474
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,210
I heard nothing of the tile at the crime site being like this.

475
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,110
The day the case was closed,

476
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,110
Yui seemed to have confessed to Inspector Yamato, besides.

477
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,510
It's strange that after she confessed,

478
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,410
nothing occurred after that!

479
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:35,010
Next Conan, "Design of Poison and Illusion (S)"

480
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,210
Next Conan's Hint:

481
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,110
"Tile"

482
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,010
It seems that people are excited over gifts over the phone.

483
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,910
This week King Kazu is appearing on our show!
