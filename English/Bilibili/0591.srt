1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.140
What exactly does that mean?

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.940
"Sunday" -To have constructed an aquarium in the house?

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.740
Mr. Nishida is a famous aquarium designer

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.240
so maybe he has a huge fish tank in his house.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.440
Aku... akurimu?

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.240
Then, does that mean it's a new type of ice cream?

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.040
It's "a-ku-a-ri-u-mu". It means aquarium.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.440
An architect who designs aquariums.

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.740
The house of a person who makes aquariums?

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.440
I wonder what the house will be like!

11
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.940
I'm nervous!

12
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.740
Brooding over passing seasons

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.540
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

14
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.240
Even the fish are freaked out

15
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.340
in the house with an aquarium.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.240
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:20.546
"The House with an Aquarium".

20
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:28.346
"Nishida, Aquarium Design Office"

21
00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:30.146
Maybe he isn't home?

22
00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:31.846
That's strange.

23
00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:35.346
We definitely agreed on 12:00.

24
00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:41.746
Dr. Agasa?

25
00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:43.046
Mr. Imura.

26
00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:44.646
"Kousuke Imura (32), Nishida's Assistant" -It's been a while.

27
00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:48.646
Oh, is Nishida not in?

28
00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:53.946
He promised to show me the interior of his house today.

29
00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:56.546
So that's why the kids are here too?

30
00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:57.646
Good afternoon.

31
00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:00.346
I'm Nishida's assistant, Imura.

32
00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.446
Hello...

33
00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:07.046
Nishida probably went out to buy something.

34
00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:09.546
Here, I'll get us in with the spare key.

35
00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:14.246
Here, come in.

36
00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:16.546
Thank you, Mr. Imura.

37
00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:18.246
By the way, your clothes...

38
00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:20.546
Did you come back from a trip somewhere?

39
00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:22.646
I went to tour Guam.

40
00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:24.846
I left there last night.

41
00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:27.946
I arrived in Narita just this morning.

42
00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:29.846
I'm a little behind on sleep.

43
00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.346
Awesome.

44
00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.546
This is fantastic!

45
00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:54.546
A pirate ship!

46
00:03:57.346 --> 00:04:00.346
This fish has a pointy mouth!

47
00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:03.346
That's the Caribbean Longsnout,

48
00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:06.146
it's part of the family of butterflyfish who lives in the Caribbean Sea.

49
00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.246
Caribbean Sea?

50
00:04:09.246 --> 00:04:10.846
What's this?

51
00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.846
There's a fish with weird markings on it.

52
00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:17.846
That's a species of pufferfish that live in the Indian Ocean.

53
00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:21.746
I wonder if there are Indian eels.

54
00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:24.246
So pretty!

55
00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:31.346
There are really rare! Black clownfish!

56
00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:33.846
Those are from Australia.

57
00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.846
Look at that, Ai. All the pretty fish!

58
00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.846
Yeah, just like jewels.

59
00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:44.246
You're romantic for a change.

60
00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.646
I wonder how much electric bill per month is spent

61
00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:49.146
on just the aquariums.

62
00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:51.146
They're certainly living jewels, aren't they?

63
00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.546
Come on.

64
00:04:52.546 --> 00:04:56.446
Hey, there isn't anything in that tank.

65
00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:57.746
Oh, no!

66
00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:03.146
Genta, what happened?

67
00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:05.346
The roof came off!

68
00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:06.946
Give me a break.

69
00:05:35.146 --> 00:05:37.346
This glue doesn't dry easily,

70
00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:39.446
so don't touch the miniature.

71
00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:40.846
All right.

72
00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:42.846
That's right!

73
00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.246
Chocolates from Guam, anyone?

74
00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:51.646
Gum chocolate? What's that?

75
00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:53.346
It's Guam, Gu-a-m.

76
00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:55.246
Me, I want some!

77
00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:57.646
Before that, wash your hands.

78
00:05:57.646 --> 00:05:59.246
Yes...

79
00:06:01.146 --> 00:06:02.846
This is spacious!

80
00:06:02.846 --> 00:06:04.746
How nice.

81
00:06:11.446 --> 00:06:12.546
What was that?

82
00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:15.846
Hey, what happened?

83
00:06:15.846 --> 00:06:17.946
Conan...

84
00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:22.546
Ni... Nishida?

85
00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:24.246
Master!

86
00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:26.346
No... no way!

87
00:06:27.646 --> 00:06:30.646
Are you two all right?

88
00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:31.946
Yes.

89
00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:35.046
Mr. Imura, hurry, call an ambulance!

90
00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:36.046
Yes.

91
00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.546
It's regrettable,

92
00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:42.346
but he's already gone.

93
00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:44.046
It's best to call the police as well.

94
00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:46.046
What?

95
00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.446
This person

96
00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:50.446
has a mark like an insect bite on the nape of his neck.

97
00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.246
What exactly...

98
00:06:55.246 --> 00:06:56.546
What's that?

99
00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:01.346
You can't stay here.

100
00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:02.846
Just a little...

101
00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:06.746
Come, let's go.

102
00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:09.046
No! Just a second!

103
00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:14.746
In short, at 12:30 pm today,

104
00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:16.346
you discovered Nishida's body

105
00:07:16.346 --> 00:07:18.946
submerged in the bathtub, right?

106
00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:21.046
That's correct.

107
00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:22.646
What's the condition of the body?

108
00:07:22.646 --> 00:07:25.146
There are no conspicuous external wounds,

109
00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:27.246
and the cause of death is drowning.

110
00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.546
Judging from the extent of the rigor mortis,

111
00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:34.346
Mr. Nishida most likely passed away Friday night.

112
00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:37.646
With today being Sunday,

113
00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:39.646
that gives us two days.

114
00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:44.446
There's a bottle brandy and a glass on the work desk.

115
00:07:44.446 --> 00:07:47.546
He took a bath after drinking?

116
00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:49.346
As he was drunk,

117
00:07:49.346 --> 00:07:51.746
he probably fell asleep while bathing

118
00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.846
and drowned.

119
00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:55.246
I suppose so.

120
00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:57.346
Mr. Nishida is a strange person, isn't he?

121
00:07:57.346 --> 00:07:59.046
What?

122
00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:02.746
Well, Mr. Nishida took bath at night, didn't he?

123
00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:04.446
But he didn't even turn on the light

124
00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:07.746
and bathed in complete darkness.

125
00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:09.246
You are right.

126
00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:11.846
If he took a bath on Friday night,

127
00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:13.946
the light should have been on, but...

128
00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:15.146
Hold on!

129
00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:17.946
Say, don't you think this is strange too?

130
00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:21.346
That's glue on his fingertip, isn't it?

131
00:08:22.446 --> 00:08:25.246
It looks that way.

132
00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:26.446
Wait! Conan!

133
00:08:29.146 --> 00:08:32.246
Applying glue onto miniatures,

134
00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:34.046
is a very delicate task

135
00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.346
that requires using needles of a syringe.

136
00:08:36.346 --> 00:08:39.446
It's amazing that Mr. Nishida had complete control of his hands.

137
00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:42.946
Normally, when one is drunk,

138
00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:45.946
it would be impossible to do something this demanding.

139
00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:49.246
We should have forensics determine

140
00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:53.246
exactly how drunk Mr. Nishida was when he died.

141
00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:54.946
Yes, sir!

142
00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:56.746
Could you conduct the test to determine

143
00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:58.346
the level of alcohol content in his blood first?

144
00:08:58.346 --> 00:08:59.646
Roger, sir!

145
00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:04.346
Also, confirm Mr. Imura's alibi since he has a spare key.

146
00:09:04.346 --> 00:09:05.446
Understood.

147
00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:09.846
My apologies,

148
00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:14.346
but could you tell us where you were Friday night?

149
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.846
Isn't it an accident?

150
00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:19.146
This is merely a formality.

151
00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:24.346
I was on an overseas trip to Guam on Friday night.

152
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:28.446
I was shooting on both Friday and Saturday night, so...

153
00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:31.146
The shooting range should have a record of it.

154
00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:34.546
Incidentally, when did this trip start and end?

155
00:09:34.546 --> 00:09:36.846
I left on Thursday night

156
00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:39.646
and returned to Narita this morning.

157
00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:44.946
I believe you can confirm that with my passport.

158
00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:49.146
-Here it is. -Excuse me.

159
00:09:52.446 --> 00:09:56.046
I see you left Guam on Saturday night.

160
00:09:56.046 --> 00:09:57.846
Thank you for your cooperation.

161
00:09:57.846 --> 00:09:59.346
You're not supposed to touch!

162
00:10:00.646 --> 00:10:02.946
I thought it should be dry by now.

163
00:10:02.946 --> 00:10:05.446
Geez, Genta.

164
00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:09.646
Hey, hey. He said the glue didn't dry easily, didn't he?

165
00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:12.646
I wonder how long it'll take to dry.

166
00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:17.646
Well, this is a special type that can dry in water,

167
00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:21.646
so it'd probably take about 12 hours or so to completely dry.

168
00:10:21.646 --> 00:10:23.246
12 hours?

169
00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:28.646
The glue on the body's fingertips wasn't dry yet.

170
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.746
If Mr. Nishida died on Friday night,

171
00:10:32.746 --> 00:10:36.246
it is strange that the glue hasn't dried.

172
00:10:36.246 --> 00:10:38.346
Conan, this is bad!

173
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.246
What is it, Ayumi?

174
00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:42.046
All the shrimps are dead.

175
00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.246
What?

176
00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:46.646
I thought they weren't keeping anything in this tank.

177
00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:52.646
The shrimps are there to control the water quality.

178
00:10:52.646 --> 00:10:55.546
I wonder why they're dead.

179
00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:59.246
The shrimps here are a different species from the ones over there.

180
00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:02.046
The lower part of their legs is white.

181
00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:05.846
The water quality and environment of every tank seems to be different

182
00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:08.546
so the species are probably placed in them accordingly.

183
00:11:16.746 --> 00:11:18.046
Could it be...

184
00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:20.546
Ayumi!

185
00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.246
There are live baby jellyfish!

186
00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:26.446
It's true! Baby jellyfish!

187
00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:27.646
Jellyfish?

188
00:11:43.546 --> 00:11:46.146
I see, so that's how it was.

189
00:11:47.846 --> 00:11:49.846
This wasn't an accident,

190
00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:52.446
but an ingeniously planned murder!

191
00:11:57.051 --> 00:11:58.651
Inspector.

192
00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.451
The blood test report is in.

193
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:06.851
The alcohol content in Mr. Nishida's blood was 0.40%.

194
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.751
0.40%?

195
00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:14.051
Usually, that's the state bordering unconsciousness.

196
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:18.951
The fingerprints found on the glass matched Mr. Nishida's.

197
00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:20.951
With this, we can conclude that we were right.

198
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:25.251
Mr. Nishida went to bathe even after he became drunk

199
00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:27.151
and eventually drowned.

200
00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:29.451
An accident due to carelessness.

201
00:12:29.451 --> 00:12:30.751
I suppose so.

202
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:35.851
That's why I advised him not to drink so much.

203
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:37.351
Hold on!

204
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:42.951
Mr. Nishida didn't drink any alcohol before he died.

205
00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:44.551
-What? -What?

206
00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:46.751
On the nape of Mr. Nishida's neck,

207
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:50.151
there's a small spot that resembles an insect bite, isn't there?

208
00:12:50.151 --> 00:12:53.551
That's the mark left behind from an injection.

209
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:55.351
First, the culprit,

210
00:12:55.351 --> 00:12:59.651
snuck up on Mr. Nishida, who was working on the miniature.

211
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:03.451
He used chemicals to put Mr. Nishida to sleep.

212
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:07.951
Afterwards, he used the syringe,

213
00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:11.451
and injected the alcohol directly into his blood-stream

214
00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:13.551
through the nape of Mr. Nishida's neck.

215
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:18.751
In this way, alcohol would be detected in the body's blood,

216
00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:22.751
and it would look as if Mr. Nishida was wasted from alcohol and died.

217
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:26.651
Afterwards, the culprit submerged the unconscious Mr. Nishida

218
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:30.051
in the bathtub and drowned him.

219
00:13:31.551 --> 00:13:33.351
Isn't that so?

220
00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:34.451
Mr. Imura!

221
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:38.351
What about me?

222
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:40.051
Confess.

223
00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:45.051
I already know you're the culprit who killed Mr. Nishida.

224
00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:49.451
I was in Guam on Friday night when Mr. Nishida died.

225
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.751
No, that's false.

226
00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:54.651
Mr. Nishida wasn't killed on Friday night.

227
00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:59.151
It was probably on Thursday,

228
00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:01.651
the day, before you left for Guam.

229
00:14:01.651 --> 00:14:05.251
That's why the bathroom light wasn't on.

230
00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:08.851
Sunlight was already flooding in through the large windows.

231
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:11.951
That caused you to simply forget to switch on the light, didn't it?

232
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.751
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:18.451
Didn't the police say Mr. Nishida's time of death was Friday night?

234
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:20.851
That's where your trick comes in.

235
00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:24.951
You cooled the body to delay the time of death, didn't you?

236
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.051
Cooled the body?

237
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:30.251
The glue on the body's fingertips

238
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:32.551
had yet to dry, hadn't it?

239
00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:33.851
It's because under low temperatures,

240
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:36.851
it's difficult for the glue to dry.

241
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:38.751
Since the body was cooled,

242
00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:42.151
the glue couldn't dry.

243
00:14:42.151 --> 00:14:44.951
It... it's true that the time of death

244
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.751
can be delayed by cooling the body,

245
00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:50.851
but how do you cool the body?

246
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:53.551
Before I explain the method,

247
00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:57.151
I have to first explain the tanks in this house.

248
00:14:57.151 --> 00:14:58.851
Tanks?

249
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:04.851
Now, a question for the kids.

250
00:15:05.951 --> 00:15:09.051
In the tank with the pirate ship miniature,

251
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:14.851
there was Caribbean Longsnout from the Caribbean Sea.

252
00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:17.251
Do you know why?

253
00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.051
Why?

254
00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:22.151
As for the tank with the pufferfish from the Indian Ocean,

255
00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:26.451
why was the miniature of the Taj Mahal placed there?

256
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:27.851
I see.

257
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:30.951
The ocean that the fish is from in the tank

258
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:34.551
is represented by the miniature inside.

259
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.051
I see!

260
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:37.351
There was a movie that told

261
00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:39.451
the story of pirates in the Caribbean sea, wasn't there?

262
00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:41.751
That's why the tank with the pirate ship

263
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.451
has fish from the Caribbean sea!

264
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:48.051
The Taj Mahal is a famous temple in India!

265
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:51.351
That means fish from the India Ocean are kept in that tank, right?

266
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:55.351
Then, the tank with the pyramid has fish from the desert?

267
00:15:55.351 --> 00:15:57.051
Not quite.

268
00:15:57.051 --> 00:16:00.551
Those fish are likely from the Red Sea, which is in Egypt.

269
00:16:00.551 --> 00:16:03.951
The Opera House is a building in Australia,

270
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:07.051
so that's the tank for fish from Australia!

271
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:09.151
That's right.

272
00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:13.851
And the miniature that was supposed to be placed in this tank is

273
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:16.851
that clock tower from Sapporo!

274
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.451
Sapporo?

275
00:16:18.451 --> 00:16:21.751
In other words, the fish that was supposed to be kept in the tank,

276
00:16:21.751 --> 00:16:23.451
were not tropical fish,

277
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:25.351
but instead, fish from the sea around Hokkaido,

278
00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.151
probably those from the Sea of Okhotsk!

279
00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:29.851
I see.

280
00:16:29.851 --> 00:16:34.751
But how exactly is that related to the case?

281
00:16:34.751 --> 00:16:37.651
Try touching the glass of the tank.

282
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:45.651
-It's cold! -Like ice.

283
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:51.651
The Sea of Okhotsk is a cold sea in the north.

284
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:53.951
To house the fish that come from there,

285
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:57.851
it's necessary to keep the temperature low.

286
00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.651
In other words, there should be

287
00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:03.651
a cooler in that tank to lower the water temperature.

288
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:09.151
This... this should be it, right?

289
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:11.651
Mr. Imura used the cooler

290
00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:13.551
to cool the water in the bathtub,

291
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:15.451
so as to keep the body's temperature low,

292
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.551
hence delaying the estimated time of death.

293
00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:20.151
-What'd you say? -What'd you say?

294
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:22.851
Look carefully inside the tank.

295
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:27.051
There's evidence showing that the cooler was used to cool the body.

296
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:32.451
Could they be...

297
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:34.851
Contact lens?

298
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:38.551
Yes, that would be Mr. Nishida's contact lens.

299
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:43.051
The contact lens case in the washroom is empty.

300
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:47.351
As for why the contact lens would be in the tank,

301
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:51.151
it's probably because Mr. Imura, who returned from Guam this morning,

302
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:55.051
came to this house before we arrived.

303
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:57.051
This is because he had to put the cooler,

304
00:17:57.051 --> 00:18:01.351
which had been used to cool the body, back into the original tank.

305
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:05.051
However, on the cooler bar that was in the bathtub,

306
00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.951
the contact lens that had dropped out

307
00:18:06.951 --> 00:18:10.151
from Mr. Nishida's eye was stuck on it.

308
00:18:10.151 --> 00:18:14.751
Not noticing it, Mr. Imura returned the cooler to the tank.

309
00:18:14.751 --> 00:18:18.051
Hence the contact lens that was stuck on the bar

310
00:18:18.051 --> 00:18:21.251
fell into the tank.

311
00:18:21.251 --> 00:18:24.351
All the shrimp in that tank died

312
00:18:24.351 --> 00:18:26.851
because you took away the cooler

313
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:28.951
and allowed the water temperature to rise.

314
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:32.151
Shrimp are highly susceptible to changes in water temperature.

315
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:35.451
I didn't come to the house this morning!

316
00:18:35.451 --> 00:18:37.651
I came in for the first time with you, Doctor,

317
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:39.151
when I met you at the door.

318
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:42.451
Do you remember the newspaper, Mr. Imura?

319
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:44.051
Newspaper?

320
00:18:44.051 --> 00:18:48.251
When you saw the mailbox full of newspapers,

321
00:18:48.251 --> 00:18:50.951
you didn't appear to be very surprised at all.

322
00:18:51.851 --> 00:18:56.151
That's because you knew that Mr. Nishida was dead, right?

323
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:00.951
You acted as though you met us at the door by coincidence,

324
00:19:00.951 --> 00:19:05.751
and let us in to discover the body.

325
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:06.951
That's absurd!

326
00:19:06.951 --> 00:19:08.351
That's just your wild guess!

327
00:19:08.351 --> 00:19:10.751
There isn't any evidence!

328
00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:13.551
Well, let's show you the evidence!

329
00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:14.551
What?

330
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:15.651
Mr. Tome.

331
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:20.351
Will you please conduct the test Conan required just now?

332
00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:21.551
Roger.

333
00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:34.751
Gunpowder reaction!

334
00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:36.251
Gunpowder reaction?

335
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:38.651
When you fire a gun,

336
00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:41.051
gunpowder will fly in all directions!

337
00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:44.551
Later, once sprayed with nitrous acid,

338
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.151
the gunpowder on clothes and furniture will react,

339
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:49.551
and turn a purplish red.

340
00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:54.051
Oh, yeah.

341
00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:57.251
You said when you left Guam on Saturday night,

342
00:19:57.251 --> 00:20:00.851
you were firing guns at the shooting range, weren't you?

343
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:03.951
When you returned the cooler to the tank,

344
00:20:03.951 --> 00:20:06.951
it must have touched the gunpowder on your clothes.

345
00:20:11.951 --> 00:20:13.251
Excuse me.

346
00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:20.751
Darn it! Why did it?

347
00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:22.651
I thought it was perfect.

348
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:24.851
The alibi that you worked so hard to create

349
00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:27.251
has become the evidence that revealed your crime.

350
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:30.751
Why? Why did you kill Mr. Nishida?

351
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:33.451
I thought you respected him?

352
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:35.851
I did, until five years ago.

353
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:39.151
He was a genius aquarium designer.

354
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:43.251
I really... I really respected him.

355
00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:45.351
Until five years ago?

356
00:20:45.351 --> 00:20:47.551
What exactly does that mean?

357
00:20:47.551 --> 00:20:51.851
Nishida stopped coming up with designs five years ago.

358
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.251
He'd used up his talent.

359
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:56.351
That's why in the last five years,

360
00:20:56.351 --> 00:21:00.051
all of his works were actually designed by me.

361
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.251
By you?

362
00:21:01.251 --> 00:21:02.951
Right.

363
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:06.151
I have been Nishida's shadow.

364
00:21:06.151 --> 00:21:08.851
But it was fine with me.

365
00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:10.251
Under the name of the genius designer,

366
00:21:10.251 --> 00:21:12.351
as long as I could design what I liked!

367
00:21:12.351 --> 00:21:14.951
I was content being merely a shadow

368
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:17.651
because I respected Nishida!

369
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:18.851
But then,

370
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:21.851
when Nishida discovered talented people from the younger generation,

371
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:25.051
he discarded me and used them instead.

372
00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:26.651
I couldn't forgive him!

373
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:29.351
I had dedicated so much to him,

374
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:31.351
and yet he cast me aside so readily.

375
00:21:31.351 --> 00:21:34.251
If he was going to abandon me,

376
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:37.451
then I decided to abandon him instead!

377
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:40.151
Or so I thought...

378
00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:10.051
"One week later" -The fish were so cute!

379
00:23:10.051 --> 00:23:12.151
They were so pretty!

380
00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:14.851
The big shark was really cool!

381
00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:17.551
Those schools of sardines were great too!

382
00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:19.251
Instead of that,

383
00:23:19.251 --> 00:23:20.951
I'm hungry.

384
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:22.551
Now that you mention it...

385
00:23:22.551 --> 00:23:26.151
It's already 2:00 in the afternoon.

386
00:23:26.151 --> 00:23:28.251
Let's go eat something.

387
00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:30.251
All right!

388
00:23:30.251 --> 00:23:32.251
What would you like to eat?

389
00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:36.051
Grilled eel!

390
00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:37.851
Sashimi would be nice!

391
00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:39.651
I wanna eat sushi!

392
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:40.951
Hey, hey.

393
00:23:40.951 --> 00:23:44.751
You're going to eat the fish that you just said were cute?

394
00:23:44.751 --> 00:23:46.951
You don't say...

395
00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:49.151
"Next Episode"

396
00:23:49.151 --> 00:23:50.651
So, it's a play on words tori otoko (Rooster Man)

397
00:23:50.651 --> 00:23:53.651
and mono tori (thief). That's why he's called Rooster Man?

398
00:23:53.651 --> 00:23:56.051
Rooster Man is really a turn-off, isn't it?

399
00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:58.951
Why are you guys here again?

400
00:23:58.951 --> 00:24:01.251
We came to get the love oracle!

401
00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:04.151
Nine?

402
00:24:05.951 --> 00:24:07.851
Not a bird, but a monkey.

403
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:09.551
Nine...

404
00:24:09.551 --> 00:24:11.551
What exactly is it?

405
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:12.951
Next Conan,

406
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:16.951
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 1)".

407
00:24:17.778 --> 00:24:20.178
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:20.178 --> 00:24:22.378
"Button".

409
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:23.378
The kind that you push, isn't it?

410
00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:24.378
The other kind.

411
00:24:24.378 --> 00:24:26.878
The kind that comes falling to the bottom-windfall.
