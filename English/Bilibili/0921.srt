1
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.570
Thank you so much for towing our car.

2
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.470
The mechanic will have an easier time finding your car

3
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.270
"Ryohei Saeki (24)" -at the station up ahead

4
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.670
than in the middle of the mountains.

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.170
We were planning on stopping there to pick up groceries anyway.

6
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.170
Are you guys going camping?

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.370
"Takahiro Komada (22)" -Our college lab

8
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.170
always goes camping together.

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.970
"Shoji Goto (50)" -Our professor enjoys this kind of thing.

10
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.870
"Haruka Inoue (23)" -Komada, you should get a smartphone already.

11
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.170
I will once this one breaks.

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.170
It takes too long to exchange data with you.

13
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.070
Try putting yourself in our shoes.

14
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.770
Sorry.

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.070
Oh, right.

16
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.370
This time we're also celebrating

17
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.370
the publication of our professor's paper.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.570
Really? That's amazing.

19
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.770
The world must be ending

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770
if that perverted drunkard is being recognized.

21
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.170
Haruka, he'll hear you.

22
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.670
He won't wake up.

23
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.870
He always gets like this when he's drunk.

24
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.570
Besides, it's not like you guys like the professor either.

25
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.770
Hey, what are you talking about?

26
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.670
Maybe you all actually think,

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.470
if only the professor would disappear from this world.

28
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.970
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

29
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.970
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.970
The conversation inside the car is rather ominous!

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.070
I hope nothing happens!

32
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.570
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.770
His name is Detective Conan!

35
00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.869
"The Murderous Carpool"

36
00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.769
Thank you so much.

37
00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.369
Excuse me. These are for you.

38
00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.069
You didn't need to.

39
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.169
I wanted to thank you for your help.

40
00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.269
Where's your friend?

41
00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.469
Saeki? He's over there.

42
00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.169
Looks like we're leaving soon.

43
00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.769
We should go.

44
00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.369
Hey, wait.

45
00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.569
Mouri, are you all right?

46
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.369
Yes, thanks to you.

47
00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:28.769
That's good.

48
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.369
Saeki, I'm putting some bags in the car.

49
00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:33.269
Oh, thanks.

50
00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:35.269
I was just thinking about bringing the car around...

51
00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.369
Professor?

52
00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:41.869
Professor, are you all right?

53
00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.269
Darn it! His phone's stuck!

54
00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:52.969
What should we do?

55
00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.369
What happened?

56
00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:57.469
His phone was stuck.

57
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.769
The strap was caught on his neck.

58
00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.269
He's dead.

59
00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.269
Did something happen?

60
00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:07.669
Ran, call the police.

61
00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.569
Got it.

62
00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.769
Everyone else, please get out of the car.

63
00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:15.869
Don't touch anything at the crime scene.

64
00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.069
It's wet.

65
00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.069
"Metropolitan Police Department"

66
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.469
So after you returned from shopping

67
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.869
at this store you always stop at,

68
00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:44.669
Goto, who had been sleeping inside the car,

69
00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.169
slid down in his seat,

70
00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.569
causing his phone strap to strangle him,

71
00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.169
resulting in his death?

72
00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.969
Yes, that's right.

73
00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.469
Komada, you were the last person to get out of the car.

74
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.769
Yes.

75
00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:00.469
While getting out of the car,

76
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.569
I thought the air inside was a little cold,

77
00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.569
so I draped a blanket over the professor.

78
00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.769
Did you notice anything then?

79
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.669
Anything out of the ordinary?

80
00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:16.869
Come to think of it, I didn't recognize the air cushion

81
00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.669
that the professor was using.

82
00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.269
He said he'd hurt his back recently,

83
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.869
so maybe he bought it for today.

84
00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.769
Inoue, you returned to the car before entering the store.

85
00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:32.969
That's right.

86
00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.969
I forgot my phone, so I went to go get it.

87
00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.869
But the professor was asleep.

88
00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:39.969
He was snoring loudly.

89
00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.169
Not that I went inside and got a good look at him.

90
00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.769
Isn't that right, miss?

91
00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:48.269
Yes.

92
00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:49.369
What?

93
00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:51.069
You were with her?

94
00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.469
Yeah. I dropped my wallet inside the van,

95
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.669
so I followed Inoue.

96
00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.469
My wallet was on the seat, so I left immediately,

97
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:06.469
but I did hear some loud snoring.

98
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.169
In other words, he fell from his seat after that.

99
00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:14.969
Finally, Saeki, you went to the convenience store next door

100
00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:18.269
to buy cigarettes after you finished shopping?

101
00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:20.869
Yeah, I'd just run out.

102
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:25.169
I returned to the car after having a smoke over there.

103
00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.969
We saw him smoking cigarettes. Right, Ran?

104
00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:34.569
Yeah. From right around here, when we gave them our gift.

105
00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:38.469
Come to think of it, did Goto always drink that much?

106
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:41.869
Every time he'd be plastered by the time we arrived.

107
00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:45.169
He said he couldn't sleep unless he drank.

108
00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.869
The professor took sleeping pills,

109
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:50.769
but he was a shallow sleeper.

110
00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:53.169
Alcohol and sleeping pills, huh?

111
00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.169
So that's why there aren't any signs of a struggle

112
00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:57.269
even though he was strangled.

113
00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:02.269
Anyway, it seems strange to me that Goto's phone was found open

114
00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:08.269
between the seat and headrest when the body was discovered.

115
00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:11.369
Goto was probably making a call.

116
00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:12.669
A call?

117
00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:16.369
It's possible the drunked Goto tried to place a call,

118
00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:22.369
but his hand slipped, and his phone ended up in that gap.

119
00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.069
Maybe it was that.

120
00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:28.469
Do you know something about that?

121
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:33.469
I got a call from the professor while I was shopping.

122
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:37.069
I thought he wanted me to get something,

123
00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:40.469
but he didn't answer, so I hung up.

124
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:42.069
"Shoji Goto"

125
00:08:42.069 --> 00:08:45.069
I knew it!

126
00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:49.769
Takagi, investigate Goto's call history immediately.

127
00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:51.369
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:53.669
He got what was coming to him.

129
00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:56.069
Haruka, behave.

130
00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:00.069
Saeki, aren't you relieved?

131
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:03.869
Now that the professor who refused to give you credits is gone,

132
00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:07.069
you'll get that job you were promised.

133
00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:09.569
That has nothing to do with this!

134
00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.169
And, Komada,

135
00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:13.469
the professor was awfully verbally abusive towards you.

136
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.369
How did you really feel about him?

137
00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:16.869
No way in particular.

138
00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:18.169
Well, you complained

139
00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:21.269
that you wouldn't forgive the professor for sexually harassing you!

140
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.669
That's right. That's why I feel relieved.

141
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:26.569
You must feel the same way.

142
00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:29.969
Don't you remember what he said last time he was drunk?

143
00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.469
Listen up.

144
00:09:31.469 --> 00:09:36.869
You idiots should shut up and listen to me.

145
00:09:36.869 --> 00:09:41.469
I can change your futures with a single word.

146
00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:43.069
That was...

147
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:45.369
Honestly, I couldn't take it anymore.

148
00:09:45.369 --> 00:09:46.969
In the first place, he...

149
00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:53.369
It sounds like all three of them

150
00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:56.569
felt quite resentful towards the professor.

151
00:09:56.569 --> 00:10:00.069
We'll need to investigate carefully.

152
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:02.969
Inspector.

153
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.569
Takagi, how did it go?

154
00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:10.069
We found a call placed to Saeki in Goto's phone history.

155
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.369
We're certain it was during the time he was shopping.

156
00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:19.769
Mouri, did anyone approach the car while you were here?

157
00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:23.169
No. I was next to the car the whole time

158
00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:25.569
since I was waiting for the roadside assistance,

159
00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:26.569
but I didn't see anyone.

160
00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:31.169
If Goto died after placing the call,

161
00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:34.969
and no one approached the car after that...

162
00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.369
Then it must've been an accident.

163
00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:39.769
Hey, don't you think it's strange?

164
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:42.169
Conan, you shouldn't be in there!

165
00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:43.969
Oh, sorry.

166
00:10:43.969 --> 00:10:47.869
I dropped something inside the car.

167
00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:50.969
Gosh. You're always barging into crime scenes.

168
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:54.969
So, what's strange?

169
00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:58.669
The air cushion Goto was using.

170
00:10:58.669 --> 00:10:59.669
Huh?

171
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.069
What's so strange about this?

172
00:11:04.369 --> 00:11:08.569
They said he may have bought it because he hurt his back.

173
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:13.569
But there's a hole in it even though it's brand new.

174
00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:17.769
Yeah. I was wondering about that, too.

175
00:11:19.169 --> 00:11:22.969
I thought it had a hole because it was old.

176
00:11:22.969 --> 00:11:25.669
And when I first looked at it,

177
00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:28.869
the surface of the cushion was slightly damp.

178
00:11:28.869 --> 00:11:32.769
There weren't any other wet spots on the seat.

179
00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:34.769
Isn't that strange?

180
00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:37.569
There's nothing strange about it.

181
00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:41.169
It was damp because Goto spilled liquor on it.

182
00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:45.069
And the cushion was defective, so a hole opened while he was asleep.

183
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:48.969
It made him lose his balance and fall from his seat.

184
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.769
Well? You got a problem with that?

185
00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:52.669
Now, now, Mouri.

186
00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:54.869
This was definitely an accident.

187
00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:56.469
An accident!

188
00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:57.969
No, he's wrong.

189
00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:00.769
Using that, they could've made the victim fall,

190
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:03.169
even from a distance.

191
00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:05.969
But without any evidence,

192
00:12:05.969 --> 00:12:09.069
this will be treated as an accident.

193
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:11.169
Is there anything?

194
00:12:11.169 --> 00:12:13.369
Anything that would definitively prove they did it?

195
00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.669
What's that?

196
00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:19.869
That's it!

197
00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:22.969
This means that they must still have it on them.

198
00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:26.869
The conclusive evidence the culprit used in their trick!

199
00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:41.836
It's probably safe to assume there was no foul play.

200
00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:44.136
Yes. They seem to have motives,

201
00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:47.636
but those three couldn't have killed him.

202
00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:49.436
Excuse me.

203
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.336
How long do we have to wait?

204
00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.636
We'd like to leave now.

205
00:12:54.636 --> 00:12:58.336
We have people we need to call.

206
00:12:58.336 --> 00:12:59.736
Don't worry.

207
00:12:59.736 --> 00:13:03.036
After reviewing the crime scene, all uncertainties have been...

208
00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:13.136
It's become clear to me

209
00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:16.436
that this is a murder made to look like an accident.

210
00:13:19.736 --> 00:13:23.536
Goto didn't accidentally fall from his seat.

211
00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:26.236
He was made to fall by the culprit.

212
00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:31.636
Didn't you just say none of them could have killed him?

213
00:13:31.636 --> 00:13:33.736
At first, that's what I believed,

214
00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:36.236
but after examining the inside of the car,

215
00:13:36.236 --> 00:13:39.836
I realized the trick the culprit used.

216
00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:41.636
Hold on.

217
00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:45.536
You think one of us killed him?

218
00:13:45.536 --> 00:13:47.936
We were together the whole time.

219
00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:51.036
We couldn't have killed the professor who was sleeping in the car.

220
00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:53.236
It's not impossible.

221
00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:56.636
All they needed to do was slip the phone with the strap

222
00:13:56.636 --> 00:14:02.336
through the gap between the headrest and seat towards the back.

223
00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:04.036
Even if that's true,

224
00:14:04.036 --> 00:14:07.636
wasn't it a coincidence that Goto fell from his seat?

225
00:14:07.636 --> 00:14:10.836
The culprit set up what you might call a timing device

226
00:14:10.836 --> 00:14:13.936
that caused Goto to automatically fall from his seat

227
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:17.936
even if no one else was present...

228
00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:23.136
using the rubber air cushion and dry ice.

229
00:14:23.136 --> 00:14:26.736
Dry ice sublimates from a solid directly into a gas,

230
00:14:26.736 --> 00:14:30.336
causing its volume to expand by a factor of 800.

231
00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:34.236
The culprit packed dry ice inside the air cushion

232
00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:36.536
and hid it on the seat.

233
00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:40.836
As time passed, the cushion began to expand like a balloon

234
00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:45.436
to a size large enough to cause Goto to fall from his seat.

235
00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:47.636
The cushion was damp

236
00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.636
because the low temperature of the dry ice

237
00:14:49.636 --> 00:14:52.636
cooled the moisture in the air,

238
00:14:52.636 --> 00:14:55.636
causing it to condense on its surface.

239
00:14:55.636 --> 00:15:00.136
The cushion continued to expand after Goto fell,

240
00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:04.036
and once it could no longer contain the gas, it burst.

241
00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:08.436
Naturally, they experimented many times

242
00:15:08.436 --> 00:15:10.736
to determine the exact amount they should use,

243
00:15:10.736 --> 00:15:14.436
so it would all have turned to gas by the time the body was discovered.

244
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:18.436
That would certainly leave no evidence.

245
00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:22.936
But isn't it difficult to transport dry ice?

246
00:15:22.936 --> 00:15:27.036
That's why the culprit used a certain piece of outdoor equipment.

247
00:15:28.836 --> 00:15:31.436
That's it! A cooler!

248
00:15:31.436 --> 00:15:32.736
Yes.

249
00:15:32.736 --> 00:15:35.936
Using a cooler allowed the culprit to preserve the dry ice

250
00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:38.036
until they needed it.

251
00:15:38.036 --> 00:15:39.536
Isn't that right?

252
00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:44.336
The individual with the cooler who used this trick...

253
00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:47.536
Komada!

254
00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:51.036
You created an excuse to remain in the car

255
00:15:51.036 --> 00:15:53.036
and passed the open phone with strap

256
00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:57.736
through the gap beneath the headrest towards the back.

257
00:15:57.736 --> 00:16:03.036
Then you draped a blanket over Goto's legs

258
00:16:03.036 --> 00:16:05.636
in order to hide the dry ice-filled cushion,

259
00:16:05.636 --> 00:16:09.236
and went shopping as though nothing had happened.

260
00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.836
I'm sure you calculated how large the cushion would expand,

261
00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:13.636
and how long it would take to burst

262
00:16:13.636 --> 00:16:15.836
and bought one accordingly.

263
00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.236
Why me?

264
00:16:18.236 --> 00:16:19.736
Surely you don't think I did it

265
00:16:19.736 --> 00:16:22.136
just because I approached the professor.

266
00:16:22.136 --> 00:16:24.936
And you said I passed the professor's phone

267
00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:28.036
through the gap and over the back of his seat.

268
00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:33.036
Have you forgotten that the professor called Saeki?

269
00:16:33.036 --> 00:16:34.736
If his phone were back there,

270
00:16:34.736 --> 00:16:37.036
he couldn't have called anyone.

271
00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:42.836
I never said it was the professor's phone that was used.

272
00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.736
What are you...

273
00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:49.336
I'm saying you're the one who called Saeki.

274
00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:53.036
You swapped out your phone for Goto's

275
00:16:53.036 --> 00:16:56.236
and used it to fabricate your alibi.

276
00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:57.436
In other words,

277
00:16:57.436 --> 00:17:02.236
the phone attached to the strap that strangled Goto was yours.

278
00:17:04.936 --> 00:17:08.436
That's why you behaved strangely.

279
00:17:08.436 --> 00:17:14.036
Conan told me that when you saw Saeki return to the van,

280
00:17:14.036 --> 00:17:19.136
you returned to the car while carrying heavy bags full of groceries.

281
00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:25.736
Looks like we're leaving soon.

282
00:17:25.736 --> 00:17:27.036
We should go.

283
00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:28.836
Hey, wait.

284
00:17:28.836 --> 00:17:31.336
Saeki, I'm putting some bags in the car.

285
00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:33.136
Oh, thanks.

286
00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.436
I was just thinking about bringing the car around...

287
00:17:35.436 --> 00:17:36.436
Professor?

288
00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:42.536
Inoue, you were with him.

289
00:17:42.536 --> 00:17:45.036
Didn't you wonder why he didn't have Saeki bring the car

290
00:17:45.036 --> 00:17:49.436
in front of the store instead of carrying so many heavy bags?

291
00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:51.236
Well, yes.

292
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:55.936
But, Komada, you went out of your way to carry the bags.

293
00:17:55.936 --> 00:17:57.636
Why is that?

294
00:17:58.736 --> 00:18:01.336
There's one reason you returned.

295
00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:03.836
It's because you needed to discover Goto's body with someone else,

296
00:18:03.836 --> 00:18:06.036
approach the body first,

297
00:18:06.036 --> 00:18:10.536
and swap out your phone, which you used for the murder

298
00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:15.536
for Goto's, which you used to fabricate your alibi.

299
00:18:15.536 --> 00:18:20.136
As the only other person with a flip phone like Goto's,

300
00:18:20.136 --> 00:18:22.736
only you could've used this trick.

301
00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:24.536
If you wanted to save Goto,

302
00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:28.736
you simply needed to pass the stuck phone through the gap.

303
00:18:28.736 --> 00:18:31.936
I knew something was off

304
00:18:31.936 --> 00:18:34.436
when you deliberately removed the phone from the strap.

305
00:18:34.436 --> 00:18:37.836
You probably planned to reattach it,

306
00:18:37.836 --> 00:18:39.136
but you gave up on the idea

307
00:18:39.136 --> 00:18:43.836
when Conan and I entered the car unexpectedly quickly.

308
00:18:46.036 --> 00:18:47.636
You're making this all up!

309
00:18:47.636 --> 00:18:51.836
Even if it was dry ice, there's no evidence it was used!

310
00:18:51.836 --> 00:18:56.036
If I'm the culprit, show me the evidence!

311
00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.636
I could say the same thing.

312
00:18:58.636 --> 00:18:59.736
What?

313
00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:03.036
Officer Takagi, how did it go?

314
00:19:03.036 --> 00:19:08.236
I didn't find the damage you described on Goto's phone.

315
00:19:08.236 --> 00:19:11.136
Damage?

316
00:19:11.136 --> 00:19:15.336
And aren't these pieces of plastic?

317
00:19:15.336 --> 00:19:19.336
Yes. They were stuck to the blanket.

318
00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:24.136
When Goto fell, the phone dangling over the back

319
00:19:24.136 --> 00:19:26.736
struck a metal piece of the seat.

320
00:19:26.736 --> 00:19:30.636
The shock sent those pieces of plastic flying.

321
00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:35.736
Komada, using an old phone came back to bite you.

322
00:19:42.036 --> 00:19:45.636
As we just heard in Officer Takagi's report,

323
00:19:45.636 --> 00:19:50.936
Goto's phone was not damaged.

324
00:19:50.936 --> 00:19:55.436
Which means a different phone was used in the crime.

325
00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:57.936
You have that phone on you right now.

326
00:19:57.936 --> 00:20:02.736
One with dents that should match those pieces of plastic.

327
00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:03.736
Darn it!

328
00:20:13.236 --> 00:20:16.336
Komada, why would you do this?

329
00:20:16.336 --> 00:20:17.636
Why?

330
00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:21.736
You probably had no idea.

331
00:20:21.736 --> 00:20:24.536
The professor's paper that won the award...

332
00:20:24.536 --> 00:20:26.636
It was originally my thesis.

333
00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:30.536
The professor stole my research topic.

334
00:20:30.536 --> 00:20:32.936
What? Is that true?

335
00:20:32.936 --> 00:20:36.136
Naturally, the professor threatened me.

336
00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:39.436
He told me to keep my mouth shut

337
00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:41.536
if I wanted to keep doing research at the university.

338
00:20:41.536 --> 00:20:45.036
You should've told someone.

339
00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:47.236
I had a dream!

340
00:20:47.236 --> 00:20:50.636
Since I was a child, I dreamed of becoming a researcher!

341
00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:54.336
But that man...

342
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:56.936
Professor, this isn't what you promised!

343
00:20:56.936 --> 00:21:00.436
Why can't I go to grad school?

344
00:21:00.436 --> 00:21:01.936
Don't worry.

345
00:21:01.936 --> 00:21:06.436
I'll help you get a job at some company.

346
00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:08.436
A job?

347
00:21:08.436 --> 00:21:10.136
Even if I can't stay here,

348
00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.636
can't I at least go to a lab at another university?

349
00:21:12.636 --> 00:21:14.336
Have you forgotten?

350
00:21:14.336 --> 00:21:16.636
I have a lot of influence in this world.

351
00:21:16.636 --> 00:21:20.036
I can change your future with a word.

352
00:21:22.036 --> 00:21:25.136
You were never meant for research.

353
00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:27.636
That's all.

354
00:21:27.636 --> 00:21:31.236
It really is a shame.

355
00:21:34.136 --> 00:21:36.736
I ignored my research

356
00:21:36.736 --> 00:21:40.336
to repeatedly experiment and perfect this method.

357
00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:43.736
I was pretty confident it would work.

358
00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:46.136
But I messed it up in the end.

359
00:21:46.136 --> 00:21:50.036
I guess I wasn't good enough to be researcher after all.

360
00:23:13.536 --> 00:23:15.536
If you didn't know where we were going,

361
00:23:15.536 --> 00:23:18.836
you should've followed the police.

362
00:23:18.836 --> 00:23:22.036
We came this way on the way here.

363
00:23:22.036 --> 00:23:26.436
I'm not doing something as pathetic as asking the police for help.

364
00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:28.736
But we're lost now.

365
00:23:28.736 --> 00:23:31.736
We even have a GPS! How does this even happen?

366
00:23:31.736 --> 00:23:34.836
Because it's giving we weird directions.

367
00:23:34.836 --> 00:23:36.736
Hey, look at that.

368
00:23:36.736 --> 00:23:39.036
We made it out.

369
00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:42.836
I knew my instincts were right.

370
00:23:42.836 --> 00:23:46.836
Huh? Weren't we just here?

371
00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:50.236
We won't be getting home for a while...

372
00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:56.736
"Next Episode" -I'm hungry.

373
00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:58.136
Where are we?

374
00:23:59.236 --> 00:24:01.136
Who are you?

375
00:24:02.336 --> 00:24:04.436
Hello, Inspector Megure?

376
00:24:04.436 --> 00:24:08.636
What? You're staking out a counterfeiting operation?

377
00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:11.936
It's money!

378
00:24:11.936 --> 00:24:14.536
You violated the contract, mister.

379
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:18.336
Why don't you return all the notes you took?

380
00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:24.336
Next Conan, "The Disappearing Youth Detective Squad"

381
00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:27.179
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:29.379
"Glazed rice dumplings"

383
00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:30.679
We're finally home.

384
00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:32.279
Thanks for driving...

385
00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:34.179
But it's the next day.
