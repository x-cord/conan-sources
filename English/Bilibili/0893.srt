1
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,740
Isn't it wonderful, Conan?

2
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,540
It really is!

3
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,340
Guess we're not the only ones here.

4
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,040
I thought there were other people here.

5
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,140
They're probably not in the bathroom

6
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,840
all together, are they?

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,640
This is kind of like...

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,940
what happened to that ship...

9
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,840
You mean the Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,940
Oh, yeah! That's the one!

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,140
The Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

12
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,140
Yeah.

13
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,840
It's a famous unsolved case from the 19th century.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,540
If I remember right, a crew of ten people disappeared into thin air,

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,540
and then the boat was found adrift.

16
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,340
There was hot soup and silverware left out,

17
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,740
making you thinking they were still eating.

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,540
The situation is similar.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,040
What was that?

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,240
Kuchiishi!

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,440
You're Kuchiishi the chef, right?

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Yes.

23
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,340
Get it together! Can you tell me what happened?

24
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,440
Dad.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,540
"Curse"

26
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,140
Ran, get an ambulance and call the police!

27
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,140
-Got it! -Look, Pops!

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,440
Footprints?

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,940
"Curse"

30
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,840
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,940
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,040
The word "Curse" and five sets of footprints.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,240
What happened during this meal?

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,840
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:38,898
"The Mystery of the Michelin Starred Restaurant"

38
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:46,798
Thankfully, that head wound isn't very severe.

39
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:51,698
Can we ask you a few questions, Kuchiishi?

40
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,798
Sure.

41
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:57,398
Now, there were five guests at that table? You're certain?

42
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,998
Right.

43
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,898
They made their reservations a week ago.

44
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:05,098
It was a group from a company called Onda Trading.

45
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,798
I see.

46
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,598
Inspector!

47
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:11,598
It's about the identities of the missing group.

48
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,398
Sitting where the glasses are...

49
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,598
That was Kozo Kano, 40 years old.

50
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:19,598
We confirmed his ID from his driver's license,

51
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,598
which was left behind.

52
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:23,198
We confirmed the guy next to him

53
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,098
from the employee ID in his jacket, which was still on the chair.

54
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:30,198
Kazuki Iketani, 28 years old.

55
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,398
Next to him was a floral handkerchief

56
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,998
and a bag containing an employee ID

57
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:38,498
for Mitsuyo Ekuni, 38 years old.

58
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,498
The seat with the ash tray next to her

59
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:43,898
belonged to Tokuro Sahara, 35 years old.

60
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:47,798
We gathered that from the cigarettes and employee ID in his coat pocket.

61
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:52,098
The last one we put together from the smart phone that was left behind.

62
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:55,698
Kaori Manaka, 25 years old.

63
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:58,598
They all work at Onda Trading.

64
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:02,098
The company homepage confirms as much.

65
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:06,498
Kuchiishi, can you confirm they're who you saw?

66
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,598
Onda Trading.

67
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:09,598
Where have I heard that?

68
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,498
"Director and President, Teruaki Onda" -Yes, that's definitely them.

69
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,998
We haven't been able to contact President Onda,

70
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:18,598
so we had local police check on his home to be safe.

71
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,698
Hey, Officer Takagi.

72
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:25,098
When we came in, there were pictures on the phone.

73
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,998
Those are the same people, right?

74
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,598
Yeah, that's right.

75
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,298
I don't know how close they were,

76
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:34,198
but apparently the five of them would go out a lot together,

77
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:36,998
because there were pictures of them partying in various locations.

78
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:40,498
I bet they planned on taking one here, too...

79
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:44,698
So, all five of them came here?

80
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,198
Right.

81
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,398
They came in about an hour ago, in a car.

82
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:52,498
That'd be 20 minutes before we showed up.

83
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:56,098
Wait, back then...

84
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,798
What happened next?

85
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,298
They made a toast,

86
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:09,098
and I went into the kitchen to continue cooking.

87
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,798
I served the appetizers and soups.

88
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,898
And then after about 15 minutes,

89
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:15,298
I was struck from out of nowhere.

90
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:21,798
You didn't see who hit you, then?

91
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:22,798
Right.

92
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:27,398
It certainly sounds like someone from that group

93
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,598
was the one to strike you.

94
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:34,298
"Ei" -Isn't this...

95
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,698
a mis-written receipt?

96
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,398
Hey, Kuchiishi.

97
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,498
This is that cake called tiramisu, right?

98
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:50,298
That's right.

99
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:52,798
Everyone else was eating dinner.

100
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,298
How come one had cake?

101
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,298
You get people like that sometimes,

102
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,798
who want to start with dessert.

103
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:07,198
I bet the lady who sat here sure loved sweets.

104
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:09,098
That might be the case.

105
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,398
That should be obvious!

106
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,198
Quit messing with the crime scene.

107
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,698
Sorry!

108
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,898
-In that case, get out of the... -One more thing!

109
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,698
Did someone break their glass when they did the toast?

110
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:26,798
I... don't think so.

111
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,298
I would've noticed if they did,

112
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,098
not to mention having to clean up.

113
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,198
That's what I thought.

114
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:34,398
The trash can in the kitchen was empty, too.

115
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,698
One other thing, the car outside...

116
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:40,298
That's enough out of you!

117
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:46,798
You can't just run around on your own.

118
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:48,498
Sorry.

119
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:50,298
Let's wait out here together.

120
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:51,598
Okay.

121
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,598
Isn't that...

122
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,098
What did you say?

123
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:04,598
Understood!

124
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:05,798
Inspector!

125
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,498
It's about Onda Trading.

126
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,498
Three years ago,

127
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:14,498
the company was under suspicion for smuggling industrial metals,

128
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:17,198
and there was an investigation.

129
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:18,598
But one of the other managers

130
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:22,198
left a note claiming they were responsible for all of it,

131
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:24,698
and committed suicide.

132
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,998
Oh, a difficult case.

133
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,998
Then the five employees from this incident might've been involved?

134
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,498
Also, the manager who killed himself

135
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:36,498
was named Keigo Kuchiishi.

136
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:39,798
-What? -That's the same family name as the chef!

137
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:41,998
Inspector Megure!

138
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,198
Look what's on Kuchiishi's blog!

139
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:47,198
"Curse" -What happened to my customers?

140
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:49,198
What?

141
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:53,498
Sir, you really shouldn't do this sort of thing...

142
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,498
Kuchiishi is gone!

143
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:58,598
Where'd he go?

144
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,398
Is that...

145
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:01,998
"Curse"

146
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,498
Kuchiishi!

147
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,298
Don't tell me...

148
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:12,798
Did he walk into the lake, like the five customers?

149
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:14,598
That's impossible!

150
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:17,598
Takagi, Chiba! I want this lake checked out now!

151
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:20,598
-We can't afford to wait until dawn! -Yes, sir!

152
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:23,898
"Curse"

153
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:26,798
I figured as much.

154
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:37,164
Is it really okay

155
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:40,264
that I'm the only one not searching the lake?

156
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,464
It's okay!

157
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:44,364
Inspector Megure told me that Officer Chiba

158
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:48,564
was going to check out the lake with the local police.

159
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,964
Still...

160
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:53,764
Did Mouri really tell us to look around here?

161
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:56,064
"Curse" -See?

162
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,964
Look closely.

163
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,864
Don't do that, Conan!

164
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:02,164
You can't just grab evidence!

165
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,864
See?

166
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,864
That's a map!

167
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,064
Yes!

168
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:13,364
If the lake is over here, then this is the restaurant.

169
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,864
"Warehouse" -And our goal is here!

170
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:17,364
We're almost there.

171
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,864
"Ei"

172
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,164
Isn't this...

173
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:28,564
Yep. Just like that chef, Eigo.

174
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,964
Maybe it's like his signature.

175
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:34,464
So this is a warehouse that Kuchiishi owns.

176
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:37,964
Did you hear that?

177
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,664
Open it up, Officer Takagi!

178
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:40,664
Got it!

179
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,664
These people...

180
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:54,264
The five missing guests.

181
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,464
They're not wearing their shoes.

182
00:11:57,464 --> 00:12:00,964
Then does that mean those footprints were...

183
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:04,664
Yep. Kuchiishi put them down.

184
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:07,864
This was all his doing.

185
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:11,664
Pops said that even that wound on his head

186
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,064
was part of the plan.

187
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,464
What?

188
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:18,264
But why?

189
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,964
And where has he gone?

190
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:24,464
He said that these people should know.

191
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,264
"Safe deposit box"

192
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,264
"Teruaki Onda (45), President of Onda Trading"

193
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:50,064
It's been a while, Mr. President!

194
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:52,064
Since my dad's funeral.

195
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,964
You...

196
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:57,364
Then you really are Kuchiishi's son!

197
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,264
My father was weak.

198
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:01,464
He let you people push him around.

199
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:05,564
No, manipulate him into committing suicide, and taking the fall!

200
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:08,864
But that's not gonna work with me!

201
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,064
That's enough!

202
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:14,364
Great timing! Get him off of me!

203
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:18,164
You're Teruaki Onda, president of Onda Trading, correct?

204
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,664
I'm Megure, with the Metro PD's Division 1.

205
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:22,864
Police?

206
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:26,464
I've been waiting for you, Mouri.

207
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:28,464
If you're here now,

208
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,364
that means you've solved the mystery, right?

209
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:34,164
Huh? Well... what was it again?

210
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:35,364
Come on, now!

211
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:36,564
We're only here because you told us

212
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:38,864
where to rescue the missing five people,

213
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,364
and question them about this location.

214
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:42,664
Rescue?

215
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:43,864
Yes.

216
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,264
We rescued them from where they were being held,

217
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:47,664
took them into custody,

218
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:51,364
and are currently questioning them about the situation.

219
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,264
So, Mouri, what's this mystery?

220
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:59,264
Well, to be honest, I have no idea.

221
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,664
Huh?

222
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,464
Is this...

223
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,064
Finally!

224
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,664
The Sleeping Kogoro!

225
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,264
Pardon me.

226
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:18,864
Now, to dissect this puzzle.

227
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:23,464
It had a few similarities with a famous unsolved case,

228
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:27,064
but as to the clues for unraveling it...

229
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:28,764
Conan!

230
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:30,164
Here!

231
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:31,364
Well, you see,

232
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:35,364
the first thing I thought was weird was the tiramisu.

233
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:36,964
The tiramisu?

234
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:37,964
Yeah.

235
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,964
It was the dessert at the seat with the lady

236
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,964
who had the flowery handkerchief!

237
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:47,264
It was dinner time when everybody went missing,

238
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:49,964
but one person had tiramisu instead.

239
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:53,264
And the chef said it was because

240
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:56,164
some people like having dessert first, but...

241
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,664
I realized it was a mistake!

242
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,264
What mistake?

243
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:03,564
The answer

244
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:07,164
has to do with the pictures that were found on the cell phone.

245
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:09,364
In the pictures of past parties,

246
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:12,764
there was always one person having dessert.

247
00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:17,764
But it wasn't Ekuni, rather Iketani, a man.

248
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,064
What?

249
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,664
Not only that,

250
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:22,864
but when you always have the same group,

251
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:26,264
you might have a seating pattern that tends to pop up.

252
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:30,464
And this time, the pictures indicated that was the case.

253
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:33,664
But for whatever reason, that wasn't what happened tonight.

254
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:35,664
The usual seating pattern

255
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,964
had different people's things in place.

256
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:42,364
I'm not sure I follow.

257
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:44,864
What was the point of it all?

258
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:49,964
It was all to make Kogoro Mouri notice something.

259
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,664
The truth behind this case!

260
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,764
What?

261
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,464
When you combined the two of them,

262
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:01,064
it shows a route to the warehouse

263
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,664
where the kidnapped people were being held.

264
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:08,864
These "Curse" notes were another part of the puzzle.

265
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,964
At first I thought

266
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:14,164
the five of them were captured at the restaurant,

267
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:19,064
then moved to the warehouse, where they were locked up.

268
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:21,364
Is that not the case?

269
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,464
No. If that were the case,

270
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,864
the five of them would've been sitting in the same positions as usual,

271
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:29,164
leaving their own belongings in those seats.

272
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:30,764
And there was one other thing,

273
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:32,964
a jacket stained with wine,

274
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:37,964
with a broken piece of glass that had no explanation at the time.

275
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,464
There was no sign of a broken glass or a bottle

276
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:43,464
in the restaurant's garbage, either.

277
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:45,364
Which would mean...

278
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:48,564
Inspector Megure, think back.

279
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:55,264
They began eating 20 minutes before we arrived at the restaurant.

280
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,964
But the hood of the car that was parked outside

281
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:04,364
was still giving off heat, like it had only recently been parked.

282
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:08,464
And that warehouse had a table, with chairs,

283
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:12,064
along with a broken wine glass and bottle.

284
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,864
I see! Then you're saying...

285
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:18,464
They were originally lured out to that warehouse,

286
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:20,464
where they were kept locked up.

287
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:23,264
President Onda,

288
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:28,264
you've all been partying in a variety of locations, haven't you?

289
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,564
The pictures in the phone

290
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:33,164
included restaurants, the roofs of skyscrapers,

291
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:35,564
the summits of mountains, beaches,

292
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,164
and even deserted islands.

293
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:39,064
Using your name as bait

294
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:43,264
would've been enough to lure them to a warehouse with little trouble,

295
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,564
and get them to start toasting among themselves.

296
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,564
Warehouse? What are you talking about?

297
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:51,764
Okay, thanks, Officer Takagi.

298
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:54,664
It's just like Pops deducted.

299
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:56,464
The wine from the warehouse

300
00:17:56,464 --> 00:18:00,464
and the wine on the jacket in the restaurant are the same,

301
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:03,164
and it had sleep medication in it.

302
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:05,464
There was also an email from that president

303
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,864
asking them all to show up.

304
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:11,964
I don't recall ever sending that email!

305
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:15,264
That's because it was Kuchiishi who sent it.

306
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,564
Once they were unconscious,

307
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:25,764
he took their shoes, along with jackets and other belongings,

308
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:30,064
and returned to the restaurant in the car they arrived with.

309
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:32,764
He then placed their things at the table,

310
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:36,164
as if they had been there all along, and served up the food.

311
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:39,064
After that, he made the footprints

312
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,264
leading to the lake through the back door

313
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:44,164
to make it look like they had drowned themselves,

314
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,964
placed the "Curse" note,

315
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:52,164
and then hurt himself while waiting for us to arrive.

316
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,564
By the way, those notes

317
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:59,164
were actually a message to President Onda

318
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:02,864
using your father's name, weren't they?

319
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,264
Using his father's name?

320
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:10,464
His father's name is Keigo Kuchiishi.

321
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:12,364
If you take the "Kuchi" from Kuchiishi

322
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,164
and the "Ani" from Keigo.

323
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:16,564
It makes "Curse."

324
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:21,864
Might it have been a signature your father used in the past?

325
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,764
Because you use one that's similar.

326
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,864
"Ei"

327
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:32,364
In other words, the son of Keigo Kuchiishi, Eigo,

328
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:35,264
planned to avenge his father

329
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:38,664
by killing off a group of employees.

330
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:40,664
Or, intended to make it look like that.

331
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:41,664
But the truth was,

332
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:45,164
he was luring President Onda into a trap by making him cautious.

333
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,964
That was his true goal!

334
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:50,164
What?

335
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:53,464
The people who were kidnapped knew where we would go

336
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:56,164
because they recognized the man who had confined them.

337
00:19:56,164 --> 00:20:00,664
And after thinking about what their president would do next,

338
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:03,764
they told me where to find you both.

339
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:09,564
Those are the secret books for your company.

340
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:15,164
They prove that Eigo's late father was innocent, don't they?

341
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:22,964
It was two weeks ago.

342
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:27,764
I learned completely by accident that my father had been framed.

343
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:30,764
Man, if those books ever see the light of day,

344
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,464
this company is done for.

345
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,164
Shh! You're too loud.

346
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:39,664
And for the record, I am not going down with this ship!

347
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:43,064
Yeah. I'm don't want to end up like him, either.

348
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:46,064
Not like poor old Kuchiishi.

349
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:51,164
They likely had no idea they were in the restaurant

350
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:56,064
of the son of Keigo Kuchiishi, the man they had framed.

351
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:58,464
I wanted revenge!

352
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,364
Against all of them!

353
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:06,264
But then, Mouri made his reservation.

354
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,664
It felt like a sign telling me to wait.

355
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:11,064
So, I reconsidered

356
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:14,364
and realized my father can't rest until I expose their crimes,

357
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,864
that I can't redeem him without doing that.

358
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:20,364
And that if I was the ace detective that my reputation suggests,

359
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,964
I'd be able to figure out the case from the clues he left,

360
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,264
find this location,

361
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:29,964
and expose their crime.

362
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:35,164
You're amazing.

363
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,464
Thank you so much.

364
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:43,364
The next day, the secret books were evidence enough

365
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:45,464
"President of Onda Trading" -to get President Onda

366
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:48,664
"And 5 Employees Arrested!" -and the complicit 5 employees arrested,

367
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:50,564
and Chef Kuchiishi's father,

368
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:53,864
Keigo, was cleared of all charges.

369
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:17,664
"Ibaraki Mito Domain Ramen" -Thanks for the food!

370
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,364
I got to say, that's really too bad.

371
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:24,364
That was a Michelin-starred restaurant

372
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:25,864
those are hard to get reservations for.

373
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:30,764
Maybe Cucina Eigo will open up again someday.

374
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:32,264
I hope so.

375
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:34,864
But the ramen here was good, too!

376
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,464
My tummy's full!

377
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:40,764
If we can't eat from the Cucina,

378
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:43,264
then we can at least eat at the kitchen!

379
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,264
You get it?

380
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:48,964
Isn't that funny?

381
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:51,464
We hope you enjoyed the show.

382
00:23:54,464 --> 00:24:00,164
Huh? Didn't Pirate's Spirit from race nine win?

383
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:02,564
Seriously?

384
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:04,964
That was the dark horse! This pays out a hundred-fold!

385
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:08,364
One million yen?

386
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,364
All right, tonight we're having sushi for dinner, sushi!

387
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:18,364
Who stole my one million yen ticket?

388
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,564
Next Conan,

389
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:24,364
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 1)"

390
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:27,607
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:29,407
"Iroha Sushi"

392
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:30,507
We're having sushi next time?

393
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,207
Not if I don't win at the races!

394
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,707
But what if he wins?
