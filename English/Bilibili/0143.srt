1
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.766
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.566
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.166
Let's relax and watch the stars tonight.

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.166
Let's shatter alibis as if they were shooting stars.

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.866
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.966
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.879
"The Astronomical Observation"

9
00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.679
"Nagano Prefecture Mt. Hoshimi Sanatorium"

10
00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.579
"11:20 p.m."

11
00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.879
A polar cap!

12
00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.379
Ran, let me see too!

13
00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.779
I'm sorry. Here, go ahead.

14
00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.879
Wow! You can say that again.

15
00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.879
Gosh, there are no shooting stars around at all.

16
00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.279
Come on, Sonoko.

17
00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.479
Why don't you quit looking for shooting stars,

18
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.279
and look through the telescope for a change?

19
00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:33.679
No way.

20
00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.179
I'm going to find a shooting star

21
00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.479
and wish for a good-looking steady.

22
00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.979
Gosh. Just what did you buy this fantastic telescope for

23
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.679
and bring it all the way here?

24
00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.879
Well, isn't it strange to come look at the stars

25
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.179
and not have a telescope?

26
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.179
It's even stranger not to look through the telescope that you brought.

27
00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.279
A shooting star!

28
00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.179
What? Where?

29
00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.979
It vanished.

30
00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:04.579
I didn't get to see it because you were talking to me, Ran!

31
00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.479
-Ran. -Yes?

32
00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.079
How is it? Is it working okay now?

33
00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.479
Mr. Eda. Thanks a lot a while ago.

34
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.479
Who is he?

35
00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.079
He is Mr. Eda, an upper graduate of Tohto University.

36
00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.379
He taught me how to use this telescope

37
00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.979
while you were taking a snooze a while ago.

38
00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.979
Hey, Eda.

39
00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.279
Hello there.

40
00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.479
If you've got time to be picking girls up,

41
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.379
start collecting data right, will you?

42
00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.179
Come off it, it's nothing like that.

43
00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.979
They are...

44
00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.279
my upper classmen at the university, Koichi Nonaka

45
00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.679
and Hiroshi Akimoto.

46
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.579
Hello.

47
00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.979
How do you do? I'm Ran Mouri.

48
00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
He is Conan, and she is...

49
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.079
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

50
00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.479
I love stars, so today...

51
00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.979
Now I remember!

52
00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.079
Weren't you on TV yesterday, Mr. Nonaka?

53
00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.679
You were awarded this what-you-may-call show, weren't you?

54
00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:05.579
Yes. I was awarded the Star Pioneer Award,

55
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.179
which is considered the Nobel Prize in the field of astronomy.

56
00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.179
And I'm history's youngest recipient of this award, too.

57
00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.279
Is it normal to brag about oneself?

58
00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.279
What's with him, anyway?

59
00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.579
Mr. Nonaka. Is the filming turning out all right?

60
00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.079
Yeah. Only I'm so sleepy

61
00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.979
that I came to get a cup of coffee.

62
00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.679
Where are you filming?

63
00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:34.179
There, by that TV broadcast tower.

64
00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:38.879
That's pretty far.

65
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.479
But it's only takes about 2 or 3 minutes by car.

66
00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.679
Akimoto and I are rolling our cameras

67
00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.179
at the center of that broadcast tower and filming.

68
00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:49.779
Since I received the award,

69
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.179
he bought the same type of camera I had.

70
00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.379
Yeah. I've been using it since yesterday,

71
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.979
but after I got the same camera as his,

72
00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.479
it's a lot easier filming.

73
00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.279
Have you been here since yesterday?

74
00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.779
No, I came here first

75
00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.679
because of the stars that I had to film.

76
00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.679
Hey, Akimoto. It's about time we get going.

77
00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:09.779
-Yeah. -Give it your best shot!

78
00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.679
Oh, right! If you look to the south around 11:30 to 12 a.m.,

79
00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:18.279
you'll see an earth satellite shoot across the sky.

80
00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.079
Really?

81
00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.579
Yeah, I don't think you'll have any trouble finding it.

82
00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:26.279
-Bye. -Hey, don't tell me you're picking up girls too.

83
00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.779
Oh, come on.

84
00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.279
Just as expected of Akimoto.

85
00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:35.479
I know nothing about the orbit of earth satellites.

86
00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.579
Ran, which do you prefer?

87
00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.879
Oh, not again.

88
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.179
What did you guys come to observe anyway?

89
00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.079
"11:50 p.m."

90
00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.479
Oh, my neck's stiff and starting to hurt.

91
00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.479
There is no earth satellite in sight, is there.

92
00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.079
Mr. Akimoto.

93
00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.679
Well? Did you get to see the satellite?

94
00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.479
No, not at all.

95
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.679
What's up, Mr. Akimoto?

96
00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:08.979
I'm filming between 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.

97
00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.379
Since I have nothing to do during that time, I decided to come back.

98
00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.879
Don't you have to keep watch over the ���m�֧ԧ�?

99
00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.979
No. The filming that we are performing now

100
00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.979
is called the fixed filming method.

101
00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:19.979
That is, the shutter of the camera

102
00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.379
is left opened for a certain duration of time.

103
00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.079
That's why I don't have to be by the camera

104
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.679
while the pictures are being taken.

105
00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:26.879
I know about it.

106
00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.779
The stars come out in a straight line

107
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.379
when the picture is taken, right?

108
00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:33.179
That's right. You're sure knowledgeable, Conan.

109
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.979
What is Mr. Nonaka doing?

110
00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.479
He's back at the broadcast tower.

111
00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.079
He has to take pictures starting from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.

112
00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:46.579
and from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m.

113
00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:49.279
So, he has to operate the camera at 12 a.m.

114
00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.379
That's right.

115
00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:53.179
Why don't we take a look at him through the telescope?

116
00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.379
I'll bet he's yawning away from sleepiness.

117
00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.879
"12:15 a.m."

118
00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.579
I can't really get a clear view.

119
00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:08.079
Although I can sort of tell that someone is standing.

120
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.579
He's looking this way too,

121
00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.679
and yawning just like I expected.

122
00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.379
Nonaka fell.

123
00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.279
Mr. Akimoto.

124
00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.879
You have a cellular phone on you, don't you?

125
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:25.679
-Yes. -I'll rush over to Nonaka,

126
00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.079
so you call the police and come right after doing so.

127
00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:29.279
All right!

128
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.579
Hey, Conan!

129
00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:54.179
"12:20 a.m."

130
00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:03.579
Mr. Akimoto.

131
00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:11.779
Mr. Nonaka!

132
00:08:19.179 --> 00:08:20.979
Too late.

133
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.879
Nonaka.

134
00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:36.479
"12:25 a.m."

135
00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:50.079
So, it's over here.

136
00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:57.679
The railing is low

137
00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:00.179
and the ground is slippery from night dew.

138
00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:02.079
So, this is an accident after all.

139
00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.779
What's this?

140
00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:09.679
A ball of wool.

141
00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:11.279
Why would something like this be in a place like this?

142
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:18.579
This scratch is still new.

143
00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:20.879
The paint that has peeled off also looks unnatural.

144
00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:34.479
The release button on both cameras are pressed down.

145
00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:37.379
Which means they are still taking pictures.

146
00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:41.279
Conan, you should know better than to run around on your own.

147
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.379
Mr. Akimoto.

148
00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:45.579
These cameras are yours and Mr. Nonaka's, aren't they?

149
00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:47.979
Yeah. The one over there is Nonaka's,

150
00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:50.179
and this one is mine.

151
00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:53.179
I guess this is no time to be taking pictures.

152
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:56.379
12:30 a.m. end of filming.

153
00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:05.079
12:30 a.m. end of filming.

154
00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:07.279
So, this has turned out to be Nonaka's last pictures.

155
00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:14.279
"2:00 a.m."

156
00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:18.979
All set.

157
00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:21.279
Roger.

158
00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:26.079
So, you all witnessed Mr. Nonaka fall from there?

159
00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:27.079
Yes...

160
00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:29.679
I was watching him through the telescope,

161
00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:32.079
but it looked to me as if he lost his balance

162
00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:34.479
when he leaned out over the railing.

163
00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:37.479
Do you have the exact time that he fell?

164
00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:40.679
I'm sure it was around 12:15 a.m.

165
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:43.079
I was looking at my watch every so often

166
00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:45.379
because I wanted to see the twin star.

167
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:50.379
Mr. Detective.

168
00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:54.379
I think that Mr. Nonaka was standing more to the right.

169
00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:58.079
You must've seen wrong because it was dark.

170
00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.979
Oh, I wonder!

171
00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:04.779
These are the pictures that were taken by Mr. Nonaka.

172
00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:07.279
From the results of what the specialists came up with,

173
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:10.479
this picture was taken from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.

174
00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:13.979
And this from 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.

175
00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:16.279
It's been confirmed that these pictures

176
00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.079
were taken at the broadcast tower.

177
00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:23.779
Mr. Akimoto, you closed the shutter of Mr. Nonaka's camera

178
00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:26.279
at 12:30 a.m., is that right?

179
00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:29.479
Yes, that 's right.

180
00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:32.879
Judging from these two pictures,

181
00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:36.379
Mr. Nonaka probably operated his camera at 12 a.m.

182
00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.479
and started his second filming then at 12:15 a.m.

183
00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:44.179
He slipped on the wet ground and fell.

184
00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:46.979
There is nothing suspicious about the site either.

185
00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:49.479
There seems to have been none other than yourselves

186
00:11:49.479 --> 00:11:51.079
who have gone in and out of here too,

187
00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:54.079
so we'll have to say that this was an unfortunate accident.

188
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:57.679
No, this is not an accident.

189
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:01.279
Mr. Akimoto is lying.

190
00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:05.879
How were Akimoto and Nonaka getting along?

191
00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:09.579
When they were talking about the Star Pioneer Award at the roof,

192
00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.779
I was a little worried

193
00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:13.379
because Mr. Akimoto looked angry.

194
00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:17.479
Oh, that... Mr. Nonaka's to blame.

195
00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:20.279
The research that he was awarded for was actually

196
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:23.479
a joint research that they were both working on together.

197
00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:27.279
But Mr. Nonaka went ahead and introduced it as his own.

198
00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.179
What? I could never do observation

199
00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:31.779
with somebody who did something like that to me.

200
00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:33.979
Me neither.

201
00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:37.979
But Mr. Akimoto is the one who set this observation up,

202
00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:40.379
saying that he's not bothered about the award.

203
00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:51.079
What did you drop, Conan?

204
00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:52.379
Oh, the button of my jacket.

205
00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:54.679
I wonder where I dropped it.

206
00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:01.979
Even if Mr. Akimoto were to be the killer,

207
00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:05.579
he was watching Mr. Nonaka fall to his death at 12:15 a.m.

208
00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:07.679
together with all of us.

209
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:11.079
No, wait a sec.

210
00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:13.579
What we saw was the figure of a person.

211
00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:16.279
We didn't actually see Mr. Nonaka.

212
00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:19.179
A thing that looked to be the figure of a person.

213
00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:21.979
Even if it were a doll, we couldn't have made out the difference.

214
00:13:21.979 --> 00:13:23.779
No, that's not it.

215
00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:27.079
There was no doll when we got here.

216
00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:29.979
Mr. Akimoto may have arrived here before us,

217
00:13:29.979 --> 00:13:33.579
but he was still in his car when we got here.

218
00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.879
It'd have been impossible for him to hide the doll.

219
00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:38.679
Besides, somebody was always near Mr. Akimoto

220
00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:41.779
since Mr. Nonaka fell to his death.

221
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.079
Huh?

222
00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:49.079
What's the matter, Mr. Eda?

223
00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:52.279
I dropped my car key.

224
00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:54.379
Oh, there, I found it!

225
00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:57.279
That's an example of overlooking something worth while close at hand.

226
00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:01.779
I got it!

227
00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:03.179
It's over there!

228
00:14:04.979 --> 00:14:06.879
Thank you, Mr. Eda.

229
00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:16.079
Just as I thought!

230
00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:18.679
He could do it if he used that method.

231
00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:20.379
But I've got no proof.

232
00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:22.979
And besides, those two pictures...

233
00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:27.079
I'm sure there's some kind of trick to those pictures.

234
00:14:29.479 --> 00:14:31.479
What a bummer.

235
00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:34.479
There's an accident, I don't get to see shooting stars.

236
00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:37.179
-What luck. -Sonoko!

237
00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.879
I've found it!

238
00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.979
I've found decisive evidence.

239
00:14:50.768 --> 00:14:52.668
Thank you for your cooperation

240
00:14:52.668 --> 00:14:55.468
despite the late hour, everyone.

241
00:14:55.468 --> 00:14:58.568
We are quite positive that this is an accident, so...

242
00:14:59.568 --> 00:15:01.768
I guess I didn't get enough sleep.

243
00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:04.968
Hey, Sonoko.

244
00:15:04.968 --> 00:15:07.468
What's the matter, Sonoko?

245
00:15:09.168 --> 00:15:11.268
I'm fine, Conan.

246
00:15:11.268 --> 00:15:13.368
Mr. Detective.

247
00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:14.368
What is it?

248
00:15:14.368 --> 00:15:17.468
Mr. Nonaka death is not an accident.

249
00:15:17.468 --> 00:15:20.768
He was killed by Mr. Akimoto over there.

250
00:15:20.768 --> 00:15:23.068
What?

251
00:15:23.068 --> 00:15:26.868
When Mr. Akimoto went back to the broadcast tower

252
00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:29.768
with Mr. Nonaka at a little after 11:30 p.m.,

253
00:15:29.768 --> 00:15:32.568
he pushed Mr. Nonaka over and killed him.

254
00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:34.668
He told us about the earth satellite

255
00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:36.868
to divert our attention to the opposite side

256
00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:41.768
so that we wouldn't see him committing the murder.

257
00:15:42.768 --> 00:15:47.068
But, didn't you all see Mr. Nonaka fall?

258
00:15:47.068 --> 00:15:50.268
We did see a doll fall, not Mr. Nonaka.

259
00:15:50.268 --> 00:15:51.868
A doll?

260
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:55.668
Yes. Mr. Akimoto placed the doll a little distance away

261
00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:58.368
from where he pushed Mr. Nonaka over,

262
00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:00.368
and fixed the doll onto the railing using a strong string,

263
00:16:00.368 --> 00:16:02.568
such as a fishing line.

264
00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:03.968
As proof of that,

265
00:16:03.968 --> 00:16:06.768
there is a brand new scratch on the railing.

266
00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:08.668
And at 12:15 a.m.,

267
00:16:08.668 --> 00:16:12.668
the doll was dropped by the timer that was set to it.

268
00:16:12.668 --> 00:16:16.468
Mr. Akimoto made us witness that event,

269
00:16:16.468 --> 00:16:18.968
as well at witness it himself,

270
00:16:18.968 --> 00:16:20.968
thereby setting up a perfect alibi for himself.

271
00:16:22.668 --> 00:16:24.868
What a thing to say.

272
00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:28.468
When you all reached the broadcast tower,

273
00:16:28.468 --> 00:16:30.668
did you see any doll there?

274
00:16:30.668 --> 00:16:33.868
Yes, there was. Under your car.

275
00:16:35.268 --> 00:16:38.568
Arriving at the broadcast tower a little before us,

276
00:16:38.568 --> 00:16:40.768
you drove right over the doll and stopped

277
00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:44.068
so that we wouldn't see it.

278
00:16:44.068 --> 00:16:48.268
And while we were all absorbed in Mr. Nonaka's corpse,

279
00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:50.668
you threw the doll into your car.

280
00:16:52.268 --> 00:16:55.768
The doll that you made using an orange blanket and fishing line.

281
00:16:57.068 --> 00:17:00.068
That's no more than your deductive logic.

282
00:17:00.068 --> 00:17:04.368
I did indeed use the orange blanket that was in my car.

283
00:17:04.368 --> 00:17:07.468
But I used it to wrap myself in it

284
00:17:07.468 --> 00:17:09.068
because it was so cold at the broadcast tower.

285
00:17:09.068 --> 00:17:12.268
Although you were the first to reach the broadcast tower,

286
00:17:12.268 --> 00:17:16.268
you were the last one to go up to Mr. Nonaka's corpse.

287
00:17:17.168 --> 00:17:18.568
Nonaka.

288
00:17:18.568 --> 00:17:21.068
What on earth were you doing?

289
00:17:21.068 --> 00:17:23.668
Well... But, Sonoko,

290
00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.068
aren't those two pictures proof

291
00:17:26.068 --> 00:17:29.768
that Nonaka was alive until midnight?

292
00:17:29.768 --> 00:17:34.768
It's true that someone needs to be near the camera to operate it.

293
00:17:34.768 --> 00:17:37.268
Which means that it would've been impossible for me

294
00:17:37.268 --> 00:17:39.668
to operate the camera since I was here all through

295
00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:41.968
besides Sonoko and the others from 11:50 p.m.,

296
00:17:41.968 --> 00:17:44.368
much less kill him...

297
00:17:44.368 --> 00:17:46.668
If you still insist on me being the killer,

298
00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:49.468
let's have you show us some legitimate evidence.

299
00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:52.468
Detective Yamada.

300
00:17:52.468 --> 00:17:55.768
Mr. Akimoto's pictures that you requested are ready.

301
00:17:55.768 --> 00:17:58.068
Mr. Akimoto's pictures?

302
00:17:58.068 --> 00:18:01.068
I asked Conan to relay the message.

303
00:18:01.068 --> 00:18:02.968
Those pictures are the evidence.

304
00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:04.768
What?

305
00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:06.768
What on earth are you talking about?

306
00:18:06.768 --> 00:18:09.568
Investigation officer, please compare the pictures

307
00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:12.668
that were taken by Mr. Nonaka from 9:00 p.m. to midnight,

308
00:18:12.668 --> 00:18:14.368
to the ones that were taken by Mr. Akimoto.

309
00:18:14.368 --> 00:18:15.768
All right.

310
00:18:17.168 --> 00:18:19.468
This one is Mr. Akimoto's picture.

311
00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:23.968
What is this?

312
00:18:23.968 --> 00:18:26.568
A shooting star.

313
00:18:26.568 --> 00:18:28.768
You saw a shooting star

314
00:18:28.768 --> 00:18:31.368
going across the sky to the north, didn't you?

315
00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:33.868
Although I didn't get to see it.

316
00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:35.568
Yes, I did.

317
00:18:35.568 --> 00:18:37.368
Mr. Akimoto and Mr. Nonaka were supposed to

318
00:18:37.368 --> 00:18:41.368
have been taking pictures at the same time, of the same direction.

319
00:18:41.368 --> 00:18:45.868
And yet, the shooting star is in Mr. Akimoto's picture

320
00:18:45.868 --> 00:18:48.568
and not in Mr. Nonaka's.

321
00:18:48.568 --> 00:18:52.568
This proves that Mr. Nonaka's pictures were not taken today.

322
00:18:54.568 --> 00:19:00.768
If so, it would mean that Mr. Akimoto's alibi is not reliable,

323
00:19:00.768 --> 00:19:03.868
despite his having been here at the roof.

324
00:19:03.868 --> 00:19:05.268
Exactly.

325
00:19:05.268 --> 00:19:07.468
Mr. Akimoto.

326
00:19:07.468 --> 00:19:11.068
You took those two pictures yesterday

327
00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:12.968
with the same camera that Mr. Nonaka had

328
00:19:12.968 --> 00:19:16.468
in order to take pictures under the exact filming conditions as today.

329
00:19:16.468 --> 00:19:18.568
This is a crime that only you who knew

330
00:19:18.568 --> 00:19:20.968
about Mr. Nonaka's filming plan could've committed.

331
00:19:20.968 --> 00:19:24.168
And after you pushed Mr. Nonaka over today,

332
00:19:24.168 --> 00:19:26.068
you set the blanket up,

333
00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:27.468
took the film out of Mr. Nonaka's camera

334
00:19:27.468 --> 00:19:31.668
and exchanged it with the film that you had already used yesterday.

335
00:19:31.668 --> 00:19:34.868
But there was a defect to this trick.

336
00:19:36.168 --> 00:19:39.268
That is the sound of the shutter.

337
00:19:41.168 --> 00:19:42.968
The sound of the shutter?

338
00:19:42.968 --> 00:19:45.468
Yes. After the film is exchanged,

339
00:19:45.468 --> 00:19:47.468
you can't leave the shutter open.

340
00:19:47.468 --> 00:19:51.268
That is, you can't leave it in the filming mode.

341
00:19:51.268 --> 00:19:53.968
If you do so, the pictures that were taken today

342
00:19:53.968 --> 00:19:55.668
would double expose on yesterday's pictures,

343
00:19:55.668 --> 00:19:57.668
and the trick would be revealed.

344
00:19:57.668 --> 00:20:02.068
That's why he had to leave the shutter closed.

345
00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:05.068
I see. When he pushed the shutter at 12:30 a.m.,

346
00:20:05.068 --> 00:20:06.568
there was a possibility that someone would notice

347
00:20:06.568 --> 00:20:08.768
there was no sound when he did so.

348
00:20:08.768 --> 00:20:10.368
I'm sure that Mr. Akimoto figured that

349
00:20:10.368 --> 00:20:13.368
everyone would be so upset over Mr. Nonaka's death,

350
00:20:13.368 --> 00:20:15.968
to notice such a thing.

351
00:20:17.168 --> 00:20:19.868
But Conan noticed it.

352
00:20:21.068 --> 00:20:24.368
Yes, the shutter made no sound back then.

353
00:20:24.368 --> 00:20:25.868
It did seem like Mr. Akimoto was trying

354
00:20:25.868 --> 00:20:29.168
to keep everyone from noticing by shouting though.

355
00:20:29.168 --> 00:20:30.968
That means that Mr. Nonaka's camera

356
00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:33.568
was not taking pictures, right?

357
00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:34.868
But still, Mr. Akimoto mentioned that

358
00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:37.768
he closed the shutter at 12:30 a.m.

359
00:20:37.768 --> 00:20:40.668
Besides, the pictures of the stars up to 12:30 a.m. are taken.

360
00:20:40.668 --> 00:20:43.868
So, I was wondering what was going on.

361
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.568
The picture wasn't being taken

362
00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:48.768
and yet, pictures of them exist.

363
00:20:48.768 --> 00:20:53.868
And, you, Mr. Akimoto are the only one

364
00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:56.768
who could've done something like this!

365
00:21:01.368 --> 00:21:04.068
Since when did you start suspecting me?

366
00:21:04.068 --> 00:21:06.068
When Mr. Nonaka fell,

367
00:21:06.068 --> 00:21:09.768
you made Mr. Eda call the police, didn't you?

368
00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.968
We would usually call an ambulance first.

369
00:21:11.968 --> 00:21:13.568
You made him call the police

370
00:21:13.568 --> 00:21:17.968
because you already knew that Mr. Nonaka was dead.

371
00:21:17.968 --> 00:21:20.668
You're really some girl.

372
00:21:22.068 --> 00:21:23.668
So, Mr. Akimoto,

373
00:21:23.668 --> 00:21:27.068
you never really forgave Mr. Nonaka after all.

374
00:21:29.168 --> 00:21:33.068
It was my dream to be awarded the Star Pioneer Award.

375
00:21:33.068 --> 00:21:36.668
I didn't care if the research was a joint project if to receive it.

376
00:21:36.668 --> 00:21:39.468
But that Nonaka had the nerve to hog the award all for himself.

377
00:21:39.468 --> 00:21:41.568
I could never forgive him!

378
00:21:41.568 --> 00:21:43.268
I never even noticed a shooting star

379
00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:46.968
going across the sky to the north at a little after 11 p.m.

380
00:21:46.968 --> 00:21:50.268
I was too busy looking towards Nonaka that I was going to kill,

381
00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.468
that I wasn't even looking at the sky.

382
00:23:36.168 --> 00:23:37.868
Did I sleep well?

383
00:23:39.068 --> 00:23:40.668
You're really something, Sonoko.

384
00:23:40.668 --> 00:23:42.668
Your deduction this time was as fantastic as always.

385
00:23:42.668 --> 00:23:44.468
Huh?

386
00:23:44.468 --> 00:23:46.568
It's morning already?

387
00:23:46.568 --> 00:23:48.468
Right.

388
00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:50.768
I was hoping to see a shooting star once more

389
00:23:50.768 --> 00:23:53.568
while it was still dark!

390
00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:58.468
My prince of the stars has fled!

391
00:23:58.468 --> 00:24:00.668
I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

392
00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:05.968
"Next Episode"

393
00:24:15.768 --> 00:24:19.768
This is just like the synopsis of the novel.

394
00:24:21.368 --> 00:24:23.268
The one that my father wrote a long time ago.

395
00:24:24.268 --> 00:24:26.368
That novel that never came to be...

396
00:24:27.868 --> 00:24:33.368
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 1)"

397
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.770
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.570
"The B berth"

399
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.570
Tune into the next episode!

400
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.970
An incident occurs in the night train that departs from Ueno Station!
