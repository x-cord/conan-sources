He sees the single

has the mind of an adult!

"The Popular Artists
Abduction Case (Part 1)."

13
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,339
Here it goes!

14
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:15,619
Okay! Now, let's hide!

15
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,499
Genta just had to kick it so hard...

16
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:24,369
A high schooler
playing Kick-the-Can?

17
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:28,249
And here, of all places?

18
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,369
What's with this crowd, anyway?

19
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,839
Oh! Conan-kun!

20
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,339
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,869
What are you guys doing here?

22
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,789
A concert!

23
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:43,119
We came to see
a concert at the Budokan!

24
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,309
Why the flowers?

25
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,119
Oh, these?

26
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,119
The concert starts at 6:00,

27
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:50,999
but we thought we might
meet them if we came early...

28
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,909
Because musicians usually show
up six hours before concerts!

29
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:57,619
Who's "them"?

30
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:01,369
Oh, come on! The two
from Two-Mix, obviously!

31
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,329
Two-Mix?

32
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,909
You never heard of them?!

33
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,299
It's the super-famous team of
Takayama Minami and Nagano Shiina!

34
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,629
Oh, that gaudy dance-music group?

35
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,959
That hurt!

36
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,869
Don't talk all big when
you never even listen to 'em!

37
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:22,099
Now, now! Conan-kun is still a kid!

38
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,539
Besides, remember
when we took him to karaoke?

39
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,459
Now that you mention it...

40
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,519
...he did sing pretty off-key...

41
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,749
Yep!

42
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:38,039
Just like someone else, he doesn't
seem that interested in music.

43
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,029
So, he doesn't get how good they are...

44
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,749
Well, excuse me.

45
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,499
Alright, Conan-kun!

46
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,459
What're you doing?

47
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,459
Please play seriously!

48
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,289
Sorry!

49
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:51,319
See you later!

50
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,459
Yeah.

51
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,329
Don't go with strangers!

52
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,469
Don't worry! I'm here!
We won't!

53
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,889
You're the biggest worry of all!

54
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,599
Bye!

55
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,539
There sure are a lot of people...

56
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,619
Where are they going?

57
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:10,609
Some Two-Mix concert.
Said they're gonna give 'em a bouquet--

58
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:11,629
For reals?!

59
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,269
The Two-Mix?!

60
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,779
The ones who did the
Masked Yaiba theme song?!

61
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,739
Oh, man! Not them, too...

62
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,359
Hey! Let's go check it out, too!

63
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,369
Let's!

64
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:24,159
Maybe we can get autographs!

65
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,699
Oh, geez...

66
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,809
Let's hurry!

67
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:27,659
Yeah!

68
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,629
Ow!

69
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:35,869
I'm so sorry, kids!

70
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:38,499
Watch where
you're walking, Mister!

71
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,429
You're...

72
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:45,159
...Two-Mix's Takayama Minami!

73
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,389
Did she say Takayama?

74
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,139
Takayama Minami?!

75
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:50,849
No way!

76
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,909
Say, kiddos! Ya hungry? My treat!

77
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,749
Great! Let's go!

78
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:09,919
Eat all ya want!

79
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,959
Guess that wasn't her...

80
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,129
Yeah.

81
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,789
This looks good!

82
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,929
Thanks for the food!

83
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,179
This is delicious!

84
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:32,399
Hey, what happened to
not going with strangers?

85
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,859
Geez... They ordered
all the expensive stuff...

86
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,529
You're not having any,
Minami-chan?

87
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,909
Nah! I'm not that hungry!

88
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:46,739
I should've brought more money...

89
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:51,709
But, is this okay? Don't you need
to tune up before the show?

90
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:57,249
Yeah, but my partner,
Shiina-kun, hasn't shown up,

91
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:59,419
and there's no answer
on his cell phone...

92
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:05,039
So, I snuck outside to
look around for him.

93
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,619
Why don't you try
calling him from here?

94
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:11,909
I'd like to, but I forgot
my own phone at the office.

95
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,809
And that guy's been on
the pay phone for a while...

96
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,629
Talk about bad luck...

97
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,559
Yup.

98
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,959
I've been having
lots of bad luck lately...

99
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,779
How so?

100
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,289
Like, my office locker
getting broken into,

101
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,249
or marks from someone
picking my lock at home...

102
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,829
And prank calls every day!

103
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:38,209
Some strange man who
says just one thing:

104
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,169
"Don't sing."

105
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,579
Do you think it's a stalker?

106
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,009
It is a case of foul harassment!

107
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,289
This is a job for...

108
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,729
...the Junior Detective League!

109
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,329
Thanks...

110
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,439
Consider this meal my payment...

111
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:01,109
Say, when did
this harassment start?

112
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,249
Hmm, last Sunday, I think...

113
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,949
Just after my live radio broadcast...

114
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,029
I heard that broadcast!

115
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,119
So did I!

116
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:15,119
You played part of a demo
tape of your new song, right?

117
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,539
Demo tape?

118
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,869
I can let you hear it all,
if you'd like!

119
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:20,999
Really?!

120
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,469
Here it is! The only demo
tape of it in the world!

121
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:40,429
What did you think?!

122
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,279
The lyrics and music were cool!

123
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:45,119
How about you?

124
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,789
It doesn't have any
strange voices or sounds...

125
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,119
How rude! Of course it doesn't!

126
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:53,579
Doesn't seem the harassment
is because of this tape.

127
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,249
So, what did you think?

128
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,319
I guess it was okay...

129
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,089
Ah! I figured it out!

130
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,619
You already solved the case?

131
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,619
No! It's their voices!

132
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,049
Something kept bugging me,

133
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,519
but Minami-san and
Conan-kun sound just alike!

134
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,479
Yeah, right!
Yeah, right!

135
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,909
They do!

136
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:20,449
Like two geese in a pond!

137
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,439
You mean two peas in a pod!

138
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,109
Maybe you can stand in
for me whenever I get a cold!

139
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,579
That's a bad idea.
Conan-kun is tone-deaf!

140
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,289
That's all I'm hearing today...

141
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:41,669
Aw, man. He's still on the phone.

142
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,589
You can use this!

143
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,379
Here!

144
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:47,829
What is this?

145
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,509
What a gaudy earring...

146
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,249
It's an Earring Cell Phone!

147
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,219
My friend, Professor Agasa,
made it for me!

148
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:59,139
So, I put it on my ear, right?

149
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,829
No, you dial the number before you--

150
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,359
Takayama-sama!

151
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:07,959
Is there a Takayama-sama here?

152
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,319
Oh, that's me.

153
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,459
A Nagano Shiina-sama is on the phone.

154
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,029
Thanks.

155
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:18,869
Where are you?!
They already started tuning up!

156
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:21,369
Sorry! Something came up...

157
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,039
I'm in the car out front.

158
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,709
Car?

159
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,119
Whose car is that?

160
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:33,389
I have something to show you.
Could you come here?

161
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:34,739
You have it there?

162
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,099
Y-Yeah...

163
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,019
Don't come, Minami! Stay away!

164
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,519
What? Hello?!

165
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,759
What's his deal?

166
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,869
Thank you!

167
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,029
Why is that guy...

168
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,669
Come on, Shiina-kun!
Say something, will ya?!

169
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,629
Freeze.

170
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,209
Shiina-kun!

171
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,419
Now, get in.

172
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,959
Oh no!

173
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,929
Conan-kun!

174
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,409
Minami-chan's been...

175
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:23,599
...kidnapped!

176
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:27,499
Darn it! A kidnapping
right before my eyes?!

177
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,749
Hello, this is the Budokan.

178
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:43,659
Sorry, could you repeat that?

179
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,909
I said I have Two-Mix hostage.

180
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:46,789
Huh?

181
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:50,279
If you wanna save 'em,
call the police right now.

182
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,569
Quit kidding around, will ya?

183
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,859
What was that?

184
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,799
Said he kidnapped Two-Mix.

185
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,759
Excuse me!

186
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,299
These kids claim Takayama
Minami-san was kidnapped!

187
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,019
Eh?

188
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,009
What?!

189
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,159
It's the truth!

190
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,839
We saw her get shoved into a car!

191
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,349
Save Minami-chan!

192
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,369
So that call really was...

193
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,659
This is bad!

194
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,369
Call the police immediately!

195
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:16,109
Yes, sir!

196
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,449
Looks like rain...

197
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:23,729
We're gonna get wet if
they don't start soon...

198
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,039
Police cars!

199
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,119
Did something happen?

200
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,239
Inspector! This way!

201
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,819
Split up and question
people in the area!

202
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:42,549
Yes, sir!

203
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:43,839
Okay, let's go!

204
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,419
Yes, sir!

205
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,729
So, Takayama Minami-san
left by herself?

206
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:58,689
Yes. We couldn't contact Nagano-kun,
so she went to look around.

207
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,699
Afterwards, while dining
with you children,

208
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:05,159
she was called outside and kidnapped?

209
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,699
Yeah. After she got
the call and went outside,

210
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:12,369
the man behind her
pushed her inside the car!

211
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:15,209
What?! So you saw the
kidnapper?!

212
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,989
Yeah! He was as tall
as old man Mori...

213
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,529
...and was wearing
a ski hat and a scarf!

214
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,779
And round sunglasses!

215
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,989
He had long, frizzy hair
and a mustache!

216
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:30,679
But, it could be a disguise!
And there were at least two kidnappers!

217
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,139
Huh? How do you know that?

218
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:37,489
After the man pushed her
into the back seat of the car,

219
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,449
he got into the passenger seat!

220
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,739
In other words,
someone else was driving!

221
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:46,659
I see. And then you got the call.

222
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:51,619
Yes. They said they had kidnapped
Two-Mix and to call the police...

223
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,739
What exactly are they planning?

224
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,489
You'd expect them to say
not to call the police...

225
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,639
Perhaps they're really confident?

226
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,589
Or...

227
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,049
Or, they never intended to release
their hostages from the start!

228
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,009
That's terrible...

229
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,409
Inspector! It's them!

230
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,809
Get ready to trace it!

231
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,189
Well, you have the honors.

232
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,769
Right...

233
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,189
Don't worry. Just stay calm.

234
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:27,279
Alright. Try not to
agitate the kidnappers.

235
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,569
Agree to all their demands.

236
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:32,199
And stall them as long as possible.

237
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,699
Right.

238
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:36,909
Go ahead.

239
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,089
Hello...

240
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:41,709
Yes.

241
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,339
Alright.

242
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,799
Inspector, he wants to talk
to the officer in charge.

243
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,699
Alright. Hand it here.

244
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,139
Put it on speaker.

245
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:58,369
Hello? This is Inspector Megure.

246
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,019
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!

247
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:05,189
It's a real honor to have the
Section 1 inspector on the case!

248
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,699
How are they?!

249
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,989
Don't worry. They're taking
a little nap together.

250
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,699
What is it you want?! Money?! Or maybe--

251
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,029
Money?

252
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,329
I'm not interested in that.

253
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:22,489
I'm one of those so-called stalkers.

254
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:25,819
I want everything that's related to them.

255
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:30,589
Yes, like the bag she forgot
at the restaurant, for example...

256
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,929
Bag?!

257
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,519
This?!

258
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,739
Alright! I'll have
one of my men deliver--

259
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,979
Don't mock my intelligence.

260
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:44,149
The brats. Have them bring it.

261
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,989
You can't mean...

262
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:50,659
...those four brats who were
eating with Minami-chan.

263
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,529
But...

264
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,159
There's no time to be hesitant.

265
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,159
I have two hostages here.

266
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,579
I wouldn't care one bit if one
of them went on to the afterlife.

267
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,239
Just get those four
runts to bring the bag!

268
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,869
No! I can't put children in
such a dangerous situation!

269
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:19,369
I'm sorry, but I can't
accept that demand!

270
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,229
Is that so?

271
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,369
Then I have no choice.

272
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:30,029
Guess I'll turn Two-Mix into
One-Mix and then get back to you.

273
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,239
Wait!

274
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,159
Alright!

275
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,129
We'll take you your bag!

276
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:36,659
Yeah, Conan's right!

277
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,529
We can't just sit around while
Two-Mix is being held captive!

278
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:41,959
I'll try my hardest!

279
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,699
Hold on, now...

280
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,749
Great, then it's decided.

281
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:46,819
Hold on!

282
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,409
In fifteen minutes, I'll call
a phone at Kudanshita Station.

283
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,479
Wait...

284
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:55,569
If even one of 'em is late,
I'll start blastin' people!

285
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:58,659
You get a trace?!

286
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,029
I know they're in
the direction of Haido,

287
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,029
but he was calling from a moving
car so I can't pinpoint him...

288
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:11,739
Alright. Contact HQ at once and get
a list of all suspects still at large

289
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:13,609
from recent cases of mine!

290
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:16,069
Yes, sir! But why...

291
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,989
The kidnapper knew my name,

292
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:23,159
and hid his speech behind
a voice-changer and polite talk!

293
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,619
It's likely that
I investigated him before!

294
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,549
Right!

295
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:27,539
Conan-kun.

296
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:28,669
Yes?

297
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:34,639
I want you to promise me you
won't do anything dangerous.

298
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,659
I promise.

299
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,029
Run away if you
think you're in danger!

300
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:38,849
Got it!

301
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,309
Do you understand, too?!

302
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,769
Um... What should I do
about the concert?

303
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,389
Cancel it!

304
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,189
That's not necessary!

305
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,859
We'll rescue them before the
concert starts, so just hold on!

306
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,659
Hello?!

307
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,699
Good. Now get on
the Toei-Shinjuku Line

308
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,949
and answer the phone on
Platform 13 at Shinjuku Station

309
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,639
on the Yamanote Line in fifteen minutes!

310
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:19,349
I dropped the bag in a gutter earlier...

311
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,169
You dropped it in a gutter?

312
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,739
Hey! Is the tape alright?!

313
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:27,059
You idiot! Have you forgotten
we want the tape destroyed?!

314
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,869
Oh, yeah...

315
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:31,979
So, they are after the demo tape!

316
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,779
Fifteen minutes, now! Don't be late!

317
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,199
But, why make the kids bring it?
Especially with police escorts?

318
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,659
Tell cops not to come
and they'll come anyway.

319
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:49,169
Plus, with four kids, they'll assume
they'll never lose sight of 'em.

320
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:52,129
We'll use that to our advantage.

321
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,389
What are you doing?

322
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:01,099
Writing the lyrics on the demo tape.

323
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,869
The kidnappers are after this tape.

324
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:06,639
I can't find any strange sounds on it...

325
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,369
In which case, there has
to be a keyword in these lyrics

326
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:13,109
that poses a problem for those guys!

327
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,569
Inspector. We just got word

328
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,159
that the kidnappers' car was
abandoned by the Teimuzu River!

329
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
Damn! They switched cars!

330
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,709
Which means those four kids
are our only hope now...

331
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,639
I'm dead tired...

332
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,239
All we've been doing is going
around the Yamanote Line...

333
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,559
Do you suppose they're toying with us?

334
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,739
No, they're just
waiting for their chance!

335
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:59,529
The moment the
police lose sight of us!

336
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,499
Give the tape to someone else?

337
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:09,159
Yeah. I'll call back in three minutes.

338
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:14,039
Hand it over in the bathroom
and make sure the cops don't find out.

339
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,739
This is weird!

340
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,699
Who did he say
to give the tape to?!

341
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,009
Tell us, Conan-kun!

342
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,989
Say, when Two-Mix played
this tape on the radio,

343
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:25,819
did they mention anything else?

344
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:26,549
Not really.

345
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:30,979
They did say they thought up the
lyrics when they passed by a temple...

346
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,989
Shoenji Temple, I think...

347
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,189
Shoenji?!

348
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:40,609
Wait! That's near where that murder
happened last New Year's Eve!

349
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:44,909
That was when some creep
with a gun attacked a man

350
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,619
but was killed when it went
off during the struggle...

351
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,579
I'm pretty sure the man was
acquitted for self-defense reasons...

352
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:58,549
Now I know why they want this tape!

353
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:00,369
It's almost time!

354
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,509
We gotta hurry...

355
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,969
Wait! I have a good idea!

356
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:13,229
The phone's ringing.
The kids are picking it up.

357
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:17,239
That's the plan.
That'll get rid of those cops.

358
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,189
Don't screw up, now!

359
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:24,659
The doors are about to close.
Please be careful.

360
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,419
Ayumi!

361
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:32,899
Are you alright, little girl?

362
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,589
Yes...

363
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,209
Anyone manage to get on?!

364
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:39,039
Just us two...

365
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,419
How about the kidnappers?

366
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,909
No, nobody yet...

367
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,759
The kids are throwing
the bag out the window!

368
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,179
There!

369
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:51,239
So, that was the plan!

370
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:55,729
OK! You watch the kids!
We're heading for the bag!

371
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,609
Ok! Let's move!

372
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,149
Huh? Where's that girl...

373
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,569
Wait! Your guys' work is done!

374
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,029
You don't need to run away!

375
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,699
Stop, little boy...

376
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:11,239
Eek!

377
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,869
"Eek"?

378
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,639
Anyone gotten near the bag?

379
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,759
No one, so far.

380
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:36,739
Hello?

381
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:39,529
Good work, little girl.

382
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,499
There aren't any cops around, I hope?

383
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,029
No, there doesn't
seem to be anyone...

384
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:46,989
Perfect.

385
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,299
Ready to come, like I told ya?

386
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,279
Yeah...

387
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,449
I'll try my hardest!

388
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:58,079
What?! Conan-kun and
Ayumi-kun switched places?!

389
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,039
My word...

390
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,519
Are these your "Tracking Glasses"?

391
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,819
Conan-kun...

392
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:50,979
You guys!

393
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,939
What're you doing here?!

394
00:23:54,189 --> 00:23:57,479
You idiots! Why didn't you give
the glasses to the police?!

395
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,649
We just wanted--

396
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,699
You'll have plenty of time to fight...

397
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,369
in the afterlife!

398
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:09,679
On the next Conan:

399
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,249
"The Popular Artists
Abduction Case (Part 2)."
