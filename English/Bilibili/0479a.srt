Really! This place is bustling with the cherry blossom festival too,

22
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,129
so I'm glad we came here!

23
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,433
Yep, thanks, Ran!

24
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,835
Shouldn't you be thanking Detective Kogoro Mouri here,

25
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,438
who suddenly gets a call from a high school student from Osaka

26
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:16,339
saying that she wants to go flower viewing

27
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,942
and speeds her over here from early in the morning

28
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:21,345
to grant her wish, huh?

29
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,947
-Yes. -I know!

30
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:26,750
Well, there seems to be people who rather than feel gratitude

31
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,153
prefer bread to the song of birds though.

32
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:33,557
Oh boy, I mean Heiji's the one who wanted to go flower viewing.

33
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,426
Hey, Kazuha!

34
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,128
This pinwheel is cute!

35
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,831
Really! I'm going to buy one.

36
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,332
How much, sir?

37
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,533
200 yen.

38
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,335
Oh, one for me too.

39
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:01,451
Hey, what're you doing standing there doing nothing!

40
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:05,155
You called me over because you wanted something, right?

41
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:06,356
Oh, yeah.

42
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:10,327
Something about a high school student wearing glasses.

43
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:13,230
Oh, right, Eisuke Hondo.

44
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,734
He's a junior in high school and is Ran's classmate.

45
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,936
I wonder if you could check on something for me.

46
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,239
Huh? Why me?

47
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,641
Does he have something to do with Osaka?

48
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,143
No, the one I want you to check on

49
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,246
is the one whose eyes resemble that of this Eisuke Hondo guy

50
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,148
and is a member of the Black Organization

51
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,350
Rena Mizunashi!

52
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,954
Mizunashi is an announcer for Nichiuri TV, isn't she?

53
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,456
She seems to be on leave right now,

54
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,425
but you mean she's a bad person?

55
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,728
Hattori!

56
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,430
You're talking too loud! Hey!

57
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,335
She's on leave because she got into an accident

58
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,738
during a chase with the F.B.I. and was hurt badly.

59
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,741
She's in a certain hospital right now and lying unconscious there.

60
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,342
And?

61
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,645
The more so, then why me?

62
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:04,247
If you want somebody to check, why not ask that thin,

63
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,850
what was his name? Officer Takagi.

64
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,252
A picture.

65
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:13,256
The picture of a woman who looks exactly like Rena Mizunashi

66
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,225
was coincidentally taken 10 years ago

67
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:18,228
seems to have been uploaded on a website for some time.

68
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,830
The woman was standing in front of Tsutenkaku,

69
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,632
carrying a convenience store shopping bag!

70
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:27,037
Which means that the woman was living in Osaka?

71
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,239
I can't come to any conclusion yet

72
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:32,342
but I tried contacting the TV station to confirm thing with her.

73
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:34,444
However, a few days after I wrote,

74
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:37,147
the website was closed.

75
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,850
Something's fishy, don't you think?

76
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,452
That's why I want you to hurry and check things out for me.

77
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,653
Make sure Eisuke Hondo

78
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,957
who's sniffing around about her doesn't beat you to it!

79
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:50,227
If so, wouldn't it be faster for you

80
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:55,131
to nab that Hondo guy and make him spit it out?

81
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,734
If those two look alike, they may be blood related,

82
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,737
and she may be a villain too.

83
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:04,341
No, I don't think they're family.

84
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,343
I can't help feeling that

85
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,945
something about the way Eisuke Hondo acts is strange.

86
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,847
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

87
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,649
It's an honor to get to see you!

88
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,353
See! Just like there was no scratch there to begin with!

89
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:22,626
A new student who suddenly transferred and came to Ran's high school.

90
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:26,429
Which means that Rena Mizunashi whose eyes resemble his is...

91
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:30,033
Yeah, a member of the Black Organization.

92
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,334
They probably changed the face of one of their members

93
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,537
with plastic surgery to one of Eisuke Hondo's family

94
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:37,240
and became that person, quite an easy feat for them to accomplish.

95
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,243
At any rate, please have Inspector Ohtaki

96
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:43,146
check carefully and in secret

97
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,749
whether there was a woman named Mizunashi or Hondo

98
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:47,350
living in Osaka or not.

99
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,754
I see. If that woman really existed

100
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:54,724
and a case of a woman suddenly disappearing is found, it's bingo.

101
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,827
It really disappeared!

102
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,031
Just as if she was spirited away!

103
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:05,635
It's probably some work of fate that I ran into you here.

104
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:06,836
Please, I beg you.

105
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,039
Will you please solve the mystery of this case?

106
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,540
-Well... -What?

107
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,142
What's the matter, Pops?

108
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,145
This monk suddenly...

109
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:18,248
What? A person disappeared?

110
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:24,854
Yes. I'm a disciple at that temple, my name is Denkyu.

111
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:28,825
A person who came to visit the head monk the other day

112
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:32,128
suddenly disappeared from the room.

113
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,332
Suddenly?

114
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:38,535
She was a woman with long hair,

115
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:41,037
and spent the night at the annex.

116
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:44,841
But, when I went to tell her that breakfast was ready...

117
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,743
She was gone?

118
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,746
Maybe she decided to go home before eating breakfast?

119
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:54,150
No, she was actually in the room at that time

120
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,952
but I found her stabbed in the stomach with a knife,

121
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,054
dead and lying on the floor.

122
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,624
-What? -Are you saying that she was dead?

123
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,125
Yes.

124
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,527
Did you report it to the police?

125
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:05,629
Of course,

126
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,232
right after I let the head monk who was resting at the temple know.

127
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:12,635
Then, don't tell me that the one who disappeared is...

128
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,639
Yes, when the police came and arrived at the annex,

129
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,442
only the head monk was in the room.

130
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:23,046
There were no signs of the woman

131
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:26,049
nor the blood stain that was on the tatami.

132
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:27,050
No...

133
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,153
And, what did the head monk say?

134
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,256
That the visitor left early in the morning,

135
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,425
and that maybe I was dreaming.

136
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,727
Are you sure you really weren't still half asleep?

137
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:41,331
No way. I really saw it with my own eyes!

138
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,835
Okay, if you insist, let's go to the temple

139
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,738
and hear what the head monk has to say, then.

140
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,844
You're that famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

141
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,546
"Shakuren" -What brings a famed person like you

142
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,548
"A Buddhist priest" -all the way up

143
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,350
to a small mountain temple like this?

144
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,354
Well, you see, Denkyu, a disciple of your temple...

145
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,555
Oh...

146
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:09,325
You want to know about that dream story of Denkyu

147
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:13,029
about the visitor who came here and disappeared out of the blue?

148
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,531
Well, sort of...

149
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,535
Well, to be honest, we just came to check things out.

150
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,538
To confirm whether what this monk saw was just an illusion

151
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:26,643
or whether you cleaned the corpse and everything up

152
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:29,746
before the police got here.

153
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,347
Heiji!

154
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:36,052
You have quite an interesting point of view, young man.

155
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,457
All right, let me take you over to the annex in question.

156
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:48,531
To the room that Denkyu insists swallowed up one whole person.

157
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:57,140
It sure takes a while to get to that annex, doesn't it?

158
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,944
Wow! The temple looks to be so far away already.

159
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,545
You can say that again!

160
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,348
There it is.

161
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:07,050
That's it.

162
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,652
It sure is an old looking building.

163
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:13,957
Yes, it's already been 50 years since it was built.

164
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,029
Please do come in.

165
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,034
One room is 8-mats and there are 4 room all together.

166
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:28,438
And, where's the place that woman's body was found?

167
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,841
Right around there to the upper right of this room.

168
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,746
-Well? -Nothing.

169
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:40,049
It's not a reversible mat either.

170
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,653
Oh, a statue of Buddha.

171
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,155
Guardians of the temple?

172
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:49,125
That's one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Tamonten.

173
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:52,228
This room facing north is called Tamonten.

174
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,631
To the west is Koumokuten,

175
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,933
the south Zoujyoten

176
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,135
and the east Jikokuten.

177
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,638
A Buddhist statue is inside each of the rooms.

178
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,441
Oh, you may touch it but please don't scratch it.

179
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,044
After all, the Buddhist statues are precious statues

180
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:11,147
that have been handed down to Shokakuji from one generation to the next.

181
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,349
Oh, is that right?

182
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,152
Well, it's already late today.

183
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,455
I suggest that you spend the night here tonight,

184
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,225
and start investigations tomorrow at dawn?

185
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:26,529
That is, only if you feel that you have more to check on.

186
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,131
Oh...

187
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:31,935
Are you serious about spending the night here at this temple?

188
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,836
I'm sure that it's only that the monk was half awake

189
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,538
and made a mistake!

190
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:39,042
That's right, so let's all head back to Ran's place.

191
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,047
It's you.

192
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:48,651
This time, in the middle of the room of the annex...

193
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:51,454
There's a woman with a knife stabbed through her stomach!

194
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,524
Is it in the same room?

195
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,026
Yes. Exactly the same as back then.

196
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:04,634
There's nobody here?

197
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,136
It can't be.

198
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,538
It was here for sure a while ago.

199
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,341
I guess I'll have to tell you about it after all.

200
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,042
Osho!

201
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,847
The fact is, there was no visitor at this temple on that day.

202
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,550
I've got to also so add that you were just chasing

203
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,854
the shadow of your mother who passed on long ago.

204
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,457
Oh, no...

205
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,025
No.

206
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,058
"Red. Disappeared Bloodstain" -I saw it with my very eyes.

207
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,359
"Red. Disappeared Bloodstain" -I'm trying to tell you that

208
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:59,965
it's all an illusion you imagined because you miss your mother.

209
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,266
It can't be...

210
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,969
Your poor mother who threw herself in the ocean

211
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,572
after bringing you here to this temple, and placing you in my custody.

212
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:08,773
In your custody?

213
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:11,376
Yes, Denkyu here is an abandoned child,

214
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,578
whom I, who had just become the head priest of this temple

215
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,781
adopted and brought up for 18 years.

216
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:19,351
I'm not good at refusing

217
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:22,254
and have ended up raising 2 or 3 others too.

218
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:25,657
But, it seems that they didn't like it here and left,

219
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,360
so only Denkyu and I are at this temple now.

220
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,861
Even after being apart so long,

221
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,264
Denkyu can't forget about his dear mother.

222
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:34,566
Which means that just like you say,

223
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:38,570
the dead body of the woman Denkyu says he saw the other day was...

224
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,974
Right, we didn't even have visitors that day.

225
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:45,277
However, three days ago, that morning,

226
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:49,281
Denkyu ran in here looking pale.

227
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,349
I thought that maybe someone who got lost in the mountains

228
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,452
came uninvited to this annex

229
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,855
and came here to check.

230
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,558
But, just like tonight, there was no one here.

231
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:04,162
Yes, I felt sorry for Denkyu who insisted on seeing such an illusion that

232
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:06,164
when the police came,

233
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:08,867
I went along with his story without thinking,

234
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,771
saying that a woman visitor came here early in the morning.

235
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:15,674
So, now has the mystery been solved?

236
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,275
Well, sort of.

237
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,877
No.

238
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:23,381
I'm sure the woman was here in this room

239
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:27,352
at least three days ago, when Denkyu said he saw her.

240
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:31,656
Do you or Denkyu like to dress yourselves in woman's clothes?

241
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,258
Woman's clothes?

242
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:35,860
You! What stupid thing are you talking about?

243
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,563
Look what I found.

244
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,065
See!

245
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,867
This is the back catch of a pierced earring?

246
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,369
When we were checking to see

247
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:47,172
if the tatami of this room was double matted

248
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,374
and flipped it over,

249
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:51,576
this kid found it.

250
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,279
The back catch of pierced earrings easily come off

251
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,081
so it probably came off accidentally

252
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,751
and got stuck in between the tatami

253
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,755
but the problem is, whose pierce it is?

254
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,657
We've got to track down who the owner of this pierce back catch

255
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:09,661
that is still shiny as if it hasn't been here for long after it came off.

256
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,162
Come to think of it.

257
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:12,764
The woman that came three days ago also

258
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,666
wore pierced earrings!

259
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,169
Then, the answers simple!

260
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:20,872
The one who Denkyu saw was not an illusion.

261
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:22,173
No.

262
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:24,576
The one who was wearing the earring

263
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,077
was probably either Bunkyu or Rinkyu

264
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:31,149
who were disciples here at this temple until two months ago.

265
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,051
Bunkyu and Rinkyu?

266
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,553
Remember, I mentioned a while ago that

267
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:39,457
I adopted two other children besides Denkyu.

268
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:43,962
Unlike Denkyu, they were both forever prone to mischief.

269
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,866
They used to sneak out of the temple night after night and go to town.

270
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,067
Moreover, they used to disguise themselves as women

271
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,569
so people wouldn't suspect them to be monks.

272
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,971
Disguise?

273
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,174
Yes. I don't know where they got a hold of it

274
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,077
but they wore a wig, pierced earrings and a long dress,

275
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:02,580
just like those the young people wear nowadays.

276
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,182
Is that true?

277
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:05,750
Yes.

278
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,552
Those two used to frequently drink liquor

279
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:10,055
secretly in this annex too.

280
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:13,258
Osho found out about it, and the two had a good scolding.

281
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:18,263
They didn't like it, so they both left this temple together.

282
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:22,667
They seem to have been using this annex to change clothes and all,

283
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,870
so the backing must've accidentally come off.

284
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,773
So, that's the story! Convinced?

285
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,878
You still don't look convinced, I see.

286
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,382
Then do check things out for yourselves to your heart's content.

287
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:38,650
If as Denkyu says

288
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,153
there was a blood smeared corpse in the middle of the room,

289
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:46,758
the blood should be found somewhere on the tatami.

290
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:50,261
Ran.

291
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,963
Don't you think Heiji and the others are a bit late?

292
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:55,567
Yeah, I wonder if something happened.

293
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,070
Okay, Ran, wait here then! I'll go check!

294
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,272
Oh, I'll go too, then!

295
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,449
Don't you think that it's better for us

296
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:15,453
to just wait here without moving after all, Ran?

297
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,655
I guess so.

298
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:43,181
Around where on the floor was that woman?

299
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,551
Oh, yes. She was right around here three days ago,

300
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:49,354
lying on the floor like this.

301
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:52,557
Then, what about the woman you saw a while ago?

302
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,659
In the middle of the room,

303
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,161
like so.

304
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,563
Was there a lot of blood?

305
00:18:58,563 --> 00:18:59,864
Yeah.

306
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:01,766
Three days ago as well as tonight,

307
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,569
there was a lot of bleeding from the stomach.

308
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,173
Then, 10 to 1 it's not possible.

309
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,675
Maybe possible with the corpse he saw yesterday.

310
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:15,079
But if the corpse he saw lying there just a while ago is real,

311
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,950
there should be a blood stained tatami on the side

312
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,954
but even looks around now, there's no such tatami around!

313
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,456
You think so too. Did I actually see

314
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:29,861
an illusion of my mother that never existed in the first place after all?

315
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:34,065
So, are you convinced now?

316
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,967
Yes, very.

317
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,170
Then, Denkyu, please show these people to the gate.

318
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,171
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,174
I'll stay here in this room for a while

320
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,076
and offer prayer to the Four Heavenly Kings

321
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:49,080
in apology of having been a bit of a nuisance with all the fuss here.

322
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,752
I'm sorry for keeping you here for so long because of my mistake.

323
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:59,257
No, don't be, but why were you there at that time in that annex?

324
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,059
I always go and check to see

325
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,761
if the doors are locked before dinner.

326
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,865
Bunkyu and Rinkyu

327
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:11,970
were actually in charge of cleaning and locking the annex up.

328
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,771
But, after their drinking incident,

329
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:18,076
Osho did the cleaning and I was in charge of locking up.

330
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,078
Not only did they drink liquor,

331
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,881
but I'll be the two were also smoking in there too?

332
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,849
How do you know?

333
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,454
They both said they succeeded in smoking secretly.

334
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:31,055
What a conspicuous secret.

335
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:34,659
There was an obviously burnt spot on the tatami.

336
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:37,762
Come to think of it, there were remains of spilt beer too.

337
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:41,766
Yeah but what I don't understand is why both the remains...

338
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:45,470
They weren't there when we checked at sundown today.

339
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,472
Right, Heiji?

340
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:49,374
-Right! -Don't tell me that

341
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,477
someone switched the tatami?

342
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:55,079
I'm just saying that it's possible.

343
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,681
No way.

344
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm sure you guys already know if you checked too,

345
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,954
but the tatami at the annex was not double-sided,

346
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:06,958
and besides, it was old and discolored from the sun.

347
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,359
Even if a tatami from someplace else

348
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,161
were to have been brought in and replaced,

349
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,764
the discoloration would make it apparent.

350
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:15,767
You mean switching isn't possible?

351
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:19,771
Switching the tatami of one of the four 8-mat floors.

352
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,673
To go from Pop's car to that annex

353
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:24,175
would take 7 to 8 minutes going and coming back,

354
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:27,178
if you run, that's enough time to switch the tatami!

355
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:30,081
Come to think of it, something always felt different from usual,

356
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,849
each time I found the bodies.

357
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,351
Right? I'll bet

358
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:35,653
the direction the tatami is placed or something is different?

359
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:38,556
Oh, but it's only that I have this feeling.

360
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:40,959
No matter how you replace the tatami,

361
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,260
you can't hide the blood stain.

362
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,163
If the body was lying smeared with blood in the middle of the room,

363
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:49,767
there should be blood on more than two tatamis!

364
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,069
Well, the only thing that did look suspicious

365
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:54,973
were the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings in the corner of the rooms

366
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:57,575
but they were inside transparent glass cases.

367
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:01,379
When the statue was moved, the tatami under it was in view,

368
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,681
so the blood couldn't have been hidden.

369
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,750
Let's pull out, pull out!

370
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,253
I can't be wasting my time on this silly story!

371
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,958
Huh? A mistake?

372
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,961
Are you saying that there was no corpse?

373
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,764
No, it was this monk's illusion.

374
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:21,065
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:24,469
But, I'm glad that nobody was dead then.

376
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,572
Okay, hurry and get in then, so we can head back to Ran's house.

377
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:29,674
The pinwheel.

378
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,476
Oh no, I squashed it.

379
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,178
It's okay, because it's not all that bent out of shape.

380
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:35,580
Why?

381
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,249
Why did the burnt remain that wasn't there at sundown

382
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:41,052
appear suddenly at night?

383
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:43,054
It was hidden out of sight?

384
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,756
But, where?

385
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,061
Heiji...

386
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:57,168
Hey, you...

387
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,875
This is it! This!

388
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,477
I've figured out where the blood stain is hidden!

389
00:23:06,477 --> 00:23:08,680
Yeah, I thought of that too!

390
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,481
Yeah,

391
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,450
completely!
