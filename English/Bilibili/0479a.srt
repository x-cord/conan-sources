Really! This place is bustling with the cherry blossom festival too,

22
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,124
so I'm glad we came here!

23
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:09,424
Yep, thanks, Ran!

24
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,824
Shouldn't you be thanking Detective Kogoro Mouri here,

25
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,424
who suddenly gets a call from a high school student from Osaka

26
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:16,324
saying that she wants to go flower viewing

27
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,924
and speeds her over here from early in the morning

28
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:21,324
to grant her wish, huh?

29
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:23,924
-Yes. -I know!

30
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:26,724
Well, there seems to be people who rather than feel gratitude

31
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,124
prefer bread to the song of birds though.

32
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:33,524
Oh boy, I mean Heiji's the one who wanted to go flower viewing.

33
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,424
Hey, Kazuha!

34
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,124
This pinwheel is cute!

35
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,824
Really! I'm going to buy one.

36
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,324
How much, sir?

37
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,524
200 yen.

38
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,324
Oh, one for me too.

39
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:01,424
Hey, what're you doing standing there doing nothing!

40
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:05,124
You called me over because you wanted something, right?

41
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:06,324
Oh, yeah.

42
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:10,324
Something about a high school student wearing glasses.

43
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:13,224
Oh, right, Eisuke Hondo.

44
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:17,724
He's a junior in high school and is Ran's classmate.

45
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,924
I wonder if you could check on something for me.

46
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:22,224
Huh? Why me?

47
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,624
Does he have something to do with Osaka?

48
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,124
No, the one I want you to check on

49
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:29,224
is the one whose eyes resemble that of this Eisuke Hondo guy

50
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:31,124
and is a member of the Black Organization

51
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,324
Rena Mizunashi!

52
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:37,924
Mizunashi is an announcer for Nichiuri TV, isn't she?

53
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,424
She seems to be on leave right now,

54
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,424
but you mean she's a bad person?

55
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,724
Hattori!

56
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:46,424
You're talking too loud! Hey!

57
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:52,324
She's on leave because she got into an accident

58
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:54,724
during a chase with the F.B.I. and was hurt badly.

59
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:57,724
She's in a certain hospital right now and lying unconscious there.

60
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,324
And?

61
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,624
The more so, then why me?

62
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:04,224
If you want somebody to check, why not ask that thin,

63
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,824
what was his name? Officer Takagi.

64
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,224
A picture.

65
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:13,224
The picture of a woman who looks exactly like Rena Mizunashi

66
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,224
was coincidentally taken 10 years ago

67
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:18,224
seems to have been uploaded on a website for some time.

68
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,824
The woman was standing in front of Tsutenkaku,

69
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:22,624
carrying a convenience store shopping bag!

70
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:27,024
Which means that the woman was living in Osaka?

71
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:29,224
I can't come to any conclusion yet

72
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:32,324
but I tried contacting the TV station to confirm thing with her.

73
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,424
However, a few days after I wrote,

74
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:37,124
the website was closed.

75
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:39,824
Something's fishy, don't you think?

76
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,424
That's why I want you to hurry and check things out for me.

77
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,624
Make sure Eisuke Hondo

78
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:46,924
who's sniffing around about her doesn't beat you to it!

79
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:50,224
If so, wouldn't it be faster for you

80
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:55,124
to nab that Hondo guy and make him spit it out?

81
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,724
If those two look alike, they may be blood related,

82
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:00,724
and she may be a villain too.

83
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:04,324
No, I don't think they're family.

84
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,324
I can't help feeling that

85
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:08,924
something about the way Eisuke Hondo acts is strange.

86
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:10,824
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

87
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:12,624
It's an honor to get to see you!

88
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:16,324
See! Just like there was no scratch there to begin with!

89
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,624
A new student who suddenly transferred and came to Ran's high school.

90
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:26,424
Which means that Rena Mizunashi whose eyes resemble his is...

91
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:30,024
Yeah, a member of the Black Organization.

92
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,324
They probably changed the face of one of their members

93
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,524
with plastic surgery to one of Eisuke Hondo's family

94
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:37,224
and became that person, quite an easy feat for them to accomplish.

95
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,224
At any rate, please have Inspector Ohtaki

96
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:43,124
check carefully and in secret

97
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:45,724
whether there was a woman named Mizunashi or Hondo

98
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:47,324
living in Osaka or not.

99
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:50,724
I see. If that woman really existed

100
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:54,724
and a case of a woman suddenly disappearing is found, it's bingo.

101
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,824
It really disappeared!

102
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:01,024
Just as if she was spirited away!

103
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:05,624
It's probably some work of fate that I ran into you here.

104
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:06,824
Please, I beg you.

105
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:09,024
Will you please solve the mystery of this case?

106
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:10,524
-Well... -What?

107
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,124
What's the matter, Pops?

108
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,124
This monk suddenly...

109
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:18,224
What? A person disappeared?

110
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:24,824
Yes. I'm a disciple at that temple, my name is Denkyu.

111
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,824
A person who came to visit the head monk the other day

112
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:32,124
suddenly disappeared from the room.

113
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,324
Suddenly?

114
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:38,524
She was a woman with long hair,

115
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:41,024
and spent the night at the annex.

116
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:44,824
But, when I went to tell her that breakfast was ready...

117
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,724
She was gone?

118
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,724
Maybe she decided to go home before eating breakfast?

119
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:54,124
No, she was actually in the room at that time

120
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:55,924
but I found her stabbed in the stomach with a knife,

121
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:58,024
dead and lying on the floor.

122
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:00,624
-What? -Are you saying that she was dead?

123
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,124
Yes.

124
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,524
Did you report it to the police?

125
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:05,624
Of course,

126
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:09,224
right after I let the head monk who was resting at the temple know.

127
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:12,624
Then, don't tell me that the one who disappeared is...

128
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:16,624
Yes, when the police came and arrived at the annex,

129
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,424
only the head monk was in the room.

130
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:23,024
There were no signs of the woman

131
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:26,024
nor the blood stain that was on the tatami.

132
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,024
No...

133
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,124
And, what did the head monk say?

134
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:33,224
That the visitor left early in the morning,

135
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:35,424
and that maybe I was dreaming.

136
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,724
Are you sure you really weren't still half asleep?

137
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:41,324
No way. I really saw it with my own eyes!

138
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:45,824
Okay, if you insist, let's go to the temple

139
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,724
and hear what the head monk has to say, then.

140
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:54,824
You're that famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

141
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:56,524
"Shakuren" -What brings a famed person like you

142
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:58,524
"A Buddhist priest" -all the way up

143
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,324
to a small mountain temple like this?

144
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:04,324
Well, you see, Denkyu, a disciple of your temple...

145
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,524
Oh...

146
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:09,324
You want to know about that dream story of Denkyu

147
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:13,024
about the visitor who came here and disappeared out of the blue?

148
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:14,524
Well, sort of...

149
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:18,524
Well, to be honest, we just came to check things out.

150
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:21,524
To confirm whether what this monk saw was just an illusion

151
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:26,624
or whether you cleaned the corpse and everything up

152
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,724
before the police got here.

153
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:31,324
Heiji!

154
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:36,024
You have quite an interesting point of view, young man.

155
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:40,424
All right, let me take you over to the annex in question.

156
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:48,524
To the room that Denkyu insists swallowed up one whole person.

157
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:57,124
It sure takes a while to get to that annex, doesn't it?

158
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:00,924
Wow! The temple looks to be so far away already.

159
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,524
You can say that again!

160
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:05,324
There it is.

161
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:07,024
That's it.

162
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,624
It sure is an old looking building.

163
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:13,924
Yes, it's already been 50 years since it was built.

164
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,024
Please do come in.

165
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:25,024
One room is 8-mats and there are 4 room all together.

166
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:28,424
And, where's the place that woman's body was found?

167
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:31,824
Right around there to the upper right of this room.

168
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,724
-Well? -Nothing.

169
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:40,024
It's not a reversible mat either.

170
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:43,624
Oh, a statue of Buddha.

171
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:45,124
Guardians of the temple?

172
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:49,124
That's one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Tamonten.

173
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:52,224
This room facing north is called Tamonten.

174
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:54,624
To the west is Koumokuten,

175
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,924
the south Zoujyoten

176
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,124
and the east Jikokuten.

177
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:01,624
A Buddhist statue is inside each of the rooms.

178
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:05,424
Oh, you may touch it but please don't scratch it.

179
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,024
After all, the Buddhist statues are precious statues

180
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:11,124
that have been handed down to Shokakuji from one generation to the next.

181
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:13,324
Oh, is that right?

182
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:16,124
Well, it's already late today.

183
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:19,424
I suggest that you spend the night here tonight,

184
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,224
and start investigations tomorrow at dawn?

185
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:26,524
That is, only if you feel that you have more to check on.

186
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:28,124
Oh...

187
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:31,924
Are you serious about spending the night here at this temple?

188
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:33,824
I'm sure that it's only that the monk was half awake

189
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:35,524
and made a mistake!

190
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:39,024
That's right, so let's all head back to Ran's place.

191
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:44,024
It's you.

192
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:48,624
This time, in the middle of the room of the annex...

193
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,424
There's a woman with a knife stabbed through her stomach!

194
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,524
Is it in the same room?

195
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,024
Yes. Exactly the same as back then.

196
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,624
There's nobody here?

197
00:13:04,624 --> 00:13:07,124
It can't be.

198
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,524
It was here for sure a while ago.

199
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:11,324
I guess I'll have to tell you about it after all.

200
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,024
Osho!

201
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:17,824
The fact is, there was no visitor at this temple on that day.

202
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,524
I've got to also so add that you were just chasing

203
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:24,824
the shadow of your mother who passed on long ago.

204
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,424
Oh, no...

205
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,024
No.

206
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:39,488
after bringing you here to this temple, and placing you in my custody.

207
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:40,688
In your custody?

208
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,288
Yes, Denkyu here is an abandoned child,

209
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,488
whom I, who had just become the head priest of this temple

210
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:48,688
adopted and brought up for 18 years.

211
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:51,288
I'm not good at refusing

212
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,188
and have ended up raising 2 or 3 others too.

213
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,588
But, it seems that they didn't like it here and left,

214
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:00,288
so only Denkyu and I are at this temple now.

215
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,788
Even after being apart so long,

216
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:04,188
Denkyu can't forget about his dear mother.

217
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:06,488
Which means that just like you say,

218
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:10,488
the dead body of the woman Denkyu says he saw the other day was...

219
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:14,888
Right, we didn't even have visitors that day.

220
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,188
However, three days ago, that morning,

221
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:21,188
Denkyu ran in here looking pale.

222
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,288
I thought that maybe someone who got lost in the mountains

223
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,388
came uninvited to this annex

224
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,788
and came here to check.

225
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:31,488
But, just like tonight, there was no one here.

226
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:36,088
Yes, I felt sorry for Denkyu who insisted on seeing such an illusion that

227
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,088
when the police came,

228
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,788
I went along with his story without thinking,

229
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:44,688
saying that a woman visitor came here early in the morning.

230
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:47,588
So, now has the mystery been solved?

231
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,188
Well, sort of.

232
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,788
No.

233
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,288
I'm sure the woman was here in this room

234
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:59,288
at least three days ago, when Denkyu said he saw her.

235
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:03,588
Do you or Denkyu like to dress yourselves in woman's clothes?

236
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,188
Woman's clothes?

237
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,788
You! What stupid thing are you talking about?

238
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,488
Look what I found.

239
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,988
See!

240
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,788
This is the back catch of a pierced earring?

241
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,288
When we were checking to see

242
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:19,088
if the tatami of this room was double matted

243
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:21,288
and flipped it over,

244
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,488
this kid found it.

245
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:26,188
The back catch of pierced earrings easily come off

246
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:27,988
so it probably came off accidentally

247
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:31,688
and got stuck in between the tatami

248
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:35,688
but the problem is, whose pierce it is?

249
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,588
We've got to track down who the owner of this pierce back catch

250
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:41,588
that is still shiny as if it hasn't been here for long after it came off.

251
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,088
Come to think of it.

252
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,688
The woman that came three days ago also

253
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,588
wore pierced earrings!

254
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,088
Then, the answers simple!

255
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:52,788
The one who Denkyu saw was not an illusion.

256
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,088
No.

257
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,488
The one who was wearing the earring

258
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,988
was probably either Bunkyu or Rinkyu

259
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:03,088
who were disciples here at this temple until two months ago.

260
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,988
Bunkyu and Rinkyu?

261
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:07,488
Remember, I mentioned a while ago that

262
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:11,388
I adopted two other children besides Denkyu.

263
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,888
Unlike Denkyu, they were both forever prone to mischief.

264
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:19,788
They used to sneak out of the temple night after night and go to town.

265
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:20,988
Moreover, they used to disguise themselves as women

266
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,488
so people wouldn't suspect them to be monks.

267
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:24,888
Disguise?

268
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:28,088
Yes. I don't know where they got a hold of it

269
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,988
but they wore a wig, pierced earrings and a long dress,

270
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:34,488
just like those the young people wear nowadays.

271
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:36,088
Is that true?

272
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,688
Yes.

273
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:39,488
Those two used to frequently drink liquor

274
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:41,988
secretly in this annex too.

275
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:45,188
Osho found out about it, and the two had a good scolding.

276
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:50,188
They didn't like it, so they both left this temple together.

277
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:54,588
They seem to have been using this annex to change clothes and all,

278
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,788
so the backing must've accidentally come off.

279
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:00,688
So, that's the story! Convinced?

280
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,788
You still don't look convinced, I see.

281
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:09,288
Then do check things out for yourselves to your heart's content.

282
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:10,588
If as Denkyu says

283
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,088
there was a blood smeared corpse in the middle of the room,

284
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:18,688
the blood should be found somewhere on the tatami.

285
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:22,188
Ran.

286
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,888
Don't you think Heiji and the others are a bit late?

287
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:27,488
Yeah, I wonder if something happened.

288
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:30,988
Okay, Ran, wait here then! I'll go check!

289
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,188
Oh, I'll go too, then!

290
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,388
Don't you think that it's better for us

291
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:47,388
to just wait here without moving after all, Ran?

292
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,588
I guess so.

293
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:15,088
Around where on the floor was that woman?

294
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:18,488
Oh, yes. She was right around here three days ago,

295
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:21,288
lying on the floor like this.

296
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:24,488
Then, what about the woman you saw a while ago?

297
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,588
In the middle of the room,

298
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,088
like so.

299
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,488
Was there a lot of blood?

300
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,788
Yeah.

301
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:33,688
Three days ago as well as tonight,

302
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,488
there was a lot of bleeding from the stomach.

303
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:40,088
Then, 10 to 1 it's not possible.

304
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,588
Maybe possible with the corpse he saw yesterday.

305
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,988
But if the corpse he saw lying there just a while ago is real,

306
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:50,888
there should be a blood stained tatami on the side

307
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:54,888
but even looks around now, there's no such tatami around!

308
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:57,388
You think so too. Did I actually see

309
00:18:57,388 --> 00:19:01,788
an illusion of my mother that never existed in the first place after all?

310
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:05,988
So, are you convinced now?

311
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,888
Yes, very.

312
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:11,088
Then, Denkyu, please show these people to the gate.

313
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,088
Yes, sir.

314
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:15,088
I'll stay here in this room for a while

315
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,988
and offer prayer to the Four Heavenly Kings

316
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:20,988
in apology of having been a bit of a nuisance with all the fuss here.

317
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:26,688
I'm sorry for keeping you here for so long because of my mistake.

318
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:31,188
No, don't be, but why were you there at that time in that annex?

319
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:32,988
I always go and check to see

320
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,688
if the doors are locked before dinner.

321
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,788
Bunkyu and Rinkyu

322
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:43,888
were actually in charge of cleaning and locking the annex up.

323
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,688
But, after their drinking incident,

324
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:49,988
Osho did the cleaning and I was in charge of locking up.

325
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,988
Not only did they drink liquor,

326
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:54,788
but I'll be the two were also smoking in there too?

327
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:56,788
How do you know?

328
00:19:56,788 --> 00:20:01,388
They both said they succeeded in smoking secretly.

329
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:02,988
What a conspicuous secret.

330
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:06,588
There was an obviously burnt spot on the tatami.

331
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,688
Come to think of it, there were remains of spilt beer too.

332
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:13,688
Yeah but what I don't understand is why both the remains...

333
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:17,388
They weren't there when we checked at sundown today.

334
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:19,388
Right, Heiji?

335
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:21,288
-Right! -Don't tell me that

336
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:24,388
someone switched the tatami?

337
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,988
I'm just saying that it's possible.

338
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,588
No way.

339
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:31,188
I'm sure you guys already know if you checked too,

340
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,888
but the tatami at the annex was not double-sided,

341
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:38,888
and besides, it was old and discolored from the sun.

342
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,288
Even if a tatami from someplace else

343
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,088
were to have been brought in and replaced,

344
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:44,688
the discoloration would make it apparent.

345
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:47,688
You mean switching isn't possible?

346
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:51,688
Switching the tatami of one of the four 8-mat floors.

347
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,588
To go from Pop's car to that annex

348
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:56,088
would take 7 to 8 minutes going and coming back,

349
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,088
if you run, that's enough time to switch the tatami!

350
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:01,988
Come to think of it, something always felt different from usual,

351
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:03,788
each time I found the bodies.

352
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,288
Right? I'll bet

353
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:07,588
the direction the tatami is placed or something is different?

354
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,488
Oh, but it's only that I have this feeling.

355
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:12,888
No matter how you replace the tatami,

356
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,188
you can't hide the blood stain.

357
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:17,088
If the body was lying smeared with blood in the middle of the room,

358
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:21,688
there should be blood on more than two tatamis!

359
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:22,988
Well, the only thing that did look suspicious

360
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,888
were the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings in the corner of the rooms

361
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:29,488
but they were inside transparent glass cases.

362
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,288
When the statue was moved, the tatami under it was in view,

363
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:35,588
so the blood couldn't have been hidden.

364
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,688
Let's pull out, pull out!

365
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:41,188
I can't be wasting my time on this silly story!

366
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,888
Huh? A mistake?

367
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,888
Are you saying that there was no corpse?

368
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:51,688
No, it was this monk's illusion.

369
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:52,988
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:56,388
But, I'm glad that nobody was dead then.

371
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:59,488
Okay, hurry and get in then, so we can head back to Ran's house.

372
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:01,588
The pinwheel.

373
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,388
Oh no, I squashed it.

374
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,088
It's okay, because it's not all that bent out of shape.

375
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:07,488
Why?

376
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:10,188
Why did the burnt remain that wasn't there at sundown

377
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:12,988
appear suddenly at night?

378
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:14,988
It was hidden out of sight?

379
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:16,688
But, where?

380
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:21,988
Heiji...

381
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:29,088
Hey, you...

382
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:35,788
This is it! This!

383
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,388
I've figured out where the blood stain is hidden!

384
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,588
Yeah, I thought of that too!

385
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:42,388
Yeah,

386
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:44,388
completely!
