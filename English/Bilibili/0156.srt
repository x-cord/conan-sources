1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.566
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.366
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.466
In today's episode, a lot of police officer make their appearance.

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.366
The Youth Detective Squad prove to be an asset.

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.766
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.066
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:59.904
"Metropolitan Police Officer Love Story 2 (Part 1)"

9
00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:03.204
There's no doubt about it,

10
00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:07.004
she's beginning to suspect your true identity.

11
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:11.004
It's no use trying to keep it hidden from her any longer,

12
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.604
you'll only end up hurting her.

13
00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:16.904
Why are you telling me this?

14
00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:20.704
You mean you can read how a criminal thinks

15
00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:23.004
but you can't read the heart of a woman's heart?

16
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:24.504
A woman's heart?

17
00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:28.204
I'm in love with you.

18
00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:30.404
I have been since the moment we met...

19
00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:34.604
You didn't know that, did you?

20
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:36.304
Masked Yaiba?

21
00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:39.404
Cut! Cut!

22
00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:40.804
That won't do, Conan.

23
00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:42.904
You've got to look more surprised.

24
00:02:42.904 --> 00:02:46.204
This is the climactic scene

25
00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:48.404
where the female spy who betrayed the underworld

26
00:02:48.404 --> 00:02:51.304
confesses her love for Masked Yaiba!

27
00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:55.304
Good grief. Isn't this supposed to be a school play?

28
00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:58.104
Then let's do a normal story.

29
00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:01.004
Like Momotaro or Issunboshi.

30
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:05.104
I can't direct something that lacks reality like those stories.

31
00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:08.104
Masked Yaiba is just as bad.

32
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.104
I'm not happy as the Potato Giant

33
00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:11.504
but I'm sticking it out!

34
00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:13.004
Don't complain.

35
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.604
He's right.

36
00:03:14.604 --> 00:03:16.504
After all, we snuck in this abandoned building

37
00:03:16.504 --> 00:03:19.304
to create an air of suspense.

38
00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:21.804
Then let's do a police story.

39
00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.204
You know what I mean, don't you?

40
00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:24.804
Where the criminal escapes into an abandoned building

41
00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.204
and a shoot-out takes place...

42
00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:27.204
Hold it!

43
00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:32.304
Stop!

44
00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:35.804
Put your hands up and don't make a move!

45
00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:38.304
Officer Sato.

46
00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:40.804
Ayumi!

47
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.204
Don't come near me.

48
00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:43.904
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

49
00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:48.804
Don't... don't come near me.

50
00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:50.204
Conan!

51
00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:55.704
Let me go!

52
00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:56.804
No.

53
00:03:56.804 --> 00:04:00.304
Let me go! Let me go!

54
00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:04.104
Sorry, little girl.

55
00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:05.904
I must have scared you.

56
00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:08.604
I'm really sorry.

57
00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:22.804
Darn.

58
00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:29.004
Ayumi!

59
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:31.304
-Conan. -Where is he?

60
00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.004
I think he's out on the roof.

61
00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:34.004
Let's go.

62
00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:42.904
Hold it. I said to stop.

63
00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:15.104
Amazing.

64
00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:16.904
Officer Sato.

65
00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:18.104
Officer Takagi.

66
00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:21.404
Officer Sato!

67
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:24.504
Takagi. Go around and come in from below.

68
00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:25.904
Right away!

69
00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:27.904
Hey, what happened?

70
00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:34.004
What? A prisoner escape?

71
00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:36.004
Yes, that's right.

72
00:05:36.004 --> 00:05:37.804
We were taking him to headquarters,

73
00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.704
there was an accident involving a car and a motorcycle.

74
00:05:40.704 --> 00:05:41.904
The suspect was sitting next to me

75
00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:43.004
but my attention went to the accident

76
00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:45.104
and when I turned back, he was gone.

77
00:05:45.104 --> 00:05:46.304
He was a very quiet man,

78
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.404
I never thought he'd try to escape.

79
00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:50.604
You blew it.

80
00:05:50.604 --> 00:05:51.604
You let him escape,

81
00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:53.904
you won't get off the hook by just filing a report, you know?

82
00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:56.004
I know it.

83
00:06:03.304 --> 00:06:05.904
6:43 pm,

84
00:06:05.904 --> 00:06:10.104
escaped suspect is apprehended...

85
00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:15.704
Oh no, the chain on the handcuffs cut.

86
00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:18.504
What a bother, you're nothing but trouble.

87
00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:23.104
Now then, get up.

88
00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:27.704
I don't believe it.

89
00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:31.304
The key! The key! Where's the key?

90
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:33.604
No. No, it's not here.

91
00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:38.004
I bet I dropped it somewhere.

92
00:06:38.004 --> 00:06:42.604
-I shouldn't have been so rough. -I'm innocent.

93
00:06:42.604 --> 00:06:44.604
I'm innocent.

94
00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.604
I didn't kill her, officer!

95
00:06:50.704 --> 00:06:54.104
Hey, did you hear some kind of noise from upstairs?

96
00:06:54.104 --> 00:06:55.204
It must be your imagination.

97
00:06:55.204 --> 00:06:57.304
The place is locked up tight.

98
00:06:57.304 --> 00:06:59.604
Come on. Let's get this job done.

99
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.504
Officer Sato, where are you?

100
00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:05.904
Officer Sato.

101
00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:06.904
Strange.

102
00:07:07.904 --> 00:07:09.804
Isn't this an art museum?

103
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.804
Yes.

104
00:07:10.804 --> 00:07:14.604
Then why aren't there any paintings?

105
00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:16.204
You're right.

106
00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:18.304
There're probably changing displays.

107
00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.404
Listen here.

108
00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:22.604
It's very dangerous didn't I tell you kids to go home.

109
00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:23.904
Takagi.

110
00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:25.104
Officer Sato?

111
00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:26.104
Takagi.

112
00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:27.504
Over here!

113
00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:29.204
Officer Sato?

114
00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:31.804
Officer Sato?

115
00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:33.204
In here! Here!

116
00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:35.604
What are you doing in there?

117
00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:37.604
This is the men's room.

118
00:07:37.604 --> 00:07:40.204
And what happened to the suspect?

119
00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:43.804
I did manage to recapture him, but...

120
00:07:43.804 --> 00:07:46.004
I sort of made a mistake.

121
00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:48.004
What in the world did you do?

122
00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:51.504
Isn't it normal procedure to handcuff the suspect's hands?

123
00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.404
I didn't want him to get away again,

124
00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:56.004
so I inadvertently handcuffed myself to him.

125
00:07:56.004 --> 00:07:57.004
Where's the key?

126
00:07:57.004 --> 00:07:58.604
I think I lost it.

127
00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:00.204
If the other police officers hear about this,

128
00:08:00.204 --> 00:08:01.404
I'd die of embarrassment

129
00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:03.604
so could you please go get the spare and not tell anyone?

130
00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:05.604
I wouldn't be able to get in and out unnoticed,

131
00:08:05.604 --> 00:08:08.704
the entire station is in an uproar because of this escaped prisoner.

132
00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:10.104
I see.

133
00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:12.604
Is that any way to talk to a senior officer?

134
00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:13.904
Besides, this entire situation occurred

135
00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:15.804
when you took your eyes off the prisoner

136
00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:17.104
and allowed him to get away, right?

137
00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:19.204
Yes. You are absolutely correct.

138
00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:21.604
Alright, get going Takagi.

139
00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:22.804
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:25.104
I didn't do it.

141
00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.604
I didn't kill her.

142
00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:28.104
I don't know what happened

143
00:08:28.104 --> 00:08:30.904
but when I woke in the morning, Ms. Muranishi was dead.

144
00:08:30.904 --> 00:08:33.104
That's all he's been saying since before.

145
00:08:33.104 --> 00:08:35.404
It's the truth! Please believe me!

146
00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:38.004
Listen to me, Mr. Higashida.

147
00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:40.904
The deceased is Mani Muranishi,

148
00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:42.504
she lived in the same condominium building as you

149
00:08:42.504 --> 00:08:44.104
"Masami Muranishi, Victim" -and she just happened to be your boss.

150
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:46.904
The crime was committed in her bathroom.

151
00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:49.604
When her body was found,

152
00:08:49.604 --> 00:08:53.904
you were stone drunk and asleep on her bed.

153
00:08:53.904 --> 00:08:57.504
The front door was locked and chained from the inside.

154
00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:59.404
The apartment was completely locked.

155
00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:02.604
Besides, your fingerprints were on the door lock and chain

156
00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:08.004
and even on the video cord we found around her neck.

157
00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:11.604
On top of that, you always argued with her about work,

158
00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:12.904
the night of the murder you told a friend

159
00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:14.504
you were "Going to tell her off,"

160
00:09:14.504 --> 00:09:17.504
then you rushed out to go home, isn't that so?

161
00:09:17.504 --> 00:09:19.804
You were drunk, you went to her apartment

162
00:09:19.804 --> 00:09:21.704
and killed her in the heat of the argument,

163
00:09:21.704 --> 00:09:23.104
isn't that how it happened?

164
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:27.104
You locked the door so she couldn't run away

165
00:09:27.104 --> 00:09:29.304
and after you killed her, you were so drunk.

166
00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:32.604
You fell asleep on her bed, isn't that right?

167
00:09:32.604 --> 00:09:36.404
But I don't remember anything.

168
00:09:36.404 --> 00:09:40.204
That's because you were drunk out of your mind.

169
00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:46.004
Yes, it's true I hated her for finding fault with every job I did.

170
00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:49.604
But I didn't hate her enough to kill her.

171
00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:52.104
Then why'd you try to escape?

172
00:09:52.104 --> 00:09:54.804
There's someplace I have to be.

173
00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:56.304
And where's that?

174
00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.304
I have a daughter in Chicago.

175
00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:02.904
My wife took her when we got divorced,

176
00:10:02.904 --> 00:10:06.704
my daughter sent me a wedding invitation.

177
00:10:06.704 --> 00:10:10.904
And for the past 17 years, I thought she hated me.

178
00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:13.804
That's why I have to go, I have to.

179
00:10:16.204 --> 00:10:17.204
It's the truth!

180
00:10:17.204 --> 00:10:18.504
Go to my apartment,

181
00:10:18.504 --> 00:10:22.404
you'll find the letter and the ticket.

182
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:24.404
But what can I do...

183
00:10:24.404 --> 00:10:27.604
That man's not a bad man.

184
00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:30.204
You know he let me go

185
00:10:30.204 --> 00:10:32.504
and when he put me down, he said he was sorry.

186
00:10:32.504 --> 00:10:35.504
If he was a bad man, he wouldn't do that.

187
00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:38.404
But...

188
00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.704
Listen. What time's the flight tomorrow?

189
00:10:40.704 --> 00:10:44.004
It leaves Narita at 12:30 pm.

190
00:10:44.004 --> 00:10:46.004
Officer Sato?

191
00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:47.404
Takagi?

192
00:10:47.404 --> 00:10:49.104
I want you to listen very carefully

193
00:10:49.104 --> 00:10:50.704
to what I'm about to say to you.

194
00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:51.904
"The Metropolitan Police Department" -What?

195
00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:54.504
You can't contact Takagi and Sato?

196
00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:55.604
No.

197
00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:58.604
I've been trying to raise them on the cellular.

198
00:10:58.604 --> 00:11:00.604
Something may have happened to them

199
00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:01.904
while they were pursuing the suspect?

200
00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:05.904
Find them! They should still be in that area!

201
00:11:05.904 --> 00:11:07.104
Hey, Shiratori.

202
00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:09.104
-We going along too. -Yes, sir.

203
00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.604
What? Get the real killer by noon tomorrow?

204
00:11:12.604 --> 00:11:15.204
Do you mean me?

205
00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:16.704
Yes, that's right.

206
00:11:16.704 --> 00:11:20.704
I'll keep an eye on this guy for you until then.

207
00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:22.804
Besides, I'm not going anywhere for a while.

208
00:11:22.804 --> 00:11:25.504
Alright then. I'll go get the key,

209
00:11:25.504 --> 00:11:27.204
let's take him down to headquarters first,

210
00:11:27.204 --> 00:11:28.904
then we both can go.

211
00:11:28.904 --> 00:11:29.904
No.

212
00:11:29.904 --> 00:11:33.304
If someone sees you at headquarters getting the key,

213
00:11:33.304 --> 00:11:35.304
the boss will put you through the ringer,

214
00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:37.404
while you're writing the report,

215
00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:40.104
the plane will take off and it'll be too late.

216
00:11:40.104 --> 00:11:41.104
Now listen,

217
00:11:41.104 --> 00:11:43.704
we're still in pursuit of the escaped prisoner.

218
00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:45.204
That's what we have to make it look like.

219
00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:47.604
In the meantime, you will work alone and find the real killer.

220
00:11:47.604 --> 00:11:49.304
That's our only alternative.

221
00:11:49.304 --> 00:11:51.504
If the suspect is found not guilty

222
00:11:51.504 --> 00:11:53.304
before he is delivered to the Public Prosecutor's Office,

223
00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:57.704
the police department has the right to set him free at their discretion.

224
00:11:57.704 --> 00:11:59.404
But...

225
00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:02.804
The time limit is tomorrow morning

226
00:12:02.804 --> 00:12:04.904
about 10 am when this art museum opens.

227
00:12:04.904 --> 00:12:07.104
Because as soon as someone comes in here,

228
00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:10.204
they're sure to call the police.

229
00:12:10.204 --> 00:12:12.904
I'll believe you until then,

230
00:12:12.904 --> 00:12:14.604
is that okay with you?

231
00:12:14.604 --> 00:12:16.304
I really appreciate that!

232
00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:19.204
But I don't know if I can do it all by myself.

233
00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:21.104
Why? You aren't alone.

234
00:12:21.104 --> 00:12:24.004
Those kids look anxious to help.

235
00:12:34.693 --> 00:12:35.693
You got me?

236
00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:38.993
The time limit is 10 am tomorrow.

237
00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:41.993
You have until then to capture the real killer

238
00:12:41.993 --> 00:12:43.993
and prove this man's innocence.

239
00:12:45.293 --> 00:12:47.793
Don't worry, you can do it.

240
00:12:47.793 --> 00:12:49.793
Have faith in yourself.

241
00:12:53.093 --> 00:12:54.993
Hey, what're you doing?

242
00:12:54.993 --> 00:12:56.193
We're going.

243
00:12:58.093 --> 00:12:59.393
No, wait a minute.

244
00:12:59.393 --> 00:13:02.493
I know Officer Sato's in tight with Inspector Megure,

245
00:13:02.493 --> 00:13:05.293
she only said those things to encourage me.

246
00:13:07.293 --> 00:13:09.793
His mood's been going up and down like a seesaw.

247
00:13:09.793 --> 00:13:10.993
Weird.

248
00:13:10.993 --> 00:13:13.593
Hey! What're you doing up there?

249
00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:17.793
Didn't you see the sign down there?

250
00:13:17.793 --> 00:13:20.093
It said no trespassing.

251
00:13:20.093 --> 00:13:21.893
It was an emergency.

252
00:13:21.893 --> 00:13:25.093
That's right. We're chasing a criminal.

253
00:13:25.093 --> 00:13:26.593
Criminal, oh sure.

254
00:13:26.593 --> 00:13:28.293
You're not the police.

255
00:13:28.293 --> 00:13:31.693
I may not look it but I'm with...

256
00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:35.593
Of course if anyone finds out

257
00:13:35.593 --> 00:13:37.393
a police officer is here with an escaped murder suspect,

258
00:13:37.393 --> 00:13:39.293
our efforts will have been for nothing.

259
00:13:39.293 --> 00:13:41.893
In order for this man to make it to his daughter's wedding,

260
00:13:41.893 --> 00:13:44.493
you have to work on your own and in secret.

261
00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.293
Sorry about that,

262
00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:49.093
we were just playing cops and robbers.

263
00:13:49.093 --> 00:13:50.693
Good grief.

264
00:13:50.693 --> 00:13:53.193
You think he'll be okay.

265
00:13:53.193 --> 00:13:54.393
What?

266
00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:58.393
That police officer didn't seen seem too reliable.

267
00:13:58.393 --> 00:13:59.793
You're so right.

268
00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:01.693
He seems so kind and somewhat clumsy,

269
00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:03.693
the kind you just can't help worrying about.

270
00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:07.893
But he's really quite dependable when he puts his mind to it.

271
00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:09.493
Really?

272
00:14:09.493 --> 00:14:11.993
Besides, that kid's with him...

273
00:14:11.993 --> 00:14:13.293
That kid?

274
00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:15.493
That kid wearing the glasses.

275
00:14:15.493 --> 00:14:19.293
Somehow, that kid gives me hope.

276
00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.493
"Yama Pub"

277
00:14:23.493 --> 00:14:24.893
That's the fifth one.

278
00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:26.793
I wonder what happened.

279
00:14:26.793 --> 00:14:27.993
I told you.

280
00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:30.993
They're looking for the killer, Officer Sato and me.

281
00:14:30.993 --> 00:14:33.693
Officer Takagi, you look like a hoodlum.

282
00:14:33.693 --> 00:14:36.893
It can't be helped, I doing some top secret investigating.

283
00:14:36.893 --> 00:14:39.993
Anyway, we've got to go to that pub first.

284
00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:43.293
That's where we'll start because Mr. Higashida said he stopped off there

285
00:14:43.293 --> 00:14:45.093
just before the murder.

286
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:48.593
Yes, he was totally plastered.

287
00:14:48.593 --> 00:14:51.793
He said "I'm going to tell that woman off once and for all today,"

288
00:14:51.793 --> 00:14:55.993
but I never dreamed he'd kill her.

289
00:14:55.993 --> 00:14:58.693
Was he alone when he left?

290
00:14:58.693 --> 00:15:02.993
Mr. Kitagawa who was drinking with him took him home.

291
00:15:02.993 --> 00:15:04.893
There, that's him.

292
00:15:04.893 --> 00:15:08.193
He and Mr. Higashida work for the same company.

293
00:15:08.193 --> 00:15:13.293
So he's same Kitagawa who first discovered the body.

294
00:15:13.293 --> 00:15:14.693
He discovered the body?

295
00:15:14.693 --> 00:15:15.793
Yes.

296
00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:18.693
When Higashida and Ms. Muranishi didn't show up for work

297
00:15:18.693 --> 00:15:19.793
the next morning.

298
00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:22.393
He had the landlord use the master key to unlock the door.

299
00:15:22.393 --> 00:15:24.493
That's how he found the body.

300
00:15:28.593 --> 00:15:30.793
I'm leaving the money on the table.

301
00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:32.893
Thank you.

302
00:15:32.893 --> 00:15:34.693
Oh, Mr. Kitagawa!

303
00:15:35.793 --> 00:15:36.993
I'm with the police.

304
00:15:36.993 --> 00:15:38.993
I have a few questions for you.

305
00:15:38.993 --> 00:15:41.293
I already told the police everything.

306
00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:43.093
I'm in a state of shock,

307
00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:45.393
my friend killed our boss.

308
00:15:45.393 --> 00:15:47.893
Please leave me alone.

309
00:15:47.893 --> 00:15:49.793
Of course.

310
00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:52.893
He's right.

311
00:15:52.893 --> 00:15:57.093
He's already been questioned by the police.

312
00:15:57.093 --> 00:16:00.493
So has the pub's owner, probably several times.

313
00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:05.793
That's right! Ms. Muranishi was Tokyo Spirits fan

314
00:16:05.793 --> 00:16:08.993
and Mr. Higashida was anti-Spirits!

315
00:16:08.993 --> 00:16:11.293
You there! What're you think you're doing?

316
00:16:11.293 --> 00:16:14.093
I'm terribly sorry, we'll be going now.

317
00:16:14.093 --> 00:16:17.193
I've got to call home. My mom will be worried.

318
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:19.293
-Me too. -Me too!

319
00:16:19.293 --> 00:16:20.393
Good grief,

320
00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:22.693
I never be able to get the real killer

321
00:16:22.693 --> 00:16:24.693
by noon tomorrow at this rate.

322
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:26.693
"Dr. Agasa's House" -What?

323
00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:30.293
You want me to pretend you're all spending the night here?

324
00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:31.993
No, I don't mind.

325
00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:35.093
If Officer Takagi is with you, I'm not worried.

326
00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:37.293
Tomorrow's Sunday, the big day.

327
00:16:37.293 --> 00:16:38.393
I'll just tell your parents

328
00:16:38.393 --> 00:16:41.793
you're all coming with me to tomorrow's event.

329
00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:44.093
Event? What event?

330
00:16:44.093 --> 00:16:48.493
Tomorrow's the day my invention will serve our town.

331
00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:51.193
I call it Tropical Rainbow.

332
00:16:51.193 --> 00:16:53.893
When it blows, it glows like a rainbow.

333
00:16:53.893 --> 00:16:57.293
When you're done with what you're doing, come have a look.

334
00:16:57.293 --> 00:16:58.693
Sure thing.

335
00:16:58.693 --> 00:17:00.893
Did Doctor Agasa say he'd do it?

336
00:17:00.893 --> 00:17:02.693
Yes, he was pretty excited

337
00:17:02.693 --> 00:17:06.193
about a fireworks display they're holding in Haido tomorrow.

338
00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:07.293
Fireworks?

339
00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:09.293
I didn't hear anything about that.

340
00:17:09.293 --> 00:17:10.293
Never mind that,

341
00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:13.293
next we go to the victim's apartment, right?

342
00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:15.793
Right.

343
00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:17.893
The police again?

344
00:17:17.893 --> 00:17:21.693
The officers who came in the afternoon just left.

345
00:17:21.693 --> 00:17:22.893
Yes, well...

346
00:17:22.893 --> 00:17:24.693
There's something they forgot to check.

347
00:17:24.693 --> 00:17:26.893
Who're those kids?

348
00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:28.993
This is a social studies project.

349
00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:30.593
We're experiencing police work

350
00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:32.093
and then reporting to the class.

351
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:35.293
"Muranishi" -I know, you're studying jobs and the people doing then.

352
00:17:36.593 --> 00:17:40.293
I'll return the key to you later then.

353
00:17:40.293 --> 00:17:42.193
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

354
00:17:46.593 --> 00:17:47.693
Oh, hey!

355
00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:49.493
If you touch things, your...

356
00:17:49.493 --> 00:17:51.393
Don't worry, look.

357
00:17:51.393 --> 00:17:54.093
While you were buying your hat,

358
00:17:54.093 --> 00:17:56.093
we bought these gloves.

359
00:17:56.093 --> 00:17:58.493
Conan told us to.

360
00:17:58.493 --> 00:17:59.993
I see.

361
00:17:59.993 --> 00:18:01.293
Good grief.

362
00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:05.093
Where in the world is the suspect and Officers Sato and Takagi?

363
00:18:05.093 --> 00:18:08.793
It seems he lost contact with them when they entered an abandoned building

364
00:18:08.793 --> 00:18:10.593
in pursuit of the escaped prisoner.

365
00:18:10.593 --> 00:18:12.993
Don't you find that strange?

366
00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:16.893
It's not like Officer Sato to not call in for so long.

367
00:18:16.893 --> 00:18:18.493
You don't think...

368
00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:21.793
They could be lying dead, killed by their prisoner.

369
00:18:25.793 --> 00:18:26.993
No!

370
00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:29.993
How awful.

371
00:18:29.993 --> 00:18:32.693
Why you... How dare you kill my valuable subordinates!

372
00:18:34.493 --> 00:18:35.693
Officer Sato?

373
00:18:35.693 --> 00:18:37.793
That? The suspect has Officer Sato?

374
00:18:37.793 --> 00:18:39.793
Ms. Miwa's being kept hostage?

375
00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:53.093
Oh no. Am I coming down with a cold?

376
00:18:53.093 --> 00:18:56.793
I'm sorry, it's my fault that we're caught up like this.

377
00:18:56.793 --> 00:18:57.893
Forget it.

378
00:18:57.893 --> 00:19:01.293
If we made a false arrest, we'd have to apologize to you.

379
00:19:01.293 --> 00:19:04.793
Besides, this isn't for you.

380
00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:10.493
I just didn't want your daughter to go through what I did.

381
00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:14.593
I lost my father when I was little, it broke my heart.

382
00:19:14.593 --> 00:19:16.793
Come on, kids, let's go home.

383
00:19:16.793 --> 00:19:19.793
We're not going to come up with anything no matter how hard we look.

384
00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:21.193
The guys from the crime lab were already here,

385
00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.693
there isn't a single piece of trash on the floor.

386
00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:25.593
There are four things out of place.

387
00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:28.193
The first is, the color of the mattress,

388
00:19:28.193 --> 00:19:31.893
the sheets, the pillow and the curtain beside the bed.

389
00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:34.593
Everything from the kitchenware,

390
00:19:34.593 --> 00:19:37.093
to the dishes down to the interior is in beige.

391
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.193
Why then is only the bed and curtain in gray?

392
00:19:40.193 --> 00:19:42.593
I suppose it's just coincidence.

393
00:19:42.593 --> 00:19:47.293
But there were beige sheets and curtains in the closet.

394
00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:49.893
And the lady who ran the pub told us

395
00:19:49.893 --> 00:19:52.593
Ms. Muranishi just loved beige.

396
00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:57.393
And she also told us Ms. Muranishi liked the Spirits and cactus.

397
00:19:57.393 --> 00:20:00.693
She also said Mr. Higashida knew a lot about video equipment

398
00:20:00.693 --> 00:20:01.693
and hated baths.

399
00:20:01.693 --> 00:20:03.693
And that when he got drunk, he always fell asleep

400
00:20:03.693 --> 00:20:06.393
and couldn't wake up, that's why he was late for work a lot.

401
00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:08.393
I don't think she told the investigators that

402
00:20:08.393 --> 00:20:10.493
when they questioned her.

403
00:20:10.493 --> 00:20:13.493
When people are being questioned by the police,

404
00:20:13.493 --> 00:20:15.593
they are afraid that if they mention something unrelated to the crime,

405
00:20:15.593 --> 00:20:18.693
they will be reprimanded.

406
00:20:18.693 --> 00:20:21.293
But the tension sometimes makes them talk anyway.

407
00:20:21.293 --> 00:20:24.893
She may not have appeared like it but I think she was scared.

408
00:20:24.893 --> 00:20:26.493
Scared?

409
00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:28.593
The second thing is, why was this calendar

410
00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:30.393
taken off the wall next to the bed?

411
00:20:33.093 --> 00:20:37.893
See, this is this year's Tokyo Spirits calendar, it was in the closet.

412
00:20:37.893 --> 00:20:41.293
It matches the spot on the wall perfectly.

413
00:20:41.293 --> 00:20:43.993
She probably took it down

414
00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.993
because the team's not doing so good lately.

415
00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:47.793
But look.

416
00:20:47.793 --> 00:20:51.993
Her whole schedule until December is written in.

417
00:20:51.993 --> 00:20:54.293
You're right.

418
00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:55.393
The third thing is,

419
00:20:55.393 --> 00:20:58.193
there're slight traces the furniture's been moved.

420
00:20:58.193 --> 00:21:00.493
The men from the crime lab mentioned that too,

421
00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:02.593
they said she'd probably rearranged the room.

422
00:21:02.593 --> 00:21:04.493
But don't you think it's strange

423
00:21:04.493 --> 00:21:08.693
she wouldn't notice she'd crushed something this valuable

424
00:21:08.693 --> 00:21:09.993
when she moved the chest?

425
00:21:11.093 --> 00:21:12.493
It's just a box of matches.

426
00:21:12.493 --> 00:21:13.493
Open it up.

427
00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:17.693
There's a piece of paper inside.

428
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.593
Why this is?

429
00:21:19.593 --> 00:21:21.893
It's her marriage registration.

430
00:21:21.893 --> 00:21:24.093
She was going to be married.

431
00:21:24.093 --> 00:21:26.493
But the groom's name hasn't been filled in.

432
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:28.993
His seal is on it though.

433
00:21:28.993 --> 00:21:30.993
The fourth thing is the cactus.

434
00:21:30.993 --> 00:21:31.993
On the day of the murder,

435
00:21:31.993 --> 00:21:34.993
it had been raining heavily since morning.

436
00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:38.793
Would a cactus lover such as herself leave the pots outside?

437
00:21:38.793 --> 00:21:41.393
Which means someone besides the victim

438
00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:45.993
moved things around for some unknown reason.

439
00:21:45.993 --> 00:21:48.093
Yes, here it is.

440
00:21:48.093 --> 00:21:51.693
This is the gold dolphin cactus the pub owner gave her

441
00:21:51.693 --> 00:21:52.993
on the day she was killed.

442
00:21:52.993 --> 00:21:56.193
But the thorns have been bent, poor thing.

443
00:21:56.193 --> 00:21:59.093
So what does that have to do with anything?

444
00:21:59.093 --> 00:22:00.993
The suspect, Mr.Higashida

445
00:22:00.993 --> 00:22:04.593
was found sleeping on the bed in this room

446
00:22:04.593 --> 00:22:06.893
sprawled out like it was his home.

447
00:22:06.893 --> 00:22:08.893
His fingerprints were found not only on the video cord,

448
00:22:08.893 --> 00:22:10.493
which was the murder weapon,

449
00:22:10.493 --> 00:22:15.593
but also on the door lock and even the chain lock.

450
00:22:16.693 --> 00:22:18.193
No, it can't be...

451
00:22:18.193 --> 00:22:19.793
You don't mean, this room?

452
00:22:19.793 --> 00:22:22.293
Shall we go check it out then?

453
00:22:22.293 --> 00:22:25.493
His apartment is in this condominium too, isn't it?

454
00:22:27.493 --> 00:22:28.493
Yes, let's go.

455
00:24:04.393 --> 00:24:07.293
"Next Episode" -The time... we don't have much time left.

456
00:24:08.393 --> 00:24:11.393
Come on, let's get going

457
00:24:11.393 --> 00:24:13.993
to the real killer's home.

458
00:24:13.993 --> 00:24:15.893
What did he say?

459
00:24:15.893 --> 00:24:18.493
I'm sure he said bomb.

460
00:24:18.493 --> 00:24:21.393
Darn, there's no time left. Hurry.

461
00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.493
Hurry!

462
00:24:22.493 --> 00:24:27.593
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

463
00:24:28.193 --> 00:24:29.793
Next Conan,

464
00:24:29.793 --> 00:24:33.514
"Metropolitan Police Officer Love Story 2 (Part 2)"

465
00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:36.995
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:36.995 --> 00:24:38.395
"Cactus"

467
00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.495
Next time we will finish the love story.

468
00:24:40.495 --> 00:24:42.295
I can't believe that Inspector Megure really...

469
00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:43.395
Hey.
