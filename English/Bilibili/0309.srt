1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,440
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,340
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,240
The secret of the men in black is finally at hand.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,540
I will figure out the diary together with Dr. Agasa.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,167
I have it. It's right here.

9
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:57,567
In my pocket, the clue to those men in the Black Organization.

10
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,467
Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's house

11
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:04,267
and check this disk thoroughly.

12
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,867
Conan?

13
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,367
I wonder if people change.

14
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,367
If they're apart, will their feelings change?

15
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,467
It's kind of tough

16
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,667
to just keep on waiting.

17
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:30,367
You don't have to worry about Shinichi.

18
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:33,467
I think he's just the way you picture him to be, Ran.

19
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,067
So, I don't think you have to worry about him at all.

20
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,167
It would be nice if you were Shinichi, Conan.

21
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,367
How stupid of me, what on earth am I talking about?

22
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,767
Ran, that's not it.

23
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,167
I...

24
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,767
Actually, I am...

25
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,067
No. I can't tell her.

26
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,567
Not until I disclose their identity.

27
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:11,067
Until I crush them.

28
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,267
I can't tell anybody about me.

29
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,667
You're...

30
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:48,767
"Contact with the Black Organization (Negotiation Edition)"

31
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,967
So, you're crying again.

32
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,367
Again?

33
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,067
You're always crying.

34
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,367
Always?

35
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,567
Does it bother you?

36
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:37,567
It's just that you sort of reminded me...

37
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,467
of a girl who resembled you.

38
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,667
A stupid girl who pretended to be composed

39
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,167
but used to cry in private.

40
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,367
Stupid girl?

41
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,367
Hey, Ran.

42
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,367
Do you know that man?

43
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,767
Yes.

44
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,667
I met him when I went to New York with Shinichi.

45
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,767
I was waiting for Shinichi in front of a dilapidated building

46
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,667
when he came walking along

47
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,767
and asked me if I saw a Japanese with long silver dyed hair

48
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,167
and an unshaven face.

49
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:29,467
Inside that building where the street slasher was hiding?

50
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,867
But, I don't think he's anyone suspicious.

51
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,767
Why?

52
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,167
Because he was together with a person

53
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:39,467
wearing a jacket with the characters FBI on it.

54
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,967
FBI?

55
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,167
It can't be...

56
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:49,067
What would the FBI be doing here in Japan?

57
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,967
He's gone.

58
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,467
He's disappeared.

59
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,467
Come on, let's go home, Conan.

60
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,267
Okay.

61
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,267
But, I wonder if he

62
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,267
really belongs to the FBI?

63
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,867
Somebody killed that street slasher

64
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,267
making it look as if he killed himself.

65
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,967
If the FBI had that area covered,

66
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,567
they would never goof like that.

67
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,567
And besides,

68
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,067
during the James kidnap case,

69
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,667
Ai reacted at sensing his presence.

70
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,867
Is it possible he was the one who killed the street slasher?

71
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,867
If he was deeply involved with Ai...

72
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,867
Shuichi Akai.

73
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,667
Don't tell me that his true identity is...

74
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,067
Hey, Conan.

75
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,967
What would you like to eat for dinner?

76
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,267
Sashimi?

77
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,967
Tenshin rice?

78
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,467
Or beef stew?

79
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,267
But, choose only one of the dishes...

80
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,267
Huh?

81
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,267
Conan?

82
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,167
"I promised Dr. Agasa that I would play a game with him,

83
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,067
so I'm going to sleep over at his place tonight."

84
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,967
Playing games again?

85
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:28,167
I tell you, he's so childish.

86
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,967
More important than Shuichi Akai now

87
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,167
is the diary that's inside this disc.

88
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:42,867
The diary of Mr. Itakura, who met Tequila,

89
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,967
one of the members of the men in black, 2 years ago.

90
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:49,167
I'm going to check it thoroughly

91
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,567
and figure out their purpose,

92
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,667
as well as their identity.

93
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,067
Shinichi, great timing.

94
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:04,567
It's been a while, but I've invented something new again.

95
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,967
While I was at it, I also made you another pair of pursuit glasses,

96
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,767
so you won't have to worry about running out of batteries.

97
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,667
By the way, where's Ai?

98
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:16,367
Ai's taking a bath right now.

99
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,467
That's just great.

100
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,767
Hey, Shinichi. What do you mean that's just great?

101
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,967
Don't tell me that you're going to take a peek?

102
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,167
Oh, come on.

103
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:34,067
What? You got hold of clues to those guys?

104
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,767
Shinichi, you're not pulling my leg, are you?

105
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,067
No.

106
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,467
If Ai finds out, it may cause her needless worry,

107
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:43,267
so I've got to check things out while she's not around.

108
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,867
Let me see, two years ago.

109
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,767
Two years ago...

110
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,667
There. This is it.

111
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:55,167
"March 7th, a man with a Kansai dialect suddenly came to see me.

112
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,567
It seems that he was after a system software

113
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,667
which was under development,

114
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,167
but as soon as he found out that my vision had gone bad

115
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:05,967
and I gave up the development, he left.

116
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,667
This man was dressed in black from head to toe.

117
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,467
I never want to see him again."

118
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,467
Hey, is this it?

119
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:18,467
There seems to be nothing more written about the big man

120
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,467
in the diary in the days following either.

121
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:24,267
Seriously. And I went through all the trouble to get a hold of this diary.

122
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,667
The only thing I found out

123
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,167
was that Mr. Itakura was developing some kind of software,

124
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:33,167
and that they wanted it.

125
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:38,367
This Itakura guy sure must've been some unreliable character.

126
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,967
Look, the space between the written and unwritten pages of the book

127
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,567
is disorganized.

128
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,867
If it were me,

129
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,367
I wouldn't be able to stand not placing everything in order.

130
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,967
Come to think of it, he said back then,

131
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,767
that Mr. Itakura would get upset

132
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,367
even if his papers were moved 10 centimeters out of place.

133
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,767
Wrong, Dr. Agasa.

134
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,867
The space between the pages is not disorganized.

135
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:03,967
Watch, okay?

136
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,567
You place the cursor on the open space like this

137
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,767
and drag the mouse along, then, highlight it.

138
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,767
This is...

139
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:13,967
I'm pooped.

140
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,867
If this keeps up, I'll probably be killed one day.

141
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,267
"Invisible writing".

142
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22,667
It's a method that's frequently used

143
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,367
when people want to hide

144
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,567
what is written on things like the internet website.

145
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:31,167
But, why would Mr. Itakura do something like this to his own diary?

146
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,967
Probably as camouflage just in case

147
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,667
somebody snuck a look at his diary.

148
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,667
Shinichi, don't tell me that the person is...

149
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,967
Yes, I'm sure he didn't want them to see it.

150
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:55,989
Dr. Agasa.

151
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,389
I finished taking a bath.

152
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:00,389
Dr. Agasa?

153
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,489
It seems that he's started using invisible writing

154
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,689
10 days after the big man came.

155
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,189
It goes on to say,

156
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,589
"March 16th.

157
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:22,589
The pen of my desk has been moved another 5 centimeters.

158
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,689
It seems that someone's been sneaking into my office after all.

159
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,889
April 15th. Somebody has snuck into my house this time.

160
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,889
The police won't take it seriously.

161
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,489
I guess it couldn't be helped

162
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:39,389
because there were no traces of a break-in or anything being taken.

163
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:43,189
June 11th.

164
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:46,089
I changed the locks and set up hidden surveillance cameras,

165
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,289
but to no avail.

166
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:51,789
July 6th. Who is it? Show yourself.

167
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:56,289
November 19th. I'm pooped.

168
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,389
If this keeps up, I'll probably be killed one day.

169
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,589
January 6th. In order to free me from this terror,

170
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,089
I inserted a message addressed to the intruder in the desk.

171
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:11,489
I wrote that I would go along with their demand.

172
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:15,989
January 8th. I got an answer earlier than expected.

173
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,189
In place of the message I inserted,

174
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,889
there was a memo from the intruder.

175
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,589
"OK" was written in red.

176
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,889
Along with a mysterious phone number was written.

177
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,089
The red words were probably written with blood.

178
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,889
It probably means, "Tell no one or you're dead".

179
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:36,189
January 23rd.

180
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,489
Although I was deliberating on what to do for a while,

181
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,889
I decided not to notify the police and call them instead.

182
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,189
To my surprise, a woman answered the phone.

183
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:49,989
A stuck up woman who talked as if she were a queen.

184
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:53,989
Her request was that she wanted to buy the software

185
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,689
that I was developing at a high price

186
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:58,989
if I could finish making it in a year.

187
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,389
I guess she's a member of the same group

188
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,889
as the big man that previously came to see me.

189
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,189
February 13th.

190
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:11,289
Their way of contacting me changed to e-mail.

191
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,289
I decided to accept the offer under the condition

192
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:18,889
that they deposit the payment into my account in advance

193
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,389
and that they stop snooping around me anymore.

194
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,789
December 22nd.

195
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:25,589
No good.

196
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,089
I can't do it after all.

197
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:29,789
I abandoned making that software

198
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:32,789
not only because my vision started weakening,

199
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:35,289
but for the sake of mankind."

200
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,689
For the sake of mankind?

201
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,289
"February 9th.

202
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,389
The deadline is drawing near.

203
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,489
I have decided to hide the unfinished software

204
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:48,289
and the check of the payment they made to me

205
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,589
near the computer of my villa

206
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,189
and escape abroad.

207
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,389
The e-mail with instructions

208
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:56,889
as to the time and place of where the software

209
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,889
will be handed over to them

210
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:00,689
should be arriving 5 days later at midnight.

211
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:03,589
I'll try to somehow make it abroad by then."

212
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,089
The date on this diary is four days ago,

213
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,789
which means the e-mail should be arriving 3 hours from now at 9 pm.

214
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,889
I guess Mr. Itakura was planning to escape abroad

215
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,489
before seeing that e-mail.

216
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:23,189
There seems to be invisible writing even after the last day.

217
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,289
"February 10th.

218
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:32,289
I wonder what they're going to do with that software?

219
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,989
The queer words of that woman who first answered the phone

220
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:38,289
won't leave my ears.

221
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:43,989
Yes. I couldn't stand the overbearing tone of voice of the woman

222
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,989
so I taunted her saying, "Just who the hell do you think you are?"

223
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:50,689
She laughed and replied,

224
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,589
"We can be both of God and the Devil,

225
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,989
since we're trying to raise the dead

226
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:00,189
against the stream of time."

227
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,589
What?

228
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,989
We can be both of God and the Devil,

229
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,489
since we're...

230
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:12,289
We're trying to raise the dead against the stream of time.

231
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,189
-Ai? -Ai?

232
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:17,989
What is that?

233
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,089
Are you reading some kind of fantasy story

234
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:20,989
where a witch or something appears?

235
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,289
Yes, exactly.

236
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,389
I'm hooked on this internet series of western novels, you see.

237
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,389
And you? What are you doing here, Shinichi?

238
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,689
Oh, me?

239
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,189
I was...

240
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:38,089
He came to try out my new invention.

241
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:39,489
Right?

242
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:40,589
Yes.

243
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,389
This is called "Fire a ball anywhere belt".

244
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:51,489
It looks like any ordinary belt at first glance.

245
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:52,989
No, it doesn't.

246
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,489
But when you adjust the dial and push the button.

247
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,889
There. One soccer ball to go.

248
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,789
That's amazing!

249
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,889
I'd be able to catch a load of culprits with this.

250
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,389
No, maybe just one or two.

251
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:09,789
Because of the nature of rubber,

252
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,889
once it leaves the belt,

253
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,189
it can only maintain its form for 10 seconds.

254
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,789
I see.

255
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,289
However, it is very elastic.

256
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,989
Depending on the amount of gas that's put in,

257
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,289
it can become as large as an advertisement balloon.

258
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,089
Oh, that's some value.

259
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,989
Sounds silly.

260
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,789
I'm going to go to bed.

261
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:36,289
So, what now?

262
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:38,489
What else?

263
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,289
We're going to Mr. Itakura's villa right now

264
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,489
and get a hold of that system software in question.

265
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:46,289
Then, we're going to receive the e-mail

266
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:50,089
that they're going to be sending at midnight.

267
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,489
It's amazing how you found out

268
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:58,589
that Mr. Itakura's villa is in Gunma.

269
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,489
Pops asked the man from the game company

270
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,689
that came to ask him to look for Mr. Itakura.

271
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,689
He was asking the man for places

272
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,289
that Mr. Itakura could be hiding like his house,

273
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:10,789
villa, the addresses of his acquaintances and so forth.

274
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,889
Will it be okay though?

275
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:16,089
What if they're waiting in ambush or something?

276
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,789
We'll be fine.

277
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,489
Mr. Itakura made them promise

278
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:23,589
not to snoop around him anymore.

279
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,089
They would never break a promise with a character

280
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,789
who is so jittery that he was bothered

281
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,589
that the pen on his desk had been moved 5 centimeters.

282
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,489
I think you have a point.

283
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:35,589
If they upset him before the software is completed,

284
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,289
they'll be throwing everything down the drain.

285
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,389
The problem is, whether the news about Mr. Itakura being killed

286
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:44,789
has already been aired on TV or radio.

287
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,289
Even so, it'll be okay.

288
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:49,589
I've been listening to the radio all this time,

289
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,389
but all they're broadcasting

290
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:53,789
is about the jewelry robber who is on the run.

291
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:58,989
The thing that bothers me though, are the last words in the diary.

292
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:00,089
Yes.

293
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,989
"We can be both of God and the Devil,

294
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:08,589
since we are trying to raise the dead against the stream of time."

295
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,589
What does it mean anyway?

296
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,989
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

297
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:16,489
Don't tell me that the drug Ai was trying to make was...

298
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:21,089
No way. Making zombies. That's ridiculous.

299
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,289
Don't rush things.

300
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:29,389
People cannot go against the stream of time.

301
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,189
If people try to bend things out of line by force,

302
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,589
they will be punished.

303
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,289
What is it?

304
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,289
What is the punishment?

305
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,889
We've finally arrived.

306
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:50,889
Now, how do we make it inside?

307
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:52,489
Well...

308
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:56,989
Where did you get that key?

309
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,989
It was hidden behind those stairs.

310
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,989
Remember it was written in the diary?

311
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:07,789
"A friend that I haven't seen in 5 years called me from my villa."

312
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:10,989
Which means that the key was hidden somewhere

313
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:14,289
so that his friends could come in whenever they wanted to.

314
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,289
I see.

315
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,989
But, how dangerous.

316
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:23,589
He left it here just for that very reason.

317
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,989
Because they wouldn't think that the software that they wanted

318
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:30,289
would be left so carelessly in a place like this.

319
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,989
And as for the e-mail that they are about to send here,

320
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,589
if no one receives their mail here,

321
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:37,889
they'll eventually come here to look for Mr. Itakura,

322
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,689
and find the software and the check,

323
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:43,789
so he gets to sever all ties with them without having to see them.

324
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:48,989
Shinichi, it's almost time.

325
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:49,989
Yes.

326
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,589
Come on, you guys in black.

327
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:57,089
Show your dirty rat selves.

328
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,189
Here it is. The mail.

329
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,489
Okay, if I open this...

330
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:06,889
Password?

331
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,989
Hey, it's counting down really fast.

332
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:12,589
Darn.

333
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,089
The mail disappeared.

334
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,689
Darn. It was set so that if it wasn't opened immediately,

335
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,889
it would disappear.

336
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:25,089
So, don't tell me that they found out the mail wasn't opened?

337
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,189
Yes. Not only that, maybe they even found out

338
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,989
that the mail failed to be opened using this computer.

339
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,289
What now?

340
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:33,389
They may think that something happened to Mr. Itakura

341
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:36,189
and come here.

342
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,789
Shinichi?

343
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,389
Shinichi?

344
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,289
I can't come to the phone right now.

345
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:04,789
Please record your message after the tone.

346
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:10,989
Hey, what's going on?

347
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,889
Vodka?

348
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,689
You're there, aren't you?

349
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,389
They've found out.

350
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:21,789
They've found out that we failed to open the e-mail.

351
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,789
Yes. Or maybe they were watching this villa...

352
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:29,389
without Mr. Itakura being aware that they were.

353
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,689
What?

354
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,889
I'm counting on them not thinking

355
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:36,489
that Mr. Itakura would receive their mail

356
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:39,789
in an unsafe place like this, though.

357
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,789
Hey. If so, how are we going to escape?

358
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:43,789
We're trapped.

359
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,989
Hey, answer me.

360
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:50,189
I know you're at that villa.

I guess we've no choice

371

but to make it out the back door

372
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:59,289
and hide in the blizzard.

373
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,989
Not really. There's still one way.

374
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,389
It's a bit dangerous, though.
