1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,770
Koji Haneda.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,370
17 years ago, the four-crowned Shogi master

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,070
took his crowns

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,770
and went to the U.S. to participate in a chess tournament,

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,070
which he played as a hobby.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,870
But the night before the tournament,

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,170
someone attacked and killed him

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,770
in the hotel room where he was staying.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,170
The room was ransacked

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,670
and it seems that Haneda

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,670
had put up quite a resistance against his killer,

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,670
but the direct cause of his death is unknown.

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,070
The cause of death of Amanda Hughes, a wealthy American woman

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,070
killed on the same day in another room is also unknown.

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,670
Because Amanda was a fan of Haneda

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,570
and they were on friendly terms,

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,270
and because the bodyguard

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,370
who accompanied Amanda had disappeared since,

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,670
the bodyguard who she called Asaka

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,870
has been sought after as the prime suspect in the case,

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,470
but his whereabouts are still unknown.

22
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,670
"Asaka" -Furthermore, the identity of Asaka

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,470
is shrouded in mystery.

24
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,870
None of Amanda's family or friends

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,770
seem to know how she came to hire him.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,570
Hey, don't you know the guy called Asaka?

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,370
I wonder, I've never heard of him.

28
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,170
But if the cause of Koji Haneda's death is unknown,

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,470
and he's on the list of people

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,070
who were administered APTX 4869,

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,770
then it's highly likely

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,670
that he's a member of the Black Organization.

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,670
Don't you think it's weird, though?

34
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,270
If Koji Haneda was killed 17 years ago,

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,870
why is his name listed two rows below mine?

36
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,270
Whoever kept the list didn't list the victims

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,870
in the order they were killed.

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,870
Maybe they were grouped according to their blood types.

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,170
And if that drug that I was forced to drink

40
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,870
was already around 17 years ago...

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,770
how old are you now, anyway?

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,570
How rude.

43
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,870
I told you that I'm 18, didn't I?

44
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,670
My parents probably made that drug.

45
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,570
All I did was scrape together the data

46
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,070
that survived the fire and recreated it.

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,770
Survived the fire?

48
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,170
My parents' lab caught fire

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,570
and both of them burned to death along with the data.

50
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,170
The Black Organization told me

51
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,470
that it was an unfortunate accident.

52
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,870
Well, the drug that they were actually making me make

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,970
was a different drug.

54
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,570
But...

55
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,670
why would they kill a Japanese Shogi player?

56
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,170
He probably just happened to witness them

57
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,070
killing the wealthy woman who was in their way.

58
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,870
Amanda apparently seems to have had clout

59
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,570
with the FBI and CIA, you see.

60
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,170
It seems definite that Amanda

61
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,670
visited Koji Haneda's room once, too.

62
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,870
Apparently, Amanda's fingerprints were on the doorknob,

63
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,070
sofa, teacup, plate and fork in Haneda's room.

64
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,370
Maybe they ordered cake and tea from room service

65
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,870
to have afternoon tea or something?

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,870
The dishes seem to have been smashed and cracked

67
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,970
when the room was ransacked, though.

68
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,770
Yeah, shards of plates and cups with Juke, the name of the hotel on them

69
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,270
seem to have been scattered all over the room.

70
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,270
Huh?

71
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,470
There's some glass mixed with the utensils.

72
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,070
Is it a mirror?

73
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,970
There's something written on it.

74
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,370
PTON?

75
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,270
It probably spelt "Put On Mascara".

76
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,270
Just about that time, there was a cosmetics company

77
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,770
selling hand mirror with mascara.

78
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,670
It turned out to be a smash hit.

79
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,670
The phrase "Put On Mascara" was printed on it.

80
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,070
My older sister also had that hand mirror

81
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,070
as a keepsake of Mother.

82
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,870
But why was that hand mirror in Koji Haneda's room?

83
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,370
Beside, it seems that the wealthy old woman who was killed

84
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,470
was over 80 years old already, too.

85
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,570
Maybe Koji Haneda also got it from his mother.

86
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,470
I guess he would've been concerned about his looks being a Shogi player.

87
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,170
What concerns me more than that is this room,

88
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,270
which was left messy as is, after being ransacked.

89
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,470
This is not the way the Black Organization does things.

90
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,970
They always leave things

91
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,570
as though nothing had happened.

92
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,170
It seems that the wealthy woman's room

93
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,070
was left looking exactly that way, too.

94
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,670
It's also written that the faucet of the sink in the bathroom

95
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,670
was left with the water running.

96
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,470
It's amazing how you gathered all this information, though.

97
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,970
It seems that somebody is periodically uploading this onto the internet,

98
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,870
not even giving a hoot of whether it'll be deleted or not.

99
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,670
It's almost as if somebody

100
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,170
is asking for this mystery to be solved.

101
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,470
But how did you find out that he resisted the attacker?

102
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,570
Several defensive wounds

103
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,070
were found on Koji Haneda's arms,

104
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,870
probably acquired when he tried to block the kicks and punches.

105
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,870
There were clear marks on his right hand of him

106
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,570
having grabbed the small scissors that came with the room.

107
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,970
He grabbed scissors?

108
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,370
Huh? What about the scissors?

109
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,270
Oh, well, this morning, there was a murder at City Okuho.

110
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,370
And the victim seems to have been holding the scissors

111
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,770
that I invented firmly in his hand and dead.

112
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,870
So, Inspector Megure asked me to come after lunch

113
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,670
to explain about the scissors.

114
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,370
Oh, you mean those ridiculous scissors

115
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,870
that make a snipping sound

116
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,770
each time you match the pattern of the scissors,

117
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,770
You mean that stuff's selling?

118
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,070
Everyone says that the sound is excellently pleasant.

119
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,870
Uh, if you don't mind, I'd like to go...

120
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,170
to the crime site, too.

121
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,370
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

122
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,670
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

123
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,470
The case involving Apotoxin and a hotel.

124
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,670
With scissors in hand danger is fast approaching.

125
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

126
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

127
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,570
His name is Detective Conan!

128
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:07,111
"The Same Crime Scene as 17 Years Ago (Part 1)"

129
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,811
Subaru, why?

130
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:15,511
I seem to have made too much meat and potatoes,

131
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,011
so I brought you some.

132
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:21,011
No, rather why do you want to go to the crime site?

133
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,611
There's something

134
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,511
about that case that interests me.

135
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:28,811
Okay then, let's go over to the site right away.

136
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:29,811
Okay.

137
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,811
Oh, you don't have to come along.

138
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,111
Huh?

139
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:46,211
You can stay home alone, can't you?

140
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:47,711
I guess so.

141
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,011
You're telling me to stay at home alone

142
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,911
and eat the lousy food you made, right?

143
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,411
It's that bad?

144
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:01,011
The vegetables in the cream stew that you shared with us the other day

145
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:03,811
were still raw.

146
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,711
I mean it was as if you listening to our conversation through a wiretap

147
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,211
and rushed the food you were making over here

148
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:12,011
so that you could get involved in the case, right?

149
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,111
Oh, no. No way.

150
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:18,411
It's just that I'm not such a good cook.

151
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:20,911
I mean you'd be a great help

152
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:24,011
if you could stew it over again while we're gone.

153
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:29,111
I'm sure that I used to correct ingredients and seasoning, you see.

154
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:44,611
Look after the girl.

155
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:46,711
I'm counting on you, Camel.

156
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,511
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,411
"Hiyama" -Dr. Agasa. I've been waiting for you.

158
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,511
Uh, you're not alone?

159
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,811
Oh, well...

160
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:06,711
Well, you see. I was also involved in inventing the scissors.

161
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,211
I'm a bother here?

162
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:11,311
Well, in that case...

163
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,911
You mean those scissors were that great an invention?

164
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,711
The site of the crime was not in the main house but the annex.

165
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,911
The victim's been spending most of his time in the annex lately

166
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,711
because he felt insecure in the main house.

167
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:32,911
Those two sure have a robust physique.

168
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,011
Are they bodyguards?

169
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:43,211
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

170
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:46,211
Thank you for coming all this way.

171
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,811
No problem.

172
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,911
The corpse is still here.

173
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:57,111
Let me explain.

174
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:59,911
The victim is the president of a real estate company

175
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,911
as well as the head of this household.

176
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,611
He is Mr. Kunihisa Hiyama, age 61.

177
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,811
He was bludgeoned to death with a blunt object.

178
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:10,611
It seems he was attacked in another room of this annex

179
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:13,711
and fled into this changing room in the bathroom,

180
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:17,511
but the perp broke the door down and finished him off.

181
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,411
And the scissors that the victim was holding

182
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,611
were these with your logo on them, Dr. Agasa.

183
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:25,411
Can you explain how they function?

184
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,511
Oh, they...

185
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,911
Wait.

186
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:30,411
You'll hurt yourself if you don't go in carefully.

187
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:32,011
Shards of glass?

188
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,411
There's a pattern and letters on it.

189
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:42,411
Looks like it matches the cup on the counter.

190
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:47,611
Can we assume that the victim

191
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,811
threw this cup at his killer when he entered the room?

192
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,811
Yes.

193
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,711
Then the victim attempted to defend himself

194
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:56,911
using these scissors invented by Dr. Agasa

195
00:11:56,911 --> 00:12:00,211
that he used to trim his moustache with to counterattack his assailant?

196
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,211
Most probably.

197
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:05,011
If so, don't you think it's strange?

198
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,811
What is?

199
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,611
The mop that is behind the victim.

200
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,511
What? Mop?

201
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:15,111
The long-handled mop would be far better for

202
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:18,411
defending oneself against a killer with a blunt object.

203
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:20,011
Then, why the scissors?

204
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,511
True.

205
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:24,311
And who are you?

206
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,511
Oh, I'm sorry for not introducing myself.

207
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:30,811
I'm Dr. Agasa's assistant, Subaru Okiya.

208
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,111
Mr. Okiya?

209
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:36,011
I came today to explain those scissors.

210
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,511
Oh, that's right.

211
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:41,411
These scissors apparently make a sound when they're closed,

212
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,611
but do they have any recording function?

213
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:46,911
They don't have such a convenient function.

214
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:48,511
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,211
I thought he was holding them

216
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:54,311
because he recorded the perp's voice.

217
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:58,311
There's blood on the shards of glass by the entrance.

218
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,311
The perp stepped on them, right?

219
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:03,211
Conan! You can't come inside!

220
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,811
If you match the blood

221
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,411
with the people who came here,

222
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,211
maybe you'll find the perp?

223
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:10,911
Oh, well. That blood is...

224
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:15,511
What? It belongs to the person who first discovered the body?

225
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,211
So, it's not the perp's blood?

226
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:20,611
No. His name is Mr. Kazunori Senba.

227
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:23,911
He used to run a candy shop in this neighborhood,

228
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,911
but his son and wife

229
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:29,211
sold the property to President Hiyama without his approval,

230
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:31,811
so he came by this morning to complain about it.

231
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,911
If so, isn't he the perp after all?

232
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,311
But it's impossible.

233
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:38,611
Impossible?

234
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:41,311
As you can see,

235
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:45,711
there are iron bars on all the windows of this annex.

236
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:51,411
And those two bodyguards were at the only entrance there is,

237
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:56,511
frisking any and everyone who entered.

238
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,611
They would've known immediately

239
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,411
if someone was carrying a blunt object.

240
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,711
They were even using a metal detector.

241
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,911
Isn't it possible that something that was at the annex,

242
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,911
to begin with, was used as the murder weapon?

243
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:13,311
No. President Hiyama had a lot of enemies

244
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,811
because of his dishonest business practices.

245
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,911
So to avoid being attacked by his visitors,

246
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:20,511
the only thing that could serve as a weapon was that mop.

247
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,311
Nothing else was kept in the annex.

248
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:27,811
Of course, no luminol reaction was found from that mop either.

249
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,011
Does that mean that the man was already dead

250
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:33,211
when that man entered the annex?

251
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:34,411
Yeah.

252
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,611
After going through a body check,

253
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,811
Mr. Senba entered the annex and called out

254
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,311
but no one answered.

255
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:43,111
So he went into the bathroom since the door was ajar and looked in.

256
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,411
That's when he found President Hiyama lying on the floor

257
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:46,911
bleeding from the head.

258
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,611
He ran over to him

259
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,711
and stepped on the shards of glass at the entrance.

260
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,811
He then went back to the entrance

261
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:54,511
and reported this to the bodyguards.

262
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:58,911
And where is that man now?

263
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,211
He's at the main house being treated

264
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,011
for his wound by a woman police officer.

265
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,411
Hey.

266
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,011
I'm sorry if I'm mistaken,

267
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:09,611
but was the water left running

268
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,611
from the faucet in the bathroom, by any chance?

269
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,211
Yes, it seems so.

270
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,111
But how did you know?

271
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,111
I thought so.

272
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,211
Mr. Akai.

273
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,811
Is there something to this case?

274
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:29,411
You've already realized too, haven't you, sonny?

275
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,111
It resembles the Koji Haneda murder

276
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,711
that occurred 17 years ago to a tee.

277
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:42,211
To that case that inspired me to become...

278
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,411
an FBI agent.

279
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:58,778
Inspired you to become an FBI agent?

280
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:01,178
You mean you were already involved

281
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:04,078
in that Koji Haneda case 17 years ago, Mr. Akai?

282
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,078
No, my father was the one who was directly involved.

283
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:10,678
Then... then, does that mean that your father

284
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,778
was also an FBI agent, too?

285
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,178
No, he wasn't an FBI agent.

286
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:18,178
But if you're going to ask me about my father,

287
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,878
I'd like you to tell me about

288
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,178
your identity too, sonny.

289
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:24,378
Oh, well.

290
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,878
I'll do that after everything is solved.

291
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:28,078
I see.

292
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:31,778
I think he already knows, though.

293
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,678
Hey, hey. What on earth's going on?

294
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,178
"Kazunori Senba (50)" -I thought that I get to home...

295
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:40,678
"Former Candy Shop Owner" -after my wounds were treated?

296
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:43,778
We... we still have some questions to ask you.

297
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:45,678
Could it be that he's the...

298
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:46,978
Yes.

299
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:50,278
He's the one who first discovered the body, Mr. Kazunori Senba.

300
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,878
Oh, you mean the one who stepped on the shards of glass at the site

301
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,578
of the scene and got hurt?

302
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:57,078
Yes, that's right.

303
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:02,178
Excuse me, did you step on the glass with your right foot?

304
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:03,178
What?

305
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:07,478
It seems that you were walking protecting your right foot, you see.

306
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:10,778
No. I hurt my left foot today.

307
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:14,378
As to my right foot, I got into a car accident last month and broke it.

308
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,378
It's the aftereffect of it.

309
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:19,378
Thanks to that, I was in the hospital till last week.

310
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:22,878
I mean, are you a cop or something?

311
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:26,178
No, he's the one that cooperated with the invention of the scissors

312
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,578
that Mr. Hiyama was holding.

313
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:31,878
I wonder if you could recreate the time

314
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,978
when you found the corpse?

315
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:36,478
There's something that's bothering me, you see.

316
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:40,378
Why do I have to talk to you who's not even a cop?

317
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:42,778
Hey, you know, the scissors...

318
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,678
They have another special function,

319
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,778
so if you did something near the corpse,

320
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:51,778
that function may have been activated.

321
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:54,278
Right, Doc?

322
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,278
Yeah.

323
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,578
What... what thing?

324
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,078
I can't tell you what it is yet.

325
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,278
Well, will you please just do what you did

326
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:04,078
when you first found the corpse?

327
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,578
Huh?

328
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:08,278
Was there such a function?

329
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:14,078
First, I was body checked by these two bodyguards

330
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,778
at the entrance of this annex.

331
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:21,378
And then I opened the sliding door, went inside

332
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:24,578
and waited a while, but since he showed no signs of coming out,

333
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:26,778
I went inside and called out to him.

334
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:29,478
But no matter how long I waited, I got no answer.

335
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,278
Then...

336
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,778
I saw that the door of the bathroom beyond was ajar

337
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:37,878
so I looked inside

338
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:40,278
and this is what I found.

339
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,178
What is it?

340
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,478
Oh, well.

341
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,778
They wanted to recreate what happened

342
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:48,478
because the special function of the scissor

343
00:18:48,478 --> 00:18:49,678
may have been activated.

344
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,378
And? Since you saw

345
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:57,178
Mr. Hiyama bleeding from the head and crouched,

346
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,878
you inadvertently ran over to him, correct?

347
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:00,978
Yeah.

348
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:03,978
Despite the fact that so many shards of glass

349
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:06,578
are apparently scattered all over the floor.

350
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,378
Well, when I looked in,

351
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:12,178
the door was only slightly open, you see.

352
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:15,578
That... that's why when I tried to run over to the corpse

353
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:18,778
I didn't notice the shards of glass and poked myself.

354
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,478
If so, it's strange, no?

355
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:25,478
Because if the door was almost closed,

356
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:28,378
when you tried to open the door and go inside,

357
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,578
the shards of glass would've been

358
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:33,078
pushed back by the door.

359
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:37,278
Besides, if the perp closed the door,

360
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:39,078
I think that the shards of glass

361
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,078
would've been pushed closer to the entrance.

362
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:42,678
Oh, that's right.

363
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,278
My mistake.

364
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:47,078
The door was wide open like this.

365
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,678
I was distracted by the body

366
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:51,678
that I didn't even notice the floor.

367
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,378
Really?

368
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:55,778
So... so what?

369
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,578
Are you saying that I'm the one who did it?

370
00:19:58,578 --> 00:19:59,978
Take a good look.

371
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:01,778
If I punched somebody to the point of making him bleed,

372
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:03,978
I would've gotten blood myself, too.

373
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:07,978
But is there any blood on my clothes?

374
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:09,478
Huh?

375
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:11,678
The button on the bottom part of your shirt

376
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,378
is not buttoned correctly.

377
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,378
What?

378
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:20,078
Your shirt's not tucked in behind either.

379
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,878
Although your necktie's neatly in place,

380
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:24,178
you're pretty sloppy otherwise.

381
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:26,178
Oh, well. This is...

382
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,178
I... I just happened to be dressed this way today.

383
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:30,878
At... at any rate, I didn't have any blunt object on me

384
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:32,978
that would serve as a murder weapon!

385
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:35,578
That's proof that I'm not the perp!

386
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:37,978
This is outrageous. I'm leaving.

387
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:40,078
Oh, not yet.

388
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:42,778
Wait. Hold on a second!

389
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:44,978
Please, Mr. Senba!

390
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,478
Okay, we've finished taking pictures.

391
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:49,778
So let's retrieve the shards of this cup.

392
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:50,978
I guess so.

393
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:52,678
Did Mr. Senba

394
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:55,078
step on the shards of glass barefooted?

395
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,878
No, he was wearing slippers.

396
00:20:57,878 --> 00:20:59,678
Here as you can see.

397
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,378
I see.

398
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:04,878
So that's the story.

399
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:11,478
Do those slippers have something to do

400
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,678
with the function of those scissors?

401
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:16,378
The cracked cup here

402
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:20,278
is the same as the cup on the counter of the sink, correct?

403
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,478
Yes.

404
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:24,878
It seems the Fusae Brand collaborated with a tableware maker

405
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:26,578
to make those cups.

406
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,178
Fusae's?

407
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:31,878
And? Does the cup have something to do with the scissors?

408
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,278
Excuse me, please make way for the body.

409
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:45,578
Sweet...

410
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:46,978
Scent.

411
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:53,878
There was a strange smell coming from the body.

412
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,078
Yeah.

413
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:58,478
There seems to have been some gooey substance

414
00:21:58,478 --> 00:22:01,478
like honey on the wound of the body for some reason.

415
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:02,978
-Honey? -Honey?

416
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:06,678
Does the honey have something to do with the scissors?

417
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:12,578
If not, will you please leave the site?

418
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,178
Hey, are you listening to me?

419
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,478
The scissors that the victim was holding,

420
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:20,778
the cup that fell to the floor and cracked.

421
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:24,278
The scent of honey that was on the corpse,

422
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,778
the faucet with the water running.

423
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,378
How did the perp kill Mr. Hiyama?

424
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:56,878
"Next Episode" -Even if Mr. Senba, who didn't have

425
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:58,878
a murder weapon on him is not the perp,

426
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:00,578
how on earth did the perp...

427
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:04,878
I guess we've found the murder weapon

428
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,678
we were looking for.

429
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,078
You've figured out who the perp is and the trick he used?

430
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:11,078
Yes, we've figured it out.

431
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:12,378
Yep.

432
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:13,578
I've bought what you asked for.

433
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:16,478
The capsule toy, honey,

434
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:18,278
colored ball and large marble.

435
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:20,778
Next Conan,

436
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:24,478
"The Same Crime Scene as 17 Years Ago (Part 2)"

437
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,421
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:29,721
"Colored Ball"

439
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,321
The evidence is sweet honey.

440
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:33,721
-But meat and potatoes... -Shouldn't be cooked too sweet.
