1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,990
The two coincidentally simultaneous
murders were solved,

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,200
and the old man's lecture
concluded without incident.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,250
Event guest Kisaki Eri arrived, and
the panel was just about to begin

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,500
with the last minute addition
of a surprising guest...

I look forward to working with you.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,070
Right now at this moment,
light pierces the darkness!

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,020
Overcome all limits with
your cool reasoning skills!

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,790
The old man and his wife appear on a panel,
but a detective girl picks a fight!

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,410
Always determining the one truth

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,270
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,320
his name is Detective Conan!

00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,208
You're appearing on the panel, too?

24
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,028
Yes.

25
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:52,988
I'm actually studying criminal
psychology in college.

26
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,228
So that's why.

27
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,608
I see.

28
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,508
I asked the president and
manager to let me go onstage,

29
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:03,118
since it seemed like there weren't
enough guests for the panel.

Event Company President
Ujimori Yusaku (45)

33
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:08,548
I apologize for the change in plans,

34
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,728
but honestly, as the event organizer,

35
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:15,328
I'd like to do whatever I can to dispel the
rumors that will surely spread about the murders.

36
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:18,638
Kisaki-sensei, what do you think?

37
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:22,478
Sounds interesting.

38
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:24,518
I don't mind at all.

39
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:26,478
Huh?

40
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:30,128
Very well. Ask me anything.

41
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,648
As the greatest of great detectives,

42
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:36,388
I, Mori Kogoro, shall reveal all my secrets.

43
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,778
Thank you!

44
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,428
Then let's get ready.

45
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,158
Got it.

46
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:45,208
In here.

49
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,018
Thank you. Could I get a coffee?

50
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,478
Yes, right away.

51
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:56,668
Oh.

52
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:58,928
What's this?

53
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:01,928
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:08,748
That's odd. These scraps of paper
weren't here when I cleaned earlier.

55
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:11,328
Wait!

56
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,138
Don't throw those away!

57
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:12,828
What?

58
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:16,198
Hanai Rika (23)

59
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:17,938
Thank you for waiting.
Hanai Rika (23)

60
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,318
We'd now like to move onto the panel.
Hanai Rika (23)
MC

61
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:22,018
We'd now like to move onto the panel.

62
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:24,828
Due to certain circumstances, we've
drastically changed the content of the event.

63
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:25,768
What are the great detective's secrets?!
A new heroine enquires!

64
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:30,558
"What are the great detective's
secrets?! A new heroine enquires!"
What are the great detective's secrets?!
A new heroine enquires!

65
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,608
is the new title we'll be going with.
What are the great detective's secrets?!
A new heroine enquires!

66
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:33,088
What are the great detective's secrets?!
A new heroine enquires!

67
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,898
Allow me to introduce our panelists.

68
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:39,108
First up is the man who just regaled
us with his entertaining stories,

69
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,338
the great detective Mori Kogoro.

70
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,318
Thank you.

71
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:48,728
Next is the lawyer Kisaki Eri-sensei.

72
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,058
Hello.

73
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:56,458
We're hoping to get your thoughts
from a legal perspective.

74
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,858
Thank you for having me.

75
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,358
Dad, Mom!

76
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:03,728
Finally, representing us as a special guest

77
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:07,648
is the new generation's detective girl,

78
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:12,378
and student of criminal
psychology, Tsukuba Mei-san.

79
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,378
Hello.

80
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:22,888
The game should be over by now
if it didn't go into overtime.

81
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,898
All right. The next step is...

82
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,388
That was a great game!

83
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:35,268
I thought it'd go into overtime, but then
they made that comeback with a header!

84
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,018
So cool!

85
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:43,538
But Conan-kun and Ai-chan never showed up.

86
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:44,568
I wonder why?

87
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:48,078
I know. They could've reached out to us.

88
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:53,078
Then they'll be treating us
to extra large eel bowls!

89
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,338
What? Oh, no.

90
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:05,138
We've been waiting for you, Detective Boys.

91
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:06,598
Conan-kun, Ai-chan.

92
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,348
What's going on?

93
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:12,148
Is it true that there were two murders here?

94
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:15,318
Depending on your answer, you
might also owe us giant pork buns!

95
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:18,028
Just come inside.

96
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:27,018
We found three of these
in different locations.

97
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:31,388
Two were at crime scenes, and the other
was in Kisaki-san's changing room.

98
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:34,608
Ran-oneesan's mom?

99
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,248
What is this?

100
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:39,208
Probably some kind of message or code.

101
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,248
A code?

102
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:44,348
Which means there must be a
codebook for deciphering it.

103
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:45,758
A codebook?

104
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:47,328
I know!

105
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:50,508
It's a set of rules for letters or sentences

106
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:55,028
that appear randomly organized showing how
rearranging them according to certain rules

107
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:58,428
or removing certain sections creates
a meaningful message, right?

108
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,768
That's right.

109
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,028
It's what?

110
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:07,768
For example, if the menu of your favorite
eel restaurant were a codebook,

111
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:08,658
if you removed only the
letters in "eel bowl" (unaju)

112
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:09,908
U-NA-JI-YU-U
if you removed only the
letters in "eel bowl" (unaju)

113
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:11,408
KI-MO-SU-I
U-NA-JI-YU-U
if you removed only the
letters in "eel bowl" (unaju)

114
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,788
or "liver soup" (kimosui) from a
sentence that appears random...
U-NA-JI-YU-U
KI-MO-SU-I

115
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,228
Oh, I see.

116
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,048
In other words, we need to
find an eel restaurant's menu.

117
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,378
You can count on us!

118
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,048
No!

119
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:26,298
We're looking for the magazine
these pages were torn from.

120
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,298
It should be someplace visible.

121
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:31,058
Why?

122
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,728
It's a long story.

123
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:37,488
But if we don't hurry, I have a feeling
something terrible will happen.

124
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:39,058
So let's find that magazine first.

125
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,628
Got it.

126
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,558
The Detective Boys are on the case.

127
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:45,698
All right! I'm not sure what's
going on, but let's do this!

128
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,698
Yeah!

129
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:48,568

131
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,588
Next, new generation's girl
detective Tsukuba Mei-san,

132
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:06,478
it seems you have some questions
for the Sleeping Kogoro.

133
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,978
Oh, yes!

134
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:11,928
My friend asked me about a murder

135
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:16,598
that happened at a certain
college one year ago.

136
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:17,728
What?

137
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:21,338
I see. Why don't you tell us the details?

138
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,228
All right.

139
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:22,438
University

140
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:23,228

141
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:24,068
Research Lab

142
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:28,628
The victim was a professor at the college.

143
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:32,088
The police arrested the
professor's assistant,

144
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,418
who was also the older brother of my friend.

145
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:38,538
Allegedly his motive was the professor
claimed a paper he had written

146
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:39,248
Ashida Hiroto (26)
Research Assistant
Allegedly his motive was the professor
claimed a paper he had written

147
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:41,998
was plagiarized from his own work
and threatened to ruin his career.
Ashida Hiroto (26)
Research Assistant

148
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:43,998
You...

149
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:44,998
Huh?

150
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:46,208
Nothing.

151
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,428
Come to think of it, that did happen.

152
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:54,368
The suspect confessed to his crime,
and he was found guilty in court.

153
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,518
I don't think there was
any problem with the case.

154
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:57,998
There's a huge problem!

156
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,388
I found it! This is it!
Staff Room

157
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,928
Look at this.

158
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,148
This is definitely it.

159
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,828
Caseweek, huh?

160
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:12,908
Caseweek?

161
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:16,158
That's a famous American news magazine.

162
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:16,448
Japanese Edition

163
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,908
But this is in Japanese.
Japanese Edition

164
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,178
Does that mean it's the Japanese version?

165
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:23,168
The American edition and
the Japanese edition...

166
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,248
Japanese Edition

167
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:26,448
English and Japanese...
Japanese Edition

168
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:26,548
Japanese Edition

169
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:32,178
I see. So that's how it is.

170
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,158
I've cracked the code!

171
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,608
Really?

172
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,178
There's also this.

173
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,048
University Professor Murdered
There's also this.

174
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:38,428
University Professor Murdered

175
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:43,688
Toto Keizai Newspaper
University Professor Murdered

176
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:44,428
And that.

177
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:45,938
There's a huge problem!
And that.

178
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:48,048
A huge problem?

179
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,378
Yes.

180
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:52,448
The murder of the professor at
that college isn't over yet.

181
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:56,828
There's no doubt that Ashida Hiroto, who's
currently serving time, was the murderer.

182
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,698
Even by my deduction.

183
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,608
But my friend can't believe he'd
steal another person's paper,

184
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:09,708
much less kill someone over one.

185
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:13,218
I see. Is that right?

186
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:19,218
Takagi, I have an urgent request.

187
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:23,938
But ultimately, he offered no
other testimony at his trial,

188
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:27,138
and no appeal was made.

189
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,228
Why would he do that?

190
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,518
I'd like you to determine that, Mori-san.

191
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:33,158
What?

192
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,488
I'm not sure what you expect me to do.

193
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:38,758
Of course.

194
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,998
You couldn't possibly know.

195
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:41,888
Huh?

196
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,708
After all, you're a hack who couldn't
even decipher the mystery message

197
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,748
left at the crime scene!

198
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,315
Is that true, Takagi?

199
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:09,405
Yes. You were right, Mori-san.

200
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,625
Got it. Contact the inspector.

201
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,465
Have him return immediately.

202
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,685
Tell him this case isn't over yet.

203
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,665
I-It's what?

204
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:22,585
Also, Takagi, could you do one other thing?

205
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,625
Where did Conan-kun go?

206
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,545
Over there.

207
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,835
What's up with Conan?

208
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,285
Haibara-san?

209
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:32,845
Wait, Ai-chan!

210
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,845
Why didn't he make an appeal?

211
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:39,345
Because he lost hope. He was betrayed.

212
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,475
Betrayed? By who?

213
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:48,365
By his irresponsible court-appointed
lawyer who quit his case!

214
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:49,735
I knew it!

215
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:51,515
Lawyer?

216
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:53,485
Could it be?

217
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:59,825
Yes. She's talking about me.

218
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:02,735
And you're Mei-san, the younger
sister of Ashida Hiroto-san,

219
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:07,255
the man currently serving time in prison.

220
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,005
Sh-She's what?!

221
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:13,965
In other words, you're not
talking about your friend.

222
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,515
You're talking about yourself, Mei-san.

223
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,105
That's right.

224
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:22,605
I believe Tsukuba was your
mother's maiden name.

225
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:28,025
And you're studying criminal psychology
at an American university.

226
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:32,545
I remember now that I heard you've been
studying abroad since two years ago.

227
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,155
When did you return?

228
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:36,155
A week ago.

229
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,815
Why didn't you contact me?

230
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:43,585
Because I didn't want to hear your excuses!

231
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:44,785
Hey, wait!

232
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,495
What are you trying to do?

233
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:58,925
I've deciphered the coded message, Mei-san.

234
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,475
Don't do anything hasty.

235
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:02,955
That's it!

236
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,185
He's asleep!

237
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:06,515
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

238
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,525
Dad...

239
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,685
Then decipher it for me, detective.

240
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:15,165
Very well.

241
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:20,035
I just received word from
someone who found the codebook.

242
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:25,415
The layered pages torn from the
Japanese edition of Caseweek

243
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,755
were pages 11 and 9,

244
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:34,925
19 and 1, and 11 and 9 again.

245
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,185
When applied to the alphabet,

246
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,495
11 corresponds to K and 9
corresponds to I, spelling KI.

247
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:46,555
19 is S and 1 is A, spelling SA.

248
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:49,595
Finally, the last code is the
same as the first, spelling KI.

249
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,405
When read all together,

250
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:56,275
they spell K-I-S-A-K-I, or Kisaki.

251
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,775
C-Could it be?

252
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:00,475
In other words, I was her target.

253
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,785
But in that case...

254
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,635
Yes.

255
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,785
She could've acted anytime.

256
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,575
But she didn't.

257
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,805
She deliberately left a message
and even had us find the codebook,

258
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,025
University President Murdered
She deliberately left a message
and even had us find the codebook,

259
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:22,555
University President Murdered

260
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,175
which featured an article on the case.

261
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,055
Conan, where did you find the codebook?

262
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:28,555
I'm here!

263
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:31,515
The Detective Boys will answer that.

264
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,685
Mitsuhiko.

265
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,855
Oh, uh, well...

266
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:44,405
It was inside her locker.

267
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,525
Mitsuhiko-kun found it.

268
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:47,825
That's right.

269
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,055
I found it!

270
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,085
Tsukuba

271
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:57,945
Why did she leave it someplace so obvious?

272
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,915
Because she wanted me

273
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:06,095
to reveal her brother's true motive.

274
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:08,985
And perhaps, if possible,

275
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:13,455
to stop her from doing
what she's about to do.

276
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:18,105
So you figured out his true motive.

277
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,235
Not even I know that.

278
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,495
What? Don't be ridiculous!

279
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:28,995
But I can identify someone who does know.

280
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:31,205
Who?

281
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:35,965
First, as far as I know, she may
have been appointed by the court,

282
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:40,005
but Kisaki-sensei would
never step down from a case.

283
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:44,905
She was probably dismissed by your brother.

284
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:47,515
What? Why?

285
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:51,965
Because she identified his true motive.

286
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:54,895
Don't speak.

287
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,545
What do you mean?

288
00:15:56,545 --> 00:16:01,645
In order to plead extenuating circumstances,
it would have to be revealed in court.

289
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:04,655
But your brother refused.

290
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:07,805
So he dismissed her.

291
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,805
Silence, Mori Kogoro!

292
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,985
Say anymore, and I'll sue!

293
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:13,535
Be my guest.

294
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:16,355
But allow me to say this.

295
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:21,135
Even after she was dismissed,
rather than moving on,

296
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:22,865
she continued investigating the case.

297
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,465
But why?

298
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:31,855
She was probably searching for documents

299
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:35,315
demonstrating extenuating circumstances
that didn't touch on his true motive.

300
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:37,985
You're lying! That's just an excuse!

301
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,405
Mom! Dad!

302
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:53,665
This is bad!

303
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,045
What's going on?

304
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:05,175
Calm down, everyone!

305
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:15,885
Kisaki-sensei, unless you
reveal his true motive now,

306
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:18,005
she won't put down the knife.

307
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:25,915
At first she only joined
the staff of my event

308
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,775
so she could get close to you.

309
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,555
But by chance, two murders occurred.

310
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:37,645
She decided to use them to
confront you more effectively.

311
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:43,935
So she tore pages from the
magazine featuring an article

312
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,875
on her brother's case that she always
carried with her and left a coded message,

313
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:53,725
all so she could use me to reveal the truth
about the case and tell it to the world.

314
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:56,975
Is that true?

315
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:01,235
You really are a great detective.

316
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,965
But I'm a lawyer.

317
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:10,075
I'd never do anything to harm a client.

318
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,745
Of course not. However,

319
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:17,325
someday the one truth will be revealed.

320
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:21,505
Is that not natural as well?

321
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:48,025
Your brother's true motive was you, Mei-san.

322
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:49,275
What?

323
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:55,165
The truth uncovered by Kisaki was shocking.

324
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:59,285
The plagiarism thought to be his motive
for murder was actually the reverse.

325
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:05,745
It was the professor who stole
Mei-san's brother's paper.

326
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,145
When he went to complain,

327
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:11,805
the professor revealed the dark secret
behind Mei-san's study abroad program.

328
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:16,655
Her recommendation had
been bought by her mother,

329
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,675
who had passed away the
previous year from an illness.

330
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:21,265
He threatened to expose the truth.

331
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:25,435
N-No... My mom?

332
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:27,855
You mustn't blame your mother.

333
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:31,985
She was just trying to
do what was best for you.

334
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:37,245
Kisaki's investigation revealed even more.

335
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:43,245
Her mother only made the bribe because
that professor had urged her to do so.

336
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:47,005
Furthermore, he demanded even more money
if he didn't want the situation exposed

337
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:51,465
after you concluded your
study abroad program.

338
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,505
M-My brother!

339
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:58,415
Your brother kept his silence to protect you

340
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:02,025
and your mother without
concern for himself.

341
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,525
I... had no idea...

342
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,295
I... I...

343
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,295
Ouch...

344
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:28,965
Huh?

345
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:30,965
Don't!

346
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,555
Let go! Let me die!

347
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,515
Listen to this, Mei-san!

348
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,265
Mori-san, this is Takagi!

349
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:43,225
Huh?

350
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:49,985
As you instructed, I met with Ashiya Hiroto.

351
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:53,005
He'd like to hire Kisaki-sensei again.

352
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:54,525
He'll rescind her dismissal.

353
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:55,725
What?

354
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:58,785
When I told him about the situation,

355
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:03,925
he apologized for making his sister worry.

356
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,035
Brother...

357
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,045
Good grief.

358
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:13,725
Mori-kun!

359
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:14,705
Mori-san!
Mori-kun!

360
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:15,045
Mori-san!

361
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:18,245
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

362
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:23,795
Now we can request a retrial.

363
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:26,055
Wait a minute...

364
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:29,375
You're just a detective. You
should've stayed out of this!

365
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,435
What?

366
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:33,445
This is really bad.

367
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,515
It wasn't because I'm just a detective.

368
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:40,695
I had to do it because I'm a detective.

369
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:48,455
Dad, Mom...

370
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:16,195

The retrial began,

372
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:23,385
but it was unclear if the defendant's extenuating
circumstances would be recognized or not.

I'm sure he'll be fine.

376
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:28,435
After all, he's got the
best lawyer on his side.

380
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,785
I still can't remember what happened.

381
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:42,365
Well, whatever. That's nothing
new, and beer still tastes good.

382
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:49,255
Don't compare detective work to beer.

383
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,895
Although it all works out
because he's that kind of guy.
