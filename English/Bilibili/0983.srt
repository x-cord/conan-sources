1
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.490
I can't.

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.740
I can't do it.

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.300
If I just tell her how I feel someplace with
beautiful scenery, I'll be losing to Kudo.

4
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.970
If I'm going to beat him,
I'll have to steel my resolve.

5
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.230
After all, at the Kiyomizu Temple
butai in front of all those people,

6
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.730
he kissed her.

7
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.620
He went all out.

8
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.320
It really was mouth-to-mouth.

9
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.920
He should've told me beforehand
that he was going to do that.

10
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.330
He surprised me.

11
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.300
What surprised you?

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580
K-Kazuha?

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.580
I bought tea.

14
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.750
Here.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.090
Thanks.

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.370
So, what surprised you?

17
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.840
Th-That the museum where Kudo—

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.800
I mean, Conan-kun and the others are meeting
us today might be visited by Kaito Kid.

19
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.890
That sure surprised me.

20
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.350
I know!

21
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.900
There was a rumor that Kid was standing on
top of the Tsutenkaku Tower the other day,

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.240
but I didn't see him myself.

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.190
I'm excited!

24
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.630
Y-Yeah...

25
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.740
Speaking of excitement,
I'm excited about Kid's target,

26
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.570
the world's largest pearl, the Fairy Lip.

27
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.170
I wish I could see that thin
pink-colored pearl now.

28
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.420
"Fairy Lip."

29
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.670
A pixie's lips...

30
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.550
A pixie's... lips...

31
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.210
Her... lips...

32
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.730
Hey, Heiji!

33
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.380
What's gotten into you?

34
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.890
You've been staring at my mouth.

35
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.030
Oh, uh, yeah...

36
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.110
It's seaweed. I had takoyaki this morning.

37
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.280
If Ran-chan and the others
see, they'll laugh at me.

38
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.120
Takoyaki, huh?

39
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.180
Bet they taste like sauce.

40
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.110
Find the question that solves the mystery!

41
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.000
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

42
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.880
Kid's target is the Fairy Lip!

43
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.470
The anxious Heiji's target is a kiss?

44
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.030
Always determining the one truth

45
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.720
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

46
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.180
his name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:21.468
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips
(Part One)

48
00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:25.748
"Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips, Part One!"
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips
(Part One)

49
00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:26.958
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips
(Part One)

50
00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:28.078
What?

51
00:04:28.578 --> 00:04:30.208
You're almost at Shin-Yokohama?

52
00:04:30.378 --> 00:04:31.158
Yeah.

53
00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:34.208
Yeah. I'll meet you at Tokyo Station.

54
00:04:34.558 --> 00:04:34.778
Wait for me there, Kazuha-chan.

55
00:04:34.778 --> 00:04:36.198
That rich geezer flamboyantly
picked a fight with Kid again.
Wait for me there, Kazuha-chan.

56
00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:37.088
That rich geezer flamboyantly
picked a fight with Kid again.

57
00:04:37.088 --> 00:04:40.588
Steal It If You Can!!
That rich geezer flamboyantly
picked a fight with Kid again.

58
00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:40.838
Steal It If You Can!!

59
00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:44.568
Anyway, are we seriously
going to this museum?

60
00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:49.058
We probably won't get a good look at the
jewel because of all the crazy security.

61
00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:50.348
Oh, but it says,

62
00:04:50.828 --> 00:04:52.778
"Arrangements have been made

63
00:04:52.778 --> 00:04:58.358
that allow the jewel to be
seen clearly from all angles."

64
00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:01.738
He can actually read the kanji.

65
00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:05.238
They may have set up something special.

66
00:05:05.408 --> 00:05:06.538
One Week Earlier

67
00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:07.998
This won't do.
One Week Earlier

68
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:14.328
This security will allow
that moonlit magician

69
00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:16.798
to easily steal the jewel
and run off with it.

70
00:05:17.048 --> 00:05:20.658
I'm willing to ignore
him stealing the jewel.

71
00:05:20.658 --> 00:05:25.178
But don't you have any better strategies
to prevent him from escaping?

72
00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:27.558
I told you,

73
00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:31.348
if we increase the number of
security guards around the jewel,

74
00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:34.018
he won't steal it in the first place.

75
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:36.338
But if we bring in more guards,

76
00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:40.648
the guests coming to see the jewel
won't be able to enjoy themselves.

77
00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:43.988
I don't care about the guests.

78
00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:47.168
They're probably mostly Kid fans anyway.

79
00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:53.708
In any case, we have one week
until the jewel goes on display.

80
00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:56.128
We have to come up with
a better plan by then.

81
00:05:56.508 --> 00:06:02.628
We'll probably end up seeing that smug
scoundrel's audacious smile again.

82
00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:10.928
I came all the way down to the Metropolitan
Police Department, but I wasted my time.

83
00:06:10.928 --> 00:06:14.928
But, sir, Inspector Nakamori is right.

84
00:06:14.928 --> 00:06:18.148
Shouldn't we tighten
security around the jewel?

85
00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:23.788
For example, we could encase the jewel's
display box inside a metal cage.

86
00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:26.618
Even if we did that, he'd steal it anyway.

87
00:06:26.978 --> 00:06:29.758
Like I said, the best
defense is a good offense.

88
00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:32.618
We have to come up with a way
to keep him from escaping.

89
00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:37.598
Attacking the outside without fortifying
the inside is a foolish plan.

90
00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:38.288
What?

91
00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:46.838
It's what a famous Chinese
tactician once said.

92
00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:49.658
Are you with the police?

93
00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:52.398
Yes, though not the MPD.

94
00:06:52.398 --> 00:06:56.278
But how am I supposed to fortify the inside?

95
00:06:56.278 --> 00:07:01.518
People always question if I have any
intention of displaying the object to guests.

96
00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:05.548
Then how about this?

97
00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:10.368
I-Is this...

98
00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:11.408
Ice?

99
00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:16.058
They stuck the jewel inside ice?

100
00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:18.918
I see.

101
00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.418
It certainly allows it to be
seen clearly from all angles.

102
00:07:23.658 --> 00:07:25.728
But it's just ice.

103
00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:30.358
Heat will melt it, and it
can be drilled through.

104
00:07:30.358 --> 00:07:32.428
Don't worry about that.

105
00:07:32.658 --> 00:07:37.938
Using a blowtorch to melt this
much ice would take a long time,

106
00:07:38.138 --> 00:07:44.338
and it's impossible to extract the jewel
with a drill without scratching it.

107
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:47.728
Furthermore, we've enclosed the
jewel's display area in hard glass,

108
00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:52.198
and lowered the temperature
compared to other rooms.

109
00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.898
Not only does it make the ice harder to melt,

110
00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:56.838
but since security is outside the glass,

111
00:07:56.838 --> 00:08:03.208
it allows the jewel to be observed without
an oppressive air of intimidation.

112
00:08:03.498 --> 00:08:06.488
This is a great idea that you came up with.

113
00:08:06.488 --> 00:08:09.088
It wasn't my idea.

114
00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:12.048
It was the good idea of the man who returned
to offer his assistance again today,

115
00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:18.808
Nagano Prefectural Police Section
1's Inspector Morofushi Takaaki.

116
00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:22.788
I simply suggested that using ice

117
00:08:22.788 --> 00:08:25.818
would allow guests to enjoy a
cool and refreshing experience.

118
00:08:26.018 --> 00:08:31.318
Though I did recommend that we implement the
idea immediately once we came up with it.

119
00:08:31.758 --> 00:08:34.488
They say celerity is the soul of warfare.

120
00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:36.148
Celerity?

121
00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.328
It's a famous saying from the
Annals of the Three Kingdoms.

122
00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:41.248
Inspector Morofushi, what are you doing here?

123
00:08:41.548 --> 00:08:46.628
The truth is, I came here the
other day to confirm something,

124
00:08:46.628 --> 00:08:50.638
but the detective on the case was
out conducting an investigation,

125
00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:53.588
so I couldn't meet with
him, so I returned today.

126
00:08:53.588 --> 00:08:57.438
And there was that female
officer serial murder case...

127
00:08:58.368 --> 00:09:00.008
Confirm something?

128
00:09:00.008 --> 00:09:01.808
A letter addressed to me.

129
00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:02.578
Please deliver this to Nagano
Prefectural Police Inspector

130
00:09:02.578 --> 00:09:06.288
To be precise, it's a letter that
seemed to be addressed to me.
Please deliver this to Nagano
Prefectural Police Inspector

131
00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:08.408
The letters are blurred
and difficult to read.
Please deliver this to Nagano
Prefectural Police Inspector

132
00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:10.748
The sender is unknown as well.
Please deliver this to Nagano
Prefectural Police Inspector

133
00:09:10.748 --> 00:09:10.778
The sender is unknown as well.

134
00:09:11.058 --> 00:09:14.858
Though I did choose to return to Tokyo today

135
00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:18.788
because General Advisor Suzuki
Jirokichi asked me to come.

136
00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:22.458
Ran-chan, do you know that detective?

137
00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:25.628
Yeah, from a case that happened in Nagano.

138
00:09:25.628 --> 00:09:30.128
Apparently he's childhood friends
with Inspector Yamato Kansuke

139
00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.048
and Detective Uehara Yui,
who you've met before.

140
00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:34.458
Really?

141
00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.908
Inspector Yamato calls him Komei.

142
00:09:37.908 --> 00:09:42.188
Apparently he's actually
as smart as Zhuge Kongming.

143
00:09:42.188 --> 00:09:43.058
I see.

144
00:09:48.248 --> 00:09:53.608
Two high school detectives and a
tactician-like cop from Nagano?

145
00:09:56.018 --> 00:09:58.898
I guess I won't steal it tonight.

146
00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:02.248
And as the days go by, that block
of ice will gradually get smaller.

147
00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:06.828
Anyway, it's an impressive pearl.

148
00:10:06.828 --> 00:10:09.628
Certainly for its color and size,

149
00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.358
but this pattern on the surface is exquisite.

150
00:10:12.358 --> 00:10:15.888
It truly is worthy of the name Fairy Lip.

151
00:10:15.888 --> 00:10:20.028
It's no wonder the general
advisor invited you.

152
00:10:20.028 --> 00:10:22.018
You've got a good eye.

153
00:10:22.508 --> 00:10:25.688
This pearl was found inside a giant oyster

156
00:10:29.148 --> 00:10:29.438
sleeping at the bottom of Mie Prefecture's Ago Bay.

157
00:10:29.438 --> 00:10:33.368
I was drawn to the brilliance of
the pearl's unique orient effect,

158
00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:37.408
and paid a huge sum for
that one-of-a-kind jewel.

159
00:10:37.718 --> 00:10:42.908
I'm honored to be part of
this plan to capture Kid.

160
00:10:43.388 --> 00:10:47.538
In exchange, I expect to be compensated
if it actually is stolen.

161
00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:48.408
Of course.

162
00:10:48.408 --> 00:10:52.868
After all, this jewel already
received a high offer at an auction,

163
00:10:52.868 --> 00:10:54.908
and is my personal possession.

164
00:10:54.908 --> 00:10:56.108
He's lying!

165
00:10:56.108 --> 00:11:00.678
That's a gift my grandfather received
from a wealthy Caribbean man

166
00:11:00.678 --> 00:11:02.268
while he was traveling overseas!

167
00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:03.428
I let you hold onto it because you
said you'd determine its value,

I let you hold onto it because you
said you'd determine its value,

I let you hold onto it because you
said you'd determine its value,

170
00:11:06.888 --> 00:11:08.398
but you won't return it!

171
00:11:08.638 --> 00:11:12.818
I looked into yours because it
looked similar to my own pearl,

172
00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:15.488
but as I recall, I already
returned yours to you.

173
00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:17.408
Yeah, you sure returned the ring!

174
00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:21.548
After swapping the jewel
out for a fake pearl!

175
00:11:22.378 --> 00:11:24.638
What's the meaning of this?

176
00:11:24.638 --> 00:11:29.588
I get crazy customers like her sometimes.

177
00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:31.838
In any case, give it back!

178
00:11:32.048 --> 00:11:37.648
That pearl was the wedding ring my
grandfather gave to my grandmother!

179
00:11:38.268 --> 00:11:40.758
I want to put it my late grandmother's coffin

180
00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:43.768
so she can take it with her to heaven!

181
00:11:43.768 --> 00:11:45.928
Let go of me!

182
00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:48.268
My grandmother's funeral is tomorrow!

183
00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:50.378
I'm running out of time!

184
00:11:50.378 --> 00:11:51.348
Let go!

185
00:11:51.348 --> 00:11:52.658
I see.

186
00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:54.278
In that case...

187
00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:57.818
Well? Have we still not
received a note from Kid?

188
00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.528
We haven't heard a peep out of him yet.

189
00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:05.338
Inspector Nakamori.

190
00:12:06.908 --> 00:12:07.858
What is it?

191
00:12:07.858 --> 00:12:09.498
There's a strange ball over there.

192
00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.328
Is this a BB pellet?

193
00:12:15.328 --> 00:12:17.378
What's it doing here?

194
00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.088
Inspector Nakamori.

195
00:12:19.088 --> 00:12:19.638
Huh?

196
00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:21.638
There's a card on the bottom of your shoe.

197
00:12:24.708 --> 00:12:26.048
What's this?

198
00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:30.898
"Tonight at midnight, I shall
come to take the fairy's lip."

199
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:35.068
Kaito Kid is coming after all!

200
00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:39.908
"I shall come to take the fairy's lip."

201
00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:44.648
To take the lip...

202
00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:58.765
Kaito Kid is coming after all!

203
00:13:01.725 --> 00:13:03.695
To take the lip...

204
00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:08.005
Heiji, you're staring at my mouth again!

205
00:13:08.835 --> 00:13:11.235
I do have seaweed on my mouth!

206
00:13:11.235 --> 00:13:12.715
Ran-chan, look!

207
00:13:12.715 --> 00:13:14.505
There's nothing there.

208
00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:15.735
I-It's not that!

209
00:13:16.035 --> 00:13:17.285
Hey, Kid is—

210
00:13:17.285 --> 00:13:19.055
Sh-Shut up!

211
00:13:19.055 --> 00:13:20.945
I haven't said anything yet.

212
00:13:20.945 --> 00:13:22.745
Is there something wrong with you?

213
00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:24.725
There's nothing wrong with me!

214
00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:29.185
Heiji, you've been acting weird
since we returned from Kyoto.

215
00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:30.165
Kyoto?

216
00:13:31.305 --> 00:13:35.175
Come to think of it, Hattori-kun was
there at the Kiyomizu Temple butai.

217
00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:38.925
If he saw that...

218
00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:47.055
Kazuha-chan, this time I might
actually sense love in the air.

219
00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:48.685
Love?

220
00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.065
Yeah, love.

221
00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:55.025
Ran-chan, I've had enough of that.

222
00:13:55.025 --> 00:13:56.835
But I appreciate the thought.

223
00:13:56.835 --> 00:14:00.575
What? But it's really for real this time.

224
00:14:01.025 --> 00:14:06.805
Anyway, when did Kid stick this
card on the bottom of my shoe?

225
00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.845
Maybe it's been there
since before you got here.

226
00:14:08.845 --> 00:14:11.585
You'd already decided that
you'd be coming here.

227
00:14:11.855 --> 00:14:16.365
Actually, it seems he
only just decided to act.

228
00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:16.925
What?

229
00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:24.305
Look. The card over here says
he'll arrive tomorrow at 8 PM.

230
00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:27.965
This card says he'll come
the day after tomorrow.

231
00:14:27.965 --> 00:14:29.975
There's even a card that
says he'll pass this time.

232
00:14:30.165 --> 00:14:31.665
What does this mean?

233
00:14:31.665 --> 00:14:35.395
He placed cards for various times
around the room beforehand.

234
00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:37.495
Once he'd chosen a card,

235
00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:39.865
by having Inspector Nakamori
walk over, step on,

236
00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:42.015
and show the note to the rest of us,

237
00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:45.405
regardless of the fact that he'd
only just made his decision,

238
00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:49.995
he wanted us to think that he'd
thought long and hard on his plan.

239
00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:55.805
Naturally, he probably intended to
secretly collect these extra cards later.

240
00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:56.675
I see.

241
00:14:56.675 --> 00:15:02.555
In other words, the officer who just
told me about the strange ball is Kid.

242
00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:04.715
Where is he?

243
00:15:06.525 --> 00:15:07.645
Was it you?

244
00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:10.765
N-No! Perhaps he's already left?

245
00:15:11.185 --> 00:15:13.145
Shit.

246
00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:16.275
That tactician-like cop
saw through everything.

247
00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:21.625
It's true that I just came up with that plan,

248
00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:26.285
but since I've already rigged the
ceiling, it's worth testing it out.

249
00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:30.235
The question is what to do
about that detective kid

250
00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:32.665
with the glasses and the high
school detective from Osaka.

251
00:15:33.815 --> 00:15:35.265
Hey, Heiji.

252
00:15:35.265 --> 00:15:36.375
Y-Yeah?

253
00:15:36.725 --> 00:15:37.965
What do you want to do?

254
00:15:37.965 --> 00:15:41.225
I was thinking we could stay
at Ran-chan's place tonight.

255
00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:44.365
As long as we're here, I've
got to stay here until tonight

256
00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:46.765
and help them catch Kid.

257
00:15:46.965 --> 00:15:48.275
You're right.

258
00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:51.305
Then I'll stay here and help, too.

259
00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:52.655
Y-You idiot!

260
00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:54.185
We're up against Kid here.

261
00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:55.555
It's too dangerous. You should leave.

262
00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:56.735
I see...

263
00:15:57.045 --> 00:16:00.605
I might get in your way if I stay here.

264
00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:06.235
W-Well, if you insist on staying,
then I suppose it can't be helped...

265
00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:07.115
Really?

266
00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:10.965
I-If you want to stay,
then it can't be helped.

267
00:16:10.965 --> 00:16:12.385
I see.

268
00:16:12.385 --> 00:16:14.125
I can use this.

269
00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:18.375
Anyway, are you sure just the ice is enough?

270
00:16:18.555 --> 00:16:20.755
I had the same thought,

271
00:16:20.755 --> 00:16:26.265
so I had the ring swapped out
for one with an internal sensor.

272
00:16:26.455 --> 00:16:29.635
If he passes through that
exit while holding the ring,

273
00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:32.475
an alarm will sound.

274
00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:36.155
Furthermore, next to the
door is an emergency button.

275
00:16:36.155 --> 00:16:39.645
Once pressed, the door is
locked for ten minutes.

276
00:16:40.045 --> 00:16:43.815
In other words, if we press the button
one minute before the time he declared,

277
00:16:43.815 --> 00:16:49.535
Kid's crime can be stopped before
it begins, ending in failure.

278
00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:55.375
Then articles describing how I stopped
his crime will be printed in newspapers,

279
00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:55.675
Kaito Kid
Completely Helpless
Victory for Suzuki Jirokichi!!
Then articles describing how I stopped
his crime will be printed in newspapers,

280
00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:59.545
and I'll reclaim my spot on the front page!
Victory for Suzuki Jirokichi!!
Kaito Kid
Completely Helpless

281
00:17:01.575 --> 00:17:05.545
Wouldn't it be faster for you to
buy the whole newspaper company?

282
00:17:05.805 --> 00:17:10.525
Damn it. Our plan is to stop Kid
from coming instead of catch him?

283
00:17:10.525 --> 00:17:12.555
I hardly feel motivated.

284
00:17:12.785 --> 00:17:16.295
A commander without courage
is no commander at all.

285
00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:19.705
It means if the commander of
an army is without courage,

286
00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.815
then it's like there is
no commander on the field.

287
00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:25.195
I-I know that.

288
00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:27.695
Inspector, the regular guests
are entering the museum.

289
00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:28.325
Got it.

290
00:17:36.325 --> 00:17:38.525
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

291
00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:39.915
You'd better hurry.

292
00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:40.585
I will.

293
00:17:41.255 --> 00:17:42.605
Ran-chan, Ran-chan!

294
00:17:42.605 --> 00:17:44.235
That thing's kind of funny looking.

295
00:17:44.235 --> 00:17:46.515
You're right. It's so funny.

296
00:17:46.515 --> 00:17:47.975
Hey, Kudo.

297
00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:48.715
What?

298
00:17:49.255 --> 00:17:51.875
Is Kid really that tough?

299
00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:52.825
Yeah.

300
00:17:52.825 --> 00:17:55.935
He's cunning. It's never
straightforward with him.

301
00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:57.095
Really?

302
00:17:57.095 --> 00:17:59.935
In that case, if I catch that thief...

303
00:18:00.355 --> 00:18:02.355
I'm impressed, Heiji!

304
00:18:02.355 --> 00:18:04.235
You're way better than Kudo-kun!

305
00:18:04.455 --> 00:18:05.605
Of course I am.

306
00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:10.765
I wouldn't mind you showing
you something even better.

307
00:18:10.765 --> 00:18:11.655
Heiji...

308
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.875
That's it!

309
00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:20.995
Heiji, you should look at this—

310
00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:26.125
I'm all sticky from the soda.

311
00:18:26.435 --> 00:18:28.865
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

312
00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:31.805
You can't bring drinks in here.

313
00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:33.765
I can't read Japanese.

314
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.265
I think it was written in English, too.

315
00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.235
I just bought these clothes.

316
00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:40.265
You can have them to make up for it.

317
00:18:40.265 --> 00:18:41.565
It's fine.

318
00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:43.175
Please take them.

319
00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:45.995
Anyway, I'm sorry.

320
00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:47.695
Hey, wait!

321
00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:48.425
Huh?

322
00:18:48.425 --> 00:18:52.305
This dress is from that brand the magazines
are saying is popular this year.

323
00:18:52.695 --> 00:18:53.295
Really?

324
00:18:53.295 --> 00:18:54.025
Yeah.

325
00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:57.215
As long as she's offering, why not accept it?

326
00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:01.035
You have to get changed anyway.

327
00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:02.455
Y-You're right.

328
00:19:02.805 --> 00:19:05.185
In that case, I'm going to
go change in the bathroom.

329
00:19:09.545 --> 00:19:10.925
Heiji!

330
00:19:12.145 --> 00:19:14.175
Tada!

331
00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:16.415
How do I look?

332
00:19:16.415 --> 00:19:17.935
So cute.

333
00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:19.615
Well, Heiji?

334
00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:21.645
Have you fallen in love with me again?

335
00:19:21.645 --> 00:19:23.225
Y-Yeah, I guess...

336
00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:24.785
Are you stupid?!

337
00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:26.525
I was never in love with you to begin with!

338
00:19:26.685 --> 00:19:28.955
This is too easy.

339
00:19:28.955 --> 00:19:32.035
I feel bad for putting her
to sleep in the bathroom,

340
00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:34.505
but I'll be going with this this time.

341
00:19:34.785 --> 00:19:36.735
Museum is closed for the day
Suzuki Museum

342
00:19:36.735 --> 00:19:39.665
Heiji, have you seen my phone?
Museum is closed for the day
Suzuki Museum

343
00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:42.135
I haven't seen it in a while.

344
00:19:42.135 --> 00:19:44.165
Want me to call it?

345
00:19:51.425 --> 00:19:53.895
Oh, it's in the room with the ice.

346
00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:57.735
I must've left it there after
taking a picture of the ring.

347
00:19:57.735 --> 00:19:58.805
Really?

348
00:19:59.205 --> 00:20:02.025
But it's almost the time Kid gave.

349
00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:04.075
You'll have to wait until it's over.

350
00:20:04.075 --> 00:20:05.055
What?!

351
00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:06.265
But if I don't have my phone,

352
00:20:06.265 --> 00:20:08.815
I won't be able to take a
picture of Kid if he shows up.

353
00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:09.735
Yeah, but...

354
00:20:10.025 --> 00:20:11.855
Please, Heiji.

355
00:20:11.855 --> 00:20:15.245
Ask the Inspector to let us go get it.

356
00:20:15.245 --> 00:20:16.835
You're ridiculous.

357
00:20:16.835 --> 00:20:18.065
What?

358
00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:20.915
Can't we?

359
00:20:21.205 --> 00:20:22.915
Heiji.

360
00:20:24.965 --> 00:20:27.165
Y-You're hopeless...

361
00:20:28.065 --> 00:20:28.965
What?

362
00:20:29.155 --> 00:20:31.805
Let you go get your phone?

363
00:20:31.805 --> 00:20:32.595
Yeah.

364
00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:34.835
We've still got ten minutes.

365
00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:36.235
We'll be quick.

366
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.615
You're hopeless.

367
00:20:37.615 --> 00:20:38.595
Thanks.

368
00:20:39.075 --> 00:20:40.295
We're running out of time.

369
00:20:40.295 --> 00:20:41.775
Be quick about it.

370
00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:42.845
Got it.

371
00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:43.975
Let's see...

372
00:20:44.735 --> 00:20:47.725
Oh, it's over here.

373
00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:56.125
He covered the ice with a clear sheet?

374
00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:00.955
H-Hey!

375
00:21:00.955 --> 00:21:02.875
What's this smoke?

376
00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:06.415
What?

377
00:21:06.805 --> 00:21:08.425
Hey, what's going on?

378
00:21:08.425 --> 00:21:09.295
Hey!

379
00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:12.445
He appears to have detonated some smoke bombs

380
00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:15.365
and sprayed an ink-like liquid in the air.

381
00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:16.125
Damn!

382
00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:18.715
We can't see what's happening inside!

383
00:21:20.215 --> 00:21:21.975
Is that the sound of a drill?

384
00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:25.225
Is he planning to drill a
hole in the ice and steal it?

385
00:21:25.445 --> 00:21:28.855
You'd throw something at the
mouse if not for the pot.

386
00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:29.985
What?

387
00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:33.485
Just as you can't throw something
at a mouse to kill it

388
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:37.235
because you're worried about
breaking the container beside it,

389
00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:41.245
Kid shouldn't be able to steal
the ring even if he wants to.

390
00:21:42.265 --> 00:21:43.865
This sound is a bluff.

391
00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:46.625
Let's wait for the door to open.

392
00:21:47.305 --> 00:21:49.365
Is that really true?

393
00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:54.505
Three, two, one, zero!

394
00:21:55.465 --> 00:21:56.845
Both of you, don't move!

395
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:58.195
Huh?

396
00:21:58.195 --> 00:22:00.095
What's this black sheet?

397
00:22:00.315 --> 00:22:01.485
I see.

398
00:22:01.485 --> 00:22:04.345
The ink stained the sheet that
came down from the ceiling black.

00:22:11.895 --> 00:22:13.555

Wh-What is this?

402
00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:17.485
There's tons of rings inside the ice!

403
00:22:17.735 --> 00:22:20.045
B-But how?

404
00:22:20.045 --> 00:22:22.095
It really is magic.

405
00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:23.995
W-Wait a minute.

406
00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:27.875
There's a long hole in
the middle of the block,

407
00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:30.915
and the ring is missing!
