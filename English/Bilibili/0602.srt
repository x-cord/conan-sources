1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.140
-Happy new year, everyone! -Happy new year, everyone!

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.540
Detective Conan has entered its 15th year.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.340
We will continue to solve one case after another this year too,

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.440
so please stay with us and tune in as you always have!

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.840
Dad?

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040
No way, I haven't done anything.

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.140
Dad, nothing's happened yet, you know?

8
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.140
I guess he's just wasted from all the drinks he had.

9
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.640
I guess you're right.

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.340
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

11
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.940
Tears are the start of all dramas.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.640
The mystery that lurks in the tennis court.

13
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.040
A sharp deduction is a smash that scores a point.

14
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.040
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:32.485
"The Devil that Lurks in the Tennis Court"

18
00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:35.685
Sonoko's tennis coach,

19
00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:39.085
Mr. Takao Goto will be competing in a tennis match,

20
00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:41.885
"Karuizawa Highland Resort Park" -so we decided to accompany her

21
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:44.485
to North Karuizawa.

22
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:47.185
Ran, here it goes!

23
00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.185
Hey, are you sure it's okay?

24
00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:51.785
Yep, it's okay.

25
00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.385
Today's the practice match for the tournament coming up,

26
00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.885
so as long as we clean up before it starts!

27
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.585
There!

28
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.185
What was that?

29
00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:13.985
"Takao Goto, Yuka Tsuchida" -Why did you bring the daughter

30
00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:17.685
of the Suzuki Financial Group here?

31
00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:19.985
She just came here to root for me.

32
00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:22.285
I'll bet you're want to make her your girl from now on!

33
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.985
Don't be silly.

34
00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:26.885
What do you think I'm interested in a slip girl like her?

35
00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:29.085
I'm pampering her a bit only

36
00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:31.685
because she's the daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group.

37
00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:33.385
I wonder about that...

38
00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:34.785
It's true.

39
00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:38.585
You're the only one in my eyes, Yuka.

40
00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:48.785
However, the bigger the fish, the better it is.

41
00:03:57.085 --> 00:03:58.685
If you ever betray me,

42
00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.685
I'll never forgive you.

43
00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.485
I wonder where Conan went.

44
00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:08.585
Weren't you with Sonoko a while ago?

45
00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:10.885
Yes, I'm Ran Mouri.

46
00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:12.285
"Fumihiro Azuma (22)" -If it's that little boy,

47
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.385
he went to the restroom a while ago.

48
00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:15.585
Would you like me to go look?

49
00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:17.885
No, thank you. I'll go...

50
00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:21.685
Let me. After all, it's the men's room.

51
00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:24.385
Sorry for the trouble.

52
00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:30.085
This place really is spacious.

53
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:35.285
That's the guy I saw a while ago.

54
00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:45.385
I'd like to talk to you about the money I lent you.

55
00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:46.585
That...

56
00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:48.585
Please wait a while more.

57
00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:50.485
"Chie Ootake (19)" -If you don't give it back to me,

58
00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:53.485
I'll be in trouble.

59
00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:54.785
What the...

60
00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:57.085
The fact that I get to enter this tournament,

61
00:04:57.085 --> 00:04:59.185
thanks to you too, you know, Chie.

62
00:04:59.185 --> 00:05:01.485
I...

63
00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:03.985
See you then, because I've got a match.

64
00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:05.385
No good!

65
00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:11.085
What a nuisance, that broad.

66
00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:13.585
Why can't she just shut up and keep supporting me financially?

67
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:17.385
Quite a player...

68
00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:22.285
If he doesn't pay me back,

69
00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:25.285
what am I going to do?

70
00:05:30.885 --> 00:05:32.185
Boy,

71
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:35.085
Ran and the others were worried about you.

72
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.185
Yes.

73
00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:50.385
-Great! -Mr. Goto!

74
00:05:50.385 --> 00:05:51.485
What the heck?

75
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.985
I thought they were on bad terms just a while ago.

76
00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:55.885
Girls are so incomprehensible.

77
00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:04.585
-Mr. Goto! -Coach!

78
00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:09.885
Game. Goto!

79
00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:12.985
-Mr. Goto, you're fantastic. -Coach, you're awesome!

80
00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.685
Here, the usual honey lemon water!

81
00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:16.985
Just what I wanted.

82
00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:18.385
Thank you.

83
00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:21.085
As I thought, Yuka know me the best.

84
00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:25.785
Mr. Goto, please use this.

85
00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:30.485
Thank you, Chie.

86
00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:33.585
Coach Goto, keep up the good work!

87
00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:35.885
Thank you, Sonoko.

88
00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:38.285
It's surprising you knew what color I like.

89
00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:41.385
Well, it's because your racket is always that color, coach.

90
00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:44.385
Nice play.

91
00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:45.785
Give it your best shot!

92
00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:49.585
I won't goof things up like you did, Azuma.

93
00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:51.985
Captain Azuma, you're really a push-over, aren't you?

94
00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:53.385
If only he didn't hurt himself,

95
00:06:53.385 --> 00:06:57.385
his place in the tournament wouldn't have been taken by Mr. Goto.

96
00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:59.485
Hey, you know what?

97
00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.385
You're no match for me,

98
00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:03.585
so why don't we change this into a mix double match?

99
00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:06.685
I'll pair with a girl that doesn't play well to even things out.

100
00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:09.385
Sure. Fine with me.

101
00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:12.885
Sonoko, we're switching to doubles,

102
00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:14.985
so pair with me, won't you?

103
00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:16.285
Me?

104
00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:18.385
Yeah. Please!

105
00:07:18.385 --> 00:07:20.085
Sonoko, how lucky.

106
00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.085
Yes, thanks!

107
00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:25.685
He's putting us away and pairing with her?

108
00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:27.585
What on earth is he thinking?

109
00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.985
Coach Goto!

110
00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:32.685
I'm counting on you.

111
00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.985
Yes.

112
00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:36.985
-Same here. -Yes!

113
00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:38.685
I'll do my best!

114
00:07:38.685 --> 00:07:41.085
Don't get too tensed up, okay?

115
00:07:42.185 --> 00:07:45.685
Sonoko, I think it's better if you take off your glove!

116
00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:47.685
What? Really?

117
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:49.685
Thank you very much!

118
00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:51.085
Give it your best shot!

119
00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:01.185
Sonoko give it your best shot!

120
00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:04.485
Sonoko, go for it!

121
00:08:04.485 --> 00:08:05.885
Go for it.

122
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.385
There!

123
00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.985
I did it!

124
00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:14.185
Sonoko, that's the way to go!

125
00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:20.085
Sonoko seems to be getting the hang of it.

126
00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:22.685
You're right.

127
00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:24.785
Sonoko, fight!

128
00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:31.385
What's wrong?

129
00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:34.985
Mr. Goto suddenly doesn't seem to be doing good.

130
00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:42.585
Coach?

131
00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:44.485
What's up?

132
00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:46.385
What's wrong?

133
00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:47.985
Are you all right?

134
00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:53.985
-Call an ambulance right away! -Okay.

135
00:08:53.985 --> 00:08:54.985
Coach!

136
00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:56.485
What's with this?

137
00:08:56.485 --> 00:08:59.085
Mr. Goto!

138
00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:01.385
What's going on?

139
00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:04.685
The man who collapsed is Mr. Takao Goto.

140
00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:06.485
21 years old.

141
00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:09.385
He's the co-captain of the university tennis club.

142
00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:10.785
It seems that he collapsed from poisoning

143
00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:13.285
in the midst of a practice tennis match.

144
00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:14.585
According to the hospital,

145
00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:16.785
he seems to have the symptoms seen in aconitine derivatives.

146
00:09:16.785 --> 00:09:19.485
I see. In other words,

147
00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.885
Mr. Goto picked poison weeds that were growing nearby

148
00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:24.385
and ate them?

149
00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:28.685
No way, right?

150
00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:31.885
Ran, so we meet again.

151
00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:35.285
I guess, Inspector Yamamura.

152
00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:39.185
I mean North Karuizawa is in Gunma Prefecture, you see.

153
00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:42.385
An accident or food poisoning seems to be unthinkable.

154
00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:45.285
The coroner says he seems to have been poisoned

155
00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:49.185
10 to 20 minutes before he collapsed.

156
00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:50.285
Which means,

157
00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:54.285
this is a homicide targeted at Mr. Goto.

158
00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:56.485
Mr. Goto isn't dead yet.

159
00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:58.985
Somebody probably gave him poison

160
00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:01.085
of some kind during the practice match and killed him.

161
00:10:01.085 --> 00:10:02.485
So, like I was saying...

162
00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:04.085
You mean it's not an accident?

163
00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:06.485
Homicide?

164
00:10:06.485 --> 00:10:09.385
But, how could the killer have done that

165
00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:12.085
during the match in front of a crowd looking at the tennis court?

166
00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:17.385
Come to think of it, the girls were giving something to Mr. Goto.

167
00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:20.085
Giving him something?

168
00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:25.985
It could be that the poison was inside what they gave him.

169
00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:29.785
Okay! Have forensics rush and check the things they gave him.

170
00:10:29.785 --> 00:10:30.885
Yes, sir!

171
00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:33.985
Hang in there, Inspector.

172
00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:36.685
No poison was found

173
00:10:36.685 --> 00:10:39.085
when body checking the people involved.

174
00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:41.685
However, toxic reaction was found on the bottle, towel

175
00:10:41.685 --> 00:10:45.585
and racket grip tape that were handed over to him.

176
00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:51.085
This, and this, then this...

177
00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:53.985
Inspector Yamamura, what're you doing?

178
00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:57.185
You see a lot of scenes like this on police dramas, don't you?

179
00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:59.785
I wanted to do something like this before.

180
00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:02.985
You currently are a police officer.

181
00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:05.985
Mr. Goto's actions during break time

182
00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:08.885
went something like this, right?

183
00:11:08.885 --> 00:11:10.785
I saw Mr. Goto having a fight

184
00:11:10.785 --> 00:11:14.685
with Ms. Tsuchida before the match in front of the locker.

185
00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:17.385
Mr. Goto said that although he's going steady with Ms. Tsuchida,

186
00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:21.185
he's being nice to Sonoko because she's rich.

187
00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:23.185
Hey, just what do you think you're...

188
00:11:23.185 --> 00:11:25.185
I see...

189
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:29.485
So, intent to kill built up in Ms. Tsuchida who didn't like the idea.

190
00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:31.785
Hey, what's with this boy?

191
00:11:31.785 --> 00:11:33.685
You mean the police is going to take

192
00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:35.885
the testimony of a child like this as legit?

193
00:11:35.885 --> 00:11:37.685
Ms. Tsuchida.

194
00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:42.885
You gave Mr. Goto a drink with poison in it, didn't you?

195
00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:44.085
No, I'm not.

196
00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:47.085
Poison was detected on the outside of the bottle,

197
00:11:47.085 --> 00:11:51.085
but not inside the drink.

198
00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.285
Is that so?

199
00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:57.085
Well, so it's not that his palms were inflamed

200
00:11:57.085 --> 00:12:00.585
because he was holding the bottle that had poison on it firmly?

201
00:12:00.585 --> 00:12:06.785
And, you miss, were talking to Mr. Goto here a while ago weren't you?

202
00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:09.285
-I was... -I know about it.

203
00:12:09.285 --> 00:12:13.485
Chie is giving Mr. Goto money in order to get his attention.

204
00:12:13.485 --> 00:12:16.185
She's even using up her tuition for him.

205
00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:19.285
Is that true?

206
00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:22.785
Yes, if I can't pay my tuition

207
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.685
I'm going to have to quit college.

208
00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:28.285
So, Ms. Ootake, you smeared poison on the towel

209
00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:29.785
and gave it to him, didn't you?

210
00:12:29.785 --> 00:12:32.485
If he wipes his eyes and nose with it,

211
00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.285
the toxin would enter through his membranes.

212
00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:36.185
I did no such thing!

213
00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:37.385
According to the hospital,

214
00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:42.185
no toxins were found on Mr. Goto's face.

215
00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:43.385
Is that so?

216
00:12:43.385 --> 00:12:45.585
Mr. Goto went through the match in a breeze

217
00:12:45.585 --> 00:12:47.485
and he didn't perspire at all,

218
00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:49.885
so he didn't use his towel.

219
00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:52.585
He removed it from his neck and put it on the bench.

220
00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:54.085
Since it's not us,

221
00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:57.385
it has to be that rich girl of the Suzuki Financial Group.

222
00:12:57.385 --> 00:13:00.885
Mr. Goto probably approached her wanting to get rich by marrying her.

223
00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:03.585
She fell for him and when she found out about it,

224
00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:05.485
she probably got angry and hated him.

225
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:09.285
No way, I didn't fall for the coach!

226
00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:12.985
I heard he's entering a match, so I came to root for him!

227
00:13:12.985 --> 00:13:16.785
He said that he changes his grip tape each game,

228
00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:18.085
so I brought him some.

229
00:13:18.085 --> 00:13:22.185
Does Mr. Goto change grip tapes for each game?

230
00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:23.285
Yes...

231
00:13:25.285 --> 00:13:26.785
I've figured it out!

232
00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:30.585
The truth of this case has came to me as a flash of inspiration!

233
00:13:30.585 --> 00:13:32.585
We will solve this case at the tennis court

234
00:13:32.585 --> 00:13:35.285
because this case happened at the tennis court!

235
00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:36.985
No joke?

236
00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:38.985
In order to wrap the grip tape around,

237
00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:43.685
first you have to peel off transparent film on adhesive side!

238
00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:46.285
If poison is smeared onto this film,

239
00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.985
the toxin will penetrate Mr. Goto's hand each time

240
00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:52.685
he changes grip tapes when he plays a new game!

241
00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:54.285
Inspector!

242
00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:56.585
The forensics have reported back to us!

243
00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:59.985
Toxin was detected on the used films found inside Mr. Goto's bag

244
00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:04.685
and the tennis glove that belong to Sonoko!

245
00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:07.085
From Sonoko's tennis glove too?

246
00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:10.885
Just like I deduced.

247
00:14:10.885 --> 00:14:14.285
Come to think of it, Mr. Goto licked his finger

248
00:14:14.285 --> 00:14:17.785
repeatedly saying that the film was hard to peel off!

249
00:14:17.785 --> 00:14:20.885
The killer, after smearing poison onto the films,

250
00:14:20.885 --> 00:14:23.185
put them back in the case and gave it to him.

251
00:14:23.185 --> 00:14:26.785
That's why no toxic reaction was detected from his body!

252
00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:29.185
Yes! In other words, the murderer...

253
00:14:29.185 --> 00:14:31.885
You, Ms. Suzuki!

254
00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:33.185
What?

255
00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:34.485
It can't be...

256
00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:36.285
Hey...

257
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.290
Ms. Suzuki is the one who smeared poison

258
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.790
onto the grip tapes and gave it to him!

259
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.390
Inspector Yamamura.

260
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.590
She may fall in love easily, but she'd never do something like that.

261
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.890
That's right!

262
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.790
I didn't do it!

263
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.290
Since Mr. Goto licked his finger repeatedly

264
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.190
when peeling off the films the poison

265
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.590
was not taken into his body!

266
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.990
While he was playing, the poison circulated through his body,

267
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.590
he tried to shoot a serve and collapsed?

268
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.790
It hurts...

269
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.990
This is...

270
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.490
I get the picture now.

271
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.890
It hurts...

272
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.490
Her motive is an entangled love affair!

273
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.390
She threw herself onto a handsome coach

274
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.690
saying that she liked him but was betrayed.

275
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.390
So, her prince charming suddenly turned into her hated target

276
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.390
and intent to kill built up inside her!

277
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.190
Ms. Suzuki, come with us to the station.

278
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.290
Hey, I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

279
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.990
I'm sure that it's some kind of mistake!

280
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.090
After all, with this much circumstantial evidence before us.

281
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.490
-Stop it! -This is a false charge!

282
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.190
I guess Sonoko has to clear the accusations for herself!

283
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.390
I tell you, are you okay, Gunma Prefectural Police?

284
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.090
What's with her?

285
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.090
Is she copying Mr. Mouri?

286
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.390
Sonoko, so it's finally come!

287
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.890
Inspector Yamamura,

288
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.190
I will tell you the truth of this case from here!

289
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.190
-What? -What?

290
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.490
Wasn't the case solved already?

291
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.790
That girl is the culprit, isn't she?

292
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.190
That's right.

293
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.590
You smeared poison onto the film of the grip tape.

294
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.190
Mr. Goto started playing the match

295
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.590
right after he changed the grip tape,

296
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.990
so there's no way that poison would be found,

297
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.590
on the towel and bottle that he touched before that!

298
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.790
True, if you put it that way.

299
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.090
Besides, although you touch the film with the fingertips,

300
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.890
but only Mr. Goto's palm was inflamed from touching the poison.

301
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.190
Which means that the poison was all over Mr. Goto's palm!

302
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.890
I get it! Mr. Goto touched something

303
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.790
with poison on it with his hands!

304
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.290
So, the culprit is you, Ms. Tsuchida!

305
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.790
You smeared poison on the bottle,

306
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.090
since you wouldn't touch it with your own hands,

307
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.790
you held the strap and handed it over to him!

308
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.290
I didn't do it!

309
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.090
If the poison got onto his hand from the bottle,

310
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.390
then there's no way that the poison

311
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.590
would be on the towel that he touched before that.

312
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.490
Then, the culprit is Ms. Ootake!

313
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.490
When he touched the towel he had around his neck,

314
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.190
the poison got on Mr. Goto's hand!

315
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.590
Why would it be me?

316
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.990
Wrong!

317
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.690
If the poison touches the skin, a visual symptom would occur.

318
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.690
Since Ms. Ootake gave him the towel with her bare hands,

319
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.290
it's not the towel either.

320
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.090
Then, where did the poison come from?

321
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.690
Right! The tennis glove!

322
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.590
Maybe she shook hands with him

323
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:21.790
with the poisoned tennis glove on

324
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.390
and put poison on the palm of his hand?

325
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.790
I see...

326
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.790
Ms. Suzuki, so you're the culprit after all!

327
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.490
-Sonoko. -Ran!

328
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.290
That's impossible, you know?

329
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.890
Because you ate this cookie and yet you're alive and kicking.

330
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.990
Right!

331
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.490
Ran, just what do you mean?

332
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.690
When Sonoko was invited to come to the doubles

333
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.290
I high touched with her when she had her gloves on.

334
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.290
So, if there was poison on it

335
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.490
my hands would also be contaminated,

336
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.890
and since I ate cookies with the same hand,

337
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.790
but, I even now...

338
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.590
Really?

339
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.790
Then just where do you suggest the poison came from?

340
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.290
There're no more culprits left!

341
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.390
There was still another way to touch Mr. Goto

342
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.790
who was on the court and get poison on him.

343
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.390
It's something that all tennis players naturally do,

344
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.990
and also something that can be done

345
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.490
without getting suspicious even if it was done before a crowd.

346
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.790
Mr. Azuma, you're the culprit!

347
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.090
-What? -Captain?

348
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.490
Don't be ridiculous.

349
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.290
I was at the stands right the whole time and didn't offer anything to him.

350
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.190
How could I poison him, who was at the tennis court?

351
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.790
It was when you did a high touch with Mr. Goto.

352
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.290
During that split second,

353
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.390
you smeared poisoned Mr. Goto's palm with poison!

354
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.090
-What? -What?

355
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.090
The fact that poison was found on my tennis glove

356
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.190
is because the poison was already there on Mr. Goto's palm

357
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.690
even before he shook hands with me.

358
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.190
If so, you're the only one who high touched him

359
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.790
before he shook hands with me.

360
00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.490
It's absurd.

361
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.290
If I had my hand smeared with poison,

362
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.690
my hand would be in terrible shape too, wouldn't it?

363
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.390
It's after you put on your tennis glove.

364
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.890
There are only two balls in a tennis match,

365
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.690
if it comes flying to the stands, it's manners to return it to court.

366
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.090
But, since you had poison smeared on the palm of your glove,

367
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.090
you bounced the ball back with the back of your hand.

368
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.690
And when the match was suddenly switched to a doubles game

369
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.590
and I was chosen to become Mr. Goto's partner,

370
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.990
I'm sure you panicked.

371
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.890
Because if the police detected the poison from my glove

372
00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.390
and suspects someone from the stands held the source of the poison,

373
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.690
your plan would go down the drain.

374
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.190
Therefore...

375
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.090
Sonoko, I think it's better if you take off your glove!

376
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.290
You made me take off my glove.

377
00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.990
If it were on the bench or something,

378
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.690
it would've been gotten rid of amidst the commotion and all by now.

379
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.690
I'm amazed by your deduction.

380
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.990
As if I want to say that.

381
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.690
But, just where do you have evidence?

382
00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.790
The evidence is right here!

383
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.090
This ball...

384
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.690
When Inspector Yamamura kicked the ball basket a while ago,

385
00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.190
there was one ball that didn't bounce,

386
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.890
so I thought it was strange.

387
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.790
There's a strange slit here on this ball.

388
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.690
This is...

389
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.590
After doing what he had to do,

390
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.490
Mr. Azuma took off the poisoned glove

391
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.490
and shoved it inside that ball.

392
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.290
Then, he mixed it into the ball basket

393
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.790
so it would be inconspicuous.

394
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.390
You were probably planning to get rid of it,

395
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.390
after the commotion subsided.

396
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.390
If Mr. Azuma's fingerprints and toxic reaction are found on this glove,

397
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.990
that would be conclusive evidence.

398
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.690
So, could this mean that I solved this case?

399
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.490
I did it, fantastic!

400
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.790
Just as expected of me.

401
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.190
Why would a kind captain like him do something like that?

402
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.290
I was scheduled to play in the match tomorrow,

403
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.190
but Goto who was envious of me

404
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.190
deliberately tripped me during practice!

405
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.590
I'd never trip and fall like you, Azuma.

406
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.090
I couldn't enter the match since I sprained a bone in my leg.

407
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.490
And Goto ended up taking my place.

408
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.890
To think that the dirty woman chaser stole my position.

409
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.290
Thanks to him, both contract with the sponsor

410
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.290
and the scholarship went up in smoke.

411
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.090
I just couldn't forgive him!

412
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.490
So, Sonoko was cleared of all suspicion.

413
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.990
Afterward, Mr. Goto regained his consciousness at the hospital

414
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.790
and his prognosis looked positive,

415
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.090
according to Inspector Yamamura.

416
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.090
Deduction Queen Sonoko, great work!

417
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.090
Really?

418
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.590
To think you would end up being the culprit,

419
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.090
I was dead worried.

420
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.990
Ran, you're sure a great friend!

421
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.290
So, the case is closed.

422
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.890
Right!

423
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.590
-Yes! -Yes. It hurts...

424
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.090
It hurts. How could you, Ms. Suzuki?

425
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.090
It hurts...

426
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.490
Darn. Case is closed, my eye!

427
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.890
As if he had such a scrutinizing mind.

428
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.290
I guess the grudge of being set up as a suspect

429
00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.990
is not easily forgotten.
