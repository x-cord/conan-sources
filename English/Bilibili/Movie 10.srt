1
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,340
Damn, overtaken again.

2
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,070
Why didn't you rent a better car?

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,520
Seriously!

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,850
It would be better to take the train, wouldn't it?

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,600
Yes!

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,500
Shut up!

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,160
It was because the client asked me to bring all of you along
that I rented this big car to hold everyone!

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,610
Five seconds left.

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,840
What?

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,000
If you don't turn right now,

11
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,530
we'll crash into the wall in five seconds.

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,360
What?

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,710
Wow, amazing!

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,440
It looks like a castle!

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,130
Then, does the emperor or something live here?

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,680
Idiot! As if he would!

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,860
This is just a hotel.

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,400
It's right in front of Miracle Land.

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,290
If someone always lived here and spent lots of money in Miracle Land,

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,630
it wouldn't be strange to consider that rich person an emperor.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,350
Say, I heard this hotel is going to
welcome its 100,000th guest, right?

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,360
Really? Then it's really successful, huh?

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,610
I'd like to see for myself.

24
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,650
Well, excuse me.

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,910
Are you Detective Mouri?

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,220
Yes, I am.

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,680
We were expecting you.

28
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm your client's secretary, Takada.

29
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,880
Let's get back to business. Please come this way.

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,440
Take care of that car.

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,040
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,950
Please, this way.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,540
Wow, amazing!

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,740
We can see all of Miracle Land from here.

35
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,390
Please sit on these seats and wait for a while.

37
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
Huh?

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,470
Hey, be quiet and sit down.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,750
Fine.

40
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,830
Then, please wait a moment.

41
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,090
Awesome!

42
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,280
I'm so excited!

43
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,330
What's wrong, Conan?

44
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,360
Somehow, it seems that this chair doesn't match this room.

45
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,850
Come to think of it, you're right.

46
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,610
Maybe they had to cut the budget.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,740
How could somewhere like this have budget cuts?

48
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,030
After all, this is a luxurious hotel.

49
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,190
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

50
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,960
These are why we asked you to bring the kids here.

51
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,530
What is this, exactly?

52
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,050
These are free pass IDs for Miracle Land.

53
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:15,660
While Mr. Mouri is solving the case, we thought it
would be nice to let the kids have fun at Miracle Land.

54
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,640
Could it be that the client is the owner of this place?

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
No, it's not like that.

56
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,590
This suite is rented on an annual basis.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,430
Huu? That's awesome.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Everyone, please put them on your wrists.

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,150
Fasten them tightly, just in case you lose them.

60
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,570
If you lose it, we can't give you another one.

61
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,200
Mr. Mouri, you too. Please wear it.

62
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,610
Don't bother, I'm not going to the amusement park.

63
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,530
Don't say that.

64
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,920
If you finish your work early,
you will be able to enjoy yourself with everyone e lse.

65
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,910
I see.

66
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,670
These IDs are valid today, until 10:00 p.m.,
the closing time of Miracle Land.

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,900
All meals and drinks are free.

68
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,050
Please enjoy yourself!

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,550
That's great!

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,440
Thank you!

71
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,150
Let's go, Conan.

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,980
OK.

73
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,450
Please stay here.

74
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,090
Why?

76
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,070
Don't tell me you're the 100,000th guest of this hotel?

77
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,180
Well, something like that.

78
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,500
Really?

79
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,360
That's so nice!

80
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,770
Then let's get in line now.

81
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,070
It's pretty normal to wait in line for two hours for the Super Snake.

82
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,360
Indeed.

83
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,690
Then I'll see you later, Conan.

84
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,440
OK.

85
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,650
Hey, what does the 100,000th guest get?

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,970
At least it won't be an eel rice bowl.

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,970
Ah, you're so lucky.

88
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,400
There must be some kind of big surprise for the 100,000th guest.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,320
I just don't want to be interrupted.

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,820
What do you mean by interrupted?

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,040
The 100,000th guest is not me, right?

92
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,350
The confetti from the hydrangea is
all over the ground in front of the hotel.

93
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,300
Oh, really?

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,300
Yes.

95
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,300
The 100,000th guest came about an hour ago.

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Then why did you make this brat stay?

97
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,050
It was client's request.

98
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
Hey, what's this?

99
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,370
What's going on?

100
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,440
Thank you very much for coming.

101
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,940
I'm your client.

102
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,650
Please forgive me for
hiding my face in the shadows without explanation.

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,930
The reason I asked you to come here today
is because there is a case waiting for you to solve.

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,910
What case do you want me to solve?

105
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,530
Well, it's also a part of your job to figure this out.

106
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,750
Huh?

107
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,140
Now I'll give you a few hints.

108
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,800
Please use this as a basis for
your reasoning through and solving this case.

109
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,300
But why did you hire me?

110
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,210
You're the fifth detective I've hired.

111
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,400
What about the first four?

112
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,700
One of them is still investigating.

113
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,630
Two have given up.

114
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,550
And one who couldn't solve the case is here.

115
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,930
Ryu!

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,090
You know him?

117
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,480
He's a detective I used to work with before.

118
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,060
Didn't I give you the investigation report?

119
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,020
How long are you going to keep me locked up here?

120
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,160
Hurry up and let me out!

121
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,580
Detective Ryu, you were unable to solve the case.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,760
What did you say?

123
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,600
An incompetent detective has no right to live.

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,780
What is this?

125
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,760
It's the same ID as ours.

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,370
Yeah...

127
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,240
Damn, what's wrong with this?

128
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,140
It doesn't matter. There's no pain.

129
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,190
You'll be at peace in an instant.

130
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,470
Could it be that the thing that made Mogi and Souda disappear is...

131
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,690
Farewell, Detective Ryu.

132
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,780
Hey, wait, wait!

133
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,650
Damn it!

134
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,620
Composition Four, or plastic explosive, was built into it...

135
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,680
In the Miracle Land ID that Detective Ryu was wearing on his wrist.

136
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,350
You bastard!

137
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,190
Who are Mogi and Souda mentioned by Ryu?

138
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,900
Well, they were two detectives
who were well- known all over the world...

139
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,640
And two idiots who wasted my precious time.

140
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,730
The deadline for you is 10:00 tonight.

141
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,170
Please find the truth about something before then.

142
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,380
If you can't solve the case by the deadline,

143
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,820
your IDs will also explode.

144
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,330
You will follow in Detective Ryu's footsteps.

145
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,280
What?!

146
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,460
Give it up.

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,400
Such small amounts of external power can't make this ID come off.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
Besides, if you take it off before I deactivate it,

149
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,940
it will explode immediately.

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,290
You bastard...

151
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:41,930
Ran!

152
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Right.

153
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,260
What about Ran and the other's IDs?

154
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,240
The children's IDs are almost the same as yours.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
What do you mean?

156
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,740
Almost.

157
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,830
Their IDs have an additional function.

158
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,130
This is a diagram of Miracle Land.

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,510
There are multiple sensors installed at the border of Miracle Land.

160
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,770
Whenever their IDs enter Miracle Land,

161
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,360
the sensors will sense it,

162
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,740
and the detonator will be turned on.

163
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,730
If any one of them wants to exit
the Miracle Land and passes by the sensors again,

164
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,240
their IDs will explode at that exact moment.

165
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,320
It would be troublesome to track them each individually.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
So please forgive me for doing this.

167
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,530
Ran!

168
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,770
Haibara, can you hear me?

169
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,270
Haibara!

170
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,810
Damn it!

171
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,750
Haibara!

172
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,230
Haibara!

173
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,330
What?

174
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,760
Haibara, don't go in!

175
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,890
What's wrong?

176
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,210
I don't have time to talk too much. Bring everyone out.

177
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,540
Don't go in!

178
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,210
Even though you say so,

179
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,150
we've already been inside.

180
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,790
You are a VIP, right?

181
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,160
This kind of IDs is only issued to special guests.

182
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,960
Is that so?

183
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,540
Please enjoy yourself.

184
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,010
Thank you.

185
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,820
What happened?

186
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,690
I'll contact you again.

187
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,860
Ran?

188
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,260
Damn it!

189
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,890
If you solve the case by 10:00 tonight and find the culprit for me,

190
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,470
I'll pay you however much you wish.

191
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,710
But if you can't solve the case within the time limit,
I'll detonate all of the IDs.

192
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,170
Take me to that man!

193
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,040
Right now!

194
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,130
I can't!

195
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,760
Because I don't know where he is either.

196
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,110
What are you talking about?

197
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,560
Mr. Mouri. Your actions are all being monitored.

198
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,820
I've built a GPS into your ID.

199
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,380
It will do you no good to run to the police.

200
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,340
Does that mean you'll press the detonation switch, you bastard?

201
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,360
Talking for too long is a waste of time.

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,100
The first hint.

203
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,610
I'm only going to say it once.

204
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,480
Listen carefully.

205
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,330
TAKA 3- 8.

206
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,070
What is this?

207
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,480
Tell me again.

208
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,470
I told you I'd only say it once.

209
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,670
There are 12 hours left until the deadline.

210
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,090
Can you solve this mystery for me?

211
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,850
For my sake and for the sake of the children.

212
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,160
Damn it!

213
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,300
Mr. Mouri!

214
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,540
Please take this.

215
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,140
This is a hotline to the client.

216
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,680
You can't call the client directly, even though I called it that.

217
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,460
It's only for receiving instructions from the client.

218
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,960
After solving the case,

219
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,620
call me using the number in this phone,

220
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,290
and then come back here.

221
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,390
So we can listen to the truth carefully.

222
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,330
(Detective Conan The Private Eyes' Requiem)

223
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,380
I am Shinichi Kudo, high school detective.

224
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,760
When I was at the theme park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,

225
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,790
I witnessed a suspicious exchange made by a man in black.

226
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,600
I was too preoccupied with watching the deal go down,

227
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,670
and didn't notice another accomplice approaching from behind.

228
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,280
He forced me to take a kind of poison by force.

229
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,980
When I woke up,

230
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,470
my body had become that of a child.

231
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,360
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

232
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,970
they would definitely come after me,

233
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,760
or even hurt the people close to me.

234
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,100
So at the suggestion of Professor Agasa, I concealed my true identity.

235
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,310
When Ran asked for my name, I took the name of Conan Edogawa.

236
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,270
In order to collect information about those guys,

237
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,940
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.

238
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,240
The only ones who know my true identity are

239
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,220
Professor Agasa,

240
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,400
my parents,

241
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,870
Heiji Hattori, a high school detective from Kansai,

242
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,720
and Ai Haibara, my classmate.

243
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,900
Professor Agasa has made many inventions for me,
since my body became smaller.

244
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,720
Haibara was once a member of the Black Organization,

245
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,570
but when she escaped from the organization,

246
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,040
she took the same poison that I took.

247
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,730
So she reverted to childhood too.

248
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,280
There is another person.

249
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,980
Kaito Kiddo.

250
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,830
Whenever he shows up,

251
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,940
things get troublesome.

252
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,140
My body may have shrunk,

253
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,980
but my mind is as sharp as ever.

254
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,530
I am the famous detective who can solve any case.

255
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,270
Only one truth will prevail!

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,520
Damn it!

257
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,330
What's up with this traffic jam?

258
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,840
My daughter's life is on the line!

259
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,770
- So don't leave Miracle Land!
- Hurry up and move!

260
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,420
So don't leave Miracle Land!

261
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,670
If you leave that area of the Miracle Land, the IDs will explode.

262
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,640
Of course, don't play Super Snake either!

263
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,030
Because the most attractive part of that Jet Booster
is that it will go out over the sea as part of the ride.

264
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,220
Hey, are you listening, Haibara?

265
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes, I got it.

266
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,060
If you don't solve the case by 10:00 tonight,

267
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,070
you and I will both be blown into pieces, right?

268
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,390
Isn't this interesting?

269
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,430
Interesting? You...

270
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,580
Hey, Haibara, what are you doing?

271
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,590
Come over here quickly!

272
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,420
Then our lives are in your hands, Great Detective!

273
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,010
But I don't understand anything!

274
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,650
What's that TAKA 3- 8?

275
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,500
This can also be read as 3 minus 8, right?

276
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,510
So TAKA is a road name?

277
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,270
Yes, and 3-8 equals -5.

278
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,040
If we remove the equal sign,

279
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,690
then it becomes 3-8-5.

280
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,760
Got it, it's Takashima District.

281
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,200
You mean the 3rd street of Takashima District, huh?

282
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,550
Hey, where's the 3rd street?

283
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,950
There's no such a place.

284
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,860
What?

285
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,500
There's no 3rd street in Takashima District.

286
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,970
What did you say? Let me take a look!

287
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,430
Damn it!

288
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,350
We gotta start over again?

289
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,810
Maybe not.

290
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,720
I heard the street names
may have been changed due to redevelopment work.

291
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,420
3-8-5 in Takashima District?

292
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,100
Yes.

293
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,040
Have the street names around here changed due to the redevelopment?

294
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,750
That's because it became Minatomirai

295
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,770
There was the 3rd street before.

296
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,120
Do you have a map?

297
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,690
Yes.

298
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,460
But does this place really have anything to do with that case?

299
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,280
We have to believe it does, don't we?

300
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,690
Speaking of which, why do I have to stay with a schoolboy like you?

301
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,940
Because he thought you weren't reliable by yourself, I guess.

302
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,300
Indeed, it's strange.

303
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,520
Why did he let just me work with Mr. Mouri?

304
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,390
Why on earth?

305
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,470
What's that?

306
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,680
Who? Who is it?

307
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,690
You can't live here.

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,380
This house will be torn down next week.

309
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,610
Must be hard for you with a kid, huh?

310
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,080
What? No, no, no.

311
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
Of course not.

312
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,400
Sir, have you been living here long?

313
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,540
Yes, since this hotel went bankrupt 2 years ago.

314
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Has there been anything strange lately?

315
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,550
Anything at all?

316
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,480
Let me see. Oh, yeah,
they said there was a giant white bird who flew over here.

317
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,500
A giant bird?

318
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,960
It flew right in front of the sun!

319
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,590
When did this happen?

320
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,100
It was my birthday, April 4th.

321
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,590
A weird car parked there that morning.

322
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,860
And then, the real estate agent came and sealed off that basement.

323
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,840
Weird car?

324
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,070
There are not many cars here.

325
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,970
When I went out in the morning,

326
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,690
there was a brand new car parked in the courtyard.

327
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,590
But when I came back in the evening,

328
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,630
it had turned into a second- hand car in shambles.

329
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,300
At night, that car had its parts taken, leaving only the skeleton.

330
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,600
What's with that locked basement?

331
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,780
The basement was a machine room.

332
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,430
I guess he was gonna sell those machines for money.

333
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,170
About what time was that?

334
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,600
It was late afternoon.

335
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,160
What... What's going on?

336
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,810
Hey, kid, what's wrong?

337
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,950
So you're here?

338
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,020
Geez, don't scare me, okay?

339
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,720
This is...

340
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,240
What?

341
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,990
I found this.

342
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,510
What's this?

343
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,360
This is...

344
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,390
A mask and gloves.

345
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,250
And a Government pistol?

346
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,820
A receipt?

347
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,710
April 4th, Yokohama City.

348
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,930
Mr. Mouri.

349
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,020
Isn't April 4th the day that guy said
there was a weird car parked here?

350
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,550
Yes, he said the car changed that day.

351
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,450
What? Changed?

352
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,020
Got it!

353
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,280
A fugitive changed cars here!

354
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,780
This fugitive is the culprit
who did something with this mask and this Government gun.

355
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,690
Next is to find out what happened on April 4th.

356
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,070
If we know that,

357
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,700
the rest will be easy.

358
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,790
What are those guys doing?

359
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,170
Hand... Handgun!

360
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,440
It's clear that they're no ordinary people.

361
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,360
Do you think they're here for the bag?

362
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,620
It's possible.

363
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,140
Okay, I got it.

364
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,840
You jump out and distract those guys.

365
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,590
In the meantime, I'll get in the car and help you get out of here.

366
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,470
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

367
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,550
Those guys won't just shoot a kid out of nowhere.

368
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,660
What's the matter, kid?

369
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,850
Don't you believe me?

370
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,710
No, I don't.

371
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
Just get out of here!

372
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,260
Wait!

373
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,760
That's what I'm afraid of.

374
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,320
Damn it, at this critical moment! This stupid car!

375
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,550
Arrest them!

376
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,920
You said arrest?

377
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,730
Are you guys...

378
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,770
Police officers?

379
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,700
It really is a huge bird as big as a person!

380
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,630
What?

381
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,340
It's that guy.

382
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,070
The one who surrounded the dark world with his white wings

383
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,040
is Kaito Kiddo!

384
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,310
Kiddo?

385
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,410
Inspector, we've found Kiddo!

386
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,650
Now he's on the roof of the Miyama Building, above the devil statue!

387
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,940
Okay, I got it.

388
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,530
President Miyama, Kiddo has appeared.

389
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,320
I see, let's take a look.

390
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,120
Even Kiddo won't be able to break this new security system.

391
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:37,850
Kiddo!

392
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,080
Damn it!

393
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,080
This is Yokomizo.

394
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,670
Kiddo is running away from
the Miyama Building towards the Landmark Tower.

395
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:48,670
Repeat.

396
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,950
Kiddo is running away towards Landmark Tower!

397
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,300
Go after him right now!

398
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,670
It looks like the police's stakeout was not that useful, huh?

399
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,220
But there are many kinds of security systems.

400
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,380
Inspector Yokomizo!

401
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,800
We caught a man who seems to be Kiddo's accomplice.

402
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,320
We're bringing him to the station.

403
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,430
Got it, I'll be right back.

404
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,450
I told you, I'm not Kiddo's accomplice.

405
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,070
I'm Kogoro Mouri!

406
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,670
Not good.

407
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,300
If this goes on...

408
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Your actions are all being monitored by monitors.

409
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,550
I've built a GPS into your ID.

410
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,830
It will do you no good to run to the police.

411
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,770
ID number 1 and ID number 2 are
now approaching Kanagawa Police Headquarters.

412
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,320
It's always exciting to hear that kind of voice, right?

413
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,640
But I'm already tired of waiting in line.

414
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,760
How much longer do we have to wait?

415
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,230
Well...

416
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,330
Let's say 3 people in line take up about one meter,

417
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,210
since there are about 150 meters in the line,
there should be about 450 people.

418
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,020
As Super Snake can hold 22 people each time,

419
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,790
it will take about 20 rides to go through 450 people.

420
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,430
One ride, including the time to get on and off,
takes about 10 minutes,

421
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,370
so it gonna take 200 minutes.

422
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,880
Then it's about 3 and a half hours.

423
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,040
Awesome, Mitsuhiko!

424
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,960
We still have to wait that long?

425
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,840
I'm hungry.

426
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,300
If the Professor were here,
he would give us some boring riddle to kill some time.

427
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,830
Indeed.

428
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,630
Then I'll be the one to give you the riddle today.

429
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,540
What? You will do it?

430
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,760
Can't I?

431
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,710
No! Go ahead! Go ahead!

432
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,870
I guess there's no choice. We'll answer it.

433
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,010
Then here we go.

434
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,330
Miracle Land Riddle.

435
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,900
Everyone wants to ride the Super Snake.

436
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,140
Then, out of you all, who is the most suitable for this ride?

437
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,550
I know, the answer is Ai, isn't it?

438
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,210
Why?

439
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,640
Because Ai seems to like snakes.

440
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,890
I hate snakes.

441
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,960
Wrong.

442
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,430
Then it's me, right?

443
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,730
I always wait for people, just like I wait for Super Snake.

444
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,130
What's that?

445
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,730
Did you forget that I waited for you at
your house for a crazy long time

446
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,570
when we went to the park?

447
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,080
That's wrong too.

448
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,300
And you, Genta?

449
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,200
It's me, right?

450
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,220
Because snakes and eels are alike.

451
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
I like eel rice bowls the most!

452
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,920
What a pity!

453
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,820
What happens to Genta who loves eel rice bowls so much?

454
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,010
Even if you ask me what happens...

455
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,160
I think I'm hungry.

456
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,600
I see.

457
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,720
The Japanese for "Snake" sounds like the English for "heavy".

458
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,840
Therefore, super heavy.

459
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,200
So Kojima, the most heaviest of us, is the correct answer.

460
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,650
Bingo!

461
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,890
I thought Ran's riddle would be something different.

462
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,490
In the end, it's still just a lame joke.

463
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,280
Hmm...

464
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,870
Ah! Conan?

465
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,760
Are you all right?

466
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,390
Inspector Megure!

467
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,750
What happened to Mouri?

468
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,250
They said they arrested Kiddo's accomplice, is that true?

469
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,320
Hmm, Nakamori.

470
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,040
Megure, you rascal...

471
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,960
Why are you here?

472
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,140
It seems that Mouri was arrested by mistake.

473
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,220
What?

474
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,680
So Kiddo's accomplice is that Sleeping Kogoro?

475
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,590
As a detective, I have a duty to keep my client's secrets.

476
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,930
But if your client is Kiddo,

477
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,290
aren't you an accomplice?

478
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,690
But wait, why were the Kanagawa Police staking out that building?

479
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,720
Because they received an advance notice from Kiddo.

480
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,700
That building is the main office of Miyama Corporation.

481
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:13,160
On the top floor of the building,
there were various jewels that President Miyama had collected.

482
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,600
But unlike last time,

483
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,770
nothing was taken.

484
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,560
Did Kiddo get into that building before?

485
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,740
Yeah.

486
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,290
On April 4th of this year, a huge diamond was stolen.

487
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,720
It seems that the security system has been upgraded,

488
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,020
in the end, Miyama was pretty pleased with this time.

489
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,730
April 4th?

490
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,280
But I thought Yokomizo was
in the first division of research department.

491
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,220
Isn't Kiddo assigned to the second division?

492
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,190
Lately there has been a strange guy trying to kill Kiddo.

493
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,930
Because we are related to him, some officers were even injured.

494
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,740
So it seems that the first division came to help us.

495
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,260
Oh, trying to kill Kiddo?

496
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,580
Someone's calling. Sorry.

497
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,560
Detective Mouri?

498
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,610
No, Kudo?

499
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,040
It's you, isn't it?

500
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,550
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

501
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,330
I was quite surprised that you came with Detective Mouri.

502
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,040
In fact, I wanted to ask you to investigate for me.

503
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,930
But I didn't know how to contact you.

504
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,410
Seem like you couldn't solve the case and went to the police, huh?

505
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,230
No, we weren't trying to do that.

506
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,610
In the ruined hotel, Detective Mouri was arrested
by five police officers on a stakeout.

507
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,530
Oh, you're really honest.

508
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,340
This guy knew?

509
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,980
That there were police at that place?

510
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,530
Ah, forget it.

511
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,930
So what was in the hotel?

512
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,060
We found a mask and pistol used for some crime.

513
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,210
Well done, Kudo.

514
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,160
So here's the second hint.

515
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,690
Go to cafe terrace at night.

516
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,030
Cafe terrace at night?

517
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,730
You'll know where it is, if it's really you.

518
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,980
I will definitely solve this case!

519
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,280
So disengage Ran and the others' IDs.

520
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,840
Hey, are you listening?

521
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,520
Damn it!

522
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,370
The person you love...

523
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,820
How painful is it to lose the person you love?

524
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,980
Please try hard to stop that thing from happening.

525
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,500
Kudo.

526
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,200
Why?

527
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,090
Why does he know my true identity?

528
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,780
That guy...

529
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,410
Who is that guy really?

530
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,960
The line isn't moving at all, but my stomach is growling.

531
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,360
Right.

532
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,370
Speaking of which, it's not even lunchtime yet.

533
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,110
Okay, I'll stand in line for you guys.

534
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,380
You can go and eat something.

535
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,230
Is that really okay, Haibara?

536
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,650
But I feel bad for leaving Ai here alone.

537
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,740
Really?

538
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,300
Then I'll stay with Haibara.

539
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,540
I'll stay too.

540
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,210
Then I'll stay too.

541
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,690
Are you guys stupid? That's no point if we all stay.

542
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,660
Then how about this?

543
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,870
We'll take turns to stand in line every 30 minutes.

544
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,770
We can start with Ai, all right?

545
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,650
Agreed!

546
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,200
Then I'll see you in 30 minutes.

547
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,400
Okay!

548
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,210
Sorry.

549
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Please go on ahead.

550
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,950
How long can I keep this up?

551
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,850
If I could disassemble one, I might be able to figure something out.

552
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,510
It's not a simple explosive device.

553
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,360
I can't do anything here.

554
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,320
I see.

555
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,870
Oh, that's right.

556
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,860
I gave it a power-up.

557
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,210
Thank you.

558
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,570
By the way, did you figure out?

559
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,860
Where is that cafe terrace at night?

560
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,690
Yes.

561
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,450
Where exactly is it?

562
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,380
The Cafe Terrace at Night was painted by Van Gogh in 1888.

563
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,500
It depicts a dim gas lamp illuminating a cafe terrace,
near a street where horse-drawn carriages come and go.

564
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,380
If we're talking about gas lamp and horse- drawn carriages,

565
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,670
the only answer is the carriage road in Japan
that was the first to be equipped with gas lamps.

566
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,750
The energy is too high, professor.

567
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,580
Haibara!

568
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,420
Here.

569
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,440
Thank you.

570
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,050
Sorry to keep you waiting.

571
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,460
Huh? We're still here?

572
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,620
I think my estimation was off.

573
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,070
It's our turn now.

574
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,470
If you would.

575
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,070
So cute, Ran.

576
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,670
Your face was just like a child's.

577
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,110
Sonoko?

578
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,520
What are you doing here?

579
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,060
Look, the Red Castle Hotel over there.

580
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,100
I heard that they're having a party tonight
to celebrate their 100,000th guest.

581
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,470
Because that hotel was funded by my father,

582
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,530
so I came to this amusement park
to kill some time before the party begins.

583
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,260
Huh? Where did you pick this up?

584
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,900
It's not like that!

585
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,800
It's from one of my dad's clients.

586
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,160
What? That client must be some big shot!

587
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,800
I didn't find my ID, so I thought I might have dropped it.

588
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,100
Oh, right!

589
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,470
You and the kids were also invited to the party, right?

590
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,600
How about we both go to Red Castle first?

591
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,660
These kids are wearing for their IDs,

592
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,320
so it's okay to leave them here.

593
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,650
Especially this kid,

594
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,100
she looks very reliable.

595
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,380
But...

596
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,680
Right now, there is a cake buffet at the restaurant there.

597
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,230
With this ID,

598
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,570
you are free to go in and out of Miracle Land.

599
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,700
What's in here, exactly?

600
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,790
Don't move!

601
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,410
Hattori?

602
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,590
How was that? Were you scared?

603
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,730
Shut up.

604
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,690
This is a good time to bump into each other.

605
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
You're pretty smart, huh?

606
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,320
No way, Kudo? You too?

607
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,320
So you were also...

608
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,400
Yeah, Kazuha is being held hostage.

609
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,760
But she doesn't know anything about it. She's just having fun at the theme park.

610
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,690
The number you dialed

611
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,830
is out of service or powered off.

612
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,460
We are unable to connect you at this time.

613
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,000
Geez. What the hell?

614
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,050
He told me to have fun and wait as
he had something to sort out quickly.

615
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,740
I really feel like I'm Ran waiting for Kudo.

616
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,460
Huh? Kazuha?

617
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,760
Ran? Is that you?

618
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,380
Kazuha, long time no see.

619
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,830
So you're here too?

620
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,160
Where's Hattori?

621
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,540
Work... Work.

622
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,720
I see.

623
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,820
So boring.

624
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,840
Huh? Kazuha?

625
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,430
Sonoko!

626
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,000
Right, we're going to a cake buffet.

627
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,850
Wanna come?

628
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,290
I love cakes!

629
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,990
Then, let's go!

630
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,640
Hmm!

631
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,830
Hey, Ran, we're leaving.

632
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,210
Wait!

633
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,390
I see...

634
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,650
So she has been taken hostage too.

635
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,380
Yeah, not only Ran.

636
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,610
There are four children too.

637
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,950
Also, the client seems to know that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

638
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,170
Are you saying that he knows your true identity?

639
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,060
I'm not sure yet.

640
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,740
Hey, you think it's because they've figured out
about that drug shrinking you?

641
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,650
That black organization...

642
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,530
Hey!

643
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,170
What's wrong?

644
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,400
The mask, the pistol, and the getaway car.

645
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,730
I see!

646
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,510
An attack on an armored car?

647
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,330
Yeah.

648
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,770
Is that what he was talking about?

649
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,170
Maybe.

650
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,490
Can I have a minute?

651
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,060
What is it, kid?

652
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,220
Has that armored car ever been attacked?

653
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,000
Yes, it has.

654
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,550
I think it was on April 4th.

655
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,710
Since you run a business here,
you must have been questioned by the police, right?

656
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,560
Can you tell us the details?

657
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,270
Yeah.

658
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,400
It was right around this time of day.

659
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,350
Don't move.

660
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,210
Stay still!

661
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,440
It all happened in a flash.

662
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,440
I couldn't even tell if it was a dream or reality.

663
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,790
That means it was perfectly executed., right?

664
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,080
Thank you, ma'am.

665
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,920
Wait a minute!

666
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,100
Kids, today is the worst day of your lives.

667
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,380
You should go home and sleep.

668
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,360
Yeah, I will, but only after I make it the best day of my life.

669
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:36,980
See you.

670
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,460
Don't go running off! I've been looking for you!

671
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,280
Ouch!

672
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,160
Forget it, this is not the time to be fighting.

673
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,970
Why is that dark-skinned brat from Osaka here too?

674
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,290
For the same reason as you.

675
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,720
Mouri.

676
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,990
Give me back the client's cell phone!

677
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,010
It's about time to tell us the truth, isn't it?

678
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,600
Well, even if you say it that way...

679
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,280
There are limits to what a detective can do alone, right?

680
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,640
Wouldn't it be better to let us take care of it quickly?

681
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,650
This is Mouri.

682
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,650
So it's Detective Mouri this time?

683
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,170
Forget it, now you're on the carriage road?

684
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,200
Yeah.

685
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,550
I thought I've told you not to be so close to the police.

686
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,210
Are you watching me?

687
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,210
That one?

688
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,630
Are you going to break the agreement, Mouri?

689
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,130
Definitely not!

690
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,860
This is force majeure!

691
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,580
Mouri, who are you talking to?

692
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,410
Idiot! Idiot!

693
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,260
Get lost, you incompetent cops!

694
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,890
What did he say?

695
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,370
Idiot! Idiot!

696
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,160
- Get lost, you incompetent cops!
- What's wrong with that doll?

697
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,290
Idiot! Idiot!

698
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,090
- Get lost, you incompetent cops!
- Hey!

699
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,220
- This is not looking good, isn't it?
- Idiot! Idiot!

700
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,380
Dangerous! Get away from the doll, it's gonna explode!

701
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,990
What?

702
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,470
10 seconds to explosion.

703
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:13,550
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4...

704
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,620
- 3, 2, 1
- Damn it!

705
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,440
Mama!

706
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,820
Yokomizo!

707
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,820
Send an ambulance! Be quick!

708
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,030
You brat!

709
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,760
Next time it will be those kids' turn!

710
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,360
Mouri!

711
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,440
What's wrong?

712
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,480
Somehow, this ID has been flashing since a while ago.

713
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,640
Mine too.

714
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,530
Do you know anything about this, Sonoko?

715
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,080
This is my first time seeing this.

716
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,030
Go ask the staff ahead and we'll know.

717
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,700
Geez.

718
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,870
He didn't even notice such a huge bomb right in front of him.

719
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,160
What on earth is wrong with the police nowadays?

720
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,440
What did you say?

721
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,990
Isn't it your fault that this happened?

722
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,480
Let go of me! There's no evidence of that!

723
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,910
To be honest, you're troublesome.

724
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,670
Stop bothering me. Okay?

725
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,810
What?

726
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,830
I'm glad I left the police.

727
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,860
I wanna live a long life.

728
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,760
Hey, let's go.

729
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,580
OK.

730
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,030
Inspector, is that all right?

731
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,560
It's all right.

732
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,080
Ran and the children are being held hostage at Miracle Land.

733
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,360
They're wearing IDs on their wrists that will explode if they leave.

734
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,830
Please protect Ran and the others discreetly. Mouri.

735
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,250
I've asked the inspector to look after Ran and the others.

736
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,480
Whether this will turn out for better or worse depends on us now.

737
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,840
Speaking of which, did you learn anything?

738
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,620
Yeah, it seems that on April 4th,
an armored car was attacked on this carriage road.

739
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:11,020
And the police said that Kaito Kiddo stole a diamond
from the Miyama Art Museum on that day.

740
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,300
I see.

741
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,330
Anyway, I'll investigate on my own from here.

742
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,430
Don't force yourself to do this, you kids.

743
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,850
What are you thinking about?

744
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,090
Maybe we're finished with the hint about the carriage road.

745
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,280
What can we figure out with such little information?

746
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,710
But there are more hints.

747
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,200
Hints to solve the mystery.

748
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,010
What?

749
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,360
The hints I got were:

750
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,160
The cafe terrace at night and YOU CRY.

751
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,250
So he gave you a different hint.

752
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,930
I guess so.

753
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,420
YOU CRY.

754
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,680
Using the alphabet, it's Y-O-U-C-R-Y.

755
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,460
Speaking of YOU...

756
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,500
Yes.

757
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:03,160
That's the initials of the marine university
on the outskirts of Yokohama. Yokohama Ocean University.

758
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,640
The rest of it is CRY.

759
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,850
I have no idea about that part either.

760
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,660
Let's head over there.

761
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,620
To that place called YOU.

762
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,010
Yeah.

763
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,410
Ran, hurry up!

764
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,010
Excuse me.

765
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,440
Yes, what do you need?

766
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,990
What's with the red light on this ID blinking?

767
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,980
- Now we'll broadcast a message for a customer.
- Well... What's this?

768
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,970
- Ran Mouri of Beika and her friend Kazuha...
- I've never seen this thing before.

769
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:34,930
- Ran Mouri of Beika and her friend Kazuha...
- Is that so?

770
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,260
Ran Mouri of Beika and her friend Kazuha...

771
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,680
If you're there, please report to the medical station at once.

772
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,420
What's going on?

773
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,490
Could it be that something happened to the kids?

774
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,680
If so, things must be serious.

775
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,040
Sorry, Sonoko.

776
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,510
Can you go on alone?

777
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,580
I'm okay.

778
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,060
You should go quickly, if you're worried about those kids.

779
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,060
I'm sorry.

780
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,020
I'll definitely eat as many as I want.

781
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,410
What's wrong?

782
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,060
She fainted in the park.

783
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,920
I think it's mild heatstroke.

784
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,300
Is it?

785
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:12,710
I'm sorry.

786
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,940
It's okay. Don't worry.

787
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,710
But why did you call Kazuha as well?

788
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,410
This is the first time I've spoken to this kid.

789
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,110
Well...

790
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,350
Isn't it obvious?

791
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,870
It's better to have two people around than only one.

792
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,080
Right, right.

793
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,430
She needs to get some rest.

794
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,200
Can you stay with her?

795
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,490
Of course.

796
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,180
Please be by my side, always.

797
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,270
I thought she was just a cold kid.

798
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,090
Actually, she's quite cute, huh?

799
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,080
It's so tiring to play this drama.

800
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,410
CRY, CRY, CRY...

801
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,610
Maybe it's an abbreviation for some course?

802
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,200
Or extracurricular activity?

803
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,880
Indeed.

804
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,470
Aside from that...

805
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:08,360
The crime research club of Yokohama. Crime Research of Yokohama.

806
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,110
I think that this club is infinitely close to the correct answer.

807
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,550
You are...

808
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,580
I'm Saguru Hakuba.

809
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,330
In many ways, I am in the same position as you.

810
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,140
You mean the same position?

811
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,900
You're the son of the Police Chief and a high school detective, right?

812
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,770
Yeah, although I failed to beat you, a schoolboy detective.

813
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,390
I see.

814
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,620
So we have something in common,
because my dad is the Osaka Police Chief.

815
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,370
That's not all.

816
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,790
So, you are also...

817
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,060
Someone important to me is also at Miracle Land.

818
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,940
Let's talk about it while walking.

819
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,100
It's this CRY that's really wasting our time.

820
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,920
Maybe that's because it will have us end up in tears.

821
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,820
Yeah, that's right.

822
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,800
Hello? Is anyone there?

823
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,720
Hello?

824
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:03,780
We're coming in.

825
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,840
There are so many files!

826
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,110
Hey, look at these pictures.

827
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,430
They look like snaps from the research club members.

828
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,350
We should photograph these pictures.

829
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,110
Yeah.

830
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,460
The client?

831
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,600
Yeah...

832
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,100
What?

833
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,120
You surprised me, Heiji Hattori.

834
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,150
I didn't expect you to find out those things with a simple "You Cry".

835
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,150
Seriously, I'm shocked by you guys.

836
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,060
Anyway, if you really want us to solve this case,

837
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,090
can't you give us some easier hints?

838
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,950
If it were that easy to solve, it'd be no fun for me.

839
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,010
Besides...

840
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,310
I'm testing your abilities as detectives,

841
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,230
and whether or not you're qualified to solve my case.

842
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,560
What are you talking about?

843
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,810
There will be no more hints from here on out.

844
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,610
I'm looking forward to your performance,

845
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,230
young detectives.

846
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,490
Hey, wait!

847
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,140
Damn it!

848
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,200
He hung up.

849
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,500
No hints?

850
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,230
What are we going to do?

851
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,150
(Targets are at Yokohama Ocean University. Kill them all.)

852
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,920
Who are you?

853
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,340
What can I do for you?

854
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,420
Well, we...

855
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,130
We're planning to come to this university next year.

856
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,560
We're just looking around.

857
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,830
If you do get in, please be sure to join our club.

858
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,330
Yeah, of course.

859
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,600
Hey, miss.

860
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,060
Who are in the photos up there?

861
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,620
From the left are the photos of the club presidents
in chronological order.

862
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,450
Then why is the photo of the third president taken down?

863
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,060
But, look!

864
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,570
There are hooks up there beside the last photo.

865
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,280
Compared to the third photo,

866
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,450
we can see slightly lighter lines
on the wall next to the next few photos, right?

867
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,250
This is because the third president's photo
was taken down for some reason,

868
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,600
and the next photos were all moved forward, right?

869
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:30,830
Isn't that so?

870
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,450
The third president Itou was expelled.

871
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,590
Seems like his name was Jirou Itou.

872
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,170
No, his name was Tsuehiko Itou. Do you know him?

873
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:45,630
Yeah, I guess so.

874
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,420
I think this is him, right?

875
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,550
No.

876
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,010
It's this guy.

877
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,040
Oh, I see.

878
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,360
What a good actor.

879
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,190
I'm sorry, I guess it's not the Itou I know.

880
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,160
Tsuehiko Itou.

881
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,800
Heiji, who's that? That Ito guy?

882
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,760
If I knew, I wouldn't ask you to look it up for me.

883
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,120
Does the chief know?

884
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,400
It's confidential.

885
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,850
You said confidential, Heiji?

886
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,190
Then, I'll be waiting for your call.

887
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,680
Hey, Heiji!

888
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,390
Well, I'm going out for a smoke. Just a smoke...

889
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,150
How about having something to eat at the school cafeteria?

890
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,380
If my blood sugar drops, my thinking speed will slow down as well...

891
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,730
Dummy. How can you have free time for that?

892
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,580
I'm still waiting for a call.

893
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,300
What's the use of a toothpick if you don't eat beef.

894
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,940
But people say, "it will be hard for
a hungry person to win the fight."

895
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,730
Besides, I've already figured out what you're trying to figure out.

896
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,660
The local Police Department is closer to
Yokohama than the Osaka Police, huh?

897
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,230
He's really annoying.

898
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,930
Yeah. Yes.

899
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,010
Next time I get there, I'll take you out.

900
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,230
Okay, please, Ao. Look it up for me quickly.

901
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,590
What are you doing, Otaki?

902
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,540
Mr. Toyama!

903
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,850
Were you on the phone with your cousin Aoki in the Kanagawa Police?

904
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,770
We haven't seen each other so long. I just wanted to hear his voice.

905
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,370
Stop pretending.

906
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,920
It's a request from Heizou's son, isn't it?

907
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,130
I got his call as well.

908
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,890
What? He called you too?

909
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,640
You've been fooled, Otaki.

910
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,690
Is there something wrong with my son?

911
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,680
Chief!

912
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,750
Come to my office, and tell me everything about it.

913
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,100
It'll be better for you if you're honest.

914
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,450
Well...

915
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,150
I gotta say this is really torture for me.

916
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,290
Then, it's up to you.

917
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Inspector Megure.

918
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,530
I'll go say hello.

919
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,960
Then, I'll come with you.

920
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
He's been taking care of Heiji for a long time.

921
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,820
Then, I want to go ride the Super Snake.

922
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,480
The rest is up to you, thanks.

923
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,550
Wait a minute!

924
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,450
You shouldn't get up yet!

925
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,230
Stop him, please!

926
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,280
Understood.

927
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,650
Inspector Megure!

928
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,420
Oh, Ran and Kazuha...

929
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,050
What happened today?

930
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,350
Why did you two come here together?

931
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,080
Is there something wrong?

932
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,450
It's nothing.

933
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,800
We're on break.

934
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,030
I'm here to play with Shiratori on break.

935
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,260
Only you two came to Miracle Land?

936
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,480
How rare...

937
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,260
Well, Ran...

938
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,160
Those kids.

939
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,410
Inspector.

940
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,380
Hmm...

941
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,310
What? Seriously?

942
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,370
(The Super Snake is currently out of service due to
a machinery inspection. We apologize for the inconvenience.)

943
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,990
This is your punishment for trying to sneak out.

944
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,210
Let's go back to the medical station.

945
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,420
I'm really sorry.

946
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,630
For the sake of safety, please be understanding.

947
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,170
We'll begin giving out timed entry tickets now.

948
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:43,840
Robber!

949
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,140
Robber! There's a robber!

950
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,020
Ayumi!

951
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,780
Ran!

952
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:01,330
Ah? Why would Inspector Megure come here?

953
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,530
Well, Takagi!

954
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,660
What are you doing?

955
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,660
Nothing...

956
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,530
Don't tell me you fell in love with some cute girl during our date?

957
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,190
No... No way... That's impossible.

958
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,420
What?

959
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,170
What did you mean, exactly? I'm confused.

960
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,970
Is that so?

961
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,840
I'd better pretend I didn't see the inspector.

962
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,970
Wow, this curry looks delicious.

963
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,280
I'm going to eat!

964
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,210
Just eat up!

965
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,950
It's delicious! This curry...

966
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,470
This curry is disgusting!

967
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,310
It's all flour.

968
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,420
So, who is Tsuehiko Itou?

969
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Itou is a wanted criminal who attacked
an armored car on the April 4th of this year.

970
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,070
I see.

971
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,570
That's why his photo was taken down from the wall of that room.

972
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,110
That's not all that's interesting about him.

973
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,660
Although he operated an investment advice firm after graduating,

974
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,500
at that firm, Far East Office, a murder took place.

975
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,440
What?

976
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,260
See? Interesting, huh?

977
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:19,260
Great! Let's go over and see!

978
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,810
That Far East Office.

979
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,970
I can't believe he ate it all...

980
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,970
I'm back.

981
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,410
Welcome back, sir.

982
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,000
Excuse me, Kuriyama. Can you get me a cold drink?

983
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:43,810
Sure.

984
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,490
This is Kisaki.

985
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,240
Dear, what's wrong?

986
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,850
Didn't you go to Miracle Land with Ran and the others today?

987
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,530
Wait, you mean case files?

988
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,580
What are you doing?

989
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,850
Well... There is something.

990
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,580
About the shooting.

991
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,690
I see.

992
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,110
About the armed robbery of the armored car on April 4th, right?

993
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,800
I'll look it up and call you back.

994
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,730
That would save me, then.

995
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,090
Dear?

996
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,830
Say, Eri.

997
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,740
Do you think I can solve this case?

998
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,930
To research, you gotta run, right? Former officer?

999
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,680
Yeah... Indeed. Then I'm counting on you for the files!

1000
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,840
Okay, I got it.

1001
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,730
Come here.

1002
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,270
Please come in.

1003
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:58,940
Sorry for the intrusion.

1004
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,150
Did someone call just now?

1005
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,330
Yeah, I had a call.

1006
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,810
From a real pain in the ass.

1007
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,300
Right, little Goro?

1008
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,990
So, it was from her husband.

1009
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,370
(Unauthorized personnel are not allowed to enter)

1010
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,580
Although we're not allowed,

1011
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,570
I still think I gotta take a look inside.

1012
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,120
All detectives would think so.

1013
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,830
The murder victim was Nishio Masaharu,
the Sales Director at Far East Office.

1014
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,090
It seems that he was killed by a sniper.

1015
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,550
At college, he was a classmate of the Club President Itou.

1016
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,390
In other words...

1017
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,490
Nishio was also a member of that crime research club.

1018
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,720
That's right.

1019
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:45,870
Come and look here.

1020
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,690
Come and look here? Hey, isn't this my phone? When did you...

1021
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,350
Look.

1022
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:58,670
The front row of the picture.
In the middle is the club president, Tsuehiko Itou.

1023
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,020
On his right is the one who was murdered, Nishio.

1024
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,190
So, who is the woman on Itou's left?

1025
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,480
This woman is Reiko Shimizu.

1026
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,780
She seemed to work for the same company.

1027
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,060
She committed suicide on May 15th.

1028
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,540
Suicide?

1029
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,360
It was during the time that she was investigated
and questioned by the police.

1030
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,020
About the shooting case of Nishio?

1031
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,510
The investigation and pursuit pushed her too far.

1032
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,140
This is where the shooting incident happened.

1033
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,720
Although everything's covered in dust,

1034
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,470
things are still the same as that day of the incident.

1035
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:44,390
But I think the blinds and windows were open at that time.

1036
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,030
The culprit shot from the toilet of that building, right?

1037
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:05,540
The gun he used was a Charter Arms AR- 7
with a sniper scope and silencer attachments.

1038
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,000
Eight empty casings fell into the toilet where the culprit was.

1039
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,990
The culprit shot all eight bullets.

1040
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,010
One of the bullets hit Nishio in the back of the head.

1041
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,530
I guess he was killed instantly.

1042
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:29,830
Afterwards, there was a plan written by Itou found on Nishio's desk.
The plan was about their attack on the armored car.

1043
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,260
Therefore, Itou, who was still alive then,
was placed on the wanted list.

1044
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:36,640
Then why would Reiko Shimizu be investigated?

1045
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,550
I don't know that much.

1046
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,780
See, Hattori, if he was really shot in the back of the head,

1047
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,320
don't you think there was too little blood?

1048
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:50,500
Yeah, but we have a large pool of blood over here.

1049
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,080
What exactly happened?

1050
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,860
And the blood on the back of the seat
was flowing straight down to the cushion.

1051
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,440
Look at this.

1052
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,590
One of the casters was shot and fell off.

1053
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,140
I see. That's how it happened.

1054
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,080
Yeah, that's it.

1055
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:15,680
This is Hattori.

1056
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,170
You've made it to the next round, Hattori.

1057
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,020
Yeah, finally...

1058
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,340
I think you've figured out what case you're supposed to solve.

1059
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,360
The shooting case of Masaharu Nishio, right?

1060
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,910
Hey, could you be...

1061
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,320
Damn it!

1062
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:36,990
What?

1063
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:37,850
Bike?

1064
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,380
Anyway, it's definitely not something good, huh?

1065
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,020
Who are those guys?

1066
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,280
I guess they are NPCs who make the game more interesting

1067
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,120
That's what the client said.

1068
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,460
It's a little too interesting.

1069
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,380
This is not good. Let's split up.

1070
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,080
Okay. Got it.

1071
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,390
Okay, one on one, huh?

1072
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,840
Just come at me.

1073
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,030
What an ugly face.

1074
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,880
Ah? Did I hurt your feeling?

1075
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:42,820
Damn...

1076
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,910
You're so tricky! Drop the gun and fight, if you have the guts!

1077
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,240
I wonder if Kudo can get away.

1078
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,750
Geez. My T-shirt was stained with the paint. It's useless now.

1079
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,110
A man in a baseball cap and a jacket, right?

1080
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,030
But he's probably already run away, right?

1081
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:18,320
You have a point.

1082
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,190
What's wrong?

1083
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,440
Don't you think he's suspicious?

1084
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,870
The one in the yellow T-shirt?

1085
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,690
Look, his hair has layered out.

1086
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,180
That means he was wearing a hat.

1087
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,490
He probably got rid of the jacket and the bag he stole.

1088
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,000
As expected of the top-notch high school student detective
in Kanto, Shinichi Kudo's girlfriend.

1089
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,260
To be exact, I'm not his girlfriend.

1090
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:52,790
Coke was spilled on the culprit's shoes, right?

1091
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,790
Yes, that was my plan to leave evidence.

1092
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,660
Oh, my bag!

1093
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,850
You're amazing, Genta!

1094
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,860
That's not true, Ayumi.

1095
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,050
You shouldn't brag, Genta.

1096
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:25,420
Help!

1097
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:28,030
I've seen it all!

1098
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,950
Ah? is that so?

1099
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,550
It's him!

1100
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,570
It's an old lady.

1101
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:49,200
It's him!

1102
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:51,780
Hey, Ayumi.

1103
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,340
You sure it's him, Ayumi?

1104
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,700
Yes, his left sneaker has Cola spilled on it.

1105
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,820
Look at him, he's looking around.

1106
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,310
He looks really suspicious.

1107
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,240
We can't be wrong.

1108
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,030
Let's follow him.

1109
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,770
That's not good. Where did they all go? Those kids!

1110
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,940
Thief! Stop!

1111
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,350
We won't let you run away!

1112
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,470
Get out ! Get out of my way!

1113
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,970
Get out of my way!

1114
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,620
Out of my way!

1115
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,620
We're borrowing this!

1116
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,770
Stop right there!

1117
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,410
Just give up.

1118
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,330
The security guards will be here soon.

1119
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,290
Don't stick your nose into other's business!

1120
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,630
Oh, no!

1121
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:24,980
Ayumi!

1122
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:25,970
Ayumi!

1123
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:33,060
Don't move! Or I can't guarantee what will happen to this kid!

1124
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,800
Number 5 is approaching the gate.

1125
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,690
Who is it?

1126
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:55,100
Number 5, Ayumi Yoshida.

1127
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,370
Is that so?

1128
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,650
Don't come any closer!

1129
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,270
If you come any closer, this kid will die.

1130
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:12,500
Hey, let that kid go!

1131
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,750
I'll be your hostage instead.

1132
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,060
Don't be ridiculous, old man!

1133
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,150
Then, let me...

1134
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,920
I'll be the hostage.

1135
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:21,370
It's because of me that she got caught.

1136
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,590
You can't go there.

1137
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,490
I mean, how can we possibly let civilians like you be hostages?

1138
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:27,690
Cut the crap!

1139
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,070
I won't change hostages!

1140
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:34,950
You guys, don't move until I get out of this gate.

1141
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,390
After all, this kid's life is at stake.

1142
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,610
That's bad, if they just get out like this...

1143
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,970
Say, this is the entrance.

1144
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,470
The exit is next door.

1145
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,930
Stop nagging! Get out of my way!

1146
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,890
It's useless to yell at me.

1147
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,260
Rules are rules.

1148
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,830
Honestly, you are not a kid or something.

1149
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,800
Why don't you know how to follow the rules?

1150
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,920
Go arrest him!

1151
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,760
Get out of the way!

1152
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,960
There are hostages everywhere.

1153
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,740
Stay back

1154
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,300
One step closer and this woman will...

1155
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,310
What will you do?

1156
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,390
Huh? What will I do?

1157
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,460
What will you do?

1158
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:35,340
Can you tell me?

1159
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,210
Excuse me... Can you let me through...

1160
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,150
Sorry, I finally got the ice cream.

1161
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,890
Miss Sato.

1162
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,210
Inspector Megure?

1163
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,530
Well... What are you all doing here?

1164
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,480
That's what I wanted to ask you.

1165
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,730
(Ah, no... Actually...)

1166
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,040
Kudo...

1167
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,390
Kudo! Kudo!

1168
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,130
Hey, Kudo!

1169
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,070
Kudo!

1170
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,590
You're finally awake!

1171
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:27,970
Where am I...

1172
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,310
You're in Mr. Agasa's car.

1173
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:32,990
Professor?

1174
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,200
Don't move.

1175
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,640
I've given you first aid treatment,
but there's a possibility that you'll have a fractured bone.

1176
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,370
Hattori, did you...

1177
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,000
No, it was Hakuba...

1178
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,150
He called Mr. Agasa here.
When Mr. Agasa arrived, he saw Hakuba holding you in his arms.

1179
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,100
Then, Mr. Agasa called me, so here we are.

1180
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,510
Hakuba...

1181
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,740
He said he had something to investigate,
then let me carry you into the car and left.

1182
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,630
What time is it now? How long has it been since I fell into the river?

1183
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:10,540
It's been two hours. It's now 8:30 at night.

1184
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:12,880
Only an hour hand a half left.

1185
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,080
Anyway, we're now going to the Red Castle.

1186
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:19,270
You've already known the culprit who shot Nishio?

1187
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,530
Not yet, we're just going there.

1188
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,960
After all, there is no use staying around here.

1189
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:29,420
Oh right. When you were asleep, Officer Otaki called me back.

1190
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,340
He told me a lot of things.

1191
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:35,710
There's something else related to the shooting case of Nishio.

1192
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,370
On the night Nishio was shot...

1193
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,710
A car flipped near the containers at the docks. It was badly damaged.

1194
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,030
The driver was Tsuehiko Itou.

1195
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,680
It is said that he was critically wounded.
It was a miracle that he could survive.

1196
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:00,680
He stayed in the intensive care unit for a whole month.

1197
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:05,810
The police investigated the car that was involved in the accident.

1198
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,070
They found the hydraulic pipes were tampered with.

1199
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:13,090
And also, they found a sniper rifle with a silencer in the trunk.

1200
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,960
Although the fingerprints had been wiped...

1201
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:22,710
it was confirmed that sniper rifle was the one used to kill Nishio.

1202
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,660
So did they arrest Itou?

1203
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:30,120
No. Two months after the accident,
the police were finally allowed to visit the patient.

1204
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,190
When the police went in...

1205
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,270
We're coming in.

1206
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:39,420
Itou was no longer in the ward.

1207
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:46,630
After that, the police couldn't find any trace of Itou,
so they placed him on the wanted list.

1208
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:51,090
And he was suspected of robbery
during the time he was still in the hospital.

1209
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,660
So, this Itou is the culprit, right?

1210
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,880
Yeah, there's no doubt that Itou shot Nishio.

1211
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,110
Itou's footprints were also found at the sniper's position.

1212
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,450
There were gunshot residues on his clothes.

1213
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:12,020
Those eight shell casings at the scene
could be loaded in the magazine at once.

1214
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:15,580
And all of the rifle marks match, but...

1215
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:17,090
Mascara?

1216
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:21,440
We found traces of mascara on the rifle's sniper scope.

1217
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,140
That's it.

1218
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:31,000
That means it came from whoever looked through the scope, right?

1219
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,090
That's right.

1220
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,440
Speaking of this mascara,

1221
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,950
they looked into the women around Itou and Nishio,

1222
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,940
and found one woman who used this mascara.

1223
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,660
It was Reiko Shimizu.

1224
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:51,320
Ah, the one who committed suicide after the incident?

1225
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:55,770
A Madonna of the Crime Research of Yokohama Club.

1226
01:13:56,310 --> 01:14:00,590
She was very close to both the murdered Nishio and the missing Itou.

1227
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:06,500
After graduation, she joined Itou's company with Nishio

1228
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,800
as the manager of their data room.

1229
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:13,170
Nishio and Itou were the ones who attacked the armored car, right?

1230
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:17,110
Itou may have had a motive to kill Nishio.

1231
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,640
Could Reiko Shimizu have had any motive?

1232
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:25,410
According to the her colleagues at the company,
Nishio had been pestering her. She hated him very much.

1233
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:28,040
The police pressed her about the mascara on the scope

1234
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:32,450
and the inconsistencies in her alibi for the night of Nishio's murder.

1235
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:35,360
But she didn't say anything.

1236
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,610
And then, on May 15h...

1237
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,820
She jumped.

1238
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,100
Although Reiko Shimizu's body wasn't found,

1239
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,250
due to the fierce currents,
the police determined that she had no chance of survival.

1240
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:23,290
Itou disappeared from the hospital eight days later.

1241
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,230
The two suspects in Nishio's murder case both disappeared.

1242
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:30,520
Without any trace of suspects,
the investigation of this case had to stop.

1243
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,920
Of course, without its president, Itou's company went bankrupt.

1244
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,550
The company that bought it out was Miyama Corporation.

1245
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,690
Is it related to the Miyama Art Museum?

1246
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,010
The one where Kiddo went to steal the jewel?

1247
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:44,420
That's right.

1248
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,080
The president, Souichirou Miyama,
was also a member of Itou's crime research club.

1249
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,200
He was four years Itou's senior.

1250
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:54,570
Itou also had been very concerned about Miyama.

1251
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,740
Ah, speaking of Kiddo...

1252
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,200
Mr. Otaki told me something interesting about him.

1253
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:06,090
On April 4th, after stealing the jewel from Miyama Art Museum,

1254
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:10,400
Kiddo ran into a group of burglars
on the run after robbing the armored car.

1255
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,310
It is said that someone heard gunshots there.

1256
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,910
Gunshots?

1257
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,870
Since Kiddo never uses guns,

1258
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,820
it must have been the burglars shooting at him.

1259
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,270
I'm afraid the reason why they shot him is because...

1260
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:26,490
Kiddo saw their faces, right?

1261
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:33,520
Yeah, Government and Charter Arms ammunition was found at the scene.

1262
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:40,550
From then on, every time Kiddo went to steal something,
there was someone trying to kill him.

1263
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,620
See? Interesting, huh?

1264
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:48,400
But it's still not enough to deduce who killed Nishio.

1265
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:52,480
Indeed. I guess we didn't find the most important part yet.

1266
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:59,000
Speaking of which, Mouri just called
and talked about an important witness he found.

1267
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,600
The day Nishio was killed,

1268
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:07,280
it seems that a janitor heard
a few metallic sounds coming from the toilet.

1269
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:13,340
Then, he saw Itou running out of
the toilet with a golf bag in his arms.

1270
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:20,220
Then the metallic sounds must be
the sound of shell casings falling onto the floor.

1271
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:26,140
And inside that golf bag must be a Charter Arms AR-7.

1272
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,440
Now things are clear, Mr. Agasa.

1273
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,680
Where is Mr. Mouri?

1274
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:35,740
He said that he had solved the case, so he went to the client first.

1275
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,080
So, did Mr. Mouri...

1276
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,150
That's terrible!

1277
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,610
Is that so?

1278
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:44,280
Don't stop, Mr. Agasa! Go full speed!

1279
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,280
Got it.

1280
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:14,060
I knew you'd come, Kaito Kiddo.

1281
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,380
You set things in place on the roof during the day,

1282
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:23,300
and now finally came in from there.

1283
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,030
I will not let you take the jewel.

1284
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,440
I won't take the jewel unless I make an announcement first.

1285
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,480
What?

1286
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,190
I came here tonight bid you farewell.

1287
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:38,560
I don't want to put my life on the line any longer.

1288
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:43,600
As expected of Kaito Kiddo. You've figure it out, huh?

1289
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,810
Yeah, kind of.

1290
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,070
But there's something I still don't understand.

1291
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,820
I have sent you back the diamond I stole,

1292
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,490
but there are still someone trying to kill me.

1293
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,850
I finally understood the reason.

1294
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,050
You're very protective of your junior schoolmates, huh?

1295
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:06,310
You shouldn't witness my cute juniors' game. It was your fault.

1296
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:11,240
A guard died for it, and you call it a game?

1297
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,100
Accidents always happen in games.

1298
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,540
But unfortunately, you saw them both.

1299
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:21,320
I couldn't do nothing when one of
my cute juniors asked me for help, right?

1300
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,560
What... what are you doing?

1301
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:48,290
Did you really think I would just
come over here without any preparation?

1302
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,290
Do it! Shoot him!

1303
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,440
What... What is this?

1304
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,900
Don't be scared. It's just sleeping gas.

1305
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:15,400
Didn't you notice? I've broken in here several times
since last time I came in on April 4th.

1306
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,570
What?

1307
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:25,110
And the reason I set up on the roof in broad daylight...

1308
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,150
was that I wanted to let you know I would come tonight

1309
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:33,260
and ensure you would appear here with your hired killers.

1310
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:34,860
How can that be?

1311
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,600
If you have anything to say, say it to the police I called here.

1312
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,920
Don't forget your lovely junior who's sleeping behind this curtain.

1313
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,280
So, where has that "junior" gone?

1314
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:06,170
I believe those two also have something to share.

1315
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:12,930
Something about this museum full of stolen items.

1316
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,200
It's Kidd! Kiddo is up there!

1317
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:39,000
I guess this is the end of your game,

1318
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:43,180
and it's in the worst possible way. Self-destruct.

1319
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:50,180
Open the door! Police! Open the door!

1320
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,680
Wait for me, Ran

1321
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,760
Thank you for your work, Detective Mouri.

1322
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,110
The client is getting tired of waiting for you.

1323
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,480
Please.

1324
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,460
Detective Mouri has come back.

1325
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,970
Sorry, I know you're tired, but there's not much time left.

1326
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:44,800
Proceed with your report.

1327
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:47,290
The case you asked me to investigate

1328
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:53,250
is an attack on the armored car on April 4th this year,

1329
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:57,930
and the truth about the related shooting case of Masaharu Nishio.

1330
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:10,790
I'll go to meet the kids at Miracle Land.

1331
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:11,330
Okay.

1332
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,880
Take care of Kazuha for me.

1333
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:13,680
Got it.

1334
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:22,760
The two men who attacked the armored car
on the carriage road were Tsuehiko Itou and Masaharu Nishio.

1335
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,450
But Nishio shot the guard who was trying to resist.

1336
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:32,460
Four days later, Nishio was killed by someone unknown.

1337
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,850
The police suspected that the murderer was Reiko Shimizu,

1338
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,790
a co-worker who was close to Nishio.

1339
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,340
But I don't think so.

1340
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:42,900
The murder's motive was...

1341
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:47,170
he had a perfect plan, but Nishio meddled this plan.

1342
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:51,420
Right, the murderer who killed Masaharu Nishio is...

1343
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,120
Wait a minute!

1344
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,410
You two?

1345
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,930
You two, Detective Mouri is now reporting...

1346
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:00,910
Oh, no!

1347
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,820
Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?

1348
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:08,920
Detective Mouri, please continue to report.

1349
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:14,300
Like I was saying, the murderer who killed Nishio was... Ouch...

1350
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,900
Sorry about that, Mr. Mouri.

1351
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,210
Not good! The monitor is off!

1352
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:20,920
Damn it!

1353
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,720
Damn, which button is it?

1354
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,240
What's that?

1355
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:36,690
Could it be that... the client is inside?

1356
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,250
What?

1357
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,440
When I was on the phone with this Takada earlier,

1358
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:46,270
I heard the same noise as when I was on the phone with the client.

1359
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:47,500
I see.

1360
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,150
We don't have much time. Let's go.

1361
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,470
It's so dark.

1362
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,750
I have no choice. Let's go.

1363
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,870
Welcome, Shinichi Kudo, Heiji Hattori.

1364
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,330
Finally, we meet.

1365
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,020
Far East Office President, Mr. Tsuehiko Itou.

1366
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,780
You two live up to your names.

1367
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,360
I knew it was the right decision to put you two together.

1368
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,420
Yeah, you could say that.

1369
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,990
I'm sorry I can only meet you guys in this way.

1370
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:38,330
It's because of my handicap.

1371
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,630
From the accident at the pier, right?

1372
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:44,480
Yeah, I know I will never recover.

1373
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,980
That's why I shut myself up in here.

1374
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,530
All these hidden assets of mine were invested by one of my friends.

1375
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,670
Including Miracle Land.

1376
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:56,170
It's Mr. Souichirou Miyama, right?

1377
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:57,620
Impressive.

1378
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,590
You figured out even this thing?

1379
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:02,920
We can give you our report, but there's not much time left.

1380
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,700
Have you found out the truth for me?

1381
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,450
Yes.

1382
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:08,400
My days are numbered.

1383
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,150
That's why I need a detective to find out the truth for me.

1384
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:16,800
A real detective who has not just brains, but the toughness.

1385
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:21,910
Alright, tell me the truth you've found.

1386
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:24,050
April 8th,

1387
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,760
at the office of Far East Office, Masaharu Nishio was killed.

1388
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:31,610
The culprit who shot him from the toilet of the adjacent building was

1389
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:33,820
Reiko Shimizu.

1390
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,740
She made you out to be the murderer in Nishio's murder.

1391
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:42,690
And, she also planned that accident to kill you.

1392
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,440
You're lying!

1393
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:46,020
It was me who shot Nishio from the toilet.

1394
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:49,500
So you're the same as the police?

1395
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:50,580
You're as useless as they are?

1396
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,890
It's true that you used a sniper rifle in that toilet.

1397
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:58,660
But it was after Reiko Shimizu shot him.

1398
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:59,500
What?

1399
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,780
You two missed.

1400
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:04,200
- The 7 rounds you fired...
- Missed?

1401
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,760
7 rounds?

1402
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:09,270
That sniper rifle's magazine should hold 8 rounds.

1403
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:14,610
You panicked and ran away without
cleaning up the shell castings on the floor.

1404
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:17,560
I guess you couldn't even remember how many shots you fired.

1405
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,890
By that time, Nishio had already been killed.

1406
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,850
How come?

1407
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:43,630
I saw it all. Nishio fell to the floor after one of my shots.

1408
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:49,720
Acually, one of the shot happened to blow a caster off his chair.

1409
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:53,670
Then isn't it possible that one of my shots happened to hit Nishio?

1410
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:58,500
Are you idiot? Who would sit around
so calmly while his room was shot up?

1411
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:01,930
Then, maybe my first shot happened to hit...

1412
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:05,450
The blood on the back of the chair that Nishio was sitting on that day

1413
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,870
had obviously flowed straight down before drying.

1414
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,800
That's how we figured it out.

1415
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:17,670
There was a sniper who shot Nishio's head with one single shot,

1416
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:24,380
And there was also an amateur
who shot around the room after the blood had dried.

1417
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:28,830
Although we couldn't tell which one was the true sniper,

1418
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,520
after listening to the testimony of Mr. Mouri's witness,

1419
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:34,070
things became clear.

1420
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:39,210
That is, he heard the several metallic sounds from the toilet,

1421
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,610
and saw you hurriedly running out with a golf bag.

1422
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,050
The metallic sounds were the shell casings falling on the tiled floor.

1423
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:51,560
There were several sounds, which means that amateur was you.

1424
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,120
In other words, the true sniper was Reiko Shimizu.

1425
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:59,110
And one who shot his chair at random

1426
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:03,140
and changed the crime scene
by making the victim fall on the floor was you.

1427
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:13,840
Inside the golf bag was a Charter Arms AR- 7.

1428
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:19,250
Before you shot, Reiko gave you that bag, didn't she?

1429
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,180
That's true.

1430
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,680
But how can you be so sure that it was Reiko who shot him?

1431
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,400
Because on the sniper scope,

1432
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,150
there were traces of a mascara,
which was always used by Reiko Shimizu.

1433
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,210
How is it possible?

1434
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,110
After you got the bag from her
and shot all the bullets from the toilet,

1435
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,440
you drove to the pier to dispose of the rifle and the car,

1436
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:47,940
I guess the part of your car out of order were the brakes, right?

1437
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:54,460
her motive probably was to keep the money
from the armored car robbery all to herself.

1438
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,340
She was there when your attacked the armored car, right?

1439
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:03,280
But when you were on the run, you run into Kaito Kiddo.

1440
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,460
Kiddo saw your faces, so you decided to kill him.

1441
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:12,780
But instead, you were trapped in a zigzag road,
so, in a panic, you shot Kiddo.

1442
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:17,860
Don't forget the Government
and sniper rifle shell castings were left on the road.

1443
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,900
No matter how well a person can drive,

1444
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:24,030
it's impossible to drive in such a zigzag road with one hand

1445
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:27,740
while using the other hand to shoot Kiddo flying in the sky.

1446
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,350
That is to say,

1447
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:31,510
there were two more with you,

1448
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,520
who were holding the sniper rifle and the Government.

1449
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,600
So, Masaharu Nishio and Reiko Shimizu were also sitting in the car.

1450
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:44,260
We heard most of the evidence from the police.

1451
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:50,380
Because the witness that Mr. Mouri found was also found by the police.

1452
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,430
The police knew this information,

1453
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:55,020
so they put their attention on Reiko.

1454
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:56,290
That's right.

1455
01:30:57,290 --> 01:31:04,210
Even from the beginning,
this case didn't need a great police officer, nor a great detective.

1456
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,530
The mystery has been solved.

1457
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,940
Please release Ran and the others' IDs.

1458
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:13,300
Liar. Reiko wouldn't do that.

1459
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:16,720
Liar. Liar. Liar!

1460
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,500
They're not liars.

1461
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,440
As expected, you're still alive.

1462
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,880
Reiko? Are you Reiko?

1463
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:32,280
I gotta say, as my partner, you're really unreliable.

1464
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,250
So was Nishio.

1465
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,370
He was too violent.

1466
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:40,070
If I let him be alive any longer, I would've been in danger.

1467
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,800
Itou, you're too cautious.

1468
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,990
And you always tried to show off when we talked.

1469
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,570
It is not fun to be with you.

1470
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:55,560
I know you hired that many detectives,
trying to take all the blame for me...

1471
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,300
But that ends today.

1472
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:03,230
Those assets handled by Miyama will all be mine.

1473
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,110
You mean Miyama?

1474
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,600
Miyama met his end as well.

1475
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:10,270
He was finished by Kaito Kiddo.

1476
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:15,710
After all of this, the one who survived will be me.

1477
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,450
Wait a minute!

1478
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:22,650
Kudo!

1479
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:23,770
Don't move.

1480
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,180
That's a Walther PPK.

1481
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,780
8 bullets in total.

1482
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,370
When she runs out of ammunition, we'll end this.

1483
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,790
6, 7, 8.

1484
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:37,540
Now!

1485
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:40,950
Hattori.

1486
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:42,920
Sorry.

1487
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,570
I'm ambidextrous.

1488
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,680
Grab it, Kudo!

1489
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,840
In the air, you don't need your feet to support your body, right?

1490
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:57,780
Right.

1491
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:20,290
Reiko? Reiko, what's wrong?

1492
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,540
What happened, Reiko?

1493
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:23,580
Reiko!

1494
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:28,540
Please release the IDs.

1495
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,330
They can be released, right?

1496
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:41,320
Yes, thank you. Please send an ambulance now.

1497
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:43,930
What?

1498
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,100
What's wrong?

1499
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:48,570
Error?

1500
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:52,990
She made things worse.

1501
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:58,340
Hey, Kudo, do you know how to fix it?

1502
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:00,070
It can't all be broken.

1503
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,330
We must find the working parts.

1504
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:06,790
I guess this is it for me.

1505
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:07,910
Kudo.

1506
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,700
Your voice sounds like a child's.

1507
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,750
Hattori, is there still an error?

1508
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,920
Yeah, it didn't change.

1509
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,110
So it really is set to a timed explosion!

1510
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,240
What's that?

1511
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,110
It's exactly 10:00.

1512
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,230
Damn...

1513
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,640
Which one should I click?

1514
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:35,370
I want to ride the Super Snake...

1515
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:37,670
It's been under maintenance.

1516
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,680
But my dessert is late.

1517
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,090
Stop complaining.

1518
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,300
This is all on inspector.

1519
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,010
Don't get fat, Inspector Megure.

1520
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:47,860
He's already fat enough.

1521
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:48,900
Really?

1522
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:54,480
Well, Inspector Megure...

1523
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,130
Is there anything wrong?

1524
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:58,100
Why do you ask?

1525
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:01,530
Because the police officers are all gathering here.

1526
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:02,810
Nothing.

1527
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:03,990
Inspector Megure.

1528
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,710
Oh, Shiratori!

1529
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,260
Excuse me, Ran.

1530
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:11,970
How is it?

1531
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,360
The customers and the hotel staff have all been evacuated.

1532
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:20,250
The only ones here are those kids and us police.

1533
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:21,370
I see.

1534
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:28,600
What are you doing, Shinichi?

1535
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,520
Damn!

1536
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:41,830
Sharing secrets will make a man and a woman become closer.

1537
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:48,110
The deepest secret is to commit a crime with the woman you love.

1538
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:54,260
See? That attack on the armored car showed my love for Reiko.

1539
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:58,120
But, because Nishio shot that guard,

1540
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,790
my perfect plan was ruined.

1541
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,420
There is no such thing as perfection.

1542
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,130
There will always be a loose cog.

1543
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:09,760
If you force it to work,

1544
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:11,490
maybe you'll ruin everything.

1545
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:13,880
You still have to reset, go back to normal,

1546
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:17,310
and try hard to right the wrongs of the past.

1547
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,390
You're just scared.

1548
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,570
Scared of reset.

1549
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:29,250
Maybe you're right.

1550
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:38,600
Will it work?

1551
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:49,200
What is this?

1552
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:52,760
If we don't stop the time limit, we can't release the IDs either.

1553
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:54,650
Damn it!

1554
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:59,390
Are you all right?

1555
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,920
Are you still not feeling well?

1556
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,200
No, I'm all right

1557
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,180
It's okay.

1558
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,940
Really? If you're not feeling well, let me know, okay?

1559
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,910
Okay, I will.

1560
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,220
Still, Conan didn't come.

1561
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:17,900
He must have stayed with Detective Mouri.

1562
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,340
Right, he always leave us behind like this.

1563
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:23,670
Conan is the best at trying to be a hero alone.

1564
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:28,830
Have you heard anything from Mouri?

1565
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:29,630
No.

1566
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:32,210
I see.

1567
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:35,270
When there's one minute left, I'm going in.

1568
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:35,830
Don't...

1569
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,410
I can't leave the kids alone there.

1570
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,270
That's right.

1571
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:46,310
It's 9:56. There's no time, Kudo.

1572
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:49,170
Oh right, he uses a wireless connection.

1573
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:55,320
If the wireless connection doesn't work,
it may work if we connect it to the cable directly.

1574
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,170
Great, we can make it this way.

1575
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,010
OK, it worked!

1576
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,560
Well done.

1577
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:18,300
Disable the time limit.

1578
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,920
Please enter password.

1579
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:22,470
Hey... Password...

1580
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:24,580
Hey, Kudo, this guy...

1581
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:27,120
It's okay. He just passed out.

1582
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:29,130
Maybe from the shock.

1583
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,700
What is the name of the person you love the most.

1584
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:38,050
It's 9:59 now.

1585
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,710
You stay here.

1586
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:43,500
Yes, sir.

1587
01:38:44,530 --> 01:38:46,640
I was really surprised.

1588
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,370
It wasn't a big deal for me.

1589
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,380
Did you have a good time today?

1590
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,380
I wish I could have rode the Super Snake.

1591
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:57,760
I think that rocket ride was fun too.

1592
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:00,300
I really want to ride it again.

1593
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,560
The one Itou loves the most should be Reiko Shimizu.

1594
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,870
Incorrect password.

1595
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:10,700
What? This guy doesn't like Reiko Shimizu?

1596
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:16,150
Incorrect password. Entry of another incorrect password
will result in immediate system shutdown.

1597
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:19,450
Who is it? The one Itou loves...

1598
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:20,580
Who is it...

1599
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:31,400
And you always tried to show off when we talked.

1600
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,960
But, because Nishio shot that guard,

1601
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:37,680
my perfect plan was ruined.

1602
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:38,910
I got it.

1603
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,410
What are you typing, Kudo?

1604
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,800
The time limit has been disabled.

1605
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:06,230
It's over.

1606
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,950
Yeah, it's over now.

1607
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,240
Good job, Shinichi.

1608
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:18,510
Although the time limit has been disabled,
I don't know how to deal with the sensors yet.

1609
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,080
So make sure to collect all of them, Professor.

1610
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Okay, I'll do it right now.

1611
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,080
Kudo, and Hattori.

1612
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:33,020
You two are the best detectives.

1613
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:38,040
You're the worst.

1614
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,500
Hey, are you all right?

1615
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:49,820
Here, take off your IDs and put them in here.

1616
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,300
Huh? Do I have to take it off?

1617
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,510
It's already closing time.

1618
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:56,160
Too bad...

1619
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,600
Handkerchief... Handkerchief...

1620
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,120
I thought I lost mine.

1621
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:04,690
What's this?

1622
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:07,030
Looks like paint.

1623
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,860
Where did it come from?

1624
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,560
Come on, I'll take it back.

1625
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:11,690
Oh, well...

1626
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:17,130
We apologize for the inconvenience. The Super Snake is now reopened.

1627
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,170
Even though it's already past closing time,
we'll run the ride one last time.

1628
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,760
Great!

1629
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:29,730
Are you okay, Hattori?

1630
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,680
Don't worry. Just a scratch.

1631
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:37,420
But then again, how did he know you were Shinichi Kudo?

1632
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,160
Because of this.

1633
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,140
This is... your fingerprint?

1634
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:43,400
Do you remember the chairs in that room?

1635
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:47,570
Ah, because they don't match the the room, I remember it very well.

1636
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,770
I was impressed by the arm rests of the chairs.

1637
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:56,480
I guess there were fingerprint recognition systems on the arm rests.

1638
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,830
This fingerprint belongs to Shinichi Kudo.

1639
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,790
Since the client are blind,

1640
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:07,750
It was natural that he thought I was Shinichi Kudo.

1641
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,400
So that's how it is.

1642
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:14,180
Oh no! it's past 10:00!

1643
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:15,540
It's past 10:00! It's going to explode!

1644
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:18,260
You can take it off now. Your ID belt.

1645
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,440
I mean this one.

1646
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:28,030
Oh, it's true! Great!

1647
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:30,010
I'll take it back.

1648
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:32,020
Hey, wait!

1649
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:36,020
He's really...

1650
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,880
Anyway, after those things were took off,
this case is finally closed, huh?

1651
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:41,840
Anyway, put me down first.

1652
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:44,430
Don't push yourself too hard. You can't walk well yet.

1653
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:52,310
That's right... the best medicine
for this kid is to ride on this girl's back.

1654
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,220
Don't make fun of me.

1655
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:55,660
Childish.

1656
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:59,320
Inspector, the IDs have all been collected.

1657
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,820
I've counted the number.

1658
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:04,720
Send them to the Identification Division without anyone noticing.

1659
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:05,710
Yes, sir.

1660
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:11,340
All right! No matter it's the Super Snake
or anything else, let's ride on!

1661
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:13,060
Hold on tight.

1662
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:21,340
Lucky! We got it all to ourselves!

1663
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:26,610
Don't let this scare the crap our of you.

1664
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,460
Idiot, I won't be scared.

1665
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:36,580
Everyone! Hands up!

1666
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:39,540
Everyone is too excited, huh?

1667
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:41,840
If you are scared, you don't have to put your hands up.

1668
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:43,210
Who is scared?

1669
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,970
I'm telling you, I could raise my hands very, very high....

1670
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,240
This kid stuff...

1671
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,340
That's too funny, Heiji.

1672
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,080
Hey! You guys!

1673
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:00,270
Genta! Take it off! Genta!

1674
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:06,880
What are you doing? Take it off!
We'll be outside the area limit when it goes out over the sea!

1675
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,730
Genta!

1676
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,880
Hey, what are you doing?

1677
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,440
Don't move, or you'll die.

1678
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:13,970
Yes...

1679
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,180
Kudo!

1680
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:33,880
Back there!

1681
01:44:39,330 --> 01:44:39,930
That's terrible!

1682
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:52,220
Hurry!

1683
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:57,140
No! Stop him!

1684
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,670
You can't do that. The bars are all linked together.

1685
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:01,650
If one is broken...

1686
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,690
all of the bars will be affected.

1687
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,090
Wow, great!

1688
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,830
They even had fireworks.

1689
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,420
It must be an extra service.

1690
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,410
Somehow, I didn't feel happy at all.

1691
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,710
Why is that guy here?

1692
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:45,650
He's been with us since the investigation started, right?

1693
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:46,640
Huh?

1694
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:53,810
What the hell!

1695
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:55,510
Geez, that Ryu...

1696
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:58,750
I never thought he would play dead for money.

1697
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:01,340
He must have been lying

1698
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:04,850
about the other two detectives he mentioned at that time.

1699
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:09,130
Did he really need money that much?

1700
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:10,770
How spineless.

1701
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,610
Yeah, this is Mouri Detective Agency.

1702
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:21,240
What? You want me to play in a TV ad?

1703
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,570
What kind of TV ad?

1704
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:27,580
What? For sleeping pills?

1705
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:30,070
It's gonna be easy because I'm always sleeping?

1706
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:31,150
Are you kidding me?

1707
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,030
Who do you think I am?

1708
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:34,950
I know it's hard to find a good actor like me, but...

1709
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:36,690
What?

1710
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:37,960
That much?

1711
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:41,810
Yeah! Please let me do it!

1712
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:44,030
Yes, yes!

1713
01:50:44,090 --> 01:50:44,930
As expected...

1714
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:47,130
He really lives up to his name, Sleeping Kogoro.

1715
01:50:48,230 --> 01:50:49,250
My pleasure!
