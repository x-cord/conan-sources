1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,940
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,740
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,140
A red trace is left behind at the site of the crime.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,640
A case that goes according to a novel.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
The mystery of the invisible culprit!

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,940
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,862
"Beika Station"

10
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,362
"Yasutaro Sasamoto (32), Office Worker"

11
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,562
What is that?

12
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,662
Don't tell me that he was...

13
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:15,962
Shadow?

14
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,262
Hikage.

15
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,362
"Toshiyuki Kamio"

16
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,862
"Shadow"

17
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,162
Yes, this is Kamio.

18
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:32,462
This is Sasamoto. Are you sleeping?

19
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:35,162
I had to keep a writer company

20
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,162
and I came home in the wee hours of the morning.

21
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:38,162
What's up?

22
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,162
Hikage... Hikage appeared!

23
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,462
He attacked you?

24
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,362
Just now, on my way to the station.

25
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,062
I'll be right over so stay there.

26
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,762
If I grab a cab, I can be there in 30 minutes.

27
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,062
Do that, will you?

28
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,762
"Toshiyuki Kamio (32), Editor" -Kamio!

29
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,362
"Toshiyuki Kamio (32), Editor"

30
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,662
"Shadow" -No doubt about it.

31
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:05,762
It's just as you said, after all.

32
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,562
Let's report this to the police.

33
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,262
Kamio!

34
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,562
But I wonder if they'll believe us, though?

35
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:13,562
But, we don't have a choice.

36
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:17,062
Right! Let's hire a detective for now.

37
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:19,362
You were almost killed?

38
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:22,562
Please, protect us!

39
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:24,162
We know who the culprit is.

40
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,162
He's Teiichi Hikage, a member of the mystery research club

41
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,362
that we belonged to in our university days.

42
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,662
Why do you say that he's the culprit?

43
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:36,762
About six months ago, I got a manuscript from Hikage.

44
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:37,862
A manuscript?

45
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,362
Of a novel.

46
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:40,762
A novel that predicted friends of the past

47
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,562
would be killed one after the other.

48
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:45,462
A novel predicting murder.

49
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,962
A novel predicting murder?

50
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:55,062
"So, Disappear Everybody"

51
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,762
You would've been in big trouble if it hit you.

52
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:01,962
Unmistakably dead.

53
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:05,262
Just one word "Shadow" written in red paint...

54
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,662
How distasteful.

55
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:09,962
Hikage was always that way since our university days.

56
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:12,662
Although he used to type his novels,

57
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:15,962
the cover of his novels were always written in revolting red characters.

58
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:18,762
Sunglasses and long hair.

59
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:21,162
It's unmistakably Hikage.

60
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,362
So, you received the novel in question

61
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,962
from Mr. Hikage six months ago?

62
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:30,862
There were several members in the mystery research club,

63
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,862
but four of us in particular were passionately active members.

64
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,062
Sasamoto, myself,

65
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,862
Takeshi Nezu,

66
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,062
and Hikage.

67
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:42,662
But, we had practically no opportunity to see each other

68
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:44,562
since we graduated.

69
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,262
However, coincidentally six months ago, that manuscript

70
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:51,562
was delivered to the mystery magazine editing section that I work at.

71
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:55,462
Unfortunately, his novel, "So, Disappear Everybody",

72
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,662
it was not a work that could be called a mystery.

73
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:00,362
It had no tricks or mysteries.

74
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:02,562
It was just a story of revenge that pointed out that

75
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:05,962
the main character would kill three of his university friends

76
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:07,562
because of a grudge he had against them.

77
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:11,862
Even harder to understand

78
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:15,062
were the names of the three who are predicted to be killed.

79
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:19,362
Takeshi Nezu, Toshiyuki Kamio, and Yasutaro Sasamoto.

80
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,062
In other words, those are our names.

81
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:25,062
The meaning of the queer novel was finally clarified

82
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:26,362
the day before yesterday.

83
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:27,962
The day before yesterday?

84
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,162
The night before yesterday, the dead body of a man

85
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,062
who had been stabbed in the back with a knife

86
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,662
was found in Beika Park.

87
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:39,562
The man who was killed was a former member of our club, Takeshi Nezu.

88
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:43,662
And, also written in the novel that was sent by Hikage to me

89
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:46,662
Takeshi Nezu dies, stabbed in the back from behind

90
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,662
in a park at night.

91
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:51,462
Please let me read that novel!

92
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,562
I see.

93
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,162
The method of murder is also the same.

94
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:00,562
I guess this is no coincidence.

95
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:02,262
It's not a coincidence for sure.

96
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,762
This novel is indeed a prediction of murder.

97
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,762
But something's not right.

98
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:11,262
Although the details of the way Mr. Nezu will be killed is written,

99
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,962
when it comes to the way and place

100
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,962
Mr. Sasamoto and Mr. Kamio will be killed,

101
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:17,662
there is no detailed description.

102
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:19,862
Oh. That's right.

103
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,862
That's why it's so eerie.

104
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,762
We have no idea when and how he's going to attack us.

105
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,662
It says that his motive for revenge

106
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:29,662
is because the novel he wrote in the past

107
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:33,862
was severely criticized by all three of you?

108
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:37,462
It's true that there was a time when we did. Right?

109
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,362
There was, but...

110
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:42,362
But such a setting is impossible in this day and age.

111
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:44,862
Even the trick is sort of old fashioned.

112
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,062
Your writing style is... you know.

113
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:49,762
It's too emotional and exaggerated.

114
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:53,062
It's basically lacking reality.

115
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,562
But, it goes for all of us!

116
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:59,362
There was a time when Hikage really razzed Kamio's work too.

117
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:02,362
What's interesting about this story, Kamio?

118
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,562
I think it's pretty good.

119
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:07,262
Why don't you crack your head in two and wash your brains out?

120
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:10,162
This story is totally hopeless.

121
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,162
I mean we all said and heard our share and yet...

122
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:15,962
Why would he want to take revenge 10 years after graduation.

123
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:18,862
True. Why now?

124
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,962
Have you seen Mr. Hikage recently?

125
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,662
No, I haven't.

126
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,062
Rather...

127
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,462
I thought he died long ago.

128
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:30,762
Died?

129
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:34,062
Hikage suddenly disappeared three years ago.

130
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,162
He went mountain climbing alone

131
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:38,562
and never came back since.

132
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:42,362
So, we all thought that he had an accident in the mountains and died.

133
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,062
But, he was in fact, alive!

134
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:48,762
So, a man that everybody thought had died three years ago

135
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,862
suddenly began committing murder to take revenge.

136
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,462
Mr. Kamio.

137
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:55,862
There's a parcel here for you.

138
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,462
A parcel?

139
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,562
Did you win an award or something?

140
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,862
I wonder if I submitted and applied for something.

141
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,362
What? Don't tell me that it's...

142
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,562
Wait! Don't open!

143
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:22,262
Well, that was close.

144
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,962
It could've been worse if there was more gun powder inside.

145
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,962
He probably miscalculated the amount.

146
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:29,862
He miscalculated the amount of gun powder?

147
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:32,862
Was it a mistake or was it...

148
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:36,262
I guess it's safe to conclude that Teiichi Hikage did this.

149
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:39,262
This was enclosed inside the parcel with the explosive.

150
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:40,762
"Shadow"

151
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,662
It's Hikage after all.

152
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:45,762
As a matter of fact, although it hasn't been publicized,

153
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:48,362
"Shadow" -beneath the dead body of Mr. Takeshi Nezu...

154
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,962
I think that it'd be better if you keep yourself hidden here

155
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:56,062
at the hospital for a while, Mr. Kamio.

156
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,362
I'll keep guard over you.

157
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:02,062
I've already got approval from the editor

158
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,662
so you can work while staying here.

159
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:05,862
Oh.

160
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:11,162
Since you're a salesman, you can't be confined to a place.

161
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:14,062
We'll guard you, both Mr. Mouri and I together.

162
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,662
Please do, thank you.

163
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:17,362
And, as for you...

164
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:19,762
-I'll... -Go home immediately!

165
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,462
I thought you'd say that.

166
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,362
I'll be counting on you, then.

167
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:29,062
Goodbye.

168
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:30,562
As for the whereabouts of Mr. Teiichi Hikage,

169
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:32,662
the officers have split up to search for him.

170
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:35,962
I hope you get to find where he's hiding.

171
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,162
If I stay and keep tight watch over him...

172
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:45,662
Granny!

173
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,262
It hurts.

174
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:48,762
Are you all right?

175
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,462
My hips.

176
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,762
Look out!

177
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,662
Hold it!

178
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:01,262
It's Hi... Hikage.

179
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:02,462
Hikage!

180
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:03,562
Don't worry!

181
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,662
As long as I'm here with you, I won't let him kill you!

182
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,662
After the explosive, comes the car.

183
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:12,862
What's with this guy?

184
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,662
Just as I thought.

185
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:26,662
That car came charging but braked once along the way.

186
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,662
Something's not right.

187
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,062
The parcel with the explosives inside

188
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,162
lacked the correct amount of explosive.

189
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:35,562
It looks to be just plain threat.

190
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:39,162
But, the first man Mr. Takeshi Nezu was killed.

191
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,962
What is the difference that the killer is feeling

192
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,062
towards Mr. Nezu, Mr. Kamio and Mr. Sasamoto?

193
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:47,362
Why this inconsistency in the crime?

194
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:49,962
Good morning!

195
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:52,962
Oh, good morning.

196
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,862
I'm counting on you today, too.

197
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,262
Unfortunately, we lost track of the car yesterday,

198
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,762
but if he appears again, we'll arrest him for sure.

199
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:02,462
Oh, excuse me.

200
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,862
Who is it?

201
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:06,862
Yes?

202
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:09,462
Long time no see, it's me.

203
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,762
Hikage?

204
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:12,962
I'm not getting anywhere with you being guarded

205
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,962
by a detectives and police detectives

206
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,062
so I'm going to pull away for a while.

207
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:18,862
He's going to pull out?

208
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,862
But, it's not that I'm giving up.

209
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,862
I'll get to you one day when I get the chance.

210
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,262
Why, Hikage? Hikage?

211
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:28,462
Excuse me.

212
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:30,762
Mr. Kamio.

213
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,762
Hikage called and...

214
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,762
I got a call from him too just now.

215
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,662
It seems he's given up.

216
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,062
So, I'm relieved.

217
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:40,662
But, we can't just drop the case as is.

218
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,062
Of course not.

219
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:44,862
Teiichi Hikage has committed murder.

220
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:46,562
We've got to arrest him no matter what.

221
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,462
Oh, yes, this is Takagi.

222
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,462
Yes.

223
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,162
Is that right?

224
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:58,462
Okay, thanks.

225
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,262
What is it?

226
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,462
They can't find the whereabouts of Teiichi Hikage.

227
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,962
Since his disappearance three years ago,

228
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:07,262
nobody has had contact with him.

229
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,162
Darn it!

230
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,862
He should've written where he'd be hiding

231
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,162
while he was at it writing this stuff!

232
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:16,062
If his motive dates back to a grudge in the past,

233
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:19,862
there could be a clue in the novels he wrote in his university days.

234
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:22,162
Novels during our university days.

235
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,662
Do you have any?

236
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,662
I have some magazines issued by Mystery Investigation Club in my room.

237
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,762
Hikage's novels are printed in them too.

238
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,562
How is it? Anything there?

239
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:37,162
There seems to be no clue.

240
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,762
None here, either.

241
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,462
This style of writing, if I remember correctly...

242
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:48,562
Just as I thought!

243
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:52,762
But if so, why?

244
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:54,062
Why?

245
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:59,262
Why did he do something like this?

246
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,709
We struck at air, I guess.

247
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,909
He may be waiting for a chance to attack

248
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,009
after throwing us off guard by declaring to pull out for a while.

249
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,609
We've got to hurry and find Teiichi Hikage.

250
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,009
I have an appointment to see a writer today.

251
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,709
Okay. I'll accompany you.

252
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,209
Hey, Officer Takagi.

253
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,809
Conan?

254
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,409
What kind of a person was Mr. Takeshi Nezu, who was killed?

255
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,609
What?

256
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,409
I hate to say this,

257
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,609
but he didn't have a very good reputation.

258
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,309
They are people who say that they lent him money

259
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,409
but he never returned it.

260
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:38,609
Money?

261
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,009
You mean, Nezu to me?

262
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,909
Yes, did he say something about money to you?

263
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,209
Come to think of it,

264
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,809
he did mention he had money, he could count on to be coming in.

265
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,809
Although I can't be too sure about that.

266
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,309
He mentioned something about an incident

267
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,109
that occurred three years ago being involved.

268
00:13:58,109 --> 00:13:59,609
Incident three years ago?

269
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,709
Is it about Mr. Hikage's disappearance?

270
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,109
Mr. Hikage was more down to earth than he looked.

271
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,709
He kept saying that he would become a professional writer

272
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:10,509
and continued to write day after day.

273
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,709
But, I guess it didn't work out the way he planned after all.

274
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,209
It didn't work out?

275
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,709
I think it was two or three days before he disappeared.

276
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,609
He was burning the novels he had written

277
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,009
in the open lot behind here.

278
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,509
He did so crying in front of his friend.

279
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:23,809
Friend?

280
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:28,109
Do you see that person in this picture?

281
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:30,709
Oh!

282
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,509
Him!

283
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,409
No good? You mean this masterpiece?

284
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,909
He told me so.

285
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,609
That it's totally hopeless.

286
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,809
I wonder what I worked so hard for all these seven years.

287
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,909
And, it was right afterwards that he disappeared, right?

288
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,209
So, I figured that

289
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,609
maybe he lost hope and committed suicide in the mountains.

290
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:56,609
So, that's the story.

291
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,109
What? I called all of you?

292
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,709
Yeah. You said that the mystery has been solved.

293
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,609
Solve or not solve,

294
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,909
as to the case this time, don't have the slightest idea.

295
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,609
Mr. Mouri? Did it start?

296
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,209
Sleeping Kogoro.

297
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,309
Grudge held back in the university days.

298
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:24,209
Behind the case this time, this is what is involved.

299
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,609
I mean all know that already, don't we?

300
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:31,109
Mr. Teiichi Hikage himself says so in his novel.

301
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:35,009
Mr. Hikage is not involved in the case this time.

302
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,809
-Pardon? -Not involved?

303
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,009
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

304
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,809
It seems that Mr. Hikage was seriously continuing

305
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,309
to write novels in hopes of becoming a professional writer

306
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,309
even after graduating from university.

307
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,209
I know that.

308
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,309
But, he was troubled by not being able to write something

309
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,009
he felt confident of.

310
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,909
However, three years ago, Mr. Hikage finally completed

311
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,109
a novel he was confident of a masterpiece.

312
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:04,009
He took this novel

313
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,409
to a friend who once belonged in the same club,

314
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:07,709
and one who is presently working

315
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,409
in the editing section of a mystery magazine, Mr. Kamio.

316
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,609
He brought it to you, didn't he, Mr. Kamio?

317
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,709
Is that true, Kamio?

318
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,709
You've got the talent to pick out good stories,

319
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:23,109
so you figured out right away that his story was a masterpiece.

320
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,909
However, you...

321
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,809
What do you think, Kamio?

322
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:30,509
It's totally hopeless.

323
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,009
You probably did so

324
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,609
to take revenge on him for rejecting your novel

325
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:40,409
that you were confident of in your university days.

326
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:45,209
Mr. Hikage took your words for fact and lost all hope.

327
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:46,909
As a result, he ended up taking his own life.

328
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,409
It can't be.

329
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,009
Mr. Kamio as well my life is being sought after by Hikage right now,

330
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,409
so how can that be? Right?

331
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,609
-Yeah. -When Mr. Hikage disappeared,

332
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,909
I'm sure Mr. Kamio understood that.

333
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:05,009
He may have driven Mr. Hikage to his death by his remark.

334
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:08,709
I'm sure Mr. Kamio suffered for three years regretting what he had done.

335
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,209
And moreover, tried to forget the whole thing.

336
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,009
But, half a month ago,

337
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,009
one of the members of the club in the past,

338
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,709
Mr. Takeshi Nezu appeared before you,

339
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,709
and started blackmailing you.

340
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,809
You drove Hikage to his death three years ago, didn't you?

341
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,909
I guess I hit the bull's eye.

342
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:30,509
I read that novel which Hikage wrote.

343
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,709
The thing is, I sort of need some money, you see.

344
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:41,009
I figure money was not much of a problem to you.

345
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,009
You just couldn't bear the fact that someone knew about

346
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,209
the bitter past that you wanted to forget.

347
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:50,109
You wanted to erase Mr. Nezu from this world.

348
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:51,909
But, if you killed him just like that,

349
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:55,009
you figured that you'd be suspected.

350
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,709
Therefore, you decided to make it look like

351
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,409
the doings of Mr. Teiichi Hikage, a person who didn't exist.

352
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,909
You thought up a motive for the murder,

353
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:04,809
which was a grudge that he held against everyone

354
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,709
for criticizing his work during university days.

355
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:12,209
But, Mr. Nezu wasn't the only one who criticized his work.

356
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,609
If it's a grudge revenge, it would be strange

357
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:17,209
if Mr. Sasamoto and yourself as well is not a target.

358
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:20,109
In order to make people believe that

359
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,909
Hikage was trying to exact his revenge,

360
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:27,109
you wrote "So, Disappear Everybody."

361
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,809
You wrote it?

362
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,809
Then, just as you had written,

363
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,509
you stabbed Mr. Nezu in the park at night.

364
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,609
Next, you disguised yourself as Mr. Hikage

365
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,709
and attacked Mr. Sasamoto.

366
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,309
Hikage appeared!

367
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:44,109
I'll be right over so stay there.

368
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:46,309
If I grab a cab, I can be there in 30 minutes.

369
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,309
You answered as if you took the call at your residence,

370
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,109
and got there 30 minutes later

371
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,709
pretending to have arrived there from your home.

372
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:56,909
You went on to make it look as if you, yourself

373
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:59,709
was also being attacked by Mr. Hikage.

374
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:03,409
You waited for an opportunity to sneak out of your hospital room.

375
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,909
You disguised yourself as Mr. Hikage

376
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,509
and attacked Mr. Sasamoto with a car.

377
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,309
Then, you lowered the curtains to your show

378
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,609
-by using Mr. Hikage's tone of voice. -Hikage?

379
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,609
This line of thinking fits everything in place.

380
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:19,009
It even explains the inconsistency in the culprit's actions.

381
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,209
The only person you wanted to kill

382
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:24,509
to begin with was Mr. Nezu.

383
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,409
Isn't that right, Mr. Kamio?

384
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:28,709
No way.

385
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,509
It's all deduction, Mr. Mouri.

386
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,209
You have no evidence whatsoever.

387
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:38,009
Mr. Sasamoto fortunately remembered.

388
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,809
The name of the company of the cab that you rode yesterday.

389
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,909
The driver remembered you and told us that

390
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,109
there was a queer man who flagged him down near the site of the crime,

391
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,409
but got off after riding only a several hundred meters.

392
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,809
That's only the testimony of an eye-witness.

393
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,109
It's possible that this man was someone who resembled you a lot.

394
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:58,209
But, that's not all.

395
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,209
Oh, this man!

396
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,409
Of all things, give me a break.

397
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,409
It just wouldn't come off, this thing.

398
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,909
When you got rid of the red paint,

399
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,409
you used some paint happened to stick to the back sole of your shoes.

400
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,009
Mr. Kamio, could you let us take a look

401
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,909
at the sole of your shoes?

402
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,509
Kamio.

403
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,809
When and how did you figure out

404
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,109
that I was the one who did it, Mr. Mouri?

405
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:27,909
That novel.

406
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,109
"So, Disappear Everybody"

407
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:35,609
From the time I realized that you, not Mr. Teiichi Hikage

408
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,609
wrote that novel.

409
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:40,609
The style. The writing style.

410
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,209
Style of writing?

411
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:46,809
The writing style of that novel is obviously different from the one

412
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,909
that Mr. Hikage had written in the past.

413
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:55,809
Mr. Hikage's novel had a lot of marks that expressed emotion.

414
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:00,409
But, there was nothing like that in the novel you showed us.

415
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,909
You didn't even use the dotted lines to describe the spaces in between,

416
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:05,109
and you wrote everything using just plain underlines.

417
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,109
An extremely restrained way of writing.

418
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:13,709
Yes, very much like that novels that you used to write in the past.

419
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,909
Habits of writing style are not easy to revise

420
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,709
no matter how many years go by.

421
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,809
Writers in particular, tend to stick and have a special feeling

422
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,409
towards their writing style.

423
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,109
You have no way out, Mr. Kamio, from something that

424
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,709
you had harboured inside for a long period of time.

425
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,009
Kamio.

426
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,809
Harbored for a long period of time?

427
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:20,609
I'm going to wash my face.

428
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,809
Prediction of murder! Right here!

429
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:33,809
A red "shadow"! It's written right here!

430
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,409
See, right here.

431
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:36,909
Help me, Conan!

432
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,409
Call the police, will you?

433
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:44,009
I think that's a trace of you drooling.

434
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,409
Shoots! It's no fun.

435
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,809
We come all this way, and they're not going to be shooting the film?

436
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,109
Oh, it's started?

437
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,309
The seatbelt is unfastened.

438
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:10,909
Maybe... this is?

439
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:16,909
Next Conan, "Extreme Car Stunt"

440
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:20,294
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,994
"Two cars"

442
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,194
This time next week, we will bring to you Masked Yaiba.

443
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:26,840
-Hey, come off it, no way. -Oh, I guess not after all?
