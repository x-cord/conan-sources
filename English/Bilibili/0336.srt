1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.440
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.540
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.540
A soundless murder within the dark.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540
A clean deduction of a messed up crime site.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:52.968
We all head over together with mom to the Tohto Processing Station

9
00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:55.768
to watch the preview of the new movie, "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II".

10
00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:00.468
However, it ends up that the preview that was scheduled

11
00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:02.368
could only be shown late at night, so we had to wait.

12
00:02:03.668 --> 00:02:06.268
Mom goes back to the U.S.

13
00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:09.968
while we all go over to Mr. Akira Hojima's condo to take a nap.

14
00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:27.068
"Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 2)"

15
00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:31.968
The victim is Mr. Norihiro Furumura, age 39.

16
00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.368
He seems to have been employed at the Tohto Processing Station

17
00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:35.868
located opposite this condo.

18
00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:39.668
One stab through the chest with a knife.

19
00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:41.968
He seems to have been stabbed from over the blanket

20
00:02:41.968 --> 00:02:44.568
in order to avoid blood splattering onto the killer.

21
00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:46.368
No.

22
00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:49.868
They all just happened to come to take a short nap at my place.

23
00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.268
We were planning to play all night mahjong

24
00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:54.668
after the movie was completed tonight.

25
00:02:54.668 --> 00:02:56.468
Movie?

26
00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:57.768
Yes.

27
00:02:57.768 --> 00:03:00.768
The preview showing of that movie was extended to around 11 pm,

28
00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:03.168
so we all decided to take a short nap together,

29
00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:04.368
including those children.

30
00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:07.668
I see.

31
00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:10.868
So, where were you all sleeping?

32
00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:12.768
That room.

33
00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:15.768
All five of us lined up sideways and slept on that bed.

34
00:03:15.768 --> 00:03:19.668
Then, we heard a man shout.

35
00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.668
When we opened the door and turned on the light,

36
00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.268
this is what we saw.

37
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.068
I see.

38
00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:29.068
But it's strange.

39
00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:30.568
What's strange?

40
00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:34.168
We didn't hear the murderer at all.

41
00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:38.568
-That's because you were sleeping... -No.

42
00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.768
But it's after Mr. Furumura was killed.

43
00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:41.768
It's only natural that

44
00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:44.568
we'd at least hear the sound of somebody leaving the room.

45
00:03:45.768 --> 00:03:49.968
The killer probably tiptoed out.

46
00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:53.168
Well, I think it's almost impossible

47
00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:55.868
to run away in such a short time from this dark, messy room

48
00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:58.268
without making a sound.

49
00:03:58.268 --> 00:04:00.568
Which means that the killer

50
00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:02.368
is the person who was sleeping next to the sofa

51
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:03.368
that the victim was sleeping on...

52
00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.068
Mr. Hojima.

53
00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:06.268
No way!

54
00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:09.368
There were no signs of the door being forced open either.

55
00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:10.968
Wait!

56
00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:14.368
People other than me have the spare key to this room.

57
00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:17.068
People who work at the same processing station as I,

58
00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:19.368
like Mr. Karata and Mr. Negami.

59
00:04:20.368 --> 00:04:23.268
What? Furumura was?

60
00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:24.668
By who?

61
00:04:24.668 --> 00:04:28.268
We'll soon find out after you all tell us about yourselves.

62
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.468
Will you please tell us

63
00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:31.268
what you were doing and where you were

64
00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:33.468
at the time of the murder around 10:55 pm?

65
00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:36.768
At that time, since I was almost done with timing,

66
00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:39.468
I left the rest of the work with another worker

67
00:04:39.468 --> 00:04:41.468
and went to take a rest at the nap room.

68
00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:43.368
Timing?

69
00:04:43.368 --> 00:04:46.168
It involves adjusting the color for movies and dramas.

70
00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:48.468
Can anyone verify that for you?

71
00:04:48.468 --> 00:04:51.868
There were two to three other people there,

72
00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:53.968
but they were all asleep.

73
00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:56.068
And you?

74
00:04:56.068 --> 00:05:02.568
I was alone in the dark room checking the film.

75
00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:06.568
So, you both don't have an alibi?

76
00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:07.868
No.

77
00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:10.868
And? Will you explain why you had a spare key?

78
00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:13.768
So that I could play mahjong right away.

79
00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:16.468
The ones who finished work first would come here

80
00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:18.968
and get the game set up and all.

81
00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:23.368
But maybe we weren't the only ones who had the spare key.

82
00:05:23.368 --> 00:05:27.068
He seemed to have other people he played mahjong with, too.

83
00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:30.268
But the only people I gave my spare key to are those two

84
00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:32.768
and Mr. Furumura.

85
00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:35.368
But if you used to come here

86
00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:38.068
and knew where everything was...

87
00:05:38.968 --> 00:05:43.068
It could be possible to move around easily even in the dark.

88
00:05:43.068 --> 00:05:44.968
But...

89
00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:50.268
Conan?

90
00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:53.568
See! This room is really pitch dark.

91
00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:58.868
Hey, stop that! Don't interfere with the officers!

92
00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:00.568
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.868
But Conan's right.

94
00:06:03.868 --> 00:06:05.268
Right.

95
00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:07.568
If it's that dark, no matter how used to you are to this place,

96
00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.868
you're bound to bump into something.

97
00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:14.168
Inspector, may I have a moment with you?

98
00:06:14.168 --> 00:06:17.568
The 3rd button of the corpse's shirt has been yanked off.

99
00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:21.568
It seems as if the victim has struggled with the killer

100
00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:24.568
before he was stabbed.

101
00:06:24.568 --> 00:06:27.668
His shirt sure is dirty though.

102
00:06:27.668 --> 00:06:29.968
His collar is soiled black.

103
00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:31.668
Mr. Furumura used to hate bathing

104
00:06:31.668 --> 00:06:33.868
and used to take baths only once a week or so.

105
00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:37.568
Come to think of it, when we played 3 days ago,

106
00:06:37.568 --> 00:06:39.268
he was wearing this shirt, too.

107
00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:41.668
Which means he hasn't changed since then.

108
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:44.468
I could never do something like this.

109
00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:46.768
I could never struggle with him,

110
00:06:46.768 --> 00:06:49.968
yank off his button or stab him in a pitch dark place like this!

111
00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:53.668
But if you were the only one awake at that time,

112
00:06:53.668 --> 00:06:55.068
you could've confirmed the position of the victim

113
00:06:55.068 --> 00:06:56.968
with a flashlight or something

114
00:06:56.968 --> 00:06:59.468
and approached him, couldn't you?

115
00:07:00.568 --> 00:07:04.868
And besides, the children haven't heard the killer running away.

116
00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:09.068
Or, did you hear the killer making any sound?

117
00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:12.068
No. I was surprised at hearing Mr. Furumura's voice

118
00:07:12.068 --> 00:07:13.968
that I noticed nothing else.

119
00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.268
What's that?

120
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.968
Inspector! There's a video camera on the floor.

121
00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:23.368
What's with this video camera?

122
00:07:23.368 --> 00:07:27.268
This is the video diary that Furumura used to take every day.

123
00:07:27.268 --> 00:07:30.268
Don't tell me the video was kept running all this time.

124
00:07:30.268 --> 00:07:33.568
Okay. Connect it to the TV right away and play it.

125
00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:35.568
There may be something it in

126
00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:37.068
that would give us a clue to the murder.

127
00:07:37.068 --> 00:07:38.268
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:42.968
Good work all day today!

129
00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:45.968
I'm going to give my best shot playing all-night mahjong tonight.

130
00:07:45.968 --> 00:07:48.768
I'll report the result later.

131
00:07:50.268 --> 00:07:53.168
It's been switched off once here.

132
00:07:55.968 --> 00:07:57.968
It switched back on again.

133
00:07:57.968 --> 00:07:59.968
But it's pitch black and you can't see a thing.

134
00:08:02.068 --> 00:08:04.368
-Inspector! -Yeah.

135
00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:06.068
Hey, Mr, Furumura!

136
00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:08.068
What's the matter? Mr. Furumura!

137
00:08:08.068 --> 00:08:10.168
This is my voice!

138
00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:13.768
That's the sound I made when I opened the bedroom door.

139
00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:16.168
Mr. Furumura!

140
00:08:16.168 --> 00:08:18.668
This is where this boy turned on the light.

141
00:08:19.768 --> 00:08:23.768
But why did the video camera switch back on again?

142
00:08:23.768 --> 00:08:26.268
The impact of the video camera falling to the floor

143
00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:27.468
when he struggled with the killer

144
00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:29.668
probably set it back on again.

145
00:08:31.068 --> 00:08:33.468
The problem here though, is the sound.

146
00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:35.068
Until the victim shouts,

147
00:08:35.068 --> 00:08:39.268
Conan opens the door and Ayumi screams,

148
00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:43.768
there is no sound other than your voice, Mr. Hojima.

149
00:08:43.768 --> 00:08:45.768
Which means that...

150
00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:47.868
No way!

151
00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:49.068
If I was planning to do something like this,

152
00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:50.868
I wouldn't have brought these children here to take a nap!

153
00:08:50.868 --> 00:08:54.268
Besides, I have no reason to want to kill Mr. Furumura.

154
00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:56.668
You do.

155
00:08:56.668 --> 00:08:59.868
You had a grudge on him for spoiling your precious movie.

156
00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:03.268
Oh, the last episode of the series, "Doting Parents' Diary".

157
00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:06.568
The same goes for you, right, Mr. Negami?

158
00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:10.068
You were really angry too, weren't you, Mr. Karata?

159
00:09:10.068 --> 00:09:11.868
Well, it's true, but...

160
00:09:11.868 --> 00:09:14.468
What do you mean? He spoiled your movie?

161
00:09:14.468 --> 00:09:17.168
Well, when he was checking the film,

162
00:09:17.168 --> 00:09:19.068
Furumura overlooked a scratch,

163
00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:23.368
developed it the way it was and cut the film.

164
00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:26.468
Because of it, we suffered a great loss.

165
00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:29.268
We had to pay for all the retake of the scenes

166
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.768
that were no good after being cut.

167
00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:34.268
But film checking is done in the dark room

168
00:09:34.268 --> 00:09:36.268
and is tough work that is done virtually

169
00:09:36.268 --> 00:09:38.168
by the sense of touch of the fingertips, so...

170
00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:40.868
It was work that was too hard on him to begin

171
00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:43.968
because he used to play mahjong till early morning almost every day.

172
00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:46.868
Checking the film in the dark room...

173
00:09:46.868 --> 00:09:48.768
Mr. Negami. Don't you do that, too?

174
00:09:48.768 --> 00:09:52.268
Yes. He used to be a developer before, too.

175
00:09:52.268 --> 00:09:57.368
After that incident, Furumura was switched over to sales.

176
00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:02.168
I don't see why three of you need to hold a grudge against him, though?

177
00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.868
Were your bonuses decreased, too?

178
00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:07.468
That "Doting Parents' Diary" series

179
00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:11.468
was the pride and joy of all of us working here.

180
00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:14.168
It's only natural to hold a grudge against him

181
00:10:14.168 --> 00:10:16.168
for damaging the final episode.

182
00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:19.868
Mr. Furumura alone didn't seem too proud about it, though.

183
00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:22.768
It's not that we held that much a grudge against him.

184
00:10:22.768 --> 00:10:25.168
He was one of the members we played mahjong with, after all.

185
00:10:25.168 --> 00:10:28.468
Most of us have forgotten about it already.

186
00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:33.568
A soundless murder...

187
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:38.168
From that front door to this door...

188
00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:41.168
Even if you were to be able to pass easily with no obstructions...

189
00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:45.668
The toughest part would be this living room.

190
00:10:45.668 --> 00:10:48.268
It's virtually impossible to go through here

191
00:10:48.268 --> 00:10:51.268
in a short time without making a sound.

192
00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:54.268
Then, the killer would have to be

193
00:10:54.268 --> 00:10:57.068
Mr. Hojima, who was here to begin with?

194
00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:04.868
Come to think of it! If I remember correctly...

195
00:11:04.868 --> 00:11:05.968
I'm sure that...

196
00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:07.568
That video camera was also...

197
00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:13.868
I see. That's why he was flustered and did what he did.

198
00:11:15.868 --> 00:11:20.468
If so, the unexplained thing about no noise on the video tape

199
00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:23.368
and the button that was yanked off all fit in.

200
00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:26.768
The killer is probably him.

201
00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:28.568
The only one who could've committed the murder

202
00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:31.768
in this pitch darkness is him.

203
00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:34.368
But I don't have proof.

204
00:11:34.368 --> 00:11:36.568
What now?

205
00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:37.868
What do I do?

206
00:11:39.368 --> 00:11:42.268
What's the matter, Ai?

207
00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.468
You look dreadful.

208
00:11:44.468 --> 00:11:47.968
It's nothing, really.

209
00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:50.068
She says it's nothing.

210
00:11:50.068 --> 00:11:52.168
Really?

211
00:12:09.968 --> 00:12:11.468
Don't tell me that...

212
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.448
So, what we clearly know now is...

213
00:12:23.448 --> 00:12:27.248
Mr. Furumura who was sleeping on the sofa around 11 pm

214
00:12:27.248 --> 00:12:30.248
was stabbed to death by someone in the dark.

215
00:12:30.248 --> 00:12:33.248
If the killer stabbed Mr. Furumura and fled,

216
00:12:33.248 --> 00:12:36.248
he would've most naturally bumped into something and made noise.

217
00:12:36.248 --> 00:12:38.548
But the children who were sleeping in the next room

218
00:12:38.548 --> 00:12:40.248
heard no noise at all.

219
00:12:40.248 --> 00:12:42.448
Moreover, the video camera

220
00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:43.948
which seemed to have fallen to the floor and switched on

221
00:12:43.948 --> 00:12:45.548
when the killer and Mr. Furumura was thought

222
00:12:45.548 --> 00:12:47.348
to have struggled with each other

223
00:12:47.348 --> 00:12:50.348
had no such sound recorded in it.

224
00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:52.248
In other words, the killer is the one

225
00:12:52.248 --> 00:12:54.948
who was sleeping next to the sofa where Mr. Furumura was sleeping,

226
00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:57.148
Mr. Hojima.

227
00:12:57.148 --> 00:13:00.848
You're the only one I can come up with.

228
00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.448
Wait!

229
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.448
Absolutely!

230
00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:05.948
Dr. Agasa?

231
00:13:05.948 --> 00:13:08.448
Doc?

232
00:13:08.448 --> 00:13:12.148
Conan called me to ask me to come pick him up.

233
00:13:13.648 --> 00:13:17.648
I heard about the case on the phone.

234
00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:21.648
No matter how much I think it over, I come up with just one answer!

235
00:13:21.648 --> 00:13:24.948
That there is probably no doubt that Mr. Hojima committed the crime.

236
00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:28.648
An ordinary person wouldn't be able

237
00:13:28.648 --> 00:13:32.348
to move around in the dark without making a sound.

238
00:13:32.348 --> 00:13:34.148
Maybe it'd be a different story

239
00:13:34.148 --> 00:13:36.148
if you were a ninja or a ghost, though.

240
00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:41.048
Dr. Agasa. You think so, too?

241
00:13:41.048 --> 00:13:44.648
But there is just one thing that bothers me.

242
00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:45.648
What?

243
00:13:45.648 --> 00:13:48.948
Remember the third button of Mr. Furumura's shirt that was yanked off

244
00:13:48.948 --> 00:13:51.948
when he struggled with the killer?

245
00:13:51.948 --> 00:13:54.048
It hasn't been found yet, has it?

246
00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:56.948
Now that you mentioned it, no.

247
00:13:56.948 --> 00:14:00.248
Without it, it just doesn't feel good.

248
00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:03.948
It couldn't be that the button had wings and flew off.

249
00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:07.848
It's probably somewhere in this messy room

250
00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:10.848
or the killer still has it on him.

251
00:14:10.848 --> 00:14:13.348
I'd recommend you to do a thorough body check of Mr. Hojima

252
00:14:13.348 --> 00:14:17.748
when you take him for questioning to the station.

253
00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:19.648
Yes, I will.

254
00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:22.248
Mr. Hojima, please come to the station with me.

255
00:14:22.248 --> 00:14:26.048
All right. But I'm not the killer.

256
00:14:26.048 --> 00:14:29.948
Then, Mr. Negami and Mr. Karata, let's go too.

257
00:14:29.948 --> 00:14:31.948
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

258
00:14:31.948 --> 00:14:33.648
Did I do okay?

259
00:14:33.648 --> 00:14:36.248
Yeah, just great.

260
00:14:36.248 --> 00:14:40.248
So, we'll go to the police station for questioning, too.

261
00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:42.548
You all slept once, so you can all stay up, right?

262
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.948
Yes...

263
00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:45.948
Hey, Ai. Let's go!

264
00:14:45.948 --> 00:14:47.648
What? Yes.

265
00:14:47.648 --> 00:14:50.348
But I really wanted to see Yaiba's movie.

266
00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.148
-Very true. -Wait...

267
00:14:52.148 --> 00:14:55.148
Let's all go see it together when it's released.

268
00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:56.448
All right then.

269
00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:45.248
Why?

270
00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:01.148
Just as I thought. It was you after all, Mr. Negami.

271
00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:05.748
Why?

272
00:16:05.748 --> 00:16:08.448
Sound. It was the sound.

273
00:16:08.448 --> 00:16:09.648
Sound?

274
00:16:09.648 --> 00:16:13.348
But the children said they heard no sound,

275
00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.348
the same with the video tape.

276
00:16:15.348 --> 00:16:19.848
Right. It's true that there were no suspicious sounds.

277
00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:22.048
But it was too soundless.

278
00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:25.548
If the video camera dropped to the floor and switched on,

279
00:16:25.548 --> 00:16:26.748
the sound back then of the video camera dropping

280
00:16:26.748 --> 00:16:28.748
or the sound of the struggle should've been recorded.

281
00:16:28.748 --> 00:16:31.348
But since it had no sound,

282
00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:35.848
chances are, the killer deliberately pressed the record button

283
00:16:35.848 --> 00:16:38.848
and put it on the floor.

284
00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:41.448
It could be that the killer was confident of fleeing

285
00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:45.648
from a dark room without making a sound.

286
00:16:45.648 --> 00:16:50.048
And your job as a developer also made me suspect you.

287
00:16:50.048 --> 00:16:51.248
Huh?

288
00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:54.048
You seemed to have mentioned that

289
00:16:54.048 --> 00:16:56.248
working as a developer requires one to check the scratches on the films

290
00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:59.248
only with the sense of touch of the fingertips.

291
00:16:59.248 --> 00:17:01.848
No matter how used to you are to the dark room,

292
00:17:01.848 --> 00:17:05.148
it is impossible to work in a room with no light at all.

293
00:17:05.148 --> 00:17:08.148
That's why I thought you would've had to place some kind of mark

294
00:17:08.148 --> 00:17:12.348
in the room to help you locate things even in the dark.

295
00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:16.048
And walla! I found it as soon as I entered this room.

296
00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:18.848
Among all the things cluttered in this room, on every corner...

297
00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:21.648
I found these black tapes.

298
00:17:21.648 --> 00:17:22.848
What?

299
00:17:22.848 --> 00:17:28.948
This probably is black vinyl tape pasted on over fluorescent tape.

300
00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:32.148
See? There are tapes that have peeled off,

301
00:17:32.148 --> 00:17:35.948
so the fluorescent tape under them are slightly showing.

302
00:17:35.948 --> 00:17:37.948
Unless light is kept at a low level in this way,

303
00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:41.748
the film in the darkroom would probably over expose.

304
00:17:42.948 --> 00:17:45.048
So, an ordinary person can't see right away

305
00:17:45.048 --> 00:17:47.648
when the lights are turned out.

306
00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:49.148
But when their eyes get used to the dark,

307
00:17:49.148 --> 00:17:51.148
they gradually start being able to see.

308
00:17:51.148 --> 00:17:54.448
Using this light as a guide and walking carefully,

309
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:57.048
aware of where everything is located...

310
00:17:58.148 --> 00:18:02.248
It's possible to go through without bumping into anything.

311
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.348
I happened to change the position of some things,

312
00:18:04.348 --> 00:18:06.548
so you seemed to have panicked a bit this time.

313
00:18:06.548 --> 00:18:08.548
That's why when Conan turned off the light,

314
00:18:08.548 --> 00:18:10.848
you turned it right back on, right?

315
00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:12.048
You did so because you didn't want others to get used to the dark

316
00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:14.048
and realize what you had done.

317
00:18:14.048 --> 00:18:17.648
Now that you mentioned it, there is black tape on this video camera, too.

318
00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:21.348
Even if he could tell where the camera was,

319
00:18:21.348 --> 00:18:25.848
would he be able to tell where the chest of a person who is asleep is?

320
00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:27.048
If the body were to move even a bit,

321
00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:28.648
it would be impossible to commit the crime.

322
00:18:28.648 --> 00:18:30.448
The button.

323
00:18:30.448 --> 00:18:33.248
He probably put a bit of fluorescent paint

324
00:18:33.248 --> 00:18:36.248
on Mr. Furumura's 3rd button

325
00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:40.148
to make out where the chest was even in the dark.

326
00:18:40.148 --> 00:18:43.848
In other words, if you can get into the room with the spare key,

327
00:18:43.848 --> 00:18:48.948
you can stab him in the chest even in the dark.

328
00:18:49.948 --> 00:18:52.148
You must've painted the button 3 days ago

329
00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:56.748
when you played mahjong all night and he was fast asleep.

330
00:18:56.748 --> 00:18:59.648
Knowing that he only takes baths once a week,

331
00:18:59.648 --> 00:19:03.148
it's very likely he wouldn't change shirts.

332
00:19:03.148 --> 00:19:05.448
Then, you decided to bring back the button

333
00:19:05.448 --> 00:19:08.848
after peeling off the fluorescent paint from it

334
00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.348
because if someone finds it, the trick would be revealed.

335
00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:13.048
On top of that, since you heard me say

336
00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:16.148
it's strange that the button hasn't been found,

337
00:19:16.148 --> 00:19:20.648
you returned the button after peeling off the fluorescent paint.

338
00:19:20.648 --> 00:19:23.148
After Dr. Agasa explained everything to me,

339
00:19:23.148 --> 00:19:24.548
finished questioning you first of all,

340
00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:26.748
and was waiting here in this room,

341
00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:29.348
but I didn't expect this outcome.

342
00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:35.248
It's amazing how Mr. Furumura who worked as a developer like you,

343
00:19:35.248 --> 00:19:38.048
didn't notice the fluorescent tapes.

344
00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:43.148
Notice what?

345
00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:46.648
These tapes were pasted on by Furumura himself.

346
00:19:46.648 --> 00:19:48.248
What?

347
00:19:48.248 --> 00:19:50.048
He told me that he pasted the tape onto the video camera

348
00:19:50.048 --> 00:19:52.548
so that he could get a hold of it any time in the dark.

349
00:19:52.548 --> 00:19:53.848
He said that he also pasted tape around the room

350
00:19:53.848 --> 00:19:55.748
so that he could find the restroom if he needed to go late at night.

351
00:19:55.748 --> 00:19:59.548
He did it as a prank and didn't let Hojima in on it.

352
00:19:59.548 --> 00:20:02.948
I always knew that he was unreliable, though.

353
00:20:02.948 --> 00:20:05.548
But I just couldn't forgive him for what he did back then.

354
00:20:05.548 --> 00:20:06.748
When he damaged the film

355
00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.348
of the final episode of the series "Doting Parents' Diary",

356
00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:11.048
I just couldn't overlook his mistake!

357
00:20:11.048 --> 00:20:14.848
But you did a retake and the movie was successfully completed, wasn't it?

358
00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:18.948
No good. It wasn't perfect.

359
00:20:18.948 --> 00:20:20.948
Because in the original film,

360
00:20:20.948 --> 00:20:25.048
the younger brother of the star of the show was also acting in it.

361
00:20:25.048 --> 00:20:29.048
But just before the retake, he died in a traffic accident.

362
00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:31.748
So we had no choice but to do without him.

363
00:20:31.748 --> 00:20:37.948
That's why that movie is not perfect or ever will be complete!

364
00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.848
Just because of him!

365
00:20:39.848 --> 00:20:41.348
He's to blame!

366
00:22:12.848 --> 00:22:15.548
Doc, thanks for everything!

367
00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:16.948
Hey, hold it.

368
00:22:16.948 --> 00:22:19.148
Come back here then, will you?

369
00:22:19.148 --> 00:22:20.248
Although it's a bit far,

370
00:22:20.248 --> 00:22:22.648
run over here because it's good for your health.

371
00:22:22.648 --> 00:22:24.148
Conan.

372
00:22:32.148 --> 00:22:33.348
Don't worry.

373
00:22:33.348 --> 00:22:35.448
That cigarette is like a car tooting its horn

374
00:22:35.448 --> 00:22:38.248
waiting for the traffic light to change.

375
00:22:38.248 --> 00:22:40.748
If you don't want them to be aware of our existence,

376
00:22:40.748 --> 00:22:42.548
let's not toot our horns from our side.

377
00:22:42.548 --> 00:22:46.148
The same with the condo they were watching.

378
00:22:46.148 --> 00:22:49.948
From what we saw from that window, he was not smoking a cigarette.

379
00:22:49.948 --> 00:22:52.248
If we saw the lit cigarette he was smoking,

380
00:22:52.248 --> 00:22:55.348
it would be like we were telling him from our side that we are here.

381
00:22:55.348 --> 00:22:58.948
It's the basics of a stake out.

382
00:22:58.948 --> 00:23:02.748
But he just happened to be smoking a cigarette in our view.

383
00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:05.348
It's only proof that he lost track of us.

384
00:23:05.348 --> 00:23:07.348
Since he's still waiting around here,

385
00:23:07.348 --> 00:23:10.648
it means that he probably doesn't have an idea of where we live, right?

386
00:23:10.648 --> 00:23:12.848
I had Officer Takagi deliberately

387
00:23:12.848 --> 00:23:14.648
go through a drunk driving checkpoint,

388
00:23:14.648 --> 00:23:16.748
and bring us all the way here.

389
00:23:16.748 --> 00:23:19.148
It's no wonder they lost track of us.

390
00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:21.548
Don't tell me that they're...

391
00:23:21.548 --> 00:23:22.648
Beats me.

392
00:23:22.648 --> 00:23:26.548
The only thing I'm sure of is that he's not one of my mom's fans.

393
00:23:26.548 --> 00:23:31.248
It seems that his target is either you or me.

394
00:23:32.248 --> 00:23:35.048
So, we've lost track of them.

395
00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:37.948
It's all right. The string hasn't been severed yet.

396
00:23:37.948 --> 00:23:39.148
Keep it up.

397
00:23:40.848 --> 00:23:42.548
But...

398
00:23:46.448 --> 00:23:48.248
She sure resembles.

399
00:23:52.748 --> 00:23:55.748
"Next Episode"

400
00:24:06.148 --> 00:24:07.648
What is this wound he has here?

401
00:24:10.548 --> 00:24:13.248
I see.

402
00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:16.948
I figured out the real truth hidden behind this accident.

403
00:24:16.948 --> 00:24:22.648
Next Conan, "The Truth Behind the Death Fall"

404
00:24:23.616 --> 00:24:26.016
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:26.016 --> 00:24:27.716
"Receipt"

406
00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:28.716
It's been 10 years since this series have begun.

407
00:24:28.716 --> 00:24:30.416
Mr. Aoyama has already written 1 billion comics!

408
00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:32.762
This year is Conan's Super Year!
