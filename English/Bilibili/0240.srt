1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,540
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,540
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,040
Today's stage is on the Bullet train.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,240
There is another locked room in an already locked room.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,230
"Escort on the Shinkansen (Part 1)"

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,130
"Shin-Osaka Station"

10
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,130
"World Cup Hero Arrested For Homicide"

11
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,730
I can't decide which.

12
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,930
Hey, hey.

13
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,330
Isn't that your cell phone?

14
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,330
What?

15
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,230
I wonder who it is?

16
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,330
No ID?

17
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,030
Could that be a long-awaited call from your sweetie, Shinichi?

18
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,330
What?

19
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,130
Come on, pick up and answer. He'll hang up if you don't sooner.

20
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,330
I don't have to answer a call from somebody who won't identify himself.

21
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,430
Don't be so shy. Come on.

22
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,130
Three's a crowd. I'm leaving.

23
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,930
Hello?

24
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,730
Shinichi?

25
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,930
Shinichi.

26
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,030
Shinichi!

27
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,830
What do you mean it's been a while?

28
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,930
Ran's dad.

29
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,430
I know what's bugging you.

30
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,730
Why should I?

31
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,130
Bull's-eye.

32
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,230
Like I told you.

33
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,930
I have no way of contacting you.

34
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,130
But...

35
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,430
But then, how did you know I am in Osaka?

36
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,530
Hattori called me and told me.

37
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,730
So, you're in contact with him all this time.

38
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,330
But... Just a coincidence.

39
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,230
You know, the K-3 event.

40
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,530
There was that event, right?

41
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,830
Let me see.

42
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,330
Which one should I pick?

43
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,830
Well, I don't need any lunch, so what about the newspaper?

44
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,630
Why, you just bought one a while ago!

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,630
What happened, Ran?

46
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,630
Well, then. Shinichi...

47
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,030
Do you know about that case?

48
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,630
I saw the news in the morning.

49
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,430
That case about Ray Curtis.

50
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,030
I couldn't believe it.

51
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,030
Kudo.

52
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,130
Well... And so, Shinichi.

53
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,630
To tell you the truth, I asked...

54
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,330
Maybe you're thinking of

55
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,930
the uniform that Ray autograph?

56
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,430
Yeah.

57
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,930
I heard about it in a phone call.

58
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,530
That wasn't necessary.

59
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,130
But...

60
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,330
Sorry, but I want you to keep it until I get home.

61
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,030
No matter what happened, Ray on the pitch is my hero forever.

62
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,430
Thank you, Ran.

63
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,230
Well, then, there's something I need to check into.

64
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,930
There's something, Shinichi.

65
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,030
What?

66
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,430
Don't you want to know

67
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,430
how Shinichi feels about you?

68
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,730
What's up?

69
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,130
Do you...

70
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,230
Go, Ran. Say it.

71
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,930
Shinichi...

72
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,530
Shinichi, about me...

73
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,430
Shin Osaka Station,

74
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,030
Track No. 26.

75
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:20,130
Nozomi No. 56 departing at 14:26 for Tokyo.

76
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,930
I can hear the Shinkansen arriving.

77
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,230
Yes.

78
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,430
Then, I'll call you when I have the time.

79
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,530
Well... okay.

80
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,030
Hey, there...

81
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,030
Wait... The conversation hasn't been done yet.

82
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,830
Oh, no. He hung up.

83
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,130
I can't stop him.

84
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,930
He's too busy.

85
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,030
Oh, Kazuha.

86
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,730
It's you, Heiji.

87
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,630
What's that fuss about?

88
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,230
It was a phone call from Shinichi.

89
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,830
The line went dead when she was about to get to the point.

90
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,630
No! Not really!

91
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,730
What point?

92
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,230
Yeah.

93
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,330
They were in the middle of a sweet conversation.

94
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,530
Then he must have chickened out by hanging up.

95
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,330
What?

96
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,130
You know, he's a wimp.

97
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,930
Wait till I get you.

98
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,230
"Nagoya" -No. 164 bound for Tokyo are going to leave.

99
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,730
The doors will close,

100
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,230
Ran, listen to me. Don't beat around the bush.

101
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,930
Give it to him straight! Throw cheese!

102
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,130
Okay.

103
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,730
Throw cheese right at the center. Hit the bulls-eye!

104
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,030
You hear me!

105
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,730
What is it, Ran?

106
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,530
Are you planning to play baseball?

107
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,230
Well, yes, sort of.

108
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,830
Don't throw straight into the bull's-eye.

109
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,130
I think you should sound out strategy with a curveball.

110
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,430
No, wait.

111
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,830
Mr. Mouri.

112
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,730
Officer Takagi.

113
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,330
What?

114
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,830
You're transporting a crime suspect?

115
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,230
Turn it down, Mr. Mouri.

116
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,230
I'm sorry, Takagi.

117
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,430
What about the guy? What did he do?

118
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,330
His name is Senzo Ogura.

119
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,530
A narcotics dealer.

120
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,530
We were about to arrest him in Tokyo,

121
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,330
but he made a narrow escape.

122
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,230
We organized a dragnet in the Kansai region, and he fell into it.

123
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,130
Yes, I remember reading it in the newspaper.

124
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,630
That such a guy is being transferred from Osaka to the Police Agency.

125
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,130
If I remember correctly,

126
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,030
a huge supply of narcotics was found in his home in Tokyo.

127
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,130
Yes.

128
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:04,230
That's why we're hoping that he'll confess the name of his boss.

129
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,730
Coffee.

130
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,530
I want to drink some coffee.

131
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,430
Boy, you are troublesome.

132
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,830
Takagi, can you go get one?

133
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,930
Yes.

134
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,430
But we can only get you cold coffee in a can.

135
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,930
I don't want you spilling hot coffee over us to try to escape.

136
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,230
Shit.

137
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,430
I wonder if I have a small change.

138
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,630
Here it is.

139
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,230
It's a ticket to the Ichizo Sanada Magic Illusion show.

140
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,230
Are you going to see it?

141
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,430
Yes, on my next day off.

142
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,630
I didn't know you were interested in that.

143
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,030
Well...

144
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,830
To tell you the truth,

145
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,530
Yumi in the Traffic Control Section asked me,

146
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,430
because she had an extra ticket.

147
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,830
I see.

148
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,330
Yumi did?

149
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,130
I told her I'm not really interested.

150
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,130
Well, Takagi.

151
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,630
Yes.

152
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,630
That might be a good idea. Why not?

153
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,430
Let me know if you catch the trick behind it.

154
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,330
Well...

155
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,330
How about this?

156
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,830
You casually tell Miwako that I asked you out.

157
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,530
What?

158
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,430
If she turns pale, that means she has a thing for you.

159
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,430
If she turns pale?

160
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,130
A straightforward pitch isn't going to work on a girl like Miwako.

161
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,430
Try sounding out with a curveball.

162
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,530
Get it?

163
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,130
What is it with you?

164
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,830
What? Well, I'm going.

165
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,430
We'll be returning to our seats.

166
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,930
Okay. See you later.

167
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,430
Look's like my curveball...

168
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,130
failed.

169
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,830
We should see Mt. Fuji soon.

170
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,030
What?

171
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,030
Looks like something happened.

172
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,730
What's wrong?

173
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,730
Has something happened?

174
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,630
First things first, I'll check the restroom.

175
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,130
You stay here.

176
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,530
Okay.

177
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,030
Excuse me. Let me through.

178
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,630
It's here.

179
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,330
"Contains Bomb. Do not touch".

180
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,330
When did you find this?

181
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,630
A passenger found this just a while ago,

182
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,830
I think it hasn't been very long.

183
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,530
I see.

184
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,230
Thanks.

185
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:41,038
It seems people are gathering over there.

186
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:43,738
There must be something going on.

187
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:45,338
You must be kidding.

188
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:55,838
I think I'll go and check.

189
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,338
Stop!

190
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:04,338
No! It's dangerous.

191
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:06,038
Sit still.

192
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,438
Hey, officer.

193
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,138
I need to go to the restroom.

194
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:15,138
What?

195
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:20,138
I've been trying to wait until we get to Tokyo, but I can't anymore.

196
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:24,838
Then, wait till Officer Sato returns.

197
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,538
I'm telling you because I can't anymore.

198
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,638
It's okay by me if I do it here.

199
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:33,438
No way.

200
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,438
Seriously.

201
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:38,838
I'm sorry about that.

202
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:39,938
Seriously.

203
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:42,838
Where are you heading, Officer Takagi?

204
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:44,738
The bathroom.

205
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:57,838
Did you find something, officer?

206
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,238
Do you hear something?

207
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,838
Yes, I hear the clock ticking.

208
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:07,738
Anyway, we must have the passengers evacuate from the car.

209
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,638
Tell the driver to stop the train.

210
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,638
It was just a hoax.

211
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:46,238
I'd like to speak to the person who found this bag.

212
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,138
Hey!

213
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:56,038
Are you done?

214
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:59,938
Don't rush me, officer.

215
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:02,038
I've only got one hand free.

216
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:05,138
That's a problem in itself.

217
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,538
Goodness.

218
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:12,738
By the way, I heard you say something

219
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:16,838
that you are going to make me confess the boss's name.

220
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:19,238
I'm sorry to tell you that it's impossible.

221
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:27,138
Because this bird won't be singing anymore.

222
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:32,338
What's going on?

223
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,338
What's this?

224
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:41,138
How did you get the knife?

225
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:46,238
I need to call Ms. Sato.

226
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,438
Oh, no!

227
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:52,638
I'm out of range in a tunnel.

228
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,938
Darn it.

229
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,638
I'll be back right away!

230
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:07,338
I'll be back. Stay there.

231
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,338
What did you say?

232
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:24,838
The suspect in the restroom?

233
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:28,238
He had a knife stabbed in the abdomen.

234
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,638
But why?

235
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:32,238
He shouldn't be in possession of a knife.

236
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:34,138
I know, but...

237
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:37,238
But, when I opened the door, he was splattered with blood.

238
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,738
Anyway, please come.

239
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,238
All right.

240
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:59,438
Officer Sato, here!

241
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:05,538
It's gone. The knife is gone.

242
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,738
What?

243
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,538
It's too late.

244
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:15,638
He already died.

245
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:17,838
No way...

246
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,038
Strange.

247
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,938
There is something fishy here.

248
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,638
What?

249
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:01,738
The suspect killed himself during transport?

250
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:02,938
Idiots!

251
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:07,638
What have you two been doing?

252
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:10,238
Well, starting from the beginning,

253
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:13,038
I took the suspect to the bathroom.

254
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,538
Suddenly, he began to suffer.

255
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:16,738
When I opened the door,

256
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:20,538
he had a knife in his abdomen and he was bloody.

257
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,338
That is why I went to report to Officer Sato to receive orders.

258
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:28,438
I locked the handcuff on the handbar in the bathroom.

259
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:31,838
I had him confined inside the bathroom to call Officer Sato.

260
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,038
Although he was injured,

261
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,438
I believed that it is dangerous to have a suspect

262
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:41,138
in possession of a weapon to be left abandoned inside the car.

263
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:44,638
When I returned with Officer Sato,

264
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:48,338
he had pulled out the knife and was bleeding.

265
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,238
Anyway, I will be heading to Tokyo Station

266
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,738
with the medical examiner and forensic team.

267
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:55,938
Don't let anybody inside until we get there.

268
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,538
Yes, sir!

269
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,838
A police officer making the mistake of allowing

270
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,638
a suspect to commit suicide during transport.

271
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:06,538
That's a scandal.

272
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,538
This means reprimand or a pay cut or even suspension.

273
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:12,838
No, no.

274
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,538
It might mean...

275
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,938
a dishonorable discharge.

276
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,738
Poor Officer Takagi!

277
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,638
What are you saying, Officer Sato?

278
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,638
You're speaking as it's no concern of yours.

279
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:31,438
Hello, Takagi speaking!

280
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:34,438
Hi, it's me, Yumi.

281
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:36,338
Yumi?

282
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:38,638
How was it? You know what.

283
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,338
What?

284
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:43,738
The operation ticket chase!

285
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,238
Did it succeeds?

286
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:48,338
Was Miwako jealous? How did she react?

287
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:52,838
Come on and tell me. I'm dying to hear.

288
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:55,438
I'm not in the mood to talk about that!

289
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,838
Don't call me about such matters!

290
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,538
It bombed as expected.

291
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,138
What did Yumi say?

292
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:11,438
It was nothing.

293
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:22,738
But, the problem is the knife used to kill himself.

294
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,438
Yes, he is not a magician.

295
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:30,038
It's impossible for a suspect to hide and carry a knife during transport

296
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,538
-without the police officers knowing. -He's not a magician.

297
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,838
This man is a samurai.

298
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,238
What?

299
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:40,138
Look at the knife on the floor.

300
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,838
Look at how it is on the floor. The blade is looking upward.

301
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,538
It means he was holding it this way, right?

302
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,738
This means that this man was holding the knife

303
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:53,738
this away to pull it out like a samurai.

304
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,638
Takagi.

305
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:59,538
How did the suspect hold the knife when he stabbed himself?

306
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,438
Of course, in reverse,

307
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:03,938
it's easier to hold that way.

308
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:06,638
Reverse when stabbing,

309
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,538
and normal when pulling,

310
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:10,238
that's weird.

311
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:15,038
Does that mean that someone else had pulled the knife?

312
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:16,438
That's impossible.

313
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:18,338
Talking about weird,

314
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:20,638
this blood is funny, too.

315
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,238
-What? -What?

316
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:25,538
Look, the blood splattered all over the man

317
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:27,938
and the blood on the knife.

318
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:30,038
It is wiggling like jelly.

319
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,738
But, the blood on his hand is not hard yet

320
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:36,738
and is liquid like water.

321
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:40,338
Does that mean that what is on his hand is not blood?

322
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:43,938
But the color looks so much like blood.

323
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:46,038
Might be heparin.

324
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,238
Heparin?

325
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,238
Yes.

326
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:53,538
It may have been mixed with blood.

327
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:55,838
You mean, that anti-coagulant?

328
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:56,938
Yes.

329
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:59,738
Usually, blood begins to clot over time,

330
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:02,138
making it difficult to transport.

331
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:05,838
If blood is mixed with Heparin and sealed tight in a bag,

332
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:09,538
it is possible to bring it in on the train to use as fake blood.

333
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,338
If it means fake blood, then...

334
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:16,238
Yes. If somebody had concealed the fake blood

335
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:18,938
and knife in here.

336
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,138
This is truly...

337
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:24,038
murder.

338
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,838
"Next Episode" -We were framed.

339
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:17,238
Something is stuck on his blood-smeared hands.

340
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:21,638
Will all three of you bring me that newspaper then?

341
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:25,938
And Mr. Tokuyama, please don't forget

342
00:24:25,938 --> 00:24:27,938
the can coffee that you bought then, too.

343
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,138
The killer said something strange, too.

344
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:32,638
That person...

345
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,038

350

You mean, because we're always far apart?

351
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,156
But, I happen to be very close to you.
