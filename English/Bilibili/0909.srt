00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.070
Sir? Sir?

5
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.470
Chief Kuroda?

6
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.270
Is something wrong, sir?

7
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.070
It's nothing.

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.470
I was just thinking.

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.670
Did you need something, Shiratori?

10
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.970
I finished the report on the other day's robbery.

12
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.170
Here it is.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.670
Good work.

14
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.970
Sir.

15
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.070
What is it?

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.770
You seem a bit tired.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.070
I have a lot on my mind.

18
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.770
Why not take a break?

19
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.670
You haven't used any of your vacation time, have you?

20
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.270
No.

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770
I know. How about camping?

22
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.570
A nice campground was opened recently.

23
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.270
Conan and his friends are going next weekend.

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.570
I see.

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.470
The Sleeping Kogoro's adviser?

26
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.770
Yes. Normally they go with Dr. Agasa,

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.370
but Dr. Agasa is sick.

28
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.770
This time they'll be accompanied by their grade school teacher.

29
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.970
A grade school teacher?

30
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.470
You know, the one who was in the news

31
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.870
for subduing the pro golfer murderer.

32
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.470
Rumi Wakasa.

33
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.470
I'd actually planned to take time off

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.770
and go with Ms. Kobayashi.

35
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.670
But if we're going on a date,

36
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
I thought it'd be better for just the two of us to go.

37
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.070
In any case, I'll leave campsite pamphlets...

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.770
"New Open! Camping and Barbecue Site" -with you.

39
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.670
Well, I should get going.

40
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.870
Sure. Good work.

41
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.670
If you don't need those pamphlets,

42
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.970
feel free to throw them away.

43
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.870
-Sure. -Excuse me.

44
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.970
Camping?

45
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970
"New Open! Camping and Barbecue Site"

46
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.170
It's not my style.

47
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.070
When the countdown reaches zero,

48
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.470
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

49
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.870
Chief Kuroda and Ms. Wakasa.

50
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.070
The suspicious duo meets at our campsite!

51
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.670
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.370
His name is Detective Conan.

54
00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:50.912
"Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 1)"

55
00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:58.312
"Toto Forest Campground"

56
00:05:14.612 --> 00:05:16.112
All right!

57
00:05:16.112 --> 00:05:18.312
We pitched the tent!

58
00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:19.712
Good.

59
00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:21.212
Okay, everyone.

60
00:05:21.212 --> 00:05:25.112
Could you go gather some firewood for dinner?

61
00:05:25.112 --> 00:05:26.612
Okay...

62
00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:27.912
Ai, let's go!

63
00:05:27.912 --> 00:05:30.512
-There's a bunch over there! -Don't run.

64
00:05:31.912 --> 00:05:34.512
Rumi Wakasa.

65
00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:37.912
Assistant homeroom teacher to class 1-B of Teitan Elementary School.

66
00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:48.912
The other day we happened to be invited to her apartment,

67
00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:53.412
and we just happened to get involved in the murder of her neighbor.

68
00:05:54.512 --> 00:05:59.512
But the receipt I found in her apartment from that morning...

69
00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:00.512
"7mart Receipt"

70
00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:05.912
It showed she'd bought plates and mugs for us.

71
00:06:05.912 --> 00:06:07.712
In other words, that morning

72
00:06:07.712 --> 00:06:10.912
she knew her neighbor would commit a murder.

73
00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.912
In order to involve us,

74
00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:15.912
she deliberately ruined the screen

75
00:06:15.912 --> 00:06:19.512
and invited us to her apartment under the pretense of repainting it.

76
00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.712
No.

77
00:06:21.712 --> 00:06:23.812
Not us.

78
00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:26.012
Is she after me?

79
00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:31.412
After all, when we found the skeleton in the old storage shed,

80
00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:34.712
the rust on the trapdoor to the basement that hadn't been opened in years

81
00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:37.312
had been recently removed.

82
00:06:38.912 --> 00:06:42.912
If she discovered the body beforehand,

83
00:06:42.912 --> 00:06:46.912
and pushed me to get involved in the case...

84
00:06:48.412 --> 00:06:50.512
Could this camping trip also be...

85
00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:53.212
Hey, Conan.

86
00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:56.712
There's someone like you.

87
00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:58.112
What?

88
00:06:58.112 --> 00:06:59.712
Someone like me?

89
00:06:59.712 --> 00:07:01.512
That guy over there.

90
00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:03.112
He's just like you.

91
00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:05.412
I told you.

92
00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:06.912
Three more.

93
00:07:06.912 --> 00:07:09.112
The curry won't be thick enough

94
00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:11.112
unless you add three more pieces of roux to the curry.

95
00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:13.712
You've got to add at least two more.

96
00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:15.512
I get it.

97
00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:17.112
That's why Midori's out buying more right now.

98
00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:19.812
I see. It's those fingers.

99
00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:23.012
That's exactly what a certain someone influenced

100
00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:25.712
by his Gallicized mother does.

101
00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.712
This gesture means three, right?

102
00:07:28.712 --> 00:07:32.412
Yes. That's three, but this is two.

103
00:07:32.412 --> 00:07:34.812
What? But that guy...

104
00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:37.212
-He did two like us. -I found some. Here.

105
00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:38.212
Why?

106
00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:41.212
He represents three like this and two like this.

107
00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:43.612
On top of that, his fingers are taped,

108
00:07:43.612 --> 00:07:45.612
which means...

109
00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:48.912
Hey, aren't you guys...

110
00:07:48.912 --> 00:07:51.312
basketball players?

111
00:07:51.312 --> 00:07:52.512
What?

112
00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:57.412
Basketball referees extend their pointer

113
00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:59.112
and middle fingers to represent two,

114
00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.412
but they use their pointer finger, middle finger,

115
00:08:01.412 --> 00:08:05.012
and thumb to represent three so you don't confuse it with two, right?

116
00:08:05.012 --> 00:08:10.212
I heard a lot of players pick up the same habit.

117
00:08:10.212 --> 00:08:11.912
That's amazing, kid.

118
00:08:11.912 --> 00:08:13.612
You're exactly right.

119
00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:19.412
I'm the manager of the Shiraami University basketball team.

120
00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:21.212
My name is Midori Furuoka.

121
00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:24.412
And the guy stirring the curry

122
00:08:24.412 --> 00:08:27.212
is the man who became our star player this year.

123
00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:28.812
Sumito Ashizawa.

124
00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:31.712
"Sumito Ashizawa (22)" -What? Don't call me that.

125
00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:34.012
I was riding the bench until last year.

126
00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:37.012
But you've been approached by professional teams, right?

127
00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:41.012
The other day, a scout came to meet you before the game.

128
00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:43.112
It was a coincidence.

129
00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:46.912
I hope we'll still be friends even after you become famous.

130
00:08:46.912 --> 00:08:47.912
Sure.

131
00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:50.612
"Fumiaki Urushibara (22)" -I'm the cornerstone

132
00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:52.412
of our team's defense.

133
00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:54.412
My name is Fumiaki Urushibara.

134
00:08:54.412 --> 00:08:58.112
I'm a stickler when it comes to defending and making curry.

135
00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:02.112
I'm former ace who was blinded

136
00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:04.112
by the cornerstone of our defense.

137
00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:06.812
And I'm Kuninori Danno.

138
00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:09.012
Blinded?

139
00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:10.812
Seriously?

140
00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:14.612
Yes. I gently bumped him with my elbow during practice.

141
00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:16.412
It wasn't gentle!

142
00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:17.912
I nearly lost my sight.

143
00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:19.912
I almost got a glass eye!

144
00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:42.812
She's grasping something.

145
00:09:45.312 --> 00:09:46.612
What is it?

146
00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:48.412
What could it be?

147
00:09:48.412 --> 00:09:50.312
Yes, but...

148
00:09:50.312 --> 00:09:53.512
because of that, you got closer to Midori, right?

149
00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:55.412
You should be thanking me.

150
00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:56.412
What?

151
00:09:56.412 --> 00:09:59.312
Urushibara, that's going too far.

152
00:09:59.312 --> 00:10:00.812
What?

153
00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:06.012
Watch what you say, Ashizawa.

154
00:10:06.012 --> 00:10:09.812
I could crush you anytime I wanted.

155
00:10:09.812 --> 00:10:11.812
Just like Danno!

156
00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:14.312
You jerk.

157
00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:21.812
I've had enough.

158
00:10:21.812 --> 00:10:23.312
I knew shouldn't have come.

159
00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:24.912
Hey.

160
00:10:24.912 --> 00:10:27.512
I'm going to drink, have some snacks,

161
00:10:27.512 --> 00:10:29.012
and go to bed.

162
00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:31.912
Wake me before you leave tomorrow.

163
00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:33.412
Wait, Urushibara!

164
00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:40.112
This is bad.

165
00:10:40.112 --> 00:10:41.712
I invited everyone camping

166
00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:44.712
because things have been tense recently.

167
00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:47.012
Sorry. I just couldn't take it.

168
00:10:47.012 --> 00:10:50.812
Now, now. He'll feel better once he has some curry.

169
00:10:50.812 --> 00:10:53.412
He loves curry.

170
00:11:17.012 --> 00:11:18.812
That's good!

171
00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:21.112
This curry is really good!

172
00:11:21.112 --> 00:11:22.812
Yes, it's delicious.

173
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:27.012
Curry tastes better when you make a lot of it.

174
00:11:27.012 --> 00:11:28.412
That's great.

175
00:11:28.412 --> 00:11:31.312
There's more, so eat all you want.

176
00:11:31.312 --> 00:11:32.612
Okay...

177
00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:36.712
Thank you for letting us join you.

178
00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:38.912
Don't worry about it.

179
00:11:38.912 --> 00:11:41.712
We just combined your ingredients with ours.

180
00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:45.012
And food tastes better when you're sharing it with a large group.

181
00:11:45.012 --> 00:11:47.012
I agree.

182
00:11:47.012 --> 00:11:49.312
It's no use.

183
00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:53.312
Urushibara's hiding in his tent and won't even respond.

184
00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:54.712
I see.

185
00:11:54.712 --> 00:11:57.012
Maybe he's already gone to sleep.

186
00:11:57.012 --> 00:12:00.412
He complained when I talked to him earlier.

187
00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:02.312
Here, Ashizawa.

188
00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:04.212
Thank you.

189
00:12:04.212 --> 00:12:06.212
But his light's on.

190
00:12:07.212 --> 00:12:08.412
You're right.

191
00:12:08.412 --> 00:12:10.612
Looks like he's doing squats.

192
00:12:10.612 --> 00:12:12.512
Come to think of it,

193
00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:14.912
Urushibara said he does them every night before bed.

194
00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:16.212
I see.

195
00:12:16.212 --> 00:12:18.712
Oh, right. Ashizawa, can I have that curry?

196
00:12:18.712 --> 00:12:21.112
What? Sure.

197
00:12:21.112 --> 00:12:23.812
I'm going to take this over there.

198
00:12:23.812 --> 00:12:26.412
I see. You're going to lure him out with the smell.

199
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.612
-Yes. -You can do it.

200
00:12:31.412 --> 00:12:33.412
Hey, Urushibara.

201
00:12:33.412 --> 00:12:35.912
Sorry for picking a fight earlier.

202
00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:39.412
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

203
00:12:39.412 --> 00:12:41.212
Come on, Urushibara.

204
00:12:42.412 --> 00:12:44.312
I'm stuffed.

205
00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:47.112
I can't eat anymore.

206
00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:48.612
Of course not.

207
00:12:48.612 --> 00:12:52.212
You had five heaping servings of curry.

208
00:12:52.212 --> 00:12:53.812
You eat too much.

209
00:12:54.912 --> 00:12:58.712
It's no use. He's not responding.

210
00:12:58.712 --> 00:13:02.312
He's listening to music on his headphones while doing squats.

211
00:13:02.312 --> 00:13:04.012
I see.

212
00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:08.612
Do you smell something burning?

213
00:13:08.612 --> 00:13:09.712
What?

214
00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:12.712
You're right.

215
00:13:12.712 --> 00:13:14.812
Hey, look.

216
00:13:16.112 --> 00:13:18.712
The tent's on fire!

217
00:13:18.712 --> 00:13:21.012
Isn't that Urushibara's tent?

218
00:13:21.012 --> 00:13:23.012
-No way. -Seriously?

219
00:13:23.012 --> 00:13:25.412
Water! Everyone get water!

220
00:13:25.412 --> 00:13:26.912
Hurry!

221
00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.879
Hurry!

222
00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:22.379
Urushibara...

223
00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:25.279
-No. -No way.

224
00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:31.679
Hey, Ai. What happened to the man inside?

225
00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:34.979
Don't! You don't want to see that.

226
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.379
But, Mitsuhiko,

227
00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:45.179
why did the tent catch fire?

228
00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:47.979
Well, because...

229
00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:53.779
Maybe the person in the tent next door saw something.

230
00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:56.679
Excuse me!

231
00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:58.379
Are you awake?

232
00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:00.179
Hello?

233
00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:01.579
Can you hear us?

234
00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:03.179
Excuse me!

235
00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:05.379
-Is anyone home? -Hello?

236
00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:07.179
We're opening the flap.

237
00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.779
Chief Kuroda?

238
00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:17.979
Sorry.

239
00:15:17.979 --> 00:15:20.879
I was sleeping with earplugs in.

240
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.879
But I can tell at a glance what's happening.

241
00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:28.979
Let's call the police immediately.

242
00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:31.679
Any objections?

243
00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:35.679
Rumi Wakasa?

244
00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.879
Ms. Wakasa...

245
00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:51.879
Ms. Wakasa!

246
00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.979
What is it, Yoshida?

247
00:15:59.979 --> 00:16:02.879
That police officer with the scary face

248
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:06.979
is asking if it's okay to call the police.

249
00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:07.979
What?

250
00:16:07.979 --> 00:16:11.779
Well, Rumi Wakasa?

251
00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:16.279
A tent caught fire, and a man is dead.

252
00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:19.679
It seems natural to me that we'd call the police.

253
00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.579
Why are you asking me?

254
00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:25.479
And how do you know my name?

255
00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:29.779
You were glaring at me with such a fierce expression,

256
00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:32.079
I thought you had an objection.

257
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:35.979
Because of this face, people often look away

258
00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:40.479
but they rarely stare.

259
00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:42.479
Really?

260
00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:45.579
And I saw your name in the news.

261
00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:49.479
"Grade school teacher Rumi Wakasa saves the day!"

262
00:16:49.479 --> 00:16:52.679
"Subdues professional golfer!"

263
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.979
You saw that?

264
00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:56.879
How embarrassing.

265
00:16:58.479 --> 00:17:00.379
This woman...

266
00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:02.179
Her right eye's blind.

267
00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:06.679
Come to think of it,

268
00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:08.579
when Ms. Wakasa first introduced herself

269
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.779
as our assistant homeroom teacher,

270
00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:12.979
she hit her head on the podium.

271
00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:16.479
She hit her head on the trapdoor to the basement

272
00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:19.079
in the old storage shed, too.

273
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.079
I was beginning to think

274
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.679
she was pretending to be a clumsy teacher

275
00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.479
so we'd underestimate her, but...

276
00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:29.079
What if hitting her head...

277
00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:32.979
wasn't an accident?

278
00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:01.079
Sorry, Yuminaga.

279
00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:05.079
I wasn't sure whether to call you or violent crime's Megure.

280
00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:07.279
No problem, sir.

281
00:18:07.279 --> 00:18:09.979
A fire is arson's job.

282
00:18:11.479 --> 00:18:13.479
So, what's the situation?

283
00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:18.279
The origin of the fire was the candle inside the lantern.

284
00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:22.479
It melted into the other candles scattered around it,

285
00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:25.079
so it's kind of a mess.

286
00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:28.579
The candle fell,

287
00:18:28.579 --> 00:18:30.679
igniting comic books and clothing.

288
00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:32.979
The fire spread quickly.

289
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.979
Then it enveloped the victim sleeping in the legless chair,

290
00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:39.779
burning everything.

291
00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:44.679
It seems the victim had quite a bit to drink.

292
00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:49.879
The tent entrance was zipped shut all the way.

293
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:53.479
It even had a lock on it.

294
00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:56.079
So it wasn't arson.

295
00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:58.979
No. I believe it was an accident.

296
00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:02.279
Isn't it strange, though?

297
00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:04.879
See? There's a single strip of bamboo

298
00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:07.179
mixed in with the melted candle.

299
00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:13.779
Yes. That's probably one of the skewers

300
00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:16.379
from the dango the victim was eating.

301
00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:21.479
I didn't realize you were here, Conan.

302
00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:25.579
You're familiar with the Sleeping Kogoro's adviser?

303
00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:29.479
Yes. He's advised me before.

304
00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:34.179
Also, if you look closely at the hardened candles,

305
00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:38.279
there's one with a hole near the tip,

306
00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:41.579
and for some reason there's a V shaped burn

307
00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:44.979
on the cover of the magazine next to the laptop.

308
00:19:44.979 --> 00:19:48.679
Maybe someone set some kind of mechanism.

309
00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:50.179
I see.

310
00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:51.579
You're right.

311
00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:57.879
Which means that person is one of you three...

312
00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:02.679
who visited his tent one at a time.

313
00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:14.179
The first to visit his tent...

314
00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:17.479
was Midori Furuoka.

315
00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:21.879
Next was Sumito Ashizawa.

316
00:20:21.879 --> 00:20:26.379
And finally Kuninori Danno, correct?

317
00:20:26.379 --> 00:20:28.379
Oh, my.

318
00:20:28.379 --> 00:20:29.979
Earlier, you said you were sleeping

319
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:34.279
inside your tent with earplugs in.

320
00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:37.879
But you know the order in which they visited?

321
00:20:37.879 --> 00:20:41.279
No. Actually, while nodding off,

322
00:20:41.279 --> 00:20:45.579
I was watching through a gap in my tent flap

323
00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:49.279
as you cheerfully ate your curry.

324
00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:53.579
Was there someone who caught your interest?

325
00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:57.179
No. I had no particular reason for doing it.

326
00:20:57.179 --> 00:21:00.179
No particular reason?

327
00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:02.979
Yes.

328
00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:07.979
Since my tent was right next to the tent that burned,

329
00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:12.679
I remembered the faces and order of the people who came this way.

330
00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:15.479
But since I had earplugs in,

331
00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:19.679
I don't know what the three of them

332
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.179
discussed with the victim.

333
00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.779
And then...

334
00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:27.979
you went to sleep?

335
00:21:30.679 --> 00:21:34.779
Surely, you didn't ignore the tent engulfed in flames

336
00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:41.279
so you could observe the person you're so interested in, right?

337
00:21:42.379 --> 00:21:43.579
No.

338
00:21:43.579 --> 00:21:46.779
I made the mistake of falling asleep.

339
00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:49.579
Though since there was a grade school teacher present,

340
00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:50.879
I may have underestimated the situation

341
00:21:50.879 --> 00:21:54.479
and believed nothing serious would occur.

342
00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.879
I see.

343
00:21:56.879 --> 00:22:00.279
Is she a teacher?

344
00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:01.779
Yes.

345
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:04.479
She's our assistant homeroom teacher.

346
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:14.979
So why don't we ask you one by one again?

347
00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:20.779
What did you discuss with the victim then?

348
00:22:21.979 --> 00:22:26.079
Let's start with Midori Furuoka

349
00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:29.079
who visited the victim's tent first.

350
00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:30.479
All right.

351
00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:57.979
"Next Episode" -Why did the victim, Urushibara

352
00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:01.779
stay in his tent instead of eating curry with everyone else?

353
00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:04.879
We got into an argument.

354
00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:06.179
Hey.

355
00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:09.079
Danno claimed he used to be the ace of his basketball team.

356
00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:11.879
-Is that true? -Yes, he was.

357
00:24:11.879 --> 00:24:13.379
Look.

358
00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:15.279
A balancing acorn.

359
00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:24.379
Next Conan, "Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 2)"

360
00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:27.722
Next Conan's Hint:

361
00:24:27.722 --> 00:24:29.522
"Ms. Wakasa"

362
00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:31.622
Chief Kuroda is a bit odd.

363
00:24:31.622 --> 00:24:34.222
-Ms. Wakasa. -No comment.
