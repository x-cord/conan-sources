00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:07,215
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:10,065
Today's stage is a karaoke box!

3
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,555
Love and farewell
songs during Christmas!

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,235
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:16,395
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:18,435
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,922
The Karaoke Box Murder Case.

8
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:04,852
Why am I stuck with
you guys during Christmas?

9
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,352
That's my line.

10
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:09,682
Say, what's up with Shinichi-kun?

11
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:12,352
He only calls once in a while.

12
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,222
What's his problem?!
Christmas only comes once a year!

13
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:18,892
He's such a conceited mystery geek!

14
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:19,982
That he is.

15
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:24,572
He's always arrogant,
snobbish, and mean...

16
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,762
But maybe that's
what I like about him!

17
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:30,782
Ran!

18
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,812
What about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

19
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:38,012
Of course I am. Kimura Tatsuya.

20
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,602
Tatsuya?

21
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:45,842
You know, the guy
from Lex, that rock band!

22
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,812
Oh, just some entertainer...

23
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:54,182
Dad got me invited
to one of their parties!

24
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,972
I get to see Tatsuya in the flesh!

25
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:57,732
Wanna come?

26
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,652
You're going to meet him?!

27
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:02,112
Her family sure is connected.

28
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,122
When is it?!

29
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:05,892
Next Sunday!

30
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,432

You know you have

Sure is sad that a former band leader

00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:16,602
is stuck running a joint like this...

00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,392

Don't worry, I'm just going solo.

What's it called?

118
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,752
Its title? It's called--

119
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:30,132
What's wrong?!

120
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,982
Tatsuya!

121
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:41,922
Get an ambulance!

122
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:42,722
Right!

123
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,182
Too late! He's dead!

124
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,652
That smells like cyanide!

125
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:55,612
Somebody planned this!

126
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,762
But I was watching the whole time!

127
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:06,062
The first suspect was Sumii,
the guy who brought the food.

128
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:09,002
He and Kimura Tatsuya
used to be bandmates.

129
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:12,922
But then Tatsuya went
pro and became popular.

130
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:15,882
It looked like a jealousy murder.

131
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:20,722
But he was cleared of
suspicion when we learned

132
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,352
that everyone had eaten the food.

133
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:28,892
Toxins were found on the
victim's clothes and microphone,

134
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,832
so he had touched the poison
before eating the rice ball.

135
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:36,892
Which means the killer
placed poison on the microphone

136
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:41,782
which indirectly adhered
to him when he grabbed it.

137
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:46,722
That means it was done by
the person who sang before him...

138
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:49,172
...you, Shibazaki Mieko-san!

139
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:54,882
I hear you sang a
farewell song while crying.

140
00:08:55,682 --> 00:09:00,562
Did something
happen between you two?

141
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:05,562
Tatsuya didn't dump me!
He turned me down!

142
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,522
Mieko...

143
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:10,482
When I told him how I felt...

144
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:14,072
Sorry, Mieko.
I already like someone.

145
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,562
She's gone right now,

146
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:24,062
but I'm waiting for her to come back.

147
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:29,932
He said it couldn't
work out between us!

148
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:32,072
Then to pay him back, you--

149
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,182
No! I didn't kill him!

150
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:36,432
Already likes someone?

151
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:41,222
Inspector. Tatsuya requested
the song that she sang!

152
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,762
She had no idea that
he would be singing next!

153
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:49,602
She couldn't have
poisoned the microphone!

154
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:50,732
That is true...

155
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:56,192
Say, who requested
his Bloody Venus song?

156
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:07,742
Did he always take
his jacket off when he sang?

157
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,582
Only at the start of every
Bloody Venus.

158
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:13,042
Could it be?!

159
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:18,762
Inspector! What part of his
clothing had cyanide on it?!

160
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:22,012
His left elbow area, I believe...

161
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,352
On his staff jacket?!

162
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:27,972
No, there was nothing on his jacket.

163
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:31,942
That's it! Now I understand

164
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:35,762
how the killer poisoned Kimura Tatsuya!

165
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:38,812
And that killer is one of those three

166
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:42,612
who have the same jacket on!

167
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:50,012
Hey, guitar lady.

168
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:53,472
The manager and Tatsuya-san
were arguing earlier;

169
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:54,922
were they always like that?

170
00:10:56,642 --> 00:11:00,142
Yeah. They argued
about everything.

171
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:03,722
Tatsuya always started it, though.

172
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:06,812
She's not as bad as he claimed.

173
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:10,142
She's smart, serious, and beautiful--

174
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:12,142
but she never caused any trouble.

175
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,322
Inspector Megure!

176
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,472
What is it?

177
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:18,572
We found this in his office locker.

178
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:22,242
I don't see anything useful here...

179
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,852
It's a band picture...

180
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,872
That sure takes me back.

181
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:33,562
That's from when he and I had a band

182
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,932
before he went pro.

183
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:39,562
But only he and these two are still

184
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,802
in the music industry.

185
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,882
He wasn't the only one who left your band?

186
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,892
Tatsuya hated that person over there.

187
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:53,812
Said they were the
reason he wanted to quit...

188
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,222
But they're not in that picture...

189
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:59,192
She's right here.

190
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:01,652
She's really changed, though.

191
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,612
Could it be?

192
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,572
Too much, if you ask me...

193
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,562
There's writing on the back!

194
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,532
Lemme see it again!

195
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,472
I see!

196
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:21,562
But what a sad incident
this is if it's true...

197
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,949
You know who did it? How?!

198
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,859
Uh-huh. Okay. Got it!

199
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,149
Cancel the investigation!
Get everyone back there!

200
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:45,749
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

201
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,449
Did something happen?

202
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,549
He's back.

203
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,249
He?

204
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,959
A detective you know very well.

205
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,169
Kudo Shinichi.

206
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,529
Eh?!
Eh?!

207
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,679
Shinichi finally came back!

208
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,179
Shinichi!

209
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:16,609
Welcome! Thank you all for coming!

210
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,399
Shinichi?

211
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,909
He must be watching with this camera!

212
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,779
Move, Sonoko!

213
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,869
Where are you, Shinichi?!

214
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,829
Let's begin unraveling this case.

215
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:31,879
Shinichi!

216
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,669
What's with this song?

217
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:38,319
It's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

218
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,589
They play it everywhere
around Christmas time.

219
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,559
It also stirs up the
killer's hatred for the victim.

220
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,489
In other words, the person
who had Tatsuya-san

221
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,019
sing this song.

222
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:54,199
Yes. Tatsuya-san's killer

223
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,109
was his manager,
Terahara Mari-san!

224
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,839
She killed him?!

225
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,149
No way...

226
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,399
Stop kidding around!

227
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,409
I wasn't even in
the room when he died.

228
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,109
You could've poisoned him
despite your distance,

229
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:17,799
simply by having
him sing this song.

230
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,949
This was his hit song,
"Bloody Venus"!

231
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:29,619
Could you sing for us,
using the mic I've prepared?

232
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,099
There's no poison on it, of course.

233
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,569
Fine. If that'll make you happy.

234
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:46,489
Wait! Why aren't you
removing your jacket?

235
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:51,739
He always took his jacket off
when he sang this song.

236
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,039
Isn't that right, everyone?

237
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,209
Yeah...

238
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,289
From the top...

239
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,169
Oh, yes.

240
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:03,769
Don't forget the dance.

241
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:12,109
♪ She's one hot babe! ♪

242
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:16,739
♪ I'm talkin' about you! ♪

243
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,219
Wow! She's good!

244
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,349
Of course she is.

245
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,619
She used to sing with
Tatsuya in my band.

246
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,579
♪ My love for you... ♪

247
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:32,539
She did?

248
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:35,459
♪ I love ya! ♪

249
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,969
Satisfied?

250
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:42,639
Yes.

251
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,739
Now try eating
the food I've prepared.

252
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,549
You mean this?

253
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,109
Just as Tatsuya-san did.

254
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,519
Pick whatever you'd like.

255
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,199
Assuming you can, that is.

256
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:04,489
I'd rather not. I touched him
after he collapsed!

257
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,949
His hands and clothes
had poison on them!

258
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,449
I could've gotten
some on my hands too!

259
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:16,039
Then please check
her jacket, Inspector.

260
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:18,039
Her jacket?

261
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,919
Same goes for the jacket!
I put it on after touching Tatsuya!

262
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,489
If there is poison on it,
that doesn't mean--

263
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:31,719
No. It's not poison
I'm looking for.

264
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,179
A lighter!

265
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:37,479
Yes.

266
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:43,399
That's his missing lighter.

267
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,279
In other words,
that's not her jacket--

268
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,409
she switched hers with Tatsuya-san's
to dispose of the evidence!

269
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:56,199
She wiped poison on the
inside of the left elbow

270
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:02,449
so that some of it would
get on his shirt underneath

271
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:05,209
when he put the jacket on.

272
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:09,949
All that remained was
to have him sing Bloody Venus.

273
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,969
During his dance,
he throws the jacket off

274
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,929
and touches his hands to his elbows.

275
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:23,859
Then he dies of poisoning
when he eats afterward.

276
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,739
But why would she do that?

277
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:29,699
Her motive is in the
photograph on the table.

278
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,659
It's from when he was
in Sumii-san's band.

279
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,619
What about it?

280
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:41,649
There's no one else in the picture...

281
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:45,489
She is there, Inspector.

282
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:49,009
In the center of the picture,
with Tatsuya-san.

283
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:50,969
Can this be?!

284
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,739
That's right. That picture
of her is the very motive

285
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,429
behind this murder!

286
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,389
Don't tell me you--

287
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,149
That's right!
I had plastic surgery!

288
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,349
For Tatsuya!

289
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,679
I fell in love with him back then...

290
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:11,819
So when he went pro--

291
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,819
Come with me, Mari!
You can be my manager!

292
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:19,529
I was so happy when he said that.

293
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:21,729
I thought he felt
the same way about me...

294
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:26,739
So I got the surgery
to be worthy of him...

295
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,489
His attitude suddenly
changed after I got it.

296
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,399
He would constantly call me ugly.

297
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:36,219
He even had me sing
the Rudolph song earlier!

298
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,179
That's why he requested
the song for you?

299
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:44,609
He made me his manager
just to insult me!

300
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,779
So he had to pay.

301
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,149
He had to pay...

302
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,859
...because I loved him!

303
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:52,989
You're wrong, Mari-san.

304
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,399
Tatsuya-san had been in love
with you for quite some time.

305
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:00,949
Yeah, right! What would you know?!

306
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:04,319
Mari! He's telling the truth.

307
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,079
Inspector. Can I have that?

308
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:11,759
This is a love song he wrote about you.

309
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,719
I Want to Tell the Real You

310
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:17,879
This is fake!

311
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,449
Nope.

312
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,069
Those were the
lyrics to his newest song.

313
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,689
He always talked about you, you know.

314
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,449
Why's Mari so self-conscious?

315
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:31,649
Why'd she change her face for me?!

316
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,109
But he always treated me like--

317
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:38,989
He wasn't good at expressing himself...

318
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:42,079
I guess he wanted the old you back.

319
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,999
What have I done?!

320
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,299
Now I see...

321
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:57,259
I'm waiting for her to come back.

322
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:02,129
Sorry, Mieko. I already like someone.

323
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:08,229
The person he liked was the manager...

324
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:11,729
Tatsuya! Tatsuya!

325
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,699
Tatsuya!

326
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,949
The combination of a man
unable to express his feelings

327
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:30,859
and a woman who hid hers
brought forth a sad ending...

328
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:34,989
...in her weeping and tears.

329
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:38,419
Only her photograph sadly smiled.

330
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:20,359
That's what you get for
saying Kudo Shinichi's name...

331
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,279
She's been waiting there three hours

332
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,319
for you to come home.

333
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,909
I wish I could help,
but there's nothing I can do...

334
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:34,549
Ran...

335
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,049
Shinichi? Are you in here?

336
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,389
Shinichi? Shinichi!

337
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,349
Where are you?
Say something if you're there!

338
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,279
The lights...

339
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,399
Shinichi!

340
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,929
Shinichi?

341
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,399
Shinichi?

342
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:07,239
Yeah, it's me.

343
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,529
I'm finally back.

344
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,859
Shinichi...

345
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,969
Geez, stop cryin'!

346
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,819
Did you wanna see me that badly?

347
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,569
As if!

348
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,609
I'm glad to see you, Ran.

349
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,449
Shinichi...

350
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,529
Wish you could see
yourself right now.

351
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,239
What's that supposed to mean?!

352
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:34,029
Well, gotta get goin'.

353
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,949
Still haven't finished that
case. Later, Ran!

354
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,439
Wait, Shinichi--

355
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,929
Shinichi!

356
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,739
"Your Christmas present. Hope you like it!
--Shinichi."

357
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,909
Now stop worrying about me, Ran.

358
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,059
