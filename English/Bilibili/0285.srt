1
00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:02,624
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:04,524
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:06,324
The mystery centers around the table.

4
00:00:06,324 --> 00:00:08,124
What's wrong with Ran?

5
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:09,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:11,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,824
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,411
With a dinner coupon that Ran won in a shopping mall lottery,

9
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,511
we are heading toward Chinatown in Yokohama.

10
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:08,611
There, we met people in the movie industry.

11
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:13,211
Mr. Kaizo Isogami, film director.

12
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,711
Mr. Motohiro Ito, assistant film director.

13
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:20,611
Mr. Keigo Kitaura, author of the book.

14
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,411
And the producer Mr. Shiro Kawabata.

15
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:26,011
Circumstances led to us having dinner with them.

16
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,411
But, suddenly...

17
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,611
Mr. Kawabata died.

18
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,411
Poison was not found in his clothing.

19
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:48,811
Because chemical reaction was found on the plate

20
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,411
and towel that he used,

21
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:56,411
Pops who sat beside him was suspected of planting cyanide.

22
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,811
This is ridiculous!

23
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:03,311
Why do I have to kill a man I met for the first time

24
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,011
at a restaurant I came for the first time?

25
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,511
What you say sound suspicious already!

26
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:10,211
What's superb timing for your daughter

27
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,211
to be asked to appear in the movie

28
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:13,511
at a restaurant you came for the first time!

29
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,011
It is true!

30
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,411
We came to this restaurant just by coincidence...

31
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:20,911
Huh?

32
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,211
Are you all right?

33
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:29,111
You look pale.

34
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,611
I'm okay!

35
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,511
I was just a bit dizzy.

36
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:36,111
Why don't just sit over there?

37
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:39,911
Uncle will solve the case soon.

38
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,911
Yeah. Thanks.

39
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:45,211
We're in trouble.

40
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,811
Ran looks really sick.

41
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,411
We need to take her to a hospital soon.

42
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:58,911
"Chinatown Dejavu In The Rain (Part 2)"

43
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:08,311
Anyway, the killer replaced that poisoned towel.

44
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:11,611
After the soup was spilled, and the victim changed seats.

45
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:13,111
That means,

46
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:15,611
you were sitting to his right at that time

47
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,111
and are the prime suspect!

48
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:19,511
Hey, hey.

49
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,111
Hey, Inspector.

50
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,911
-Ran... -Inspector!

51
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:28,811
This bottle believed to have contained the poison was found

52
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,211
in the restroom.

53
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,511
What?

54
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:36,411
I see. The towel was brought into the restroom

55
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:38,611
and laced with the poison.

56
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,211
That's why, it's not me!

57
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:45,011
In that case, Uncle Kogoro is not the culprit!

58
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:50,411
'Cause Uncle hasn't been to the washroom since he arrived here.

59
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,211
So that's why, Inspector!

60
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:57,811
Also, Mr. Kawabata changed seats,

61
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:01,311
holding his towel he used to wipe the soup off.

62
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,111
That's why, nobody could have switched towels.

63
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:07,011
No, there must be something to wait.

64
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:10,211
A way to switch without people noticing.

65
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:14,911
I see!

66
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:20,911
The killer used the rotation of the turntable.

67
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,511
If the cyanide-laced towel

68
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,411
is placed at the edge of the turntable

69
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,811
and it is rotated cleverly,

70
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:32,411
it can fall right in front of Mr. Kawabata.

71
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:34,711
How's that?

72
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:37,211
But, how?

73
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:41,011
If something like that falls, everybody will find it strange, right?

74
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:44,611
So, that's why it has to be done cleverly so nobody notices.

75
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,611
If nobody sees it,

76
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,411
the speed with which the turntable

77
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,711
has to turn to drop off the towel

78
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:54,411
would make all the plates fall off, too.

79
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:56,811
In the first place,

80
00:05:56,811 --> 00:06:01,411
who'd use such a towel when you have one yourself?

81
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,311
You're right.

82
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:06,511
Wait.

83
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:10,811
I remember when I tried to get the soy sauce and the chili oil,

84
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:13,611
the turntable rotated so many times, that they were hard to get.

85
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:18,411
The order of the dishes that were placed on the turntable

86
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,511
was in the clockwise direction.

87
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,011
The pork dish.

88
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,511
Beef and green peppers.

89
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,911
Crab and eggs.

90
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:29,511
Pitan.

91
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:32,811
Sweet and sour pork.

92
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,111
And the steamer lid.

93
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:37,811
The soy sauce was between the sweet and sour pork and the pitans,

94
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:42,211
and the chili oil was between the pork dish and the steamer lid.

95
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,111
At that time, the order of the seats was...

96
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,411
Starting with the victim Mr. Kawabata, in the clockwise direction.

97
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:49,511
Me, Ran,

98
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:51,111
Mr. Kitaura,

99
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:55,511
Mr. Ito, Mr. Isogami, and Pops.

100
00:06:56,611 --> 00:07:00,211
And the soy sauce went back in front of Pops again and again.

101
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,611
And the chili oil went back in front of Mr. Kitaura.

102
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,911
Oh, yes, Mr. Kawabata said...

103
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:12,011
Actually, I'm allergic to eggs

104
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,811
and hate even the sight of it.

105
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,511
Hate even the sight of it?

106
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,811
Okay, work on this area with caution.

107
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:27,911
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:31,411
Excuse me, officer.

109
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:34,111
There's something I'd like to ask you.

110
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,611
What's that, kid?

111
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:39,811
If you checked the food, you must have checked the plates

112
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:43,011
-and the top of the table as well, right? -Yeah.

113
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,411
Then...

114
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,611
Did you check places like that?

115
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,911
No, not yet.

116
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:55,411
Then, Uncle Kogoro is asking you to check it right away.

117
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,311
What? You mean Sleeping Kogoro?

118
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,511
Yes, also,

119
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,211
did you find anything funny on the towel with cyanide?

120
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:05,911
Huh? You mean other than the cyanide?

121
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:10,611
Oh, yes!

122
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,811
There was a light brown stain!

123
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:16,811
I sniffed it, and that's soup for sure.

124
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:19,311
You must have seen it, right?

125
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,811
Mr. Kawabata spilled the soup on his jeans

126
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,611
and wiped it with the towel, right?

127
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,111
It's a stain from the spill.

128
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,411
-Anything else? -What?

129
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,711
You found nothing else?

130
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,111
Oh, no.

131
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,711
Nothing special.

132
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,711
Really?

133
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:37,911
Nothing else, right?

134
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,311
Then, I'll tell that to Uncle Kogoro.

135
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,111
I was right.

136
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:47,211
Mr. Kawabata was not killed by

137
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,611
switching his towel with the poisoned one.

138
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,511
The towel was switched after he was killed.

139
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:57,211
By that person.

140
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:02,711
If that is right, the evidence must still be there.

141
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:05,011
On that table.

142
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,411
Anyway!

143
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,511
The killer is the one who laced his own towel

144
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,211
with cyanide in the restroom

145
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:21,211
and switched it with the victim's towel at the table.

146
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,111
Yeah,

147
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,011
without attracting the attention of

148
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,911
Ran, Conan and me sitting on both sides.

149
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,411
But how? How can you do that?

150
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:37,111
Oh, yes! All three suspects are in the movie industry!

151
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:40,211
Maybe he used an invisible line used in special effects

152
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,711
to move the towel.

153
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,111
For goodness's sake.

154
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,711
They've got to turn down the air conditioning.

155
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,811
What is it, Inspector Yokomizo?

156
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:59,311
Well, there's something I heard from my brother.

157
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:03,711
Kogoro Mouri makes bizarre, out-of-place comments at first,

158
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,811
but it's only to fool people.

159
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,811
His attitude changes abruptly with a weird voice and dance.

160
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:14,411
As if a spirit takes hold of him.

161
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:19,211
But, of course, he can be exaggerating.

162
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,911
Oh, but...

163
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,711
Is that what your brother mean by...

164
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,711
a weird dance?

165
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,711
So, enough joking around.

166
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,911
Now, I would like you to take your seats.

167
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:42,811
At the same table the crime took place.

168
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:47,311
There was Mr. Ito, Mr. Isogami and Mr. Kitamura.

169
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:51,511
Then, I'll be able to tell you everything,

170
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:55,211
what happened during dinner.

171
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:59,411
It's happening! The Sleeping Kogoro detective show!

172
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,311
First, I would like to have

173
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:06,011
Inspector Yokomizo take a seat where the victim sat.

174
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:10,911
From his right, in the exact same seating arrangement,

175
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:13,711
there's me and Mr. Isogami.

176
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:16,811
Mr. Ito and Mr. Kitaura.

177
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,711
Next, at Ran's seat,

178
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,211
I'd like another police officer.

179
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:24,211
Why?

180
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:27,711
My daughter is a bit indisposed.

181
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,611
I'm all right.

182
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:33,211
I can do it.

183
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:37,211
Ran.

184
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:43,111
And Conan sits between Ran and the victim.

185
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:51,111
Now that all the seats are taken,

186
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,111
I would like to hear an exclamation

187
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,011
of a mysterious incident that took place immediately

188
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,811
before the crime.

189
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,811
A mysterious incident?

190
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,011
Yes, the table. Somebody was moving the turntable,

191
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,011
trying to give me a hard time.

192
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:07,211
Look! Do you see the bottle of soy sauce

193
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,711
on the turntable right in front of Uncle Kogoro?

194
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,511
I moved the turntable to get the soy sauce.

195
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,511
Each time I tried to get it,

196
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,711
it will return immediately in front of Uncle.

197
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,611
No matter how many times I do it.

198
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,111
The same thing happened

199
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,411
with the chili oil in front of Mr. Kitaura.

200
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,311
Each time the bottle came close to me,

201
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:33,311
it would go back to where it was right away.

202
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:37,611
This means that someone was having fun, giving me a hard time, right?

203
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,211
Hey, Mr. Detective.

204
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:43,611
Is what the kid is saying related to the crime?

205
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:47,211
Hey. Tell me.

206
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,211
It's all right.

207
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:54,411
Uncle Kogoro said we don't have to do anything

208
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:56,911
for the culprit will expose himself.

209
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,711
Expose himself?

210
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:03,011
Here you are, little boy. Your bun!

211
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,811
Wow! Thank you!

212
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:07,711
Hey. Why now?

213
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,311
Oh, yes.

214
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:15,911
Detective Mouri ordered Chinese bun for this little boy.

215
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,211
Thank you! First, a big bite!

216
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,111
Stop!

217
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,911
What is it, Mr. Isogami?

218
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,411
Think!

219
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,811
Somebody got killed just now at this table!

220
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:32,611
Poison might still be found somewhere on the table!

221
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,611
And you allow a kid to eat with his hands here?

222
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:40,211
But, the forensics have already checked

223
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,211
-and did not find cyanide anywhere... -No!

224
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,311
Mr. Isogami is right.

225
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:47,511
There might still be cyanide.

226
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:52,011
Somewhere where we cannot see.

227
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,462
Don't fool around with me! Get to the point!

228
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,962
Who's the culprit, and where's the cyanide?

229
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,362
How would you turn it?

230
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:18,362
-What? -The turntable.

231
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:22,162
How? Of course, you place your hand like this.

232
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,262
Then, what would you do if plates are crowded

233
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,262
like this egg and crab dish and the pitan?

234
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,462
Well, in that case,

235
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:38,662
I'll pick up the edge of the turntable with my fingers.

236
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:41,762
Don't tell me that...

237
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:44,962
The cyanide is under the turntable?

238
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:48,962
No, wait.

239
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,762
There are a lot of problems here making the victim touch this.

240
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:57,262
What is Mr. Kawabata didn't like these two dishes?

241
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:02,062
What if he hates even the sight of them?

242
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:06,762
Is that right?

243
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:07,862
Yes.

244
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,462
Mr. Kawabata was allergic to eggs.

245
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:14,062
Now, Inspector Yokomizo, please check.

246
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,662
Right in front of you, seated at the victim's chair.

247
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:20,262
are the two dishes.

248
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,162
Now, where is the chili oil?

249
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,762
In... in front of Mr. Kitaura.

250
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,962
Yes, of course.

251
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,362
That's why, when the kid tried to get the chili oil,

252
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:34,062
the turntable was returned to the original position.

253
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:37,162
The victim would try to avoid the two dishes

254
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:40,662
and hold the table to moving around, again and again.

255
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:44,562
Well, it might be true for the chili oil.

256
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:47,062
But this time, the soy sauce is in front of the kid.

257
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:51,262
Why then did the table turn when he tried to get the soy sauce?

258
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:53,062
To get the victim to touch the cyanide,

259
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,062
you have to get the cyanide on that spot, right?

260
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:59,462
In addition, the cyanide must be

261
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:02,562
applied immediately before the Peking Duck is served,

262
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,062
a dish you have to eat with your fingers.

263
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:10,962
If you do that earlier, somebody might touch it accidentally.

264
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,262
Then, when the kid tried to get the soy sauce,

265
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:17,362
he had not applied the cyanide yet?

266
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:18,762
Right.

267
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:21,062
Most probably, the culprit tried to apply cyanide

268
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:24,362
on the underside of the turntable where the two plates were placed,

269
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:27,462
when the waiter could be seen bringing the Peking Duck.

270
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,462
He couldn't apply the cyanide

271
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,562
and turned the turntable again and again,

272
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,962
because Conan would rotate it.

273
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:36,062
You mean the person who had the two plates in front of him

274
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,962
when the soy sauce was in front of you is the...

275
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:39,962
Yes.

276
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:42,462
That person

277
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:45,562
killed Mr. Kawabata...

278
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:48,862
Here. Tonight.

279
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:51,662
Mr. Isogami!

280
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:58,862
Then, what was that towel with so much cyanide?

281
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:02,262
That was Mr. Isogami's towel.

282
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:05,062
He brought the towel to the restroom,

283
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:07,562
poured cyanide on it, and returned to his seat.

284
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:12,862
He applied the cyanide on that spot.

285
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:17,762
In the chaos that ensued when Mr. Kawabata lost consciousness,

286
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:20,562
he switched towels.

287
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:23,162
To make sure nobody notices the switch,

288
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:26,162
he drenched his own towel with soup.

289
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,462
He wanted to make the towel look identical

290
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:33,562
to Mr. Kawabata's towel after he wipe the soup of his pants,

291
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:36,862
but you missed one small point

292
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:40,762
that Mr. Kawabata was wearing jeans.

293
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:42,362
Yes.

294
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:48,362
On Mr. Kawabata's towel that you switched,

295
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:51,662
along with the soup stain,

296
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:55,462
there was a blue stain from his jeans.

297
00:17:58,462 --> 00:17:59,862
I get it.

298
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,662
If that towel is right in front of Mr. Isogami,

299
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:09,462
that is proof that he is the killer.

300
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:14,062
No. That towel is not proof enough.

301
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,162
There is the possibility that the towel

302
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,262
was placed there to frame Mr. Isogami.

303
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:25,262
But, you will confess, won't you? Mr. Isogami?

304
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:30,162
When Conan touch the place with cyanide just a while ago,

305
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:32,862
and he tried to eat the bun with those hands,

306
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,062
you stop him.

307
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,862
There is enough conscience...

308
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:41,562
left in you.

309
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,262
Conscience?

310
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:05,262
If that scoundrel who let Rika die had a bit of conscience,

311
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:08,462
I wouldn't be doing this.

312
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,162
Rika? You mean the girl who died a year ago?

313
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:15,662
But, that was an accident during the shoot.

314
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,162
It was no accident.

315
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,562
That was full-fledged murder.

316
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:30,862
He knew all along that Rika took over the stunt

317
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:34,662
in the last scene from the stunt pro.

318
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:36,762
Really?

319
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:44,462
He told me that he made her wish to do it on her own come true.

320
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:47,762
He said the movie became a hit, thanks to her,

321
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,462
grinning that evil grin.

322
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:54,662
We had so many opportunities to stop that.

323
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,262
But why?

324
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:04,562
You yourself snubbed her for being such a ham.

325
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:07,462
You're still green.

326
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:11,462
A director's job is a sad one.

327
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:15,362
When you keep on looking at the actress through the camera lens,

328
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:17,962
you fall in love with her.

329
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,262
No matter how amateurish.

330
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,562
Or uncouth.

331
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:25,162
It just happens.

332
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:32,462
You'll never get to direct a film, if you don't understand that.

333
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:34,462
Okay, let's go.

334
00:20:35,762 --> 00:20:37,462
We'll talk to you at the station.

335
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:44,362
Mr. Detective,

336
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:47,762
I'm sure you had already wiped off the cyanide.

337
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,862
But, what were you planning if I had pretended

338
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,462
not to know and let him die?

339
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:57,062
If I was a man like that scoundrel?

340
00:20:57,862 --> 00:21:02,462
Then, I was planning to say something different to corner you.

341
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:07,462
And stop you from trying to make excuses.

342
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:10,462
I wanted to see that.

343
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:17,462
I have a gripe to whoever gave me this thing called conscience.

344
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:22,462
As a film director, I most certainly wanted

345
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:25,562
to see you interrogate ruthlessly.

346
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:30,662
I'm not the one to believe in a god.

347
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,062
God?

348
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:37,062
Is there a god in this world?

349
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,962
That voice. Who?

350
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:42,662
That calm voice of a woman.

351
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:44,262
Who is it?

352
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:46,862
Ran?

353
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:48,762
Rain.

354
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:52,262
The noise of the rain is fading.

355
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:54,962
Should there?

356
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:57,162
I can hear.

357
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,162
Should there be a reason?

358
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,862
Should there be a reason?

359
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:07,662
Is there a god?

360
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,062
Japanese?

361
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,862
No. The angel did not smile at me.

362
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,262
Get out!

363
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:18,362
Not even once.

364
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:19,962
Sharon.

365
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:21,862
Yes.

366
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,862
That time,

367
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,862
I met her.

368
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,762
With Shinichi.

369
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:29,762
That...

370
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:33,762
Ran!

371
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,162
Ran, can you hear me?

372
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:09,662
What happened, kid?

373
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,062
Ran is...

374
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:16,562
She's so hot!

375
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:18,762
-We need an ambulance! -Yes, sir!

376
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:20,962
Ran...

377
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,662
Ran, can you hear me?

378
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:26,262
Is that you?

379
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:29,662
Shinichi?

380
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,662
Next Conan,

381
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:35,762
"Shinichi In New York (Part 1)"

382
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,789
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,789
"Stage costume"

384
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:43,289
We are in New York, again.

385
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:45,589
A case from a while back.
