1
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.040
Abduction and ransom.

2
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.540
Money is usually the objective,

3
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.740
but something is strange about today's incident.

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.640
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:13.625
2:30 is the time that I get sleepy.

8
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:22.925
What happened?

9
00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:27.325
-Call the police! -Ambulance! Call an ambulance.

10
00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:34.125
There's no need to call an ambulance.

11
00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.425
He died on the spot.

12
00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:37.125
He was going at tremendous speed.

13
00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.625
He couldn't possibly have controlled the wheels at the speed he was going.

14
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.425
What's with this load of cash?

15
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:50.525
Unreal.

16
00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:53.025
Huh? There seems to be a letter inside.

17
00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:54.425
Give it to me!

18
00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.925
"Here is 30,000,000 yen. I haven't contact the police.

19
00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:02.425
Please return my father right away. Domoto."

20
00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:04.825
Which means that this money is...

21
00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:08.825
Ransom that was prepared to get back a hostage.

22
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:15.725
"A Mock Kidnap... Case"

23
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:28.225
The name of the man who died is Takeshi Hirano.

24
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:30.825
He has a record of being arrested for threatening and taking cash.

25
00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:33.225
He's on the kidnappers side for sure.

26
00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:36.625
I wonder if he was on his way back after taking the ransom money?

27
00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.625
If Hirano alone committed this crime,

28
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.025
we've got trouble.

29
00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:45.225
Nobody knows where the kidnapped person is being confined.

30
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.125
On top of that, we don't have time.

31
00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:51.225
"My father has kidney ailment.

32
00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:53.625
He needs medication every six hours.

33
00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:57.625
I've enclose it, so please administer it to him."

34
00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:02.625
It means that the hostage will not get this medication.

35
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.725
Unless we hurry and find the hostage.

36
00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.625
But where is he being confined?

37
00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:11.825
First, we've got to find out who the hostage is.

38
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:15.125
We know his last name is Domoto but Domoto of where?

39
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.225
Maybe he was visiting a hospital

40
00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:18.425
to get his medicine.

41
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.325
This is Beika Electric Company.

42
00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:30.225
We've come to deliver the TV set you ordered.

43
00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:32.625
I haven't ordered it.

44
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:34.425
Maybe it's some mistake?

45
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:37.425
No. It's no mistake.

46
00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:39.925
Please verify the order form.

47
00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.925
We did not order any TV set.

48
00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:51.225
We're the police.

49
00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:52.825
Dear.

50
00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.225
The police?

51
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:56.025
Hey, long time no see!

52
00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:57.525
Remember I was an upperclassman at the same university?

53
00:04:57.525 --> 00:04:58.925
It's me, me.

54
00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:00.525
And I'm his son!

55
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:02.525
How do you do?

56
00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:05.225
How come you're here, too?

57
00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.425
You'll look less suspicious with a child, right?

58
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:11.125
This is a kidnap case, isn't it?

59
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.525
Yes.

60
00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.925
Our father...

61
00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:18.425
We matched the "Domotos"

62
00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:22.025
that live within Tokyo and visit the hospital for kidney ailment,

63
00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:25.225
and came up with your father.

64
00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:28.725
Mr. Shozo Domoto, who goes to the Beika Central Hospital.

65
00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.025
But why?

66
00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.125
We were told that if we report this to the police, father would be killed.

67
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.225
The situation has changed.

68
00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:38.125
Why does the police have this?

69
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.825
We left it where we were told to leave it.

70
00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:45.425
That culprit passed away of a traffic accident while on his motorbike.

71
00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:47.525
The culprit?

72
00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:49.825
Please don't give up.

73
00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:52.525
We are tracing the friends of this man.

74
00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:53.925
We're hoping to find the place

75
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.925
where your father is being confined from the hints we may get from them.

76
00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:59.225
To think that this did not reach father.

77
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.625
It says every six hours,

78
00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:04.325
but when is the last time your father was injected?

79
00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:05.825
At 9:00 this morning.

80
00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.825
Which means the next shot...

81
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.525
has to be given to him at 3:00 in the afternoon.

82
00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:12.325
It's way past time!

83
00:06:14.525 --> 00:06:15.525
Inspector.

84
00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:21.025
It's not that he's going to fall into serious condition right away,

85
00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:24.125
but if there is a time span of more than eight hours...

86
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.825
The limit is eight hours, which means...

87
00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:28.825
The time limit is 5:00 in the afternoon.

88
00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:30.625
There's only an hour and a half left.

89
00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:36.025
Please tell us when and in what way your father was kidnapped,

90
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.925
as well as how you coped with the situation.

91
00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:40.425
The more in detail the better.

92
00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:42.825
There are four of us living here.

93
00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:46.125
Shosaburo Domoto, my father who runs a metal processing company,

94
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.425
his only daughter, me,

95
00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:50.325
my husband Akinori

96
00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:53.925
and our housekeeper, Masayo.

97
00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:57.025
Today is the company's establishment day, so it was closed.

98
00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:59.525
That's why everyone was at home from morning.

99
00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:02.725
I'm also working at father's company.

100
00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:05.425
You have married into your wife's family.

101
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.125
And will eventually become the heir.

102
00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:14.425
I injected father at 9:00 in the morning,

103
00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:16.825
and went to visit a friend of mine.

104
00:07:20.725 --> 00:07:24.625
I had promised to go see her from sometime before.

105
00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:28.025
After that, father went out for a walk.

106
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.325
He always does on his days off.

107
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:33.625
And at about 10:00, I went into my study

108
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.825
because I had some documents I had to get together.

109
00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:43.225
At about 11:00, when I was cleaning the bath tub, the phone rang.

110
00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:45.125
It was the voice of a young man.

111
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:46.825
Get one of the family members on the phone.

112
00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:51.225
This is Domoto speaking.

113
00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:53.125
What? Kidnap?

114
00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:56.925
In other words, Mr. Shosaburo Domoto was kidnapped

115
00:07:56.925 --> 00:08:02.225
while taking a walk between the hours of 09:00 to 11:00.

116
00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:09.925
When he takes a walk, does he always walk the same course?

117
00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:11.725
Yes, it's almost always the same.

118
00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.625
Can you tell me about where it is?

119
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.625
There could be a hint leading to the place of confinement.

120
00:08:18.825 --> 00:08:20.025
I'll go look.

121
00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:26.325
I called and told her to come home right away.

122
00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:30.325
I'll do everything I can to get together the ransom of 30,000,000 yen

123
00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:33.725
that is being demanded, so don't worry.

124
00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:37.025
As long as we give them the money, father will be all right.

125
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:38.425
Leave it to me.

126
00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:41.825
I'm counting on you, Akinari!

127
00:08:52.525 --> 00:08:54.725
Now, everything will be okay.

128
00:08:54.725 --> 00:08:56.925
Thank you, Akinari.

129
00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:04.025
Hello.

130
00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:06.125
Yes, the ransom...

131
00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:22.925
"I'll return the hostage as soon as I confirm the cash, so wait at home."

132
00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:25.525
I believed what he told me.

133
00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:29.425
I even enclosed the medicine just in case, too.

134
00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:33.125
5:00. Only one more hour to go before the time limit.

135
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:36.325
Don't cry. I know father's going to come back safely.

136
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:39.125
Yes, we'd like to pray that he's okay,

137
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:40.925
regardless of how we usually feel about him.

138
00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:52.625
Uncle Kogoro told me to ask you.

139
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:53.625
What did you mean when you said,

140
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:55.625
"regardless of how we usually feel about him" a while ago?

141
00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.725
Well...

142
00:09:57.725 --> 00:10:03.025
Akinari always had it tough with Mr. Domoto.

143
00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:04.825
Had it tough?

144
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:07.425
Of all things,

145
00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.825
I feel no ambition or spirit from you at all.

146
00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:14.825
I'm trying the best I can for the company, too.

147
00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:19.025
You're just not cut out to take after me.

148
00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:21.125
Just looking at you makes me lose my appetite.

149
00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:23.425
Father!

150
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.625
Mr. Domoto is strict to the point

151
00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:29.525
that it makes you wonder why he's so hard on Akinari.

152
00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:32.625
But his wife protects him at times like these, right?

153
00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:38.025
When they first got married, they really got along well.

154
00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:40.425
But recently, even Mrs. Domoto...

155
00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:43.825
Aren't you vexed?

156
00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:47.825
Making him talk that way about you. Be a man!

157
00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:50.925
Mitsuko, why are you acting like this?

158
00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:54.725
I wonder if it's her father's influence?

159
00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:58.125
But him being kidnapped is another story.

160
00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:02.425
Even Akinari will worry about him and hope that he is safe.

161
00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:06.325
That's why he gathered the ransom with all his might.

162
00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:11.825
I guess so.

163
00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:14.025
This has nothing to do with the kidnapping.

164
00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:19.225
It's me.

165
00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:21.325
According to a friend who goes around with Takeshi Hirano,

166
00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:24.925
he says that Hirano seemed to have a lot of money on him since a week ago.

167
00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:28.725
Which means that Hirano was hired and paid by someone.

168
00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:32.025
Probably.

169
00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.925
But I haven't got info on who hired him yet.

170
00:11:34.925 --> 00:11:37.025
So, you don't know who it is yet.

171
00:11:37.025 --> 00:11:39.625
Continue asking around his friends and acquaintances.

172
00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.325
If only we can find who it is,

173
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.425
we may get a hint on where Mr. Domoto is being confined.

174
00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:46.225
There's another mastermind behind this.

175
00:11:46.225 --> 00:11:48.325
But if so, something is odd.

176
00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:49.625
Something's strange, isn't it, Inspector?

177
00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:50.725
What is?

178
00:11:50.725 --> 00:11:52.025
The mastermind.

179
00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:56.025
The guy who went to get the ransom hasn't come back for a while.

180
00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:57.625
Therefore, wouldn't he normally call to demand

181
00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:59.325
what happened to the money, saying,

182
00:11:59.325 --> 00:12:02.725
"What happened to the money? Are going to leave the hostage to die?"

183
00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:04.725
I see. Now that you mentioned it.

184
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.225
Exactly.

185
00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.525
Why does the mastermind seem quite indifferent to the money

186
00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:11.025
after having demanded it?

187
00:12:14.725 --> 00:12:15.925
Father!

188
00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:16.925
Mitsuko.

189
00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:20.125
Maybe the real purpose of this kidnapping is...

190
00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:27.425
I see.

191
00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:29.225
If so...

192
00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.925
Oh, my. What is it now, kid?

193
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:36.225
Mr. Akinari Domoto was in his study all morning today, right?

194
00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:37.925
Yes, he had work to do.

195
00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:40.525
Did he say something to you back then?

196
00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:41.925
Something?

197
00:12:41.925 --> 00:12:43.825
Well...

198
00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:47.125
Masayo, I'm going to concentrate on work for a while.

199
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.525
So you don't have to bring me tea or anything.

200
00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:51.325
Just as I thought.

201
00:12:51.325 --> 00:12:52.425
If so...

202
00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:10.025
Machine oil.

203
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:22.025
No doubt about it.

204
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.725
I figured out who the real culprit of this kidnapping case is.

205
00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:25.725
But I know that the person will play dumb

206
00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:27.525
even if I try to pressure him for a confession.

207
00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.325
And the time limit will eventually come.

208
00:13:30.725 --> 00:13:35.525
That's the real purpose behind all this, not the ransom.

209
00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:38.025
It's 4:30, only 30 minutes more to go.

210
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:40.825
Where is the place the hostage is confined?

211
00:13:46.589 --> 00:13:49.489
Hey, kid. What're you doing staring at a map?

212
00:13:50.489 --> 00:13:53.889
I was just wondering where the motorbike was headed for.

213
00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:57.289
Where? The hideout where the hostage is confined.

214
00:13:57.289 --> 00:14:00.989
That's why from the place he picked up the ransom in Beika Park,

215
00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:02.989
to the scene of the accident, over here.

216
00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:04.189
If you draw a line beyond it is...

217
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:06.589
Most likely.

218
00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:08.289
But Conan...

219
00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:12.989
But you can't tell if it's 10 or 100 kilometres away.

220
00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:15.789
Huh? There's a place with the same name as this house.

221
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:17.189
Huh?

222
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.889
Domoto Metal Processing?

223
00:14:19.989 --> 00:14:22.489
That's our factory.

224
00:14:22.489 --> 00:14:26.289
But since we moved and built a new one in East Beika six months ago,

225
00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:28.089
it's closed down now.

226
00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:29.989
Which means it's not in use anymore.

227
00:14:29.989 --> 00:14:33.889
So nobody is there or will come there anymore.

228
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:36.289
Inspector, it's the ideal place for confining someone.

229
00:14:36.289 --> 00:14:38.489
Very probable.

230
00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:39.589
Conan, give me the map.

231
00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:41.189
Yes, sir!

232
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:43.589
Then, father is in that factory?

233
00:14:43.589 --> 00:14:46.389
There's a possibility he is.

234
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:49.189
There's only 15 more minutes left.

235
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:53.189
Mrs. Domoto, please don't give up until the end.

236
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:54.689
Pops, great phrase.

237
00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:58.489
Please hold up for another 15 minutes.

238
00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:09.289
Stop. Time, please stop.

239
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:11.589
Father.

240
00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:24.489
Give it to me, I'll open it.

241
00:15:29.289 --> 00:15:30.689
Father!

242
00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:32.189
-Mr. Domoto! -Mr. Domoto!

243
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.289
Father!

244
00:15:40.289 --> 00:15:41.289
Father.

245
00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:54.689
Father!

246
00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:55.889
He's still breathing!

247
00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.489
This is Takagi.

248
00:15:58.489 --> 00:15:59.689
Please send an ambulance over.

249
00:15:59.689 --> 00:16:00.889
The location is...

250
00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:11.389
Mr. Domoto, get a hold of yourself!

251
00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:20.789
Your wife will head for the hospital.

252
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:22.689
You go, too.

253
00:16:22.689 --> 00:16:23.989
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:29.289
Please wait, Mr. Domoto.

255
00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.489
Why?

256
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:34.189
He's transformed into the Sleeping Koori!

257
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:35.589
Mr. Mouri?

258
00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:41.489
I believe that Mr. Domoto will be all right,

259
00:16:41.489 --> 00:16:46.289
regardless of whether you hope otherwise, Akinari.

260
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:50.689
Hope otherwise?

261
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:52.389
Just what do you mean?

262
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:53.789
The minute I found out

263
00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:58.589
that this kidnapping was not after ransom, I realized something.

264
00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.889
According to what Conan heard from Masayo, the housekeeper,

265
00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:06.589
you and Mitsuko really got along, and got married loving each other.

266
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:10.589
But after you entered the Domoto family as her wedded husband...

267
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.089
tough days of being criticized by Mr. Domoto for not being ambitious

268
00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.789
or not being fit for being an heir continued everyday.

269
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:23.489
You most naturally hated Mr. Domoto

270
00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:26.089
and thought you'd like to erase him from this world.

271
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:28.989
Don't tell me...

272
00:17:28.989 --> 00:17:32.089
But you didn't have the courage to do so.

273
00:17:32.089 --> 00:17:35.289
Therefore, you thought up this scheme.

274
00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:36.789
Scheme?

275
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.689
Don't be ridiculous. Just what're you talking about?

276
00:17:38.689 --> 00:17:39.889
I know nothing of it.

277
00:17:39.889 --> 00:17:43.589
No! The culprit is Akinari, Inspector Megure.

278
00:17:43.589 --> 00:17:44.589
What?

279
00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:46.689
It can't be.

280
00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:50.089
Mr. Domoto was kidnapped while taking a walk.

281
00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:52.189
At that time Akinari was...

282
00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:54.589
I was doing my work in the study!

283
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.889
I wonder if that's true?

284
00:17:56.889 --> 00:17:59.289
When going into the study, you...

285
00:17:59.289 --> 00:18:02.789
Masayo, I'm going to concentrate on work for a while.

286
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:04.589
So you don't have to bring me tea or anything.

287
00:18:06.989 --> 00:18:10.889
And after saying so to Masayo,

288
00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.789
you wore the shoes that you prepared beforehand.

289
00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:21.589
You caught up with Mr. Domoto who was taking a walk

290
00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:22.989
and got him to get in the car.

291
00:18:24.889 --> 00:18:27.089
What on earth do you want to talk to me about

292
00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:29.489
after bringing me to a place like this?

293
00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:31.689
I tell you, what kind of man are you.

294
00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:33.889
If you have something you want to say, just get to the point.

295
00:18:35.389 --> 00:18:36.389
Oh, no.

296
00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:39.289
Akinari, take me home quickly.

297
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:41.089
I don't have my medicine with me.

298
00:18:58.589 --> 00:19:00.489
Akinari, there's a phone call for you.

299
00:19:05.889 --> 00:19:08.289
What? Kidnap?

300
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:12.689
And you acted out the role of the victim.

301
00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:16.289
Of course there is evidence, too.

302
00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:18.489
The same kind of machine oil

303
00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.289
that is smeared over the floor of this factory,

304
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:24.189
should be found on the frame of the window frame of your study,

305
00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:27.289
showing that you went out and came back in from the window.

306
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:29.889
I'm sure that the tissue paper that you used to wipe it off

307
00:19:29.889 --> 00:19:32.189
can also be found somewhere in the room.

308
00:19:32.189 --> 00:19:33.589
And above all,

309
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:36.189
your footprints when you went in and out of your study.

310
00:19:38.389 --> 00:19:42.189
From the Domoto residence to here, it takes an hour to go and come back.

311
00:19:42.189 --> 00:19:43.989
It was possible for you to commit the crime

312
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:49.489
between 10:00 to 11:00, the time you were confined to your study.

313
00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:51.089
It is possible,

314
00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.489
but he didn't have to do it himself.

315
00:19:53.489 --> 00:19:57.389
He could've made the guy Hirano that he hired do it, couldn't he?

316
00:19:57.389 --> 00:19:59.289
That man was probably not told

317
00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:03.289
that he was lending a hand to kidnapping.

318
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:04.789
He lent a hand without knowing?

319
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:08.089
Akinari asked Hirano to do just two things.

320
00:20:08.089 --> 00:20:11.589
Call me at 11:00 in the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon,

321
00:20:11.589 --> 00:20:15.189
then pick up a trunk at Beika Park.

322
00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:18.989
It's for your benefit not to know what's inside the trunk or who I am.

323
00:20:18.989 --> 00:20:22.989
Because if he tells of his scheme, Hirano would hold his weak point.

324
00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:26.289
And aware that his wife was going out,

325
00:20:26.289 --> 00:20:28.489
he decided to carry out his scheme today.

326
00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:30.389
What? Kidnapped father?

327
00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:33.189
Ransom...

328
00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:34.389
Beika Park...

329
00:20:34.389 --> 00:20:37.089
In other words, he was acting the conversation out alone.

330
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.289
Yes. Only if Hirano didn't get into an accident,

331
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:53.389
The money could be retrieved later,

332
00:20:53.389 --> 00:20:56.789
and the scheme would've worked out fine,

333
00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:00.289
with neither the police nor the detective showing up.

334
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:05.689
All he had to do was pretend to be worried about Shosaburo and wait.

335
00:21:07.489 --> 00:21:08.989
Exactly.

336
00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:12.089
But the motive is not correct, Mr. Mouri.

337
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:16.689
It's true that I hated him.

338
00:21:16.689 --> 00:21:19.089
I did want him to disappear.

339
00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:20.389
But that's not all.

340
00:21:21.389 --> 00:21:23.989
I wanted to show my wife

341
00:21:23.989 --> 00:21:26.389
how hard I tried to get the money together.

342
00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:27.989
I thought that if she saw that,

343
00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:31.989
her love for me would return once again.

344
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:04.989
It's me, Mitsuko!

345
00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:08.489
I'm glad. Father's life has been saved.

346
00:23:08.489 --> 00:23:10.789
When he regains consciousness, I'll tell him

347
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:13.989
how desperately you went around to gather money for him,

348
00:23:13.989 --> 00:23:15.989
as well as how worried you were.

349
00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:17.389
I'm sure that father

350
00:23:17.389 --> 00:23:21.389
will stop deliberately taking his anger out on you from now on.

351
00:23:21.389 --> 00:23:23.189
Deliberately?

352
00:23:23.189 --> 00:23:26.989
In order to make you a fine heir,

353
00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:29.489
father deliberately took on the hated role and acted it out.

354
00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:32.789
Because father actually likes you.
