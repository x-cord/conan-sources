00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,210
A murder occurred at a theater

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,490
holding a lecture titled "The Great
Detective Mori Kogoro Reveals His Secrets."

Panelist and actor Inokoshi Kenichiro-san

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,680
was found murdered inside
his locked changing room.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,300
I knew it.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,200
The body's keeping the door
shut instead of the lock.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,220
In other words, this is...

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,290
Yeah.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,940
It's a locked room mystery.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,830
What?

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,270
The old man solved the locked room mystery,

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,570
and it seemed as though the
suspect had been identified.

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,860
But the suspect Reizei
Mokichi-san confessed to...

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,850
I knew you'd spot my cane trick eventually.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,330
But I killed someone else.

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,470
Wha—

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,840
Wh-What?!

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,680
Right now at this moment,
light pierces the darkness!

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,560
Overcome all limits with
your cool reasoning skills!

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,310
The old man's reasoning was right,
but in reality, there are two cases!

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,280
Always determining the one truth

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,020
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,440
his name is Detective Conan!

00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:44,077
Once again, we have an
announcement for our guests.

35
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:47,137
Due to certain circumstances,

36
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:47,467
With Inspector Megure's approval,

41
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,717
Anyway, I'm terribly sorry
for the inconvenience,

42
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,717
but we appreciate your cooperation.

I'm in a bit of a bind though.

48
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,477
What do you mean?

49
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,647
I'm honored I was invited
to appear on the panel.

I'm honored I was invited

00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:13,227
I'm honored I was invited
to appear on the panel.

52
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:16,807
But I have plans immediately after this.

53
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,837
I can't accommodate a one hour delay.

54
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,107
I see.

55
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:25,367
And you verified my alibi, didn't you?

56
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,107
Of course.

57
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,207
In that case...

58
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:34,297
But that alibi applies only to
Inokoshi Kenichiro-san's murder.

59
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:41,727
Reizei may have confessed to
Hishida Junko-san's murder,

60
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:44,437
but we haven't even determined
the time of death—

61
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:44,927
Inspector!

62
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:48,427
We've determined the time of the crime.

63
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:56,727
I just couldn't. I just couldn't accept it!

64
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,747
Disregarding the achievements
of the late previous owner—

65
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:04,277
rather, her father, was her style.

66
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:06,997
Emergency Exit
rather, her father, was her style.

67
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:12,127
I wanted her to understand, so we
continued our conversation there.

68
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:14,207
But...

69
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:17,377
You never give up. I've had enough of you.

70
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:19,377
Wh-What?!

71
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:40,437
Take a look at this and this.

72
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,307
Th-This is...

73
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:50,347
Wasn't Inokoshi-san's time of death 2:50?

74
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:51,457
Yes.

75
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:56,537
That's the time the victim's pocket watch
broken by the weapon was stopped at.

76
00:05:56,807 --> 00:06:02,777
Which means Inokoshi-san
wasn't killed by Reizei-san.

77
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:06,547
In other words, there's another culprit.

78
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,407
I know it's a coincidence,
but this isn't good.

79
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,997
That's not all that's not good, Inspector.

80
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:13,767
What?

81
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:15,967
Have you forgotten?

82
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:19,517
The two murders took place
at practically the same time.

83
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,667
Aside from Reizei-san,

84
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:27,277
the people whose alibis we verified for
Inokoshi-san's murder were all innocent.

85
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:28,637
In other words...

86
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:32,907
Not a single person doesn't have an alibi.

87
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,987
Is it true that the owner
Hishida was killed as well?

88
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,657
And the culprit was...

89
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,777
Yeah.

90
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:53,127
That old man Reizei, the manager before me.

91
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,937
Did he kill Inokoshi-san, too?

00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:06,567
No way.

99
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:11,287
A-Are you sure we shouldn't cancel the lecture?

100
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:11,767
If they don't arrest the culprit...

107
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:26,467
So focus on assisting the audience.

108
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:31,467
And don't mention the case until the
police explain the situation later.

109
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,537
U-Understood.

110
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,587
We'll be standing by.

111
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:36,727
Huh?

112
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:40,147
Come to think of it, where's Mei-chan?

113
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:44,857
Do you not care about
the game? It's starting.

114
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,507
I know, but we can't leave now.

115
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:53,867
We have less than thirty minutes
until the old man's lecture starts.

116
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:59,247
Maybe so, but we need to come with
an excuse to tell those kids.

117
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,667
You can handle that.

118
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,817
Jeez.

119
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,507
Excuse me!

120
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:08,097
Kogoro-no-ojisan asked me to do something.

121
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,267
So, do you have any leads?

122
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,787
Huh? Nope.

123
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,997
You're unbelievable.

124
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:23,747
What's that?

125
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:27,597
This wasn't here before, right?

126
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:31,327
Are those pages from a magazine or something?

127
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,157
Looks like they were torn out.

128
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,737
Judging by the quality of the paper and
print, they're probably from the same magazine.

129
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:46,857
There's been a guard standing in front of this
changing room since after the scene was examined.

130
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:52,497
So they reached in through the
window so they wouldn't be spotted?

131
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:57,487
The question is who left it
here, and for what purpose.

132
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,187
Not only that, but now, after the murder.

133
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,237
Could it be?

134
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:23,967
Found it.

135
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,297
I knew it.

136
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,987
Are they different pages
from the same magazine?

137
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,487
And the one underneath is...

138
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:41,307
Is it from a gravure article?

139
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:45,687
It's probably the first page after the cover.

140
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:50,567
I feel like there's some meaning
behind the way they're overlapped.

141
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,007
Either way, it could be some kind of message.

142
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,037
Yeah.

143
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:55,697
Hey.

144
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:03,457
If you found something, shouldn't
you let Mori-san know?

145
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:07,247
Right, little detective?

146
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:24,313
Huh? What about this?

147
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,113
I thought it might be some kind of message.

148
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:28,973
From who?

149
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,213
I don't know.

150
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,833
Jeez. You went off and found
something trivial again.

151
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:38,323
I'm sure it was just a prank.

152
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,583
I'm busy over here.

153
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,203
Stop bothering me.

154
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,343
Excuse me, Inspector. And?

155
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:56,723
We thought you solved the trick
used to create the locked room,

156
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,043
Cane?

157
00:10:57,043 --> 00:11:02,473
but if Reizei-san's cane wasn't used to
prop up the chair with the body in it,
Cane?

158
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:02,803
Cane?

159
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,983
then what was?
Cane?

160
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:09,753
I've been thinking about that, too.

161
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,693
Have you figured it out?

162
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:14,713
No, I have no idea.

163
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:21,763
In any case, there isn't a
single person without an alibi.

164
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:25,003
We can't proceed with our investigation
if we can't solve that mystery.

165
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:32,003
They must've used something
in place of a cane.

166
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,153
In place of a cane?

167
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,593
That's it. They used that!

168
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,933
Hey, mister.

169
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:45,313
Maybe it's wrong to assume it
was a long object like a cane.

170
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:51,193
But recently they sell
telescoping canes, too.

171
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,193
What?

172
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,503
A telescoping cane?

173
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:58,403
This is why I can't stand amateurs!

174
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:00,963
Stay out of—

175
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:04,083
Wh-What is it, Mori-kun?

176
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:07,873
Th-That's it! I've figured it out, Inspector!

177
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,983
Really?

178
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:12,713
Tsukinogi Hideki-sama

179
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,213
Tsukinogi Hideki-san.

180
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,263
You've retired from bodyguarding,

181
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:26,853
but you still carry your gear with you.

182
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:30,463
Yes, that.

183
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:33,363
I'm talking about your
telescoping nightstick.

184
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:37,663
It's a habit I developed over the years.

185
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:40,743
I feel anxious without it.

186
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,243
What about it?

187
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:47,623
Don't play dumb.

188
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,753
You extended your nightstick,

189
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:56,343
pressed it against the back of the chair
supporting Inokoshi-san's body, tilted it,

190
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,013
Cane

191
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,173
and withdrew it while gradually closing
the door, creating the locked room.
Cane

192
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:01,793
and withdrew it while gradually closing
the door, creating the locked room.

193
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:03,513
Am I wrong?

194
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:10,563
Would you hand over your
nightstick, Tsukinogi-san?

195
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:17,073
We'd like to see if the end of your
nightstick matches the mark left on the chair.

196
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,533
That's fine with me.

197
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,823
But this was actually stolen from me.

198
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,083
Stolen?

199
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:33,153
I went to the bathroom
immediately after arriving.

200
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:36,603
I took it off and left it in this
changing room, and it went missing.

201
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:39,673
But when I just checked,
it had been returned.

202
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:43,473
I don't know who it was, but
I thought it was strange.

203
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,973
You think we'll believe that excuse?

204
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:52,273
In that case, don't I have an alibi?

205
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,943
I was with several others
when the murder took place.

206
00:13:56,653 --> 00:14:02,073
Weren't you, the police,
the ones who verified that?

207
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,073
W-Well...

208
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:10,363
Forgive me, Mori-san, but
I'm disappointed in you.

209
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:14,713
Is this the best the great
Sleeping Kogoro can do?

210
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:20,463
Hey, about the time of the crime...

211
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:27,973
Wasn't that the time shown on the victim's
pocket watch that was broken by the weapon?

212
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,393
That's it!

213
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:39,633
They broke it beforehand and
set the hands pointing at 2:50.

214
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:45,653
Then they put it in the breast pocket
of the victim after they killed him.

215
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,373
That's right.

216
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:52,043
In other words, the murder actually
took place earlier than that.

217
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:56,393
Takagi, Chiba. Reconfirm
their alibis immediately.

218
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:57,293
Yes, sir.

219
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:05,283
At the originally determined time of 2:50,

220
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:10,183
Tsukinogi-san met with event
company president Tsunohazu-san

221
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:12,313
and staff member Amagi-san.

222
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:16,483
But no one saw Tsukinogi-san during
the ten minutes before that.

223
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,453
We spoke with the others, and
they all gave the same answer.

224
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:24,853
Can you explain that, Tsukinogi-san?

225
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:28,143
What can I say?

226
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,443
I simply didn't encounter anyone else.

227
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,583
That doesn't mean I did it.

228
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,503
Well, yes, but...

229
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:40,253
Then what's that shining on your lapel?

230
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:41,303
What?

231
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:50,343
Maybe it's a piece of glass from the
pocket watch broken by the weapon.

232
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,183
If it's a match,

233
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,843
there's no way a piece of
glass could've gotten on you

234
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,613
if the pocket watch was inside
the victim's jacket was broken,

235
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,673
so it must have been broken beforehand.

236
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:13,093
And the pieces could only have
gotten on the person who broke it.

237
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,873
Right, Mori-san?

238
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:15,953
What?

239
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:18,503
Uh... Yes, exactly.

240
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:24,123
I was just about to say
the same thing, Inspector.

241
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:30,263
Well, Tsukinogi-san?

242
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,943
I-I couldn't forgive him.

243
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:40,133
I couldn't forgive him!

244
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,603
According to Tsukinogi-san's confession,

245
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:48,963
one year ago while guarding Inokoshi-san,
he caught a woman stalking him.

252
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,123
After explaining the situation and
turning the woman over to the police,

253
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,633
not only was he fired by Inokoshi-san,

254
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,373
but rumors of his uselessness were spread.

255
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,053
Because of that, he and the
security company he manages

256
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:12,063
Tsukinogi Security  - Company Lack of Security Abilities
Because of that, he and the

Inability to Fulfill Duties - No Guarantee of Safety
Because of that, he and the
security company he manages

259
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:14,063
would be forced into bankruptcy soon.

262
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,443
You did it, Mei-chan!

263
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,423
You beat the great detective!

264
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,523
She's kind of amazing, isn't she?

265
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:28,943
Huh? Yeah, she sure is.

266
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,933
Her detective skills certainly
are impressive, but...

267
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,473
We knew you could do it.

268
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,203
It's just a coincidence.

269
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:36,713
There's no need to be modest.

270
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:37,893
Something bothering you?
There's no need to be modest.

271
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,183
No, really.

272
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:45,963
In any case, the two murders were solved,

273
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:48,753
and the old man's lecture was to be held.

Thank you.

285
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,733
Now let's bring the star of the day onstage.

286
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:28,883
Everyone, please put your hands together

287
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:32,853
for the great detective Mori Kogoro!

288
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:37,303
Thank you, thank you.

289
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,413
Thank you, thank you.

290
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:43,273
You can do it, Dad.

291
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:54,053
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

292
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,783
Focus, focus.

293
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,183
Thank you for waiting!

294
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:06,543
As I was just introduced,

295
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:10,293
I am the great detective

296
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,253

299
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,053
I should redeem myself here.

300
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,503
It's no use. I can't sleep.

301
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:46,713
The case has already been solved,
so I won't be sleeping today.

302
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,083
What?

303
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,083
Seriously? I was looking forward to this!

304
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,923
I'll tell you all about it eventually.

305
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:03,273
The subject of today's lecture
is a great detective's secrets,

306
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:09,483
and as such, I will be telling you
all about my abundant experience.

307
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:13,823
Good. Nice one, Dad.

308
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:21,353
Then another panelist arrived.

309
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,583
Anyway, that's enough from me.

310
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,313

Anyway, that's enough from me.

311

00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:33,733
That was the great detective Mori Kogoro-san.

314
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,633
Let's give him another round of applause.
Mori Kogoro

315
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:40,883
Thank you, thank you!

316
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:51,293
After a short break,

317
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,903
we'll move onto the panel.

318
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,633
The audience was informed that
due to certain circumstances,

319
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,953
panelists Inokoshi Kenichiro-san and
Tsukinogi Hideki-san

320
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,913
were no longer able to attend.

321
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:09,643
The event organizers decided
to keep quiet about the case

322
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,013
until the police made their
official announcement.

323
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,633
Thanks for waiting.

324
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:20,633
Mom!

325
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,503
Sounds like you had some trouble.

326
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:24,843
I just heard the news.

327
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:29,643
But thanks to Mori-sensei,
the cases were solved.

328
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:33,853
I know the circumstances are unusual,
but everyone loved the lecture.

329
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:38,283
Keep up the same energy during
the panel, Kisaki-sensei.

330
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:40,783
Sure.

331
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:49,663
But doesn't that mean it'll be
just the two of us going onstage?

332
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,963
Something wrong with that?

333
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,203
Dad!

334
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,793
No, as long as you don't
have a problem with it.

335
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,043
Mom...

336
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,173
