1
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:05,233
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,083
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:11,383
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:14,413
Today's case is a code! A deep
meaning behind regular numbers!

5
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:16,293
I'll have to change
my way of looking at things!

6
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:18,333
There's always only one truth!

7
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:56,323
The Mysterious Sniper Message Case.

8
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,953
There's some! Now!

9
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:15,043
Got 'em!

10
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:17,043
They got away again...

11
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:21,683
We sure caught a lot!

12
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,323
Yeah...

13
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,973
Genta-kun was right--
this is a good spot for fishing!

14
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,743
I'm hungry. What time is it?

15
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:33,113
It's exactly 1:00.
What do you say we have lunch?

16
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,683
Hey, what's that?

17
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:45,913
Looks like a remote-controlled boat.

18
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,453
Where's it being controlled from?

19
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:02,283
A rifle!

20
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:08,133
Up there! There are people
on the building across the river!

21
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:18,233
Come on, Conan! Let me see!

22
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,363
There's nobody up there...

23
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:28,163
Did this guy really
shoot it with a rifle?!

24
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:40,783
Dang! He shot the balloon
from way up here?!

25
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:43,043
He's really good if he did!

26
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:51,073
Maybe he was doing target practice?

27
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:53,113
That, or he was being tested...

28
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,113
Tested?

29
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:55,743
Against his own will.

30
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,113
Against his own will?!

31
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:00,443
Two other guys were
pointing handguns at him!

32
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:01,943
You serious?!

33
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,533
What are you doing?

34
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,953
Looking for any sort of evidence...

35
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,963
What's with those numbers?

36
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:34,323
I'm guessing it's a message
the rifle shooter left for me.

37
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,933
Message?

38
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:41,023
Yes. He seemed to notice me
when I saw him through the binoculars.

39
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,693
But what in the world
could these numbers mean?

40
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,703
At any rate, we need to tell
Inspector Megure about this!

41
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:10,733
Are you certain that
he hit it from here?

42
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:15,233
Yeah. I didn't see him shoot,
but I saw him holding the rifle.

43
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,763
And then you found
that calculator left behind?

44
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,023
Say, Inspector.

45
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:24,523
Do you think that maybe he
was kidnapped and then brought here?

46
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,693
It did look like he was forced
to shoot against his own will...

47
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:32,943
We haven't received any such reports...

48
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,663
And I don't see any signs
of them being here, either...

49
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:40,113
What? Then look harder!
Like across the river, or in it!

50
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,943
The bullet has to be there somewhere!

51
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:45,123
Yeah! That radio-controlled
boat might be--

52
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,443
Unfortunately, this is Golden Week.

53
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:51,273
Most of our investigators
are out on holiday leave!

54
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:56,093
But I'll tell you what. I'll at least
check out that calculator. How's that?

55
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:04,273
Well, I'll see you later.
Give Mori-kun my regards!

56
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,983
He doesn't believe us one bit!

57
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,863
"Romantic dream trip aboard
the Heisei Expressway"?!

58
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:26,773
All they did was steal an old photo!

59
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,883
It's hopeless! I can't figure this out!

60
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,313
Of course you can't.
There is no message.

61
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:36,523
Someone just forgot
their calculator, that's all.

62
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,893
I can't believe you called
Inspector Megure out there

63
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:41,813
during Golden Week!

64
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,143
Dad!

65
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,863
Say, if that person really was
forced to do target practice

66
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:50,443
and then left you a message,

67
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,153
all I can think of is...

68
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,483
The time or place where
the real shooting will take place,

69
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,073
or the victim's name...

70
00:06:56,863 --> 00:07:00,313
Or a hint about where he's being held.

71
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:03,543
People play code games on their
pagers all the time! Number games!

72
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:09,363
So since 3135134 can also be read
as a couple of Japanese names,

73
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,923
that means the victims are
going to be 31-san and 51-san?

74
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,863
Sure, whatever.

75
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:20,973
Say, 162 might be an apartment
or hotel room number!

76
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:24,233
Or maybe a road?

77
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,773
Like Route 162, you know?!

78
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:36,693
So then what's the 3135134 stand for?

79
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:41,533
Maybe it was to camouflage the 162

80
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,373
in case the bad guys
found the calculator.

81
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:48,313
I see. Come to think of it,
the river was shaped like a road...

82
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:51,333
And the flow of the river
resembles a flow of cars.

83
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,403
Route 162...

84
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,093
Kyoto!

85
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:04,193
Too far. It would at least
have to be in the Tokyo region.

86
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,063
It would have to be a
primary municipal highway.

87
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:09,853
Here it is! Saitama Prefectural Route 162!

88
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,983
You found it, Conan-kun!

89
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,823
Here it is, Dad!
You can take us tomorrow!

90
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:17,213
Take you? What now?!

91
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:29,113
Why did I have to rent a car
and drive you around again?!

92
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:31,083
Because we don't have licenses!

93
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:35,983
Hey, he's a detective, right?
So why doesn't he have a car of his own?

94
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,563
He can't afford one!

95
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:40,113
It sounds like he doesn't
usually drive much.

96
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:42,123
We'd better put our seat belts on!

97
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:42,933
Yeah!

98
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,973
Hey, you! I'll have you know--

99
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,513
Keep your eyes on the road!

100
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:55,903
The curves are shaped differently.

101
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:57,823
This isn't the place!

102
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,153
This isn't it!

103
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:04,323
This isn't it either!

104
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,493
Doesn't look like this is it either...

105
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,953
This isn't it.

106
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,813
Why don't you give up already?

107
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:15,873
You're crazy if you think the shape
of the river will match a street.

108
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:21,153
What? You were the one who said
the river flowed like a flow of cars!

109
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,223
Did I now?

110
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,313
No more curves to check, I take it?

111
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:35,653
I'll just turn around up here and--

112
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,403
Under construction...

113
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:47,623
Stop the car!

114
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:52,663
Conan-kun?

115
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,263
Aha!

116
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,223
This building's on Route 162 too!

117
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:24,733
This is the place!

118
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:25,973
You're right!

119
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,023
It's definitely it!

120
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:27,913
Way to go, Conan!

121
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:29,873
What? You found it?!

122
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,773
Conan-kun wants you
to tell Inspector Megure.

123
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:34,833
Why me?

124
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:40,293
Because you have a good track record,
plus he trusts you!

125
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:45,903
A good track record? You sure know
about hard-to-understand things!

126
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:48,263
Oh well, guess I'll give him a ring!

127
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,813
Megure here.

128
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:54,313
Oh, Mori-kun! Perfect timing!

129
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,863
Come to the police headquarters
right away!

130
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,893
And bring Conan-kun with you!

131
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:03,773
There is only one reason why
I've asked you to come here.

132
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:08,483
We've learned that one of our officers
on vacation and his girlfriend

133
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:09,873
have gone missing.

134
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:10,973
This man.

135
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:16,583
This is the guy, Inspector!

136
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,733
I thought so.

137
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:23,273
The fingerprints on the calculator
matched his own when we checked.

138
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:25,443
His name is Koichi Yamabe.

139
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:28,053
He used to be an Olympic marksman.

140
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:29,933
A marksman?!

141
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:35,313
The kidnappers probably took
Yamabe and his girlfriend, Eri-san,

142
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:41,153
and are threatening to kill her
if he doesn't shoot someone for them.

143
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:45,263
So what Conan-kun and the others
saw was target practice for that?

144
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:48,773
Looks like your deductions hit the mark!

145
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:52,113
But our hands are still tied since we
don't know the most important facts:

146
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:54,083
when and where it will happen...

147
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,043
We know where!

148
00:11:58,023 --> 00:11:58,873
Come again?!

149
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:06,313
Yes, it's very similar, indeed.

150
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:09,313
It looks like this is the place.
Excellent work!

151
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:13,563
Um, don't forget that I was
the one who drove them here!

152
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:16,693
But we still don't know
when the attack will be...

153
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:17,813
Yes, that's too bad...

154
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:22,983
It was around 1 pm
when the balloon burst, right?

155
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,313
Is that so? Then 1:00 must
be the time of the attack!

156
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,403
But on what day?

157
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:31,733
They're keeping two people captive!
They don't have time to waste!

158
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,313
The sniper attack will
probably be tomorrow!

159
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:34,773
Good thinking, Mori-kun!

160
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:36,743
Let's make preparations at once!

161
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:39,193
What's the matter, Conan-kun?

162
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,623
Oh, nothing...

163
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:53,983
Does this 162 really refer to Route 162?

164
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:57,433
If it were me, I would make sure to put
the place and time in the message...

165
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,363
Which means...

166
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,653
No...

167
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:05,343
No matter how I look at it,
the 3135134 still makes no sense!

168
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:21,018
Alright now. Don't make a move
until I give the order.

169
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,098
Roger that!

170
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:23,308
Understood!

171
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:28,048
We have police snipers and a
helicopter on standby at the river.

172
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,628
All preparations are complete.

173
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:31,378
If the sniper's going to strike at 1:00,

174
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,778
then the criminals should
appear by 12:00 at the latest.

175
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,088
One hour left...

176
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,658
But would you mind explaining why--

177
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,298
They insisted on coming along!

178
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:48,628
You guys aren't to leave this van!

179
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,088
Well?!

180
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:50,218
We know!

181
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:51,758
We know!
We know!

182
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:54,718
My ears...

183
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:03,648
Thirty minutes left...

184
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,418
Something's not right!
Why aren't they showing up?!

185
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,878
Maybe Conan-kun is wrong?

186
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:31,868
What?!

187
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,048
Of course he isn't!

188
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,588
No, that has to be it!

189
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:38,348
It was a mistake to
listen to some stupid kid!

190
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:39,808
Dad!

191
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:44,468
Let's see...

192
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:49,768
It was 3135134162, right?

193
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:55,318
3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 4...

194
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,778
Mitsuhiko! Let me see that!

195
00:14:58,778 --> 00:14:59,948
Okay...

196
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,868
That's it! Now I see!

197
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,628
You have it upside-down, Conan-kun...

198
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,588
Oh, wow!

199
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:16,338
You can read the numbers even
when you flip the calculator over! Cool!

200
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,168
What nonsense is this now?

201
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,548
See! 162 becomes 291!

202
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:23,308
And the rest looks like English letters!

203
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:25,268
Let me see that.

204
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:29,918
291, Heisei E...

205
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:30,728
They are readable...

206
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:38,868
Heisei E? Wait, I could swear
I've seen that somewhere before...

207
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,868
It was in the magazine
you were looking at yesterday!

208
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:48,168
The Heisei Express!

209
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:52,718
Wait, then that means this message
was meant to be read upside-down!

210
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,918
Meaning that the 162 actually
means the 29th at 1:00!

211
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:57,758
What?!

212
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,298
Yamabe-san must have realized
this upside-down trick

213
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,878
where he was being held

214
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,228
and tried to leave us this message
when he got the chance!

215
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,418
Inspector! Hurry! The helicopter!

216
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:12,548
Oh, right!

217
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:24,468
Heisei Express will be departing
from Platform 2 shortly.

218
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,378
Thank you!

219
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,128
Excuse me!

220
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:38,828
Yes?

221
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,758
Sit down before the train starts, Daddy!

222
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:45,558
Ok, I will...

223
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,668
It's going just as we planned.

224
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,518
He's sitting in the
very front of the first car!

225
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:23,638
It's time.

226
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,848
Huh? Where's Conan-kun?!

227
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,588
Eh?! Don't tell me he's--

228
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,918
What? When did you get in here?!

229
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:41,948
It doesn't matter! We won't
make it in time if we don't hurry!

230
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:44,728
Fine, whatever. Put this on!

231
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,008
Too big!

232
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,468
There's the Kanetsu Line!

233
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:57,338
Okay! Follow the tracks north!

234
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,348
Three minutes left...

235
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,128
We still haven't found a curve
that looks like the river!

236
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,468
Here it comes.

237
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,978
Try any funny business
and the girl's dead.

238
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,378
One minute left!

239
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:11,788
Inspector! There!

240
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,678
There they are! Get us lower!

241
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:36,188
What the...?

242
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,258
Who cares! Just shoot it down!

243
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,128
Bastard!

244
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:48,168
Stop or she's dead!

245
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,528
Don't shoot! You might hit Yamabe!

246
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,038
Yes, sir!

247
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:04,208
There's no wind! The helicopter's speed
is 5 meters per second!

248
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,378
Medium setting should do the trick!

249
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:11,238
Distance: 30 meters!

250
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:14,968
Go!

251
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:23,798
Got 'im!

252
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,608
What're you doing?!
That's dangerous!

253
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,278
Damn it!

254
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:34,948
Damn you!

255
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:39,538
It's all over! Give yourself up!

256
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:50,088
Koichi-san!

257
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:50,948
Eri!

258
00:20:54,918 --> 00:21:00,518
What a stroke of luck that
this helmet just happened to hit him!

259
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,108
Here you are. Don't drop it
on the way back, now!

260
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:04,738
I won't!

261
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:08,068
Man, was that close...

262
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:18,968
You're okay! That's great!

263
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:21,588
Hey, Conan! That wasn't fair,
you get all the fun!

264
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:23,418
It isn't nice to hog all the glory!

265
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:24,248
Conan-kun!

266
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,748
Sorry!

267
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,348
Huh?

268
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:35,848
Conan! No more sneaking off
without permission!

269
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:39,998
He got you that time!
He got you that time!

270
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,828
Why you little...

271
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:25,168
The men we arrested were former
members of the Oni Tora crime ring.

272
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:28,248
Last year, the leader and various
high-ranking officials in the ring

273
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:31,968
were all put behind bars
by a skilled public prosecutor.

274
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,838
The remaining members
were forced to disband.

275
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:36,208
So it was that prosecutor
they were after?

276
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,838
He was on his way home
from a trip with his family.

277
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:41,128
Revenge was their motive.

278
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,518
But you did a spectacular job, Mori-kun!

279
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,968
I don't think I did...

280
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,488
...that bad, myself!

281
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:53,588
They're acting like
he solved it all by himself.

282
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:57,498
But I'm sure he'll take us
on vacation somewhere now!

283
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:58,878
Where would you want to go, Conan-kun?

284
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:01,438
That's easy! An amusement park!

285
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,548
Boy, it sure is hard to
constantly act like a kid!

286
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:15,218
It's a dead body!

287
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,438
It's gone! The corpse is gone!

288
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,468
It's disappeared!

289
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:22,398
That's impossible!

290
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:24,488
Let's go, everyone.

291
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:27,548
Wait, Inspector! We really saw--

292
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,698
I was a fool to believe you!

293
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,668
No, the body is here!

294
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:35,718
On the next Conan--

295
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:37,888
The Missing Corpse Murder.

296
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,938
Next Conan's Hint:

297
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:57,942
Next Conan's Hint:
Answering Machine Phone.

298
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:00,019
Answering Machine Phone.
