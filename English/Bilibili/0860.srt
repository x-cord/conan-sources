1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,770
You're in good hands, leave everything to me.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,470
I, Kogoro Mouri will give you my word

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,270
that I will nab the burglar who broke into your house, Junko.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,670
I hope you don't get your hand dirty, though.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,370
"Junko Miyoshi (26), Client" -I'm counting on you, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,770
Just the other day,

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,170
a jewelry shop near the station was robbed, right?

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,470
That's why I'm really scared.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,970
All right then, Junko,

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,670
I can spend the night over at your place from tonight.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,570
No, that won't be necessary.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,370
My boyfriend's supposed to be coming over.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,270
Your boyfriend?

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,070
That's good to hear.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,770
So, please nab the burglar

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,270
as soon as you possibly can, Mr. Mouri.

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,270
Of course, my pleasure.

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,870
He's been brushed off.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,670
There was a bug on your head, a bug...

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,770
He heard me.

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,670
Thank you so much

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,970
for seeing me home.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,070
No problem.

24
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,770
Walking alone at night is dangerous.

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,770
I wonder what it is?

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,070
It seems to have come from the parking lot of the condo.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,770
What seems to be the matter?

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,070
Over there...

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,770
Mr. Mouri, what on earth?

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,870
Junko, please stay back.

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,170
And please contact the police right away.

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,270
All right.

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,970
Mr. Kitagami?

34
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,370
Do you know him?

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,770
Yes. He lives next door to me.

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,070
Mr. Mouri. How's Mr. Kitagami?

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,870
From the looks of it,

38
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,370
he's already...

39
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,470
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

40
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,670
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

41
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,570
While discussing theft prevention,

42
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,870
the neighbor experiences a strange fall.

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,370
His name is Detective Conan!

46
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,869
"Security System Pitfall"

47
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:07,969
"Naotsugu Kitagami (32)" -The victim is Mr. Naotsugu Kitagami,

48
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,469
"Company Employee" -age 32.

49
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,569
He's a company worker who lives in room 704 of this condo.

50
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:16,169
The cause of his death is most likely brain contusion

51
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,469
caused by a strong blow to his head.

52
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:23,069
There were many scratches on the front part of the body,

53
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,069
so most likely...

54
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,669
He most likely fell to his death.

55
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:28,769
Mr. Mouri.

56
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,269
His body smells of alcohol.

57
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,569
I think he got wasted,

58
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,969
slipped on the veranda and fell over the railing.

59
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,269
Pops.

60
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,869
There's a weird smell mixed in with the smell of alcohol.

61
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,569
He smells kind of like peppers.

62
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,969
Never mind, just stay with Junko, will you?

63
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,069
Okay.

64
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,769
Come to think of it, the girl that was with you, who is she?

65
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,969
Well...

66
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:57,469
We're not in any sort of intimate relationship.

67
00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:00,369
That's not my question.

68
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,569
She's one of the victims of the burglaries

69
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,969
that have been occurring recently in this neighborhood.

70
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:08,369
She called me to discuss this problem,

71
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,769
so I came and ended seeing this incident.

72
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,969
It turned out that she coincidentally

73
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:16,069
happened to live next door to the victim, Mr. Kitagami.

74
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:17,669
I see.

75
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,369
Inspector, I think we should start heading over to the room of the victim.

76
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,869
Right.

77
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:24,969
Go get the manager of the condo then.

78
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,069
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,669
Officer Chiba!

80
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,869
We're going up to the victim's room!

81
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:30,969
Yes, sir!

82
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,369
This way please.

83
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,269
He has a private security camera.

84
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,569
And...

85
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,169
he's even registered with a security company.

86
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,269
It seems he was a very cautious character.

87
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,269
Yes.

88
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,069
What seems to be the matter?

89
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,469
The lock's open.

90
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:08,169
It seems that he just carelessly forgot to lock the front door.

91
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,669
The security system is turned off

92
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,469
and the key to the house is hanging here too.

93
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:18,769
Inspector, I guess the victim was drunk after all.

94
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,269
He seemed to be totally wasted.

95
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,869
Inspector Megure.

96
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,069
There are liquor bottles on the veranda too.

97
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,469
I guess it's just as I deduced.

98
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,369
But, why did the victim come out to the veranda?

99
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:39,969
I guess he wanted to cool down his body that got hot.

100
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,369
And...

101
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,069
he tripped over the liquor bottles,

102
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,969
lost his balance and fell over the railing.

103
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:50,569
And fell upside to the ground.

104
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,869
I see.

105
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,569
Officer Takagi and Chiba.

106
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,569
Just in case, can you two split up

107
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:06,369
and ask around the neighborhood for information?

108
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:07,569
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

109
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,169
Thank you for your cooperation.

110
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,869
"Sawada"

111
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:18,969
Yes.

112
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,569
Excuse me, I'm from the police,

113
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,369
could I ask you some questions?

114
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:25,769
Please wait for a while.

115
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,169
I'm sorry to be intruding on you.

116
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,469
"Ryosuke Sawada (30)" -I thought something was noisy

117
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,469
"Ryosuke Sawada (30)" -below in the parking lot.

118
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:35,069
Is something wrong?

119
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,269
Do you know Mr. Naotsugu Kitagami of Room 704?

120
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:41,569
Yes, I know at least what he looks like.

121
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:46,969
Mr. Kitagami was found dead in the parking lot.

122
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:48,369
Seriously?

123
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,769
Do you know something?

124
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,469
I stayed home all day today

125
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,669
but I didn't notice anything in particular.

126
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,069
I see.

127
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:00,769
Was your room burglarized, sir?

128
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,069
Conan?

129
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,569
What's with this brat?

130
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,969
Well...

131
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,569
There's a scratch on the keyhole of the door,

132
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,169
so I thought that maybe...

133
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:14,269
Really?

134
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,369
True.

135
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:20,269
Maybe it's just a prank.

136
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,569
Nothing was stolen either.

137
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,269
Please check carefully once more.

138
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,569
And if you find something suspicious...

139
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,169
Then,

140
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,869
Will you show us the veranda of your room?

141
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:38,869
Do you mind if we check your veranda?

142
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,569
Did you find anything?

143
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,469
No, nothing in particular.

144
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:03,969
Thank you for your cooperation.

145
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,469
Conan, let's go.

146
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:10,469
What's the matter?

147
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,269
I have to use the restroom.

148
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,969
I was holding it from some time ago.

149
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,469
I'm sorry but could he use your restroom?

150
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,169
Go ahead. Its...

151
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,369
I'm fine. I know.

152
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:34,469
Conan, here we are.

153
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:37,769
I'm sorry. I was thinking of something.

154
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,769
Inspector Megure, I'm back.

155
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,569
Is something wrong?

156
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,969
We found the perpetrator.

157
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:51,269
The perpetrator? Wasn't this an accident?

158
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,769
Yeah, no...

159
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,969
That's not it.

160
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,669
This necklace seems to be Mrs. Miyosh's but...

161
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,369
My boyfriend bought it for me when we were abroad,

162
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,569
so there's no mistake about it.

163
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,369
What about it?

164
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,769
That necklace came out from this room.

165
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,369
What? Then, don't tell me that...

166
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:16,969
Yeah. In other words the perpetrator who burglarized this area

167
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:18,969
is a resident of this room got drunk,

168
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,869
and fell to his death from the veranda.

169
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:24,569
His name was Naotsugu Kitagami!

170
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:30,969
And how did the interrogation go, Officer Takagi?

171
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:32,169
Well...

172
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,969
We didn't get a hold of any useful information.

173
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,269
I see.

174
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,769
So just as Mr. Mouri said,

175
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,969
he got drunk and fell to his death.

176
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,469
The case is settled.

177
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:47,069
I see, I get the picture.

178
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:50,469
This is not a mere death fall case.

179
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:01,336
About the stolen objects and burglary,

180
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,036
we'll have the 3rd investigation department contact you immediately.

181
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:07,436
Thank you.

182
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:08,836
Have a good day, then.

183
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,236
What an unexpected conclusion, don't you think?

184
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,036
That the person who happened to fall to his death

185
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:17,836
was coincidentally a burglar.

186
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,236
I guess so.

187
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:22,236
All that's left is how do we prove it.

188
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:25,736
What're you doing, Mr. Mouri?

189
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,536
Well, I was just...

190
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:30,436
I was looking at my own reflection

191
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,736
and wanted to prim up a bit.

192
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:37,736
This wall sure is shiny like a mirror.

193
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:41,936
That's because it's UV coated.

194
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,136
It's quick trying and glossy,

195
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,036
so is often used in elevators.

196
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,736
What's the matter, Conan?

197
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,936
Maybe I dropped the detective badge...

198
00:11:57,936 --> 00:11:59,736
I had in my pocket.

199
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:03,336
Do you have an idea where you dropped it?

200
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,336
Well...

201
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:09,836
I think I dropped it in Room 604, Mr. Sawada's room.

202
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,536
May I go get it?

203
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:12,636
Of course.

204
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,636
What's up? Go and get quick.

205
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:23,436
Aren't you coming with me, Pops?

206
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:26,636
Why do I have to go with you?

207
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,836
I don't want to go alone.

208
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:33,436
You always go everywhere on your own.

209
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,636
What's the problem, Mr. Mouri?

210
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:37,936
Just go along with him.

211
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:40,036
Gosh, come on let's go!

212
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:41,636
Thanks, Pops.

213
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,136
"Sawada"

214
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,336
I'm so sorry.

215
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:46,836
It's okay,

216
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:48,436
but once you find what you're looking for,

217
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,436
leave right away, will you?

218
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,036
Yes, of course.

219
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:55,436
Hey, did you find what you're looking for?

220
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:58,836
Not yet... Strange.

221
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:00,336
Gosh...

222
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:01,636
Are you sure you lost it here?

223
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:02,836
I found it!

224
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,236
Let's go if you found it.

225
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:07,236
Okay.

226
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,936
The door's that way.

227
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:11,336
We're sorry to have intruded on you.

228
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:19,736
Hey, hey.

229
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:21,436
What kind of joke is this?

230
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,636
Hey!

231
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,436
What are you getting all comfy for?

232
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,736
Yes.

233
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,036
Detectives...

234
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,436
Excuse me.

235
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,936
Mr. Mouri asked us to come up here.

236
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,536
Good timing.

237
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,936
Will you do something about him?

238
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:46,936
Mr. Mouri, what are you doing in his room?

239
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,236
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,136
I fell asleep while waiting for you to come up.

241
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:54,436
And? What is it you want?

242
00:13:54,436 --> 00:14:01,136
It bothered me that Mr. Kitagami who was so into security measures

243
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,936
forgot to lock his front door.

244
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:06,636
But, people sometimes do forget to lock their doors, don't they?

245
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,936
But, he was a burglar.

246
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:11,436
There was proof of that in his room too.

247
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,636
I wonder if a person like him can be so careless?

248
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,436
And, the way his body was found also is of concern.

249
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,236
The way his body was found?

250
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:23,536
Officer Takagi, when you drink at home,

251
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:25,436
how do you dress?

252
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:26,736
How?

253
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:29,436
Do you wear your suit and necktie?

254
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,936
No way.

255
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:37,536
Right. Mr. Kitagami's corpse was wearing a suit and tie

256
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:41,036
despite drinking at home.

257
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:42,836
But, Mr. Mouri...

258
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,836
The liquor bottle that was found in the room

259
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,536
was something from some while ago,

260
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,836
-so it's thinkable that he drank elsewhere. -That's not possible.

261
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:54,236
The beer that was found in the glass cup of Mr. Kitagami's room

262
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:56,736
still had some foam in it.

263
00:14:56,736 --> 00:15:00,036
Which means, that maybe the beer was poured into the glass

264
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:02,136
just a while before we went into the room.

265
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,936
It's true that it's odd.

266
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:09,836
But what's even odder is you, getting all comfy in this room.

267
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:12,036
What on earth are you getting at?

268
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,136
Of course I'm trying to solve the case

269
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:19,036
of Mr. Ryosuke Sawada, who is the resident of this room

270
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:22,136
having killed Mr. Kitagami.

271
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,236
What?

272
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:27,436
I don't know what you're talking about.

273
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:29,936
Mr. Mouri. Just what're you talking about?

274
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,536
Mr. Kitagami got drunk,

275
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:36,536
tripped over the liquor bottle and fell off the veranda of his room.

276
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,936
Yeah, that's what you said.

277
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:43,636
There were scrape marks all over the body of the corpse.

278
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:48,236
But, there were no scratches on his veranda that matched those marks.

279
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,636
Isn't that because the scratches found on him

280
00:15:50,636 --> 00:15:53,536
were scrapes made when he fell to the ground?

281
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,136
Officer Takagi, please check the veranda of this room.

282
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,036
There should be scratch marks.

283
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,036
Yes, sir!

284
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,536
Mr. Mouri, yes, there are!

285
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,636
New scrape marks.

286
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:16,536
Mr. Sawada, after killing Mr. Kitagami,

287
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:19,736
you probably tried to throw him over your veranda.

288
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:24,236
But, it's not easy throwing someone over.

289
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:27,336
That's why in order to throw Mr. Kitagami over the veranda,

290
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,836
you carried him up to the railing once.

291
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:32,836
When you did so, the buckle of Mr. Kitagami's belt

292
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:36,136
rubbed against the railing and scratched it.

293
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:39,736
And of course, you'll scrape marks on Mr. Kitagami's belt buckle too.

294
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:42,936
Then, you lifted his legs up and dropped him slowly.

295
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,836
That's when he got scrape marks all over the front part of his body.

296
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,436
How rude can you get?

297
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:51,936
Barging in like this

298
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,736
then saying that I'm a murderer?

299
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:57,736
The guy called Kitagami fell off his own veranda, right?

300
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:01,436
It could be that he scraped his body against the wall of this veranda

301
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,036
when he went falling, no?

302
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:07,436
Besides, in the first place, why do I have to kill him?

303
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:10,136
I never even really talked to him too.

304
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:11,536
Motive...

305
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,636
Mr. Mouri, how about it?

306
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:17,436
Mr. Kitagami was a burglar.

307
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:22,336
And there are traces of this door having been picked.

308
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:25,536
Then, don't tell me that...

309
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:29,836
Yes, he burglarized this room.

310
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:32,036
And coincidentally ran into you

311
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:34,336
when you came home.

312
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:37,836
Are you saying that he happened to run into the burgler in his place

313
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,536
and inadvertently killed him?

314
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:41,736
Yes.

315
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,436
But, Mr. Mouri...

316
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:48,536
Why didn't Mr. Sawada report it to the police or flee?

317
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:52,236
What if it's not that he didn't but rather couldn't?

318
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:53,836
He couldn't?

319
00:17:53,836 --> 00:17:55,336
Why not?

320
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,636
I think I know why.

321
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,436
When I borrowed the restroom here,

322
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:04,936
there was a big bag shoved into the cabinet.

323
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:07,036
-You brat! -Come, come, now...

324
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:10,136
Officer Takagi, will you bring that bag over here.

325
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,336
Yes, sir!

326
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,336
You don't mind, do you?

327
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:16,336
Inspector Megure.

328
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,236
Just as Conan said, the bag was there.

329
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:20,536
And the contents?

330
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,036
What?

331
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,136
This is...

332
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:27,836
Mr. Sawada, excuse me

333
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:31,036
but you don't look to be someone who would have enough money

334
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,436
to own valuable things like these.

335
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,636
What on earth are these?

336
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,136
How about it?

337
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,536
Oh, right.

338
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,936
Those valuables are the ones that I robbed!

339
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:47,536
Mr. Kitagami, who broke in here found these valuables

340
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:50,036
so you killed to shut him up.

341
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,736
Wrong!

342
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:54,136
It's true that I panicked when he found them

343
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:55,536
but I made a deal with him.

344
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,736
A deal?

345
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,436
Since he found the valuables,

346
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,036
I gave him a piece.

347
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:04,336
With that we decided that I would forget

348
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,436
about the fact that he was a burglar

349
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,736
and he would forget that I was a robber. Then, he left.

350
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:14,936
I know nothing about him falling to his death!

351
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,336
Enough with delusive stories!

352
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:23,136
Mr. Mouri, I hope your deduction is based on proof.

353
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:25,936
Of course. Besides the valuables,

354
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:29,736
there is pepper spray in that bag.

355
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,436
I guess you used it when robbing.

356
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:35,236
Mr. Kitagami's eyelids were red and swollen,

357
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:36,836
not because of the liquor

358
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:39,836
but because pepper spray was used on him.

359
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,736
That won't serve as proof.

360
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,136
Mr. Mouri.

361
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:47,336
I borrowed what you asked for from forensics.

362
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,836
Good. Conan, please help me.

363
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:51,936
Okay!

364
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:57,436
Officer Takagi, may borrow that?

365
00:19:58,436 --> 00:19:59,436
Yeah.

366
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:02,936
When using this type of spray,

367
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:06,936
it sprays a bit on the user too.

368
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:12,436
Since the fluid's transparent, it's hard to tell.

369
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:13,936
Don't worry.

370
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,636
UV coating is used in pepper sprays

371
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:21,936
so that the perpetrator who flees can be pursued!

372
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:26,036
So Officer Chiba, will you turn off the light of the room?

373
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:27,036
Yeah.

374
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:32,636
Officer Chiba, can you shine the black light on my hand

375
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,536
and Conan's clothes?

376
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,036
See?

377
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:41,936
I see.

378
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,636
Which means...

379
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:48,636
If Mr. Sawada's sleeve glows like Conan's clothes...

380
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,636
Excuse me.

381
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,836
How about it? Do you still insist you didn't do it?

382
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:01,836
He said that he changed his mind

383
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:04,836
and suddenly demanded to have all the valuables.

384
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:09,036
He overwhelmingly came at me

385
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:12,736
so I impulsively sprayed him with the pepper spray that was in the bag.

386
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,036
He squirmed around because it stung,

387
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,236
his feet tripped over the table

388
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:20,036
and he hit his head on the corner of the shelf.

389
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:23,236
He barged in here on his own and died on his own!

390
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:26,336
Why do I have to take responsibility for this?

391
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:29,236
Since I realized he lived right above me,

392
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:30,536
I figured it wouldn't look unnatural

393
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,736
even if I dropped him from this veranda.

394
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:35,736
Besides, I had the key to his room too.

395
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:39,336
You tried to cover up your crime.

396
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:41,336
You idiot!

397
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:44,036
On top of robbing jewels,

398
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,436
you threw Mr. Kitagami off the veranda

399
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:49,236
and tried to use childish measures to cover up your crime.

400
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:51,236
Do you understand the seriousness of the crime you committed?

401
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,636
Darn.

402
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:58,536
Darn!

403
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,636
It's about time you get up, Mr. Mouri.

404
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,636
We're leaving.

405
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:33,936
Where am I?

406
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:44,436
My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

407
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:47,436
Something's on my hand...

408
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,836
Your deduction was superb,

409
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:51,136
but how unsightly of you now.

410
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:53,036
You've got to take care of your eyes.

411
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:56,836
"Next Episode" -Koji Haneda.

412
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,036
Shards of glass?

413
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:02,836
There's a pattern and letters on it.

414
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:05,236
It probably spelt...

415
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,136
"Put On Mascara".

416
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:08,736
So what?

417
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:12,136
Are you saying that I'm the one who did it?

418
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:14,036
I'd like to go

419
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,136
to the crime site too.

420
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:20,736
Next Conan,

421
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,336
"The Same Crime Scene as 17 Years Ago (Part 1)"

422
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,279
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,579
"Scissors"

424
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:31,679
A 17-year-old Ms. Sato?

425
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,979
-What's wrong? -Just a little misunderstanding.
