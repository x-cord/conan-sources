00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,380
However, Taira claimed he only burglarized the house while Raita-san was asleep.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,930
Was it Taira who murdered Raita-san

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,520
and set the gears of tragedy
in motion for the Oide family?

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,540
Or was it...?

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,030
Ah, Fusaya.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,790
Fusaya, where have you been?!

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,040
We're almost there, Fusaya.

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,540
Where do you think you're going, Fusaya?!

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,640
Fusaya, come here.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,520
Don't laugh at me.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,030
I'm pretty serious about this.

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,630
I'll be back, Dad.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,690

32
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,827
If this case was the premeditated
murder of Oide Raita,

33
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:46,167
that would make what Taira
said rather curious.

34
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:49,137
He was snoring in his sleep.

35
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:50,627
Right on the floor here.

36
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:52,087
That testimony.

37
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:55,587
That's it!

38
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:56,447
All right!

39
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,087
Did you figure something out?

40
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:01,317
I haven't figured anything out, so I'm
going back to the Oide family home.

41
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:02,347
I see.

42
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:06,097
Inspiration will surely strike
if we go to the crime scene,

43
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:10,097
the same way we figured out
Taira Yasushi was the burglar.

44
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:16,017
So, why are we taking the train
instead of a rental car today?

45
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:16,607
Because today, taking public
transportation is good luck.

46
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:20,617
This week for you!
Taking public
transportation is good luck!
Because today, taking public
transportation is good luck.

47
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,627
We're relying on fortune telling now?

48
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:25,617
Wait, is this what he was
reading so intently earlier?

49
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:30,627
If we'd taken the train yesterday,
we might've solved the case already.

50
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:34,067
Now then.

51
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:36,607
Fusaya-kun.

52
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,907
Mori-san, what are you doing here?

53
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:42,137
I thought I'd examine your place again today.

54
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,317
I see. In that case, my
sister went to the hospital.

55
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:46,927
I'll give you the key.

56
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,457
Thank you.

57
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,957
Fusaya-san, you're dressed rather formally.

58
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,707
Do you have a date or something?

59
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,657
No. I've got an interview.

60
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,367
Your necktie is crooked.

61
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:05,597
My father was worried that I couldn't
find a job until the very end.

62
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,157
I thought doing whatever it takes to get one
would be a good way to honor his memory.

63
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:13,457
They're closed today, but I asked
them to make some time for me.

64
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:17,647
I'm sure they'll understand if you
explain your feelings to them.

65
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:18,827
They surely will.

66
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:20,297
Thank you.

67
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:24,297
All that's left is to
find my father's killer.

68
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:29,257
Leave it all to me, the great detective Mori
Kogoro, to handle the case.

69
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,687
You should focus on your interview.

70
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:33,307
Mori-san.

71
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,937
So, we came all the way here...

72
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:43,657
But I'm still not getting any ideas.

73
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,447
It's strange, isn't it?

74
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:47,047
What is?

75
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,957
When Taira snuck into the
house to steal the money,

76
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,937
Oide Raita-san was sleeping on
the floor around here, right?

77
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,607
Huh?

78
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,957
They have a sofa, so why was
he sleeping on the hard floor?

79
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:02,097
He was probably overcome
by extreme sleepiness.

80
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:06,217
When I've had a lot to drink, I end
up sleeping wherever when I come home.

81
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:11,797
But Raita-san was looking for Fusaya-san
that day, so that couldn't have been it.

82
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,377
Maybe he drank his cares away.

83
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,227
He's not you.

84
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:19,557
In that case, he must've
been really tired or...

85
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,607
Sleeping pills.

86
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,947
In that case, the culprit

87
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:28,117
secretly drugged Raita with sleeping
pills before Taira snuck into the house.

88
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:34,517
After confirming they'd taken
effect, they tried to kill him.

89
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:35,987
But then...

90
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,127
Taira snuck into the house.

91
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:42,727
The culprit hid somewhere and
watched to see what he'd do.

92
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:46,177
After watching Taira burglarize
and flee the house,

93
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:51,307
they killed Raita as planned.

94
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,537
In that case, why did the culprit
bother putting him to sleep?

95
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,187
Because he would've resisted otherwise.

96
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,647
In other words, the culprit is a weak person.

97
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:05,527
Like a woman?

98
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,657
I hate to imagine it,

99
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,147
but is that a possibility?

100
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,347
A woman? Could it be?

101
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,357
All right. In that case...

102
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:19,497
Mister?

103
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:21,337
We'll have to go to the hospital to check.

104
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,417
Sounds like he's zeroed
in on the culprit again.

105
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,757
What? A woman?

106
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:28,607
Yes.

107
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:29,177
Did Raita mention having
problems with anyone?

108
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:32,507
Oide Io (56)
Fusaya's Mother
Oide An (24)
Fusaya's Older Sister
Did Raita mention having
problems with anyone?

109
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:32,637
Oide An (24)
Fusaya's Older Sister
Oide Io (56)
Fusaya's Mother

110
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:34,847
She's a young woman.

111
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,487
Who are you talking about?

112
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,367
She was there yesterday by the station.

113
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,467
A very suspicious-looking woman.

114
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,017
Oh.

115
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:46,987
Oh, that's who you meant.

116
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:49,257
Who did you think I was talking about?

117
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:50,277
Nobody.

118
00:07:50,697 --> 00:07:55,627
She's around your age, wears sunglasses,
and has a mole right here.

119
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:56,037
What?

120
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:59,147
Do you mean Kuremi?

121
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,507
So you know who she is?

122
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:01,537
Y-Yes.

123
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:03,287
Soho Kuremi-san.

124
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,687
She was my classmate in middle school.

125
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,617
Last night she came here to visit us.

126
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,237
She's your friend?

127
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,047
She was here last night?

128
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:11,997
Yes.

129
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,027
When I ran into her the other day,
I told her I'd gotten engaged.

130
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,807
She seemed very happy for me.

131
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:20,477
Where can I find this Soho Kuremi-san?

132
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,597
H-Hold on.

133
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,377
She gave me her business card the other day.

134
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:25,227
This is it.

135
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:25,897

She's a pharmacist?

138
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:32,757
In other words, she could've
acquired some sleeping pills.

139
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,557
Thank you for your help.

140
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,407
Now then.

141
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:36,967
Excuse me.

142
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,037
Wait, Mister.

143
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:40,497
Does Kuremi know something?

144
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:43,337
Maybe there's something
he wants her help with.

145
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,417
On the day of the incident, when
the two of you returned home,

146
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:51,837
Raita-san was in the living room angry about
Fusaya-san running away from home, right?

147
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:53,487
Not in the living room.

148
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,377
He was at the bottom of the
stairs just inside the entrance.

149
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:57,287
Yeah.

150
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,847
Dad was really angry while
he was fixing the shelf.

151
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:05,267
Fusaya leaving home must
have really come as a shock.

152
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:09,307
Remember that last phone call he made to you?

153
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:10,737
Did something happen?

154
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:11,687
Yeah.

155
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,907
He called to ask if we'd found Fusaya.

156
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,527
I see.

157
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:20,187
You haven't even found anyone who's seen him.

158
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:24,917
I'm sorry. I suddenly feel sleepy.

159
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,587
The rest is up to you.

160
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:28,917
Hey, Dad?

161
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:34,417
Since his voice was so indistinct, I
thought it must have really gotten to him.

162
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,927
What time did you receive
that final phone call?

163
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,837
Around 3:30.

164
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:41,747
Is something the matter?

165
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,187
No.

166
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:46,067
I'll pass on your story.

167
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,047
Bye.

00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,037
Soho Kuremi (24)
Pharmacist

175
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:02,187
You seem to recognize me.

176
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:06,567
You know who I am, don't you?

177
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:14,327
Soho Kuremi-san, after running
into your former classmate,

178
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,847
you heard about her engagement.

179
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,297
She was engaged to the
son of a wealthy family.

180
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:22,847
Jealous that she was marrying into money,

181
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:25,857
you plotted to inflict misfortune upon her.

182
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:27,177
Huh?

183
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,247
There's something odd about this culprit.

184
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,767
By making her father Raita a murder victim.

185
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:39,617
That day, you visited the Oide family home

186
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:44,867
and secretly drugged Raita using sleeping
pills you procured from your workplace.

187
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:48,477
The sudden sleepiness Raita mentioned

188
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,627
was due to the sleeping pills
he was given taking effect.

189
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:55,127
In other words, Raita must've fallen asleep
immediately afterwards just past 4 PM.

190
00:10:56,317 --> 00:11:00,487
But he was killed 30 minutes later at 4:30.

191
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:03,797
They successfully put
him to sleep as planned,

192
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,397
so why didn't the culprit act right away?

193
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,257
That 30 minute delay.

194
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,627
What does it mean?

195
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,517
I'm beat.

196
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,527
I can't believe I got injured after
getting caught up in that accident.

197
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:20,327
Although I did receive a bunch
of money in compensation.

198
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,907
That kind of thinking will get you killed.

199
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:27,357
Your injuries may not have been
serious, but it's still a concussion.

200
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:35,257
That's what you thought of me?

201
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:35,677
Huh?

202
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:37,987
It's true that I was jealous.

203
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:41,177
I think she got what she
deserved with this case.

204
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:44,747
When you started showing up
everywhere I went, I laughed.

205
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,977
I thought they must really be struggling
if they hired a famous detective.

206
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:51,687
But it sounds like you're actually a hack.

207
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,107
Wh-What?

208
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:57,527
I haven't fallen so low that I'd commit
murder over something like that.

209
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,907
Could you not make a fool of me?

210
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:04,667
Then why did you keep showing up
wherever that family went yesterday?

211
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,807
Is watching them from a distance
and pretending to visit them

212
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,587
so I could laugh at them a crime?

213
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,837
It's certainly true that
you're behaving suspiciously.

214
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:16,027
Don't treat me like a criminal when
you don't even have any evidence.

215
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,577
Then at least help me with my investigation.

216
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,007
You're so persistent.

217
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,817
I'll give you some special information
if you'll leave me alone.

218
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,427
Wh-What is it?

219
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,547
I saw a suspicious person exit that house

220
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:32,047
on the day of the incident
when the 4:30 PM notice played.

221
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,047
What? What kind of person?

222
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:38,447
A short man wearing a hat with
shaggy hair and a prominent nose.

223
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:44,307
Shaggy hair, prominent nose, wearing a hat,

224
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,977
and short.

225
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,367
That's Taira.

226
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,987
What? He's not the culprit?

227
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,897
I held onto that information so
the family would owe me a favor.

228
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:56,747
Hold on.

229
00:12:56,747 --> 00:13:00,477
Was he carrying a large bag of some kind?

230
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:01,887
A bag, huh?

231
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:07,297
I think all he had with him
was a small shoulder bag.

232
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:12,257
Which means Taira didn't
take the weapon with him.

233
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,397
He's starting to sound innocent.

234
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:16,277
Satisfied?

235
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:21,827
Good luck finding the real
culprit, Mr. Great Detective.

236
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:23,777
Later.

237
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,077
Damn it!

238
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:26,977
Tebai Police Station

239
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:29,537
What? From the autopsy?
Tebai Police Station

240
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:32,917
Yeah. He asked me to check in a hurry.

241
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:33,187
Lieutenant Tagiri Yoshia (45)
Tebai Station Officer

242
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,487
If it was Mori-san's request,
then I suppose I can show you.
Lieutenant Tagiri Yoshia (45)
Tebai Station Officer

243
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:36,497
But will you understand
what you're looking at?
Lieutenant Tagiri Yoshia (45)
Tebai Station Officer

244
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:39,827
But will you understand
what you're looking at?

245
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,927
I'll tell him exactly
what I saw. Don't worry.

246
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:43,927
Will you?

247
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,727
Single blow only

248
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:53,277
Caused by acute epidural hematoma

249
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,477
I knew it.
Caused by acute epidural hematoma

250
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:58,587
The person who set the gears of tragedy
in motion for the Oide family was...

251
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:11,884
Really?

252
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,164
Yeah, I really got the job.

253
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:15,704
That's great.

254
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:17,934
Now Dad can rest in peace.

255
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,464
You came, Fusaya.

256
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:24,194
Sorry, Mom. Did I wake you?

257
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,184
It's fine.

258
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:28,534
I was just dreaming about you.

259
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,314
We were all celebrating you landing a job.

260
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:33,734
Mom, your dream came true.

261
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,194
What? You mean...

262
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:38,944
Yeah. They're going to hire me.

263
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:43,614
That's great. That's so great.

264
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,464
Hello? Yes.

265
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:50,834
Really? Yes.

266
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,484
Yes, I'll head back immediately.

267
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:54,834
What is it?

268
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,384
That was Mori-san.

269
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:57,964
He figured out who the culprit is.

270
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:01,464
Hiring him was the right choice after all.

271
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:05,164
You're getting married, and I got a job.

272
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:08,474
The gears of tragedy will
finally stop turning now.

273
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:11,614
I'm going to go hear what he has to say.

274
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,604
Is it true?

275
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,944
After all, it's only been a day.

276
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,984
Well, he is a great detective.

277
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,614
You're right.

278
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:31,914
There's no harm in praying to god
or asking great detectives for help.

279
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,124
What does that mean?

280
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,594
I'll meet you at your home.

281
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:42,504
Oide

282
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,804
Where have you been?

283
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,044
What about you?

284
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,764
How did things go with the suspicious woman?

285
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,724
She was just suspicious, nothing more.

286
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,814
I didn't find a single piece of evidence.

287
00:15:55,814 --> 00:16:03,024
I see. Speaking of evidence, they didn't
find any sleeping pills in Raita-san's body.

288
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,624
No alcohol either.

289
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:05,904
What?

290
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:09,944
That means my deduction
is fundamentally wrong.

291
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,954
Wait, how do you even know that?

292
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:18,714
Lieutenant Tagiri asked me to tell you.

293
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:22,784
Mori-san.

294
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:25,584
You truly are the country's
greatest detective.

295
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,574
Who is it? Who's the true culprit?

296
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:30,014
What?

297
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:32,394
Actually, I, uh—

298
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,464
I'm still working on that...

299
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:38,144
Mori-san?

300
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,014
Let's figure that out together.

301
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:43,654
Is this the rumored Sleeping Kogoro?

302
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:47,154
Allow me to describe my reasoning.

303
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:54,384
The culprit thought to have snuck into
this house and killed your father

304
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:58,664
never existed in the first place.

305
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:02,364
What do you mean, Mori-san?

306
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:07,174
Before I explain the truth, I'd like
to confirm something with you first.

307
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:13,684
The morning of the incident, Raita returned
just as you were leaving the house

308
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:18,684
in order to avoid troubling
your sister and her fiancee.

309
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:25,074
He returned to speak with you about your
future, but the two of you got into a fight.

310
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,944
That's right. Why are you
bringing that up now?

311
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,084
Was your fight with your
father rather intense?

312
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:33,954
For example...

313
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:38,704
Yeah. Dad was really angry
while he was fixing the shelf.

314
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:43,234
Your sister was referring to
the hanging shelf up there.

315
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,214
And your fight was violent
enough that it broke.

316
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:49,314
We got into a scuffle, and
I threw my father off of me.

317
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:54,224
His back struck the wall,
causing the shelf to fall.

318
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:58,144
I left while that was happening.

319
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:00,474
And that was around 10 AM.

320
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:05,474
Yes. More importantly, what do
you mean, there's no culprit?

321
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:06,234
My father is—

322
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:09,114
Dead. You've heard the cause
of death, haven't you?

323
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,114
Yes, but I'd never heard the term before.

324
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:12,514
Caused by acute epidural hematoma

325
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,994
Acute epidural hematoma.
Caused by acute epidural hematoma

326
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:18,534
Yes, I believe that's what it's called.

327
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,874
They're quite tricky.

328
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:25,674
Often the moment a person strikes their
head and their time of death don't match.

329
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,124
What?

330
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:31,434
People who strike their head and
fall unconscious due to a concussion

331
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:35,394
often recover quickly and appear totally
lucid as though nothing happened.

332
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,224
This is known as a lucid interval.

333
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,144
Lucid Interval
This is known as a lucid interval.

334
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:43,054
The state can persist for three to six hours.

335
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:48,064
However, they then rapidly lose
consciousness and die shortly later.

336
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,564
You're saying that's what
happened to my father?

337
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,284
Most likely.

338
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,154
You mean...

339
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:58,714
Why don't you show a little more
consideration for your family?

340
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:02,494
You and Raita got into a scuffle here.

341
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:14,984
The hanging shelf fell, and its
corner struck Raita on the head.

342
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,934
That's when the acute
epidural hematoma developed.

343
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,794
Raita probably lost
consciousness for a moment,

344
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,314
but once the lucid interval began,

345
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:28,454
he got up as though nothing had happened.

346
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:29,444
Fusaya!

347
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:31,324
After that, he fixed the shelf,

348
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:34,944
and helped your other family
members look for you,

349
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:41,074
but eventually he was overcome by
fatigue as he lost consciousness.

350
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:45,144
Unaware that a burglar
had entered his home...

351
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:50,084
The time is 4:30.

352
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:53,224
Please be careful as you
return to your homes.

353
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:54,784
...he died.

354
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,704
But that's just one theory, right?

355
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:05,024
There could be a true culprit who
snuck in after that burglar fled

356
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:08,524
and bludgeoned my father to death!

357
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,274
That's not possible.

358
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,024
There were no wounds on Raita's head aside
from the one caused by the fatal blow.

359
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:17,034
Single blow only
There were no wounds on Raita's head aside
from the one caused by the fatal blow.

360
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,944
And when the shelf was examined earlier,

361
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:24,034
it matched Raita's injury.

362
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:27,404
That's the truth, Fusaya-kun.

363
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:32,244
Which means my father died

364
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:35,954
because of me.

365
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:43,684
I prayed at this shrine yesterday
evening and this morning, too,

366
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:49,814
for Mori-san to find the culprit.

367
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,564
Your prayers were answered.

368
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:56,574
Now we can finally begin
preparing for your wedding.

369
00:20:56,574 --> 00:21:02,324
Fusaya has found his way, and you'll
be able to leave the hospital tomorrow.

370
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:07,474
The light has finally fallen on our family.

371
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,324
Yeah.

372
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:53,374
You can count on me, Fusaya-kun.

373
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:59,414
I promise I'll save the entire Oide family.

374
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:06,684
I, the great detective Mori Kogoro, so swear.

375
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:13,834
Mori-san, it's my job to stop the
gears of tragedy from turning.

376
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:18,334
Fusaya-kun, you should decide
how you'll live for yourself.

377
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:20,074
Thank you.

378
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:22,094
For my dad, my sister, my mom.

379
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,094
For my entire family.

380
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:26,704
I...

381
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,724
Tebai Police Station

382
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:37,674
After all, I'm the country's
greatest detective.

383
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:39,404
Hey, Mister.

384
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:42,314
It's time for the last train.

385
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:47,464
Come on, old man. Wake up already.

386
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:54,414
Taking public transportation
is good luck? Yeah, right.
