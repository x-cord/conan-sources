1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:03,466
In order to catch up with the members of the Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:05,466
who went before us by bus,

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:09,466
Ai and I were given a lift on Subaru's car.

4
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,266
We ran into Officer Takagi on the way, I stopped to talk to him when...

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:14,766
He fell!

6
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:15,866
Somebody fell!

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,166
Let's go to the site.

8
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,066
Come on, hurry.

9
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,466
When we get to the site,

10
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:24,066
we see the body that had fallen from the top floor of the condo.

11
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:28,366
Since three people who knew the man who fell were near the site,

12
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,366
we visited the rooms of each of these people

13
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,566
to ask them some questions but...

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,766
How about this?

15
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,966
There's still this much beer foam left here.

16
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,366
It's because I was drinking beer

17
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,966
and watching TV till just a while ago.

18
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:43,166
I see.

19
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,666
This coffee?

20
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:50,266
That's the coffee I was drinking before I left the room.

21
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,366
I can't start my day without my morning coffee.

22
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:56,466
Then, this will for the time being, serve as proof.

23
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:59,766
There still some steam rising from it too.

24
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,366
Hurry and look officer!

25
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,166
Please calm down.

26
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,466
After I heard about the steam of Ms. Tsukihara's coffee a while ago,

27
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,066
I happened to remember.

28
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,266
No good. They're all snuffed out.

29
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:16,766
I left the cigarette standing in the ashtray when I left the room,

30
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:20,366
so I thought it'd still be lit, but...

31
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:21,866
Please look, see.

32
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,166
The smoke's still rising, isn't it?

33
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:27,566
This is proof that I was here till just a while ago.

34
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:30,766
The things that will serve as proof of the alibis are...

35
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:34,966
foam, steam, and smoke.

36
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:37,366
Inspector Megure.

37
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,966
Why don't we experiment while we're at it?

38
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,466
Experiment?

39
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:45,866
Yes, an experiment with foam, steam, and smoke.

40
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,566
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

41
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,466
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

42
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,566
A perfect trick that erased all traces.

43
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,566
The experiment proves false alibi.

44
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,266
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,466
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,766
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:51,488
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 2)"

48
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:55,188
Well, just as Conan said...

49
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:56,688
If the room temperature is low,

50
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:59,188
I think that steam would hold longer but...

51
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:02,688
The room temperature here is 27��C?

52
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,288
"Kaori Tsukihara" -When I entered this room together with you officers,

53
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:08,588
I didn't touch the remote controller of the air conditioner, did I?

54
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,988
No, you didn't.

55
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:13,488
No matter how many times we do it,

56
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:15,688
the steam becomes invisible after about 8 minutes.

57
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,588
Then, when you heard the noise and left the room,

58
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:21,288
was there anything you noticed?

59
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:24,788
Like see someone suspicious or hear something queer.

60
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:25,988
I wonder...

61
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,488
It seems that the people on the upper floors

62
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,988
were trying to go down using the elevator,

63
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:32,088
so it didn't come for a while.

64
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:34,388
So, I went down using the stairs,

65
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:36,688
but I didn't see anyone suspicious.

66
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,388
Any noise, then?

67
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,888
Well...

68
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:42,588
Just before I left the room,

69
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,988
I heard the sound of a bell from Mr. Ogino's room next door.

70
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:48,088
Oh, that bell...

71
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:52,288
It's the alarm clock by the pillow at the bedside.

72
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,088
When I'm not staking out,

73
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,388
I always get up at 7:30 am.

74
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:58,988
Well, but last night I got up in the middle of the night

75
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:01,588
and was watching the soccer broadcast from abroad.

76
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:06,788
"Keisuke Ogino (34)" -And? What about the foam in the beer?

77
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:10,188
I tried several glasses.

78
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:13,888
The foams seem to disappear after 6 minutes or so.

79
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:16,188
By the way, when you left the room,

80
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:18,588
did you see or hear anything?

81
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:19,888
Come to think of it,

82
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:21,688
when I was going down the stairs,

83
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,288
I heard Sodesaki below, going down.

84
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:28,488
He always carries a bunch of keys on his hip

85
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:31,488
and when he moves they jingle.

86
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:33,488
Yes, I wear them,

87
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,288
the bunch of keys. See.

88
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,388
You sure have a lot of keys, don't you?

89
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:41,588
"Kazutomo Sodezaki (31)" -For my house, my car, my office,

90
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,888
my bicycle and the key for my safe.

91
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:47,088
For cigarettes to burn to ashes completely.

92
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,688
It would take a little less than 9 minutes.

93
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:53,388
Your cigarette was on the verge of burning completely, wasn't it?

94
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:54,488
Yes.

95
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,788
If so, it would mean

96
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,788
that you left the room for around 9 minutes or so.

97
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:01,888
Of course.

98
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:04,188
You officers came to my room

99
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:06,788
after you checked Mr. Ogino's room and all.

100
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,388
Then, when you came out of the room,

101
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:11,588
was there anything that bothered you?

102
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,388
A sound or a person.

103
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,388
A sound...

104
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:16,788
When I got to the site,

105
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:19,888
I heard Ms. Tsukihara's cell phone's ringtone

106
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,588
among the spectators, that's about it.

107
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:23,688
Who was the call from?

108
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:28,188
She told me it was from the cameraman in charge.

109
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,188
Something about a scoop picture or something.

110
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:33,688
I see.

111
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,588
What shall we do about those three, inspector?

112
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:42,388
They all have enough motive,

113
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:45,988
I guess we'll have them interrogated a bit longer.

114
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:48,988
An alarm clock,

115
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:52,088
a bunch of keys and a cell phone ringtone...

116
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,488
Those three said that?

117
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:59,688
Yes, they're each going through interrogation individually.

118
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:02,488
And? How did the experiment work out?

119
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,988
The beer foam lasted for about 6 minutes.

120
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,188
The steam, about 8 minutes

121
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:10,388
and the cigarette smoke about 9 minutes.

122
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,188
So, room temperature had nothing to do with it.

123
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,188
Officer Takagi, you look sleepy.

124
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,288
Well, sort of.

125
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:19,488
I was staking out all night,

126
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,888
and didn't get to sleep right through after that.

127
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:24,488
If I use the eye drops that Chiba always uses,

128
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:27,788
I can pretend to look a bit sharp but...

129
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:30,388
He's still staking out.

130
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:32,788
Pretend?

131
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,388
Come to think of it,

132
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:39,988
pops told me once before.

133
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:41,988
How about it, surprised?

134
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:45,388
I used to do this when I was a poor student.

135
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,088
I see. I get it.

136
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,688
So, he's the culprit after all.

137
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:54,188
Do you think it'll really be okay, Conan?

138
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,988
I've got to start heading home soon.

139
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,188
Would you like me to give you a lift?

140
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,388
I'll be fine, because I have a car waiting for me.

141
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:05,688
Besides, if you hear what I have to say,

142
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,288
I'm sure that you'll end up going back again

143
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,688
to that condo.

144
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:16,188
I wonder if this the first time...

145
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:19,188
that I've been with you, just the two of us.

146
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:22,688
Come to think of it, I guess so.

147
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,288
I don't really feel right

148
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,988
parking right outside The Metropolitan Police Department.

149
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,888
But, since I have to wait for him,

150
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,588
what do you say,

151
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,788
I move the car to the parking lot and we wait inside the car?

152
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,388
If you want to do so why don't you force me to do so?

153
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,788
I would never force you to do anything.

154
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:41,388
Because I gave her my word.

155
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:46,388
Then, I'm sorry,

156
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:48,188
but could you both wait for me there.

157
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:51,088
I'm sure that I can be back in about 30 minutes so.

158
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:57,488
I tell you... why can't you just leave it up to the police?

159
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:02,088
Rather, are you sure you don't want to wait in the car?

160
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,188
You might catch a cold.

161
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,388
I'll be fine.

162
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,488
Like they say, children love the cold.

163
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:14,888
Hey, hey, it's already pass 7:00 in the evening.

164
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,088
This is getting us nowhere.

165
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,988
I mean you tried it out many times

166
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,788
before going to interrogation at the police, didn't you?

167
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:25,688
Why do we have to return and check the time again?

168
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:28,288
All my cigarettes are gone already.

169
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:31,888
After the incident when I returned to my room with the officer,

170
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:35,288
the foam of the beer was still in the glass, wasn't it?

171
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:38,488
Steam from my coffee was still rising too.

172
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:41,988
The smoke from my cigarette was still rising, wasn't it?

173
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,788
Aren't all these proof that we were all in our rooms

174
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:47,788
until right before the incident happened?

175
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:52,188
Rather, why are you doing that experiment in my room?

176
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:55,988
I also wondered about that, but Officer Takagi...

177
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:59,188
Because we'll find out if we stay here...

178
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:01,388
who the culprit is.

179
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,188
Conan?

180
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:08,388
Well, the first ones who entered the room were Officer Takagi

181
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,188
and I so we realized it.

182
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,488
Really?

183
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:14,088
Yes, sir.

184
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:16,788
What did you realize?

185
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:19,988
Conan, wasn't the one who saw through the truth,

186
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:23,188
not us two, but Shinichi Kudo.

187
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:26,788
That's why if we carry everything out the way Shinichi said we should,

188
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,188
everything will work out.

189
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,688
"When the time ripens,

190
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:34,288
the traces that the culprit failed to erase will emerge."

191
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:37,688
That's what Shinichi wrote in his mail to me.

192
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,596
Conan, wasn't the one who saw through the truth,

193
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:52,896
not us two, but Shinichi Kudo.

194
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:56,496
That's why if we carry everything out the way Shinichi said we should,

195
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,896
everything will work out.

196
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,196
"When the time ripens,

197
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:03,996
the traces that the culprit failed to erase will emerge."

198
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,796
That's what Shinichi wrote in his mail to me.

199
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:11,196
If so, I wonder why he didn't call Inspector Megure directly

200
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:12,896
and tell him the truth?

201
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:16,996
Hey. I don't know what you're up to

202
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:19,196
but I hope you saying that, "we'll find out if we stay here"

203
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:22,696
doesn't mean that you think that I'm the one

204
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,896
who killed President Katsumoto?

205
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:25,896
No.

206
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:28,996
The culprit avoided the surveillance camera

207
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:31,096
in the elevator and used the stairs, right?

208
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:36,096
If I'm the one who pushed President Katsumoto off the 26th floor,

209
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,796
there's no way that I could've run over to the place

210
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:41,496
in front of the condo where Katsumoto was found before these two.

211
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:44,296
Right? I was the first to be there, wasn't I?

212
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:47,596
Yes. When I got there,

213
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,996
Ms. Tsukihara was already among the spectators.

214
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:53,996
Then, why did you get there later than she did, Mr. Sodesaki?

215
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,496
You also went there after hearing someone shout,

216
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,496
"Somebody fell!" didn't you?

217
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,696
Why?

218
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:01,696
I was right in the midst of writing an article,

219
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:03,496
and wasn't about to stop in the middle.

220
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,896
But, I was only a minute or two late.

221
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:10,096
Then, what about you Mr. Ogino,

222
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,696
that arrived at the scene later than Mr. Sodesaki?

223
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,696
It was a scene that I couldn't afford not watching,

224
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,796
so I couldn't leave right away.

225
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:18,296
Because I was watching the soccer game on TV.

226
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:20,796
What scene couldn't you afford not to see?

227
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,596
I forgot.

228
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:24,696
I think a super pass was made or something,

229
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:27,396
a corner kick... or it could've been anything.

230
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,296
Which means that you were absorbed

231
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,996
in watching the soccer game, right, Mr. Ogino?

232
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,496
Yes, that's right.

233
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:35,196
So much that I almost couldn't hear the noise outside.

234
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,796
If so...

235
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:38,396
Wasn't it noisy?

236
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,996
The bell of the alarm clock?

237
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,596
Come to think of it,

238
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:48,396
I heard it when I left the room to go check the noise outside.

239
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:52,696
This bell is the sound of the alarm clock in your room, isn't it?

240
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,696
Yes, most probably.

241
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:57,796
It's 7:30 in the evening now.

242
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:02,696
I heard that you always set your alarm to ring at 7:30 in the morning.

243
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,896
Why is it ringing even now?

244
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:09,296
It's because you left the bell ringing without stopping it,

245
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:12,296
and made it stop on its own?

246
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:16,896
In other words, that's proof that you weren't in your room back then.

247
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,596
You couldn't have been calmly watching a soccer game in this room

248
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:22,196
with the alarm ringing as loud as it was.

249
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,496
So loud that it could be heard all the way to this room next door.

250
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:28,196
Well, you could've been concerned of the noise outside,

251
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:29,896
and it's understandable if you left the room

252
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,796
without taking note of the alarm ringing in your room.

253
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:35,696
If so, you would've at least had to be at the site

254
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:38,096
before Mr. Sodesaki, no?

255
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,196
How about it?

256
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:40,596
Oh, that's right.

257
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,696
I remember.

258
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,596
The john, I went to the men's room.

259
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:47,796
Back then, I was doing my thing in the john.

260
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:50,596
I thought the alarm clock was ringing

261
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,396
but I couldn't stop it.

262
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,796
I heard somebody say, "Somebody fell!" before I went to the john,

263
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:59,396
and was concerned, but I couldn't hold it any longer.

264
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:02,496
And, you mean the alarm had stopped after you came out of the restroom

265
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,996
and headed for the site then?

266
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:08,596
Yes. After watching soccer for a while though.

267
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:11,896
Darn, his story's consistent.

268
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:15,496
And besides, didn't you say, officer...

269
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,896
If I were the culprit, used the stairs,

270
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:21,196
went up 23 floors to the president's room to push him off,

271
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:23,596
and ran down the stairs to the first floor.

272
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,596
It would mean that my room would've been empty

273
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:29,096
for more than 10 minutes until you came to my room.

274
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,396
The foam of the beer would've been gone,

275
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:33,996
like that beer, if left as is for 10 minutes.

276
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:37,896
But when you came to my room, officer,

277
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,696
there was still a lot of foam in my beer glass, wasn't there?

278
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,396
Or, are you insinuating

279
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:45,896
that I used magic or something to make the beer foam?

280
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:49,596
Abracadabra.

281
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:53,596
How strange. There's so much foam.

282
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,796
The foam should've been gone and yet why?

283
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:03,596
I poured in the salt that I found in the kitchen of this room.

284
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:06,896
If you pour salt into beer, will it foam up?

285
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,296
If it's any type of grain that sinks in beer,

286
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:12,096
I guess anything will do whether it's sugar, sand, and so on.

287
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,296
The point is, when it sinks,

288
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:17,396
and a lot of space is created between the air and beer,

289
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:21,396
carbon dioxide seems to gather there, and create foams.

290
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:23,896
So, see.

291
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,996
In the other beer glasses where the foams have disappeared,

292
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:27,996
if you pour salt into them...

293
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,896
-True. -Wow.

294
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:36,696
But, Conan, it's amazing that you knew something like this.

295
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,396
Pops Kogoro told me about it once.

296
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:42,496
How about it, surprised?

297
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:44,196
When I was a poor student,

298
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:46,696
I used to use this method a lot.

299
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,796
When he was a university student he was poor,

300
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:52,196
so he used to pour in salt occasionally so people wouldn't notice

301
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:54,296
that he was sipping beer that lost all foam.

302
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:55,596
By the way,

303
00:15:55,596 --> 00:16:00,596
it seems that this method is also used when taking pictures of beer.

304
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:04,796
Because it looks more delicious with foam.

305
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:08,296
It's something that you, a cameraman would know about.

306
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:12,096
But... I didn't have any salt on me back then.

307
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,196
But, Mr. Ogino, when we came into the room

308
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:19,196
you kicked the package that was at the entrance, didn't you?

309
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:28,496
That was something you brought back from the funeral, right?

310
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:31,496
If so, it would've been inside, no?

311
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,496
The "cleansing salt".

312
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:37,696
I see, so he used that salt.

313
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,996
Yes, most likely.

314
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:42,596
Because after he kicked it,

315
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:44,396
he returned the tea package that fell out.

316
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:48,096
Back then, he took out the "cleansing salt"

317
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,496
and snuck it into his pocket.

318
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,396
He then broke the packet open,

319
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:53,196
picked up several grains of salt.

320
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:57,296
Then, just before showing me the beer glass,

321
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:00,796
poured salt into it and showed me the beer with foams.

322
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:04,296
Well, it must've been a trick that he thought up

323
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:08,096
at the spur of the moment.

324
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,196
Even if he were to have disposed of the salt packet somewhere,

325
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,196
there should be several grains of salt left in his pocket.

326
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:16,496
Besides, if he did push someone off the veranda,

327
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:19,196
they must've struggled slightly.

328
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:21,096
And if you consider the fact that

329
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:25,296
he had to rush out of the room as soon as possible,

330
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:30,196
if we check the carpet that President Katsumoto had installed last night,

331
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:31,896
I'm sure we'll still be able to find it, no?

332
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:36,296
The trace of you having gone to the President's room

333
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:39,696
between last night and this morning.

334
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:46,296
But, it's hard to believe

335
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,696
that Mr. Ogino would kill President Katsumoto.

336
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,496
Right. Because even the lawyer told us

337
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:52,996
that our chances of winning were good.

338
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:56,196
In the first place, you said so too, Mr. Ogino.

339
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:59,196
That on the memory card that had the successive pictures in it,

340
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:01,596
the fingerprints of the president were on,

341
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:02,796
so that it would prove that...

342
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,596
the president had chosen the pictures in question,

343
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:07,196
on his own and put them on the magazine.

344
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,396
Why would he want to kill the president

345
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,196
knowing that he would be winning the case?

346
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:14,396
It disappeared.

347
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:15,996
Disappeared?

348
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,996
Since I received that strange mail this morning from the president,

349
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:22,896
I had this uneasy feeling, so I checked...

350
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:27,996
and found that the memory card had disappeared from my camera bag.

351
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:32,996
I had an idea of who it was right away,

352
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,496
so I went to the president's room

353
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,196
and pressed him for an answer. Just as I thought...

354
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:38,796
Cut it out.

355
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,196
Why don't you ask your assistant who quit the other day

356
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,496
about that memory card?

357
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,696
Well, I'm sure he split somewhere abroad

358
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:48,696
after making a lot of cash and is enjoying himself.

359
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,496
I don't think you can contact him by phone either.

360
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,096
Just as I thought...

361
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:56,296
You paid him to steal that memory card.

362
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:01,496
He told me that you guys were planning to place charges against me.

363
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,896
Well, if you're not going to withdraw charges,

364
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:06,196
I've got something in mind too.

365
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:11,596
Those successive pictures will be used as a newly acquired scoop too.

366
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:18,096
With the headline, "A Ruthless Cameraman who Sold his Classmate."

367
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:22,396
Classmate?

368
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,896
With that actress?

369
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,196
Yes, we were classmates in intermediate school.

370
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:30,596
That's why I knew that the guy who was with her

371
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:33,296
was her younger step-brother.

372
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:36,696
And I didn't take that picture without permission.

373
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:42,096
I took it right in front of them so that I could send it to them.

374
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:45,696
My assistant, mistook that picture

375
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:47,196
and showed it to the president on his own

376
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:48,996
and made up that darn article.

377
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:53,296
That's why I couldn't forgive him

378
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:57,496
when thinking that the picture that I took

379
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,796
served as a factor in driving her to commit suicide.

380
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:03,496
By the time I snapped back to myself,

381
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:06,796
the president was lying flat on the ground like a frog.

382
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:13,496
But, for a murder that wasn't planned ahead of time,

383
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:17,396
I thought that the beer foam trick would get me through.

384
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,896
To think that the trick actually lead to me being suspected

385
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:22,196
and even served as proof against me...

386
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:27,096
I suspected you as being the culprit

387
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:29,996
ever since I heard that you were a cameraman.

388
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,196
No joke.

389
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,696
Because when you got to the site,

390
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:38,496
all you had on you was your cell phone and nothing else.

391
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:42,196
That's why I had my eye on you from the start.

392
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:44,996
But, if he heard the commotion and came,

393
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:46,396
having nothing on him would be natural.

394
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,796
No.

395
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:54,796
A press cameraman would never forget the camera

396
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,396
that brings in the bread.

397
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,496
Well, how amazing, Officer Takagi!

398
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,496
You're pretty good when you want to be.

399
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:28,296
Right.

400
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:31,296
Oh, well, not really...

401
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:35,196
All I did was talk as was written in Shinichi's mail though.

402
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:40,396
It seems that the case has been solved...

403
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:33,096
From here, it's my area.

404
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:35,096
It's not where you come in.

405
00:23:38,196 --> 00:23:41,696
Adults get cold easily and don't like the cold.

406
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,496
What's the matter? Both of you...

407
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,396
The door's left opened.

408
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:47,596
It's nothing.

409
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:48,596
Let's go home.

410
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:49,996
Let's go.

411
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,296
It's getting a bit chilly.

412
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:10,196
Wait, Candy!

413
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:13,296
Kingo Ebisawa and Ginji Kaniyama,

414
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:15,796
both have previous police records of committing robbery.

415
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,796
What's with you?

416
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,496
What's going to happen to Candy?

417
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:23,496
Inspector, if I remember correctly,

418
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:27,096
you said that the two were listening to police radio communication?

419
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:29,696
If... if we go that way, we'll run into the next checkpoint.

420
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,496
Where are you?

421
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:33,196
Next Conan,

422
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:37,096
"The Car Carrying a Time-Bomb".

423
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,996
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,196
"Puppy".

425
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,896
Kogoro, you did it.

426
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:00,696
I'm not just drinking.

427
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:01,996
No, I think you are.
