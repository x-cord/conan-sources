1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,640
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
There's a strange mark on Ayumi and Genta.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,340
The key to the case is in the car.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:50,568
On the way back from school in the rain,

9
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,268
Ayumi bumps into a serial killer on the run.

10
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:57,568
She didn't get to see his face

11
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,568
but the mark of, probably, the belongings of the culprit

12
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,268
that resembled the number "5"

13
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:03,368
was left on the palm of her hand.

14
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:07,268
And the same mark was also found on Genta's buttocks!

15
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,368
Don't tell me that...

16
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:14,268
This! It's this mark!

17
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,168
The key-shaped bloodstain

18
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:19,368
was on the sleeve of Ayumi's clothes.

19
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:22,568
This serves as proof that the culprit grabbed the key

20
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:25,568
with hands soiled with the blood of the victim and fled!

21
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,368
This means that the culprit will not show the police the key,

22
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:32,468
which he knows will display haematological response!

23
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:42,268
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 2)"

24
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:43,868
"The Metropolitan Police Department, Beika Police Station"

25
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,368
Only three?

26
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:48,468
Are you serious, Inspector Megure?

27
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,568
Yes.

28
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,568
One that was stopped at the checkpoint

29
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:55,768
and two others that were driving around in the vicinity!

30
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:58,068
They're car owners who are nearby residents that have no alibi

31
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:01,468
and who are saying that they've lost their master keys.

32
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,568
At any rate,

33
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,968
I'm going to have the three people go over to you right now.

34
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:09,568
If you got a glimpse of the serial killer,

35
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:10,868
I'd like you to make a confirmation too!

36
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,668
Yes, sir! I understand!

37
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:16,768
The three suspects are on their way here right now!

38
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:17,768
Good!

39
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:21,168
It's as if we've already arrested the culprit!

40
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,268
Ayumi heard the culprit's voice.

41
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:28,368
So, he'll probably go pale when he sees her!

42
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,168
Yes, I'm sure!

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,768
I'll do my best!

44
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,668
I'm against it.

45
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:38,468
It the culprit is really among the three,

46
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,568
you meet him and he gets arrested, that's fine.

47
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:47,368
But what if he's acquitted because of lack of evidence?

48
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:50,368
The culprit's going to hold a grudge on you for putting him in a fix,

49
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:54,868
come after you and may take revenge on you one day!

50
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,268
Even more so if he's a serial killer who's killing people at random,

51
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:59,068
don't you think so?

52
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:01,668
You're taking your imagination too far, Haibara.

53
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,268
I'm trying to say don't go taking a reckless risk

54
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:07,868
when there isn't sufficient evidence yet!

55
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:11,868
But I'm the one who saw the culprit at the closest range,

56
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,868
so I may be able to tell who the culprit is

57
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,868
if you make them wear raincoats, right?

58
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:19,768
You can confirm that just looking at pictures too, right?

59
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:22,768
As for the voice, you can listen to the recorded voice.

60
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,768
There's no need to go any further

61
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,068
and leave a stronger impression on the culprit

62
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,068
than you already have.

63
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,168
Just as Haibara's pointing out,

64
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:34,068
it's too risky to meet the culprit directly.

65
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,768
But it's vexing to let the three suspects go off just like that

66
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,868
after questioning them too.

67
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,768
There's no guarantee that they'll be no more victims either.

68
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,168
Maybe it's better to just keep a distance

69
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,668
and peek in secretly for now, right?

70
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:49,068
Okay! This way...

71
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,168
Stop!

72
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:57,268
Please get out of the car one by one,

73
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,768
tell me your name and what you do.

74
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,368
Please also tell me where and what you

75
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,668
were doing at the time of the crime, around 14:00.

76
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:05,468
First, from you at the far left.

77
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:06,668
Geez.

78
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:08,268
I came here voluntarily

79
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,368
and you treat me like I'm the culprit.

80
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:12,868
"Hiroshi Enomoto (21)" -I'm Hiroshi Enomoto.

81
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:13,968
I'm a university student working part-time

82
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:16,168
at a sushi shop at Sanchome!

83
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,568
Did you buy this car with the money you made

84
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,768
from working part-time?

85
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,468
No. I leeched off my parents.

86
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,468
Is there a problem with that?

87
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:24,968
I see.

88
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,468
If through smoked glass,

89
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,068
they can't see us from their side.

90
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:33,768
And does the voice of that man sound familiar?

91
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,068
It sounds familiar and yet doesn't.

92
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,868
It's my day off today.

93
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:41,568
Last night my boss scolded me

94
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,568
so I was feeling bummed out

95
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:46,368
and decided to get it off my chest by going to the mountains,

96
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:49,168
when I was nabbed at the checkpoint.

97
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,768
You were going to the mountains to get it off your chest?

98
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,568
Well, the scenery in that area is nice

99
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:55,268
so I feel refreshed.

100
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:59,368
No wonder the body of the car is soiled and full of scratches.

101
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,868
Next! You, in the middle!

102
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:04,268
Oh, yes.

103
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:06,968
Hey! Don't you go banging my car around!

104
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,768
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:13,268
I'm not really good at driving

106
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,268
but I'm good at repairing.

107
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,368
Which means you work as...

108
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,668
Oh, yes.

109
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,968
"Naokazu Fukuchi (36)" -I work at an automobile repair factory.

110
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:23,268
My name is Naokazu Fukuchi.

111
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:25,968
The factory is closed today

112
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,568
but my car was not in the best condition,

113
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,168
so I was confined in the factory since morning repairing it.

114
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:35,068
But there are reports of you being seen driving around town.

115
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:37,868
I was just driving around the shopping arcade to check

116
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:40,168
if the car was totally repaired!

117
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,568
Is anything wrong with that?

118
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,968
No.

119
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,168
Next.

120
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:47,368
Yeah.

121
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,068
"Toshiaki Degawa (43)" -My name's Toshiaki Degawa.

122
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:55,468
I'm a locksmith and my shop's located on Ichome.

123
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:59,268
How wretched of me despite being a locksmith,

124
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,568
to lose the master key.

125
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:06,568
Your car, unlike the other two, is sure nice and shiny.

126
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:09,768
Yeah, I go get a car wash each time I go out.

127
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,968
This car is my heart and soul, you know?

128
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,668
Which means you went out this afternoon too?

129
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,868
I got a call saying that the client lost her house key

130
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,668
and wanted me to unlock the door.

131
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,768
But since she didn't explain her address very well,

132
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:25,568
I was going around in circles looking for the house.

133
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,468
However, I didn't get to see her at all.

134
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,168
She called again and say that her boyfriend who had a spare key came,

135
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,968
so that I didn't have to go.

136
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:36,268
Has anything dawned on you so far?

137
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:38,468
Nothing at all.

138
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,568
Besides, they're not shouting.

139
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:43,568
All three of them are about the same height and physique.

140
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:44,968
Hey, over there!

141
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,468
What're you whispering about?

142
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,768
Oh, well...

143
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:48,868
Hey.

144
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,268
Officer Takagi

145
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:52,468
I've got a little favor to ask you.

146
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:54,768
What is it?

147
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:55,968
What could it be?

148
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,868
You see...

149
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,968
I'll go see him, after all.

150
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,168
What?

151
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:04,268
If I go closer and take a look,

152
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,368
I may be able to figure out the culprit.

153
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,968
No! Didn't I just tell you that

154
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,868
if the culprit doesn't get arrested,

155
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,768
something terrible may happen to you.

156
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:15,968
But...

157
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,868
Not only you.

158
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:20,268
There's a possibility that the culprit would come

159
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,868
to take revenge on anyone who was involved with you too.

160
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:27,268
Although I know how you feel about wanting to punish the bad guy,

161
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:29,068
but to hold back your feelings no matter how strong

162
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:33,068
and keeping out of the picture also requires a lot of courage too.

163
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:35,868
Yes. This is the right thing to do

164
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:39,968
for yourself as well as for all the others.

165
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:41,068
That's the story.

166
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:43,168
What? You want me to call the forensic officer

167
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,368
and get a minus screwdriver?

168
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:46,468
Yup.

169
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,268
I think everything will clear up.

170
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:53,368
And we'll all find out who the big fat liar serial killer

171
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:57,168
that is resorting to cheap tricks to hide his crime is.

172
00:08:57,168 --> 00:09:00,468
Yes, it's him.

173
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:01,968
Well, at any rate,

174
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,568
you're going to have to leave your cars

175
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:05,768
at the police station for a while.

176
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:07,768
There are a lot more things we'd like to check on.

177
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:08,868
Hey...

178
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,168
You got to be kidding.

179
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:14,268
I came here to Beika Police Station voluntarily.

180
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:18,268
Why are you taking things so far as to keep my car in police custody?

181
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:21,068
Please give us a convincing explanation too.

182
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:25,568
Why were we summoned here as suspects of a serial killer case?

183
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,868
If you called us in just because we don't have an alibi

184
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:28,868
during the time of the crime,

185
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,968
I'm sure there are a lot of other people too.

186
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:34,368
First of all, it's your car!

187
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,768
All of them are from the same brand and model.

188
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:37,968
Yeah.

189
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:42,068
Moreover, all three of you say you've lost your master key.

190
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,968
When the serial killer fled,

191
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:47,868
he dropped the car key of this car with the emblem of the brand on it.

192
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:50,268
We already have reports that the culprit picked the key up

193
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:53,768
with hands smeared with the blood of the victim.

194
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,068
We also know that he came back to the site of the crime to confirm

195
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,868
whether the police had a lead on him.

196
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,868
We also know based on the testimony of a witness

197
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:04,068
that the culprit is very likely a resident of this vicinity

198
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,768
who knows he'll be in hot water

199
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:11,068
once the police start checking on him.

200
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,768
The person who own this car model

201
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:15,268
have no alibi,

202
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,968
live nearby

203
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,268
and cannot show us your master key

204
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,668
because it is smeared with blood

205
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:23,268
are only three of you.

206
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:27,168
I told you I really just lost my key.

207
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,968
Well, a simple check by those forensic officers

208
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,868
will clear all of that in no time at all.

209
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,268
-Check? -What?

210
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,768
We're just going to check for luminol reactions.

211
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:42,468
Officer Takagi, please have them begin.

212
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,268
Yeah.

213
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,068
Please do as I told you over the phone then.

214
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,668
Yes, sir.

215
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:52,468
First, start from Mr. Enomoto's car on the far left.

216
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:53,568
Hey...

217
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,868
Don't tell me that you're going to search the inside of the car

218
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,668
for the master key?

219
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:58,868
Even if you're the police,

220
00:10:58,868 --> 00:10:59,968
you couldn't possibly do something outrageous like that!

221
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:03,168
Don't worry. We won't check inside your car.

222
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:04,968
Hey, Conan?

223
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,368
What on earth are you going to check?

224
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,368
If I were the culprit,

225
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,968
I would've thrown the blood stained key away long time ago!

226
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,868
Silly. It's not the key that's being checked.

227
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:19,968
We're checking the keyhole of the door of the driver's seat side

228
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:24,668
that the culprit stuck the key in when he fled.

229
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:27,968
I see! Blood should be there too, right?

230
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:30,268
But even if blood were found there,

231
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:31,568
it would be a very small amount.

232
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,468
Will you really be able to make it out?

233
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,668
Of course.

234
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,268
Luminol reaction is very sensitive

235
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:39,468
and can detect the slightest amount of blood.

236
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:42,568
Yeah. The culprit went out all out as to think up a cheap trick

237
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,968
and lie in order to hide the fact.

238
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,768
A lie? Cheap trick?

239
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:48,668
Try and remember

240
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,368
what the three said about

241
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:52,568
what they were doing at the time of the crime.

242
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:53,968
Let's see.

243
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:59,768
Mr. Enomoto was headed for the mountains to take a drive.

244
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:02,668
Mr. Fukuchi drove around the shopping arcade

245
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,668
to check if his car was repaired.

246
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:09,268
And Mr. Degawa was going around looking for the house of the person

247
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:11,468
who said she lost the house keys.

248
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,868
Why does that make them liars?

249
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,668
Then, take a look!

250
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,868
The car of Mr. Degawa who says his car is his heart and soul

251
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,268
is sparkling clean.

252
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,768
Mr. Fukuchi who says he's a lousy driver

253
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,968
has his car parked really near the next car.

254
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,368
And the speed racer Mr. Enomoto's car

255
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,768
is full of scratches and soiled.

256
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,168
You understand, now, don't you?

257
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,768
Not at all!

258
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,968
Genta, how did you practice riding the bicycle?

259
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,768
I practiced together with mom

260
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:41,368
at a back road where not too many people were.

261
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:43,668
Because it'd be dangerous bumping into people.

262
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:45,168
Oh! I see!

263
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:47,068
Mr. Fukuchi is lying!

264
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,868
If he's not good at driving

265
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,768
he wouldn't even try driving through a shopping arcade

266
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,568
where there are a lot of people!

267
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,268
Besides at the time of the crime,

268
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:56,768
it was raining and his vision would be poorer than usual.

269
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:59,468
It's the worse course to try out a car

270
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:01,368
that you're not even sure is working right.

271
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:03,768
Moreover, Mr. Fukuchi parked his car completely parallel

272
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,668
to the car next to his.

273
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:08,368
That's only proof that he's an extremely good driver!

274
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:12,068
If he's not good, he's car would be a bit crooked.

275
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:16,368
Then, the culprit is Mr. Fukuchi and he's the liar?

276
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:18,568
Yes, he parked his car very close to the next car

277
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,468
to make checking the keyhole of the door difficult.

278
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,668
But, it's all over now.

279
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:26,668
Look, the car next to his was moved,

280
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:29,868
so the keyhole on the driver's seat side is in clear view.

281
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,768
I'm sure there'll be a response

282
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,268
if luminol is sprayed onto the keyhole.

283
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,768
A bluish-purple color should be emitted

284
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:37,968
when it chemically reacts to blood.

285
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,268
No reaction.

286
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:45,968
No way.

287
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:03,532
Really?

288
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:04,732
Hey.

289
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,932
Just what does this mean, Officer Takagi?

290
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:10,332
You said so confidently that this would specify the culprit.

291
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:14,432
Well, it was supposed to work out that way.

292
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:37,732
Excuse me, could you lend me a minus screwdriver?

293
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:40,432
A minus screwdriver?

294
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,232
Here you go.

295
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:44,232
Thank you.

296
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:47,132
So, are you satisfied now?

297
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,632
Since all three cars showed no reaction,

298
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,632
can we go now?

299
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:54,632
Now you know that we're not the serial killer, right?

300
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,732
Please calm down.

301
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,332
What's going on, Conan?

302
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,532
It's not like you said at all.

303
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:07,032
Where's Conan?

304
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,132
He went that way just now,

305
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,032
after taking a minus screwdriver from the forensic officer.

306
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:13,132
What?

307
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,232
This keyhole moves like a slime

308
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:23,832
when pushed from outside?

309
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:24,932
What?

310
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:28,032
I wonder what it is?

311
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:30,632
Oh, hey!

312
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:40,432
Hey, sonny!

313
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:51,732
The key cylinder is fixed in place with vinyl tape!

314
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,332
I see.

315
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:55,632
He changed it on the spur of the moment

316
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:57,732
with the cylinder of another car,

317
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,232
thinking that the police would check it out.

318
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:01,232
Which means that the real reason

319
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:02,832
why he parked his car really close to the next car is...

320
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,832
To hide this.

321
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,932
Unless you open the door this way and remove the cover,

322
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:12,032
you can't check how the key cylinder is on the inside.

323
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,732
Then, don't tell me that...

324
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:18,632
Conan had foreseen all this to begin with.

325
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:25,232
No. This key cylinder is really the one for this car!

326
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:28,232
I goofed when trying to set it up and broke it.

327
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,932
It's just a temporary measure until a replacement arrives.

328
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:35,532
Will you show us the key to this car, then?

329
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,732
As well as the car number that is carved into it!

330
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,732
You should know since you're an auto mechanic.

331
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,832
That there are numbers on the key cylinder

332
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,832
of the driver's seat side of the car.

333
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,032
If we compare the two,

334
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,632
we can tell whether it's the same key.

335
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:54,432
Or would you like us to spray luminol onto the key cylinder

336
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,832
of the ignition beside the steering wheel?

337
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:59,732
I'm sure blood reaction will be displayed,

338
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,732
because the key cylinder of the ignition is sealed

339
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:05,532
and cannot be changed in a short period of time.

340
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:09,932
Okay!

341
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,532
I'll show you the key number!

342
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:22,232
I'm sure the key is in the dashboard compartment.

343
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:28,632
Oh, hey!

344
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,532
Open the door, will you?

345
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:54,632
This guy confessed later that he did what he did

346
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:57,932
because he wanted public attention.

347
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:01,832
It seems he was just seeking stimulation in his mundane life.

348
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,632
However, since in this serial killer case,

349
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:07,432
there are no casualties...

350
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:08,432
No...

351
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,232
That doesn't redeem him at all.

352
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:14,632
It turned out that this stupid attention seeker

353
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:17,832
just jostled the area around the Beika Police Station a bit

354
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,932
and the case was closed.

355
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:27,032
I'm sure glad that the culprit was caught though!

356
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:30,732
We don't have to worry about Ayumi being pursued by the culprit anymore!

357
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:33,532
I don't mind being pursued!

358
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:36,432
Why?

359
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,732
Because I know Conan will protect me.

360
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:40,132
Hey...

361
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:48,332
Of course, I was counting on Mitsuhiko, Genta and Ai too!

362
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,132
I know I'd be totally fine!

363
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:01,232
Sorry.

364
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:04,332
I have something I have to do.

365
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,332
Bye-bye.

366
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,332
Bye-bye!

367
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:15,832
See you!

368
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,232
My, how nice of you.

369
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,432
To come visit me.

370
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,732
If I let time pass by,

371
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:02,832
I felt like I was going to change my mind, that's why.

372
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:04,732
So, you've made up your mind.

373
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:09,032
As to whether to accept the witness protection program or not.

374
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:10,732
Yes.

375
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:11,832
Of course.

376
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:19,432
Of course...

377
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:20,732
I'm declining.

378
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,332
It's probably true

379
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:27,832
that I'd be safe if I change my name and address

380
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:29,832
and become an entirely different person.

381
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:33,032
But I'd have to go over the same thing again anyway.

382
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,432
I'll be living a vicious circle of fear and hiding,

383
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:36,432
then becoming another person

384
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:40,132
when the danger of my identity being revealed comes around!

385
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,932
Besides, there is no guarantee that

386
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:46,232
I can completely trust you FBI agents.

387
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:48,632
And besides...

388
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:53,432
Although I know how you feel about wanting to punish the bad guy,

389
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:56,832
but keeping out of the picture also requires a lot of courage too.

390
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,632
But...

391
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,432
But I...

392
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:01,932
don't want to run!

393
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:05,532
I can't win just by running around!

394
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,932
I can never win!

395
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,932
I don't want to run.

396
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:19,632
So, you've decided against it after all.

397
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:21,532
You're not going to try to convince me otherwise?

398
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:22,932
Well...

399
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:28,732
Of course, I'm against your idea as an FBI agent but...

400
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:30,032
since I experienced

401
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:33,632
somebody coming after my life when I was still a child.

402
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:38,432
I'd like you to cherish how you feel right now!

403
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:41,932
Hang in there.

404
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,032
See you.

405
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:03,132
Geez.

406
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,532
It's like I'm watching you as a child.

407
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:09,832
You, who kept denying to accept the witness protection program.

408
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:13,332
And in the end, shouted defiantly to let you join the FBI

409
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,932
in exchange for accepting the program.

410
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,832
Wrong, James.

411
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:23,332
She seems to already have what I lacked back then.

412
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,232
Yes.

413
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,232
Something that is very dangerous

414
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:32,632
and capable of breeding disaster.

415
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:35,732
But yet a very warm thing that gives you courage.

416
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,332
"Next Episode" -There's something

417
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,732
that feels familiar about this place!

418
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:59,732
Nostalgia, as they say.

419
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,432
Beware of fire!

420
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:07,832
Where's Ayumi?

421
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,832
Wait, don't leave me behind!

422
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:16,732
It can't be...

423
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:18,532
Next Conan,

424
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:22,832
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 1)"

425
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:26,501
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:27,801
"Seal"

427
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,701
The next episode is the off-season mystery.

428
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,601
I'm scared! Mother!
