1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.240
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.940
Kogoro's always messing things up

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.740
but this time he's in a mess, big time!

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.999
"Kogoro Mouri The Suspect (Part 1)"

9
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.799
Peaches and melons and kumquats.

10
00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.699
I just love summer fruits.

11
00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.199
And they're so ripe.

12
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:29.899
Ran?

13
00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.699
Why you...

14
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.799
You suggested we spend a night at a hotel since we were coming to Karuizawa

15
00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.999
to get away from the heat in the city.

16
00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.899
How come you're the only one who brought swimming trunks!

17
00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.099
The whole idea was so he could look at girls in the pool, I bet.

18
00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.399
Hey come back, I'm not through listening...

19
00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:52.899
Too bad!

20
00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.999
I'm not lending this to any dirty old man.

21
00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.999
Besides, mom bought this for me.

22
00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.999
Hey, wait. Wait up.

23
00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.399
"Pool Entrance" -You can't blame me.

24
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.399
I've been so busy working lately,

25
00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.899
the stress has been building up.

26
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.899
But I've been letting you sleep, haven't I?

27
00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.199
Don't you think you're being unfair to mom?

28
00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.799
You can't tell what she's doing about now either.

29
00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.599
She could be going after some young guy...

30
00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.499
Mom!

31
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.499
I don't believe it. What are you doing here?

32
00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.099
I just told you.

33
00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.499
I came to Karuizawa with a lawyer colleague

34
00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.699
to do some sightseeing, that's all.

35
00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.799
Then what about that neck tie you were buying just now?

36
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.099
That... a friend asked me to buy one

37
00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.899
and I asked him to help me choose one,

38
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.399
isn't that right?

39
00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.899
"Norifumi Saku (35)" -Really? I didn't know that.

40
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:13.999
"Lawyer" -I thought you were buying it for me.

41
00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.699
This is no joking matter, Saku.

42
00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.599
You're not a little kid,

43
00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.099
can't you choose one on your own?

44
00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.999
Well, excuse me.

45
00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:25.899
Very interesting.

46
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.099
Ritsuko.

47
00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:31.999
"Ritsuko Usui (32)" -The great Queen herself

48
00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:35.699
"Lawyer" -is reduced to a mere commoner when it comes to her husband.

49
00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.399
Did she say Queen?

50
00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:39.999
Didn't you know?

51
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.099
She reigns so mightily in court, no one dares approach.

52
00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.599
She's such an eloquent speaker,

53
00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.399
even judges are left in awe

54
00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:50.599
that's why she's been nicknamed Queen of the legal circle.

55
00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.399
Will you stop saying that?

56
00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.199
You're the only ones who call me that.

57
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.899
"Kenzo Shiozawa (41), Lawyer" -No, I heard some prosecutors say

58
00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.599
that when they're in court up against Ms. Kisaki,

59
00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.099
they feel like traitors defying their Queen.

60
00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:11.499
I think I understand how that feels.

61
00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.999
But now the number one female lawyer is you,

62
00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.899
after you got a ruling in the second trial reversed

63
00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:19.999
and took that famous case all the way to the High Court.

64
00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.399
Anyone could have won that case.

65
00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.099
Let me apologize then...

66
00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.499
"Yuji Mikasa (37)" -I was the lawyer in first trial

67
00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:29.399
"Lawyer" -and I guess I wasn't good enough

68
00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.699
that's why I lost the case that anyone could have won.

69
00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.399
No. That's not what I meant.

70
00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.099
What I really meant was that winning a case like that

71
00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.799
doesn't put me even close to Queen Eri's class.

72
00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.199
Enough already.

73
00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.999
You two may be separated but I still envy you,

74
00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.199
a female lawyer who never loses

75
00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.199
and a private detective who always solves his cases, what a couple.

76
00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.299
Oh no...

77
00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:54.699
I'm just an worthless man who is ever so proud

78
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.799
to be married to a grand lady.

79
00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:58.999
You're right.

80
00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.799
Then that must mean I'm a stupid woman

81
00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:06.199
who's picked a woman chasing private detective, a low-life

82
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.199
who looks for the dirt in other people's lives as the man

83
00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.799
to share her life with.

84
00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.899
Good grief, how can you say that every time.

85
00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:18.099
Mr. Mouri solves a case,

86
00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.799
you cut out the article in the newspaper and put it in your scrapbook.

87
00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:23.299
No, I don't.

88
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.299
Dad does that too.

89
00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:28.099
Late at night, he sneaks

90
00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.099
and reads all articles on the cases mom is working on.

91
00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.899
Right, dad?

92
00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.599
Don't tell her, you idiot.

93
00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.499
Come on now, here we are, all in Karuizawa.

94
00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:39.799
Let's just call a truce for tonight and have a good time.

95
00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.999
Well, if Eri doesn't object, I'll oblige.

96
00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:50.299
I don't mind... not one bit.

97
00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.899
What is this? What's going on?

98
00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.499
Could it be? They're still in love?

99
00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.099
No way.

100
00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.199
I'd like to hear Ritsuko's sweet voice pleading my case in court too.

101
00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.999
Mr. Mouri.

102
00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.699
I'm kidding.

103
00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.299
Dad!

104
00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:22.299
Ritsuko, your little hands are so cute.

105
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:24.599
You're my type.

106
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.199
From this to that.

107
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.099
Mom, wait!

108
00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:34.799
What a drunkard.

109
00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.899
Wait a minute.

110
00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.699
Mom, you know that dad always gets like that when he's drunk.

111
00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.199
Besides, you were with a man today yourself.

112
00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.299
You looked so happy, choosing that tie.

113
00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:52.199
You're right.

114
00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.499
I shouldn't have bought this thing.

115
00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:58.099
I let my guard down for one moment

116
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:00.699
and now I'm so mad, I think I might explode.

117
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.899
I don't believe it, you mean that tie's...

118
00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.699
Yes, that's right.

119
00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:08.799
Tomorrow's our wedding anniversary.

120
00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:10.499
I felt sorry for you

121
00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:12.799
and I thought maybe it was time for me to forgive him

122
00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:15.399
so I figured I'd give him a present

123
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.599
but I'm glad I didn't.

124
00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.499
Then I'll take that!

125
00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:22.499
Hey, wait...

126
00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:26.499
I'll give it to him for you!

127
00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:28.599
No, come right back here!

128
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.199
I think I'll give it to him myself.

129
00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:42.699
Good grief.

130
00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:47.699
Did everybody leave?

131
00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:49.099
Dad too?

132
00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:53.099
He said he was going back to the room to sleep because he felt drunk...

133
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.599
Mom.

134
00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:57.699
I think dad's in his room. Good luck.

135
00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:59.599
All right.

136
00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:11.799
Yes.

137
00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.699
Ms. Kisaki.

138
00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:15.499
I know it's late and I apologize

139
00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:17.599
but is my husband here?

140
00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:20.499
No, he's not, why?

141
00:09:20.499 --> 00:09:22.199
I see.

142
00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:24.099
Is something wrong?

143
00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:25.999
I can't find dad,

144
00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:30.399
he's not in our room or in the other 3 people's rooms.

145
00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:34.499
Maybe he's wandering around outside,

146
00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:37.599
he likes to feel the night air.

147
00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:39.999
I'm sorry we disturbed you,

148
00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.699
we'll go look outside.

149
00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:44.099
Excuse us.

150
00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.899
Let's go find him.

151
00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:48.199
Yes, let's go.

152
00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:56.999
Forgive me, Ms. Kisaki,

153
00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:59.099
but I've finally discovered

154
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.099
that I'll never be like you, no matter how hard I try.

155
00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:06.199
The only way I can ever rise above you...

156
00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:10.999
is you've got to fall a few notches.

157
00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:22.299
If you thought there was something

158
00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:24.599
between your beloved husband here and me,

159
00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:26.399
your ability to think clearly would be affected

160
00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.099
and your work would suffer,

161
00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:30.999
then you'd be forced to relinquish your title as number one to me.

162
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.899
Ritsuko Usui.

163
00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:38.299
Good grief, are they back again?

164
00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:41.099
How persistent.

165
00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.799
What can I do for you?

166
00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:55.399
Mr. Mouri's still not back?

167
00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.199
Are you sure about that?

168
00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.599
Yes.

169
00:10:58.599 --> 00:10:59.799
We've looked everywhere, the hotel grounds,

170
00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:03.099
the roof, the stairways, everywhere.

171
00:11:04.099 --> 00:11:06.999
It's already 2 am.

172
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.899
That's strange.

173
00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:10.399
He left with Miss Usui

174
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:13.699
because he said they were staying on the same floor.

175
00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:15.399
I see.

176
00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:17.499
So that leaves...

177
00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.399
Ritsuko's room is the only one we haven't checked.

178
00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:27.099
This wasn't here when we came here earlier.

179
00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:28.299
Earlier?

180
00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:29.999
We came here earlier to ask

181
00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:31.699
but she said he wasn't with her.

182
00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:33.299
Of course he wouldn't be.

183
00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:36.899
I doubt those two would.

184
00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:39.199
Mom, what are you doing?

185
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.599
Be quiet.

186
00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:49.499
I don't believe it.

187
00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:52.899
There's no mistake. That's his cellular phone.

188
00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:54.499
It can't be.

189
00:11:54.499 --> 00:11:56.599
Mikasa, I hate to ask but could you go to the front desk

190
00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:58.199
and borrow their master key?

191
00:11:58.199 --> 00:11:59.199
You bet.

192
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:07.899
-Please. -Thank you.

193
00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.099
Look, the door chain's on.

194
00:12:16.099 --> 00:12:17.599
What's the matter?

195
00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:21.599
Hey, that's...

196
00:12:21.599 --> 00:12:22.999
Isn't that Ritsuko?

197
00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:27.699
Bell boy. Get the chain cutter, quick.

198
00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:32.099
Stand back.

199
00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:34.699
There's no time to waste.

200
00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:38.099
Ritsuko.

201
00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:40.199
Ritsuko.

202
00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:45.399
Come on. What's wrong? Wake up.

203
00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.399
Stop.

204
00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:51.599
I don't feel a pulse.

205
00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:53.099
That's impossible.

206
00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:54.799
What happened?

207
00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:58.999
Boy, what's all the racket about?

208
00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:02.199
What's going on here?

209
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:05.599
-Dad? -Kogoro.

210
00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:26.288
Why are you here?

211
00:13:27.888 --> 00:13:30.388
The chain was on the door.

212
00:13:30.388 --> 00:13:32.888
Ritsuko's body was on the floor

213
00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:37.388
and only one other person was in this locked room.

214
00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:43.188
-Hey, now... What's going on here? -Don't step on that.

215
00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:46.088
That telephone cord on the floor is probably the weapon.

216
00:13:46.088 --> 00:13:48.988
-Murder weapon? -Look, over there.

217
00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:52.688
See the thin marking around her neck?

218
00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:53.788
I see.

219
00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:57.788
You're saying she was strangled with the telephone cord.

220
00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:00.988
Hey. Why's Miss Usui lying on the...

221
00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:04.788
Did you say strangled?

222
00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:07.588
By who?

223
00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:09.288
You're the one who could've done it.

224
00:14:09.288 --> 00:14:11.188
Why'd you kill her?

225
00:14:12.588 --> 00:14:13.788
Now just hold on.

226
00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:15.788
I'm sure this is some kind of mistake.

227
00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.288
My father would never kill anyone,

228
00:14:18.288 --> 00:14:20.688
would he, mom?

229
00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:24.488
Penal code 499...

230
00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.788
A person charged with murder will be sentenced

231
00:14:26.788 --> 00:14:31.288
to life or a minimum sentence of three years or...

232
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:32.588
the death penalty.

233
00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:33.688
What?

234
00:14:33.688 --> 00:14:35.488
Mom?

235
00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:37.088
Ran. Why are you standing around?

236
00:14:37.088 --> 00:14:39.288
Call the police at once.

237
00:14:39.288 --> 00:14:41.288
She's got to be kidding.

238
00:14:46.388 --> 00:14:48.688
Let me get this straight.

239
00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:51.388
Your husband was missing,

240
00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:53.188
you thought he might be in this room

241
00:14:53.188 --> 00:14:55.988
so you called him on his cellular

242
00:14:55.988 --> 00:14:57.088
and as you suspected,

243
00:14:57.088 --> 00:15:01.188
you heard his cellular ringing in this room.

244
00:15:01.188 --> 00:15:04.288
When you used the master key to unlock the door,

245
00:15:04.288 --> 00:15:06.788
you found the chain was on

246
00:15:06.788 --> 00:15:08.388
and you could see the victim lying on the floor

247
00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:11.288
in the space between the door.

248
00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:13.988
"Misao Yamamura" -When you broke down the door and entered the room,

249
00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:16.988
"Gunma Prefecture Police Officer" -you found the victim was already dead,

250
00:15:16.988 --> 00:15:20.588
and your husband was asleep on this bed, right?

251
00:15:20.588 --> 00:15:22.288
Yes.

252
00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.788
Then I'm sorry to tell you this

253
00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:26.388
but your husband is the murderer.

254
00:15:26.388 --> 00:15:28.788
That's not fair!

255
00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:32.288
Just wait a minute. Dad, don't just stand there, say something.

256
00:15:32.288 --> 00:15:34.188
Hey? I know you.

257
00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:37.088
Aren't you Kogoro Mouri?

258
00:15:37.088 --> 00:15:39.488
-Yes. -I'm in luck.

259
00:15:40.688 --> 00:15:44.088
With a famous private detective like you on the scene,

260
00:15:44.088 --> 00:15:45.288
this case's good as solved.

261
00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:48.488
Why don't you tell me your thoughts regarding this murder?

262
00:15:48.488 --> 00:15:50.188
Yes, dear.

263
00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:54.588
Why don't you tell him all about what happened here

264
00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:58.588
while you were snoring up a storm, Mr. Famous Private Detective?

265
00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:02.988
He's your husband? You're married to Kogoro Mouri?

266
00:16:02.988 --> 00:16:05.288
But, then, that means...

267
00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:07.988
Then you're the murderer?

268
00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:10.288
I don't believe it, what's going to happen

269
00:16:10.288 --> 00:16:13.288
with "The Sleeping Kogoro's Mystery Solving Show"?

270
00:16:13.288 --> 00:16:14.688
What do I care!

271
00:16:15.988 --> 00:16:17.188
Officer Yamamura.

272
00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:22.088
Shall we take Mr. Mouri down to the station for questioning?

273
00:16:22.088 --> 00:16:24.388
I suppose if Mr. Mouri doesn't mind.

274
00:16:24.388 --> 00:16:26.188
Dad.

275
00:16:30.188 --> 00:16:33.288
I really wanted to see him solve the case in his sleep.

276
00:16:33.288 --> 00:16:35.988
I guess you'll be his pre-indictment lawyer then?

277
00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:39.288
Pre-indictment lawyer?

278
00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:41.588
It's a system where a lawyer can be present with the suspect

279
00:16:41.588 --> 00:16:43.788
so he gets treated fairly by the police.

280
00:16:43.788 --> 00:16:46.188
Sorry, but I pass.

281
00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:51.488
I'm not taking a case when I know the suspect's guilty.

282
00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:55.188
I'm not going to spoil my perfect record.

283
00:16:56.988 --> 00:16:59.988
I wasn't going to ask you anyway.

284
00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:03.688
And don't you show up at the police station either, or you'll be sorry.

285
00:17:05.788 --> 00:17:07.288
Dad!

286
00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:09.088
Mom!

287
00:17:09.088 --> 00:17:12.188
All right then, I'll take care of it,

288
00:17:12.188 --> 00:17:15.188
besides, I don't think Mr. Mouri did it.

289
00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:18.788
Let's go then.

290
00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.688
Thank you very much.

291
00:17:22.888 --> 00:17:24.388
How could you...

292
00:17:25.388 --> 00:17:28.388
Mikasa, will you and Shiozawa leave the room?

293
00:17:28.388 --> 00:17:31.788
I have something to say to the police officer.

294
00:17:31.788 --> 00:17:34.188
Sure, no problem.

295
00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:35.688
What are you going to say?

296
00:17:40.688 --> 00:17:42.688
-Excuse me. -Yes?

297
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:45.188
Would you mind lending me your gloves?

298
00:17:46.188 --> 00:17:47.888
Did you say gloves?

299
00:17:49.888 --> 00:17:52.088
Mom, what are you going to do?

300
00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:55.188
There are three things that don't add up.

301
00:17:55.188 --> 00:17:58.388
The first is the telephone cord used to strangle the victim.

302
00:17:58.388 --> 00:18:00.888
If he killed while he was drunk and without pre-meditation,

303
00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:03.388
he would have ripped the cord out of the jack

304
00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:05.688
but the telephone is still neatly in place

305
00:18:05.688 --> 00:18:09.488
and there's no indication the cord was forcibly removed from either end.

306
00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:12.988
The second thing is his cellular phone.

307
00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:18.188
I have a feeling it was deliberately left near the door

308
00:18:18.188 --> 00:18:20.588
so we could hear it ringing from outside.

309
00:18:20.588 --> 00:18:23.588
And the third thing is, his hands.

310
00:18:23.588 --> 00:18:25.588
Only about 40 minutes had passed

311
00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:29.488
since the time we last spoke to her then found her body.

312
00:18:29.488 --> 00:18:31.488
If he had strangled her with the cord,

313
00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:34.788
there should still have been marks on his hands

314
00:18:34.788 --> 00:18:38.288
unless of course, he wore leather gloves or something of that sort.

315
00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:40.988
But we found nothing like that here.

316
00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:44.088
Yes, I see what you mean, it is strange.

317
00:18:44.088 --> 00:18:47.488
Mom, are you saying the reason you didn't go with dad to the station

318
00:18:47.488 --> 00:18:49.188
was you wanted to check things out here.

319
00:18:49.188 --> 00:18:50.588
Of course, silly.

320
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:54.088
I've known him much longer than you.

321
00:18:54.088 --> 00:18:58.088
Sure, I was angry at first but I know better than anyone

322
00:18:58.088 --> 00:19:00.788
that he isn't capable of murder.

323
00:19:00.788 --> 00:19:04.588
Then when dad said he didn't want you to show up at the station,

324
00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:06.888
what he really meant was he wanted you to find the evidence

325
00:19:06.888 --> 00:19:08.488
that would clear him.

326
00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:10.388
I wouldn't know.

327
00:19:10.388 --> 00:19:14.588
Maybe he said that because he really didn't want to see me.

328
00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:15.988
What's this?

329
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:18.288
There's a memo pad on the desk

330
00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:20.388
and a page has been ripped out.

331
00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:24.088
Maybe it's this? Is this the page?

332
00:19:26.188 --> 00:19:30.388
It's kind of wrinkled but it has some writing on it, see?

333
00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:34.488
Yes, it is her writing.

334
00:19:34.488 --> 00:19:37.688
Hayashi? And is that the number two?

335
00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:42.588
It could pertain to Hayashi a lawyer

336
00:19:42.588 --> 00:19:45.288
who she'll be teaming up with on her next case.

337
00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:49.188
He's been wanting to contact her to discuss that certain case.

338
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.988
What case is that?

339
00:19:50.988 --> 00:19:52.188
It's the case everyone's talking about,

340
00:19:52.188 --> 00:19:55.888
regarding a company polluting the water.

341
00:19:55.888 --> 00:19:58.688
They approached us at first

342
00:19:58.688 --> 00:20:01.588
but neither Shiozawa nor I wanted to handle it

343
00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:03.888
and Saku's a criminal lawyer,

344
00:20:03.888 --> 00:20:07.888
so Ritsuko and Mikasa ended up with it.

345
00:20:07.888 --> 00:20:12.088
They lost the first trial but were able to win the second.

346
00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:15.088
She asked me to introduce another lawyer to replace Mikasa

347
00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:18.088
because she wanted to win the case

348
00:20:18.088 --> 00:20:19.688
and I thought of Mr. Hayashi.

349
00:20:19.688 --> 00:20:23.088
But I hadn't told her about him yet.

350
00:20:24.088 --> 00:20:25.788
It's strange though.

351
00:20:25.788 --> 00:20:29.788
I don't think I told him the name of this hotel.

352
00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:32.788
He said Mr. Shiozawa told him.

353
00:20:33.888 --> 00:20:34.888
I'm sorry,

354
00:20:34.888 --> 00:20:38.888
I'm the one who connected the call from Mr. Hayashi to this room.

355
00:20:38.888 --> 00:20:41.388
Who told you could come in here?

356
00:20:41.388 --> 00:20:43.788
I... something was bothering me

357
00:20:43.788 --> 00:20:46.588
so I thought I'd better tell you about it.

358
00:20:46.588 --> 00:20:48.188
So what's bothering you?

359
00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:52.288
Actually, Mr. Hayashi called twice.

360
00:20:52.288 --> 00:20:55.488
The first time he called, he got through,

361
00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:57.288
but the second call came back to the desk,

362
00:20:57.288 --> 00:21:00.688
I thought it was strange so I came up to the room to check.

363
00:21:01.688 --> 00:21:03.588
I checked twice.

364
00:21:03.588 --> 00:21:06.188
-You checked twice? -Yes.

365
00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:09.088
The first time, I rang the doorbell and there was no answer

366
00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:12.588
so I told Mr. Hayashi she might be resting,

367
00:21:12.588 --> 00:21:15.988
but Mr. Hayashi said she might just be taking a bath

368
00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:19.188
so he asked me to check again

369
00:21:19.188 --> 00:21:25.688
and there was a do not disturb sign on the door and a note.

370
00:21:25.688 --> 00:21:26.688
A note?

371
00:21:26.688 --> 00:21:29.088
Yes, it said.

372
00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:33.588
"I'm very sorry, please tell him I'll repay the money."

373
00:21:33.588 --> 00:21:36.388
The writing was very distorted.

374
00:21:37.788 --> 00:21:40.888
And did you give Mr. Hayashi the message?

375
00:21:40.888 --> 00:21:42.688
Did you?

376
00:21:42.688 --> 00:21:46.188
Yes, but he sounded very confused,

377
00:21:46.188 --> 00:21:48.688
he said he was calling just to change the time of their meeting

378
00:21:48.688 --> 00:21:50.288
the next day from 2 to 4.

379
00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:53.588
I don't understand.

380
00:21:53.588 --> 00:21:55.488
The note we found in the waste basket

381
00:21:55.488 --> 00:21:59.688
was probably the memo regarding her meeting at 2 am with him.

382
00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:00.888
That's right.

383
00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:05.388
But the note on the door was about something totally different.

384
00:22:05.388 --> 00:22:10.788
If she was killed before the second call,

385
00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:17.388
then that means the killer put the sign and the note on the door.

386
00:22:17.388 --> 00:22:21.688
But why would the killer do something so stupid?

387
00:22:21.688 --> 00:22:25.288
It would only be leading us to conclude Kogoro didn't commit the crime.

388
00:23:59.488 --> 00:24:02.188
"Next Episode" -Madam, I regret saying this, but...

389
00:24:02.188 --> 00:24:05.888
I'm almost positive your husband is the murderer!

390
00:24:08.488 --> 00:24:10.788
I'm pretty sure. Yes, I'm sure.

391
00:24:12.788 --> 00:24:16.588
I see, so that's why that person left that note.

392
00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:19.088
You had absolutely no reason to enter this room,

393
00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:22.488
unless you were the murderer.

394
00:24:23.388 --> 00:24:24.888
Next Conan,

395
00:24:24.888 --> 00:24:28.488
"Kogoro Mouri The Suspect (Part 2)"

396
00:24:29.065 --> 00:24:31.465
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:31.465 --> 00:24:33.665
"Hayashi Rice"

398
00:24:33.665 --> 00:24:35.165
Next episode, Pops will be even more cornered.

399
00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:36.265
Mom, help him.

400
00:24:36.265 --> 00:24:38.165
He can do whatever he wants.
