1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,440
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,840
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,540
Champion dog Doyle disappears.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,840
The real faces of the breeders are revealed.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,353
We visited the residence of Teruya Kanou, a friend of Dr. Agasa

9
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,353
who invited us over because he wanted to give away things

10
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:07,553
to his friends before moving to England.

11
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:12,253
At his house, we meet his friends Mr. Yoshio Tsunashima,

12
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:14,453
Ms. Aki Tosabayashi,

13
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:16,253
and Ms. Shino Hasuki.

14
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:21,353
Amidst the exchange of various complicated feelings,

15
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:23,453
one of the dog

16
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:26,353
named Doyle disappears out of the blue.

17
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:29,553
Moreover,

18
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:32,053
the burnt black piece of Doyle's collar

19
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:36,453
that has been cut with a knife is found in the incinerator.

20
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,553
Don't tell me that's...

21
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:41,353
Doyle's...

22
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:44,253
It can't be...

23
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:50,353
Huh?

24
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,553
That's strange.

25
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:55,153
Just a while ago, there were only two blue cushions.

26
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:59,453
Counting the one that Arthur brought out makes three blue cushions.

27
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:04,053
One extra cushion.

28
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,053
What does this all mean?

29
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:14,253
"The Nonvanishing Evidence (Part 2)"

30
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,853
At the chime when the clock struck 12:00,

31
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,053
Doyle headed for the Japanese room where he could get his snack,

32
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,553
and disappeared from our view.

33
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:27,653
After that,

34
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,753
we all followed Mr. Kanou who went into the kitchen

35
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,053
to get the cheese snack.

36
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,853
Then we went to the Japanese room and found that Doyle was not there.

37
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:40,253
So, we split up and looked all over the house for Doyle.

38
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,653
This is approximately how the layout of the house is.

39
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:46,053
We don't really know who searched where yet.

40
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:50,353
But where on earth did the person hide Doyle?

41
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:54,853
And how is that person planning to carry Doyle out of here?

42
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:59,053
I wonder if you're going to get around to prepare for your move.

43
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,553
Yes, but that's okay.

44
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,253
Move?

45
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:05,653
You said that you're giving us the things you don't need

46
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:08,153
because you're going to be moving away

47
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:09,853
but can we take the things we want home with us today?

48
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:13,053
Yes, sure.

49
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,353
Are all the others going to take their things home today, too?

50
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,353
No.

51
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,053
I'm going to send Mr. Tsunashima's clock

52
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,553
to his residence tomorrow.

53
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,653
Ms. Hasuki's stereo will be sent to her house 10 days later,

54
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,253
which will be the day before I move.

55
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:26,653
I never use any of the stuff,

56
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:29,053
so I told them that I could send the goods right away,

57
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,553
but they both came today

58
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:33,053
because I happened to find more antiques in the closet

59
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,153
and they wanted to take a look.

60
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,053
As for Ms. Tosabayashi who showed up out of the blue today,

61
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,953
judging from her personality and all,

62
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:41,853
I'm sure she's going to take that flower vase home with her today.

63
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:44,153
If I remember it correctly, that flower vase in the living room.

64
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,353
Don't tell me that...

65
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,153
Doyle is in that...

66
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,653
Of course, not.

67
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,453
A living creature couldn't possibly be hidden in a stereo

68
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:03,353
that is supposed to be shipped out 10 days from now either.

69
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:06,253
The wall clock in the Japanese room...

70
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,353
It's impossible to hide a dog in there either.

71
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:14,053
Huh? That clock is five minutes slow.

72
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:16,953
Strange.

73
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:20,253
After it was repaired, it was always accurate.

74
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,553
Wait a second.

75
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,453
When I looked at it while ago...

76
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:28,053
What's this cotton like thing?

77
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:31,053
It looks like some sort of chemical fiber.

78
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,153
Hey, let me see it.

79
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:36,653
This is...

80
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,853
That glittering cotton was on the blue cushion

81
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:42,853
that Arthur was holding, too.

82
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:44,053
Wait a second.

83
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,653
Come to think of it, I've seen this some place, too.

84
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,653
The incinerator!

85
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,753
What's the matter, Conan?

86
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:58,953
Was Doyle burnt in there?

87
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:04,753
When I saw it a while ago, I just thought it was plain trash,

88
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:07,753
but this is definitely glass wool.

89
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:10,253
It's sound absorption material.

90
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:11,753
I see.

91
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:14,453
That's what the person used.

92
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:17,153
Conan.

93
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:19,653
I've figured out where Doyle is hidden

94
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:23,153
as well as how and why.

95
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,953
I've also figured out who did it, too.

96
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,853
It's this late already.

97
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:36,153
I've got to get going home.

98
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:37,653
Me, too.

99
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,353
I have to start getting dinner ready.

100
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,653
Please wait.

101
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:43,853
Well, I guess you were just unlucky.

102
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,053
I suggest you forget about that doggie.

103
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:47,953
No way.

104
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,353
This is the sound of...

105
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,653
The sound of the wall clock in the Japanese room.

106
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:58,753
It's only supposed to ring at 12:00 noon.

107
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,253
What's going on?

108
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,653
Conan?

109
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:09,853
It worked, Conan!

110
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:13,153
We'll go get things ready in the living room, then!

111
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:14,253
Okay!

112
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:15,953
Get things ready?

113
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:18,653
We're going to try an experiment

114
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,353
to see if the person who hid Doyle could really do so

115
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:25,053
without being seen by anyone.

116
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,353
How foolish,

117
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:29,353
when we haven't even found Doyle yet...

118
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:32,453
Of course, the star of the experiment

119
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,853
is Doyle here!

120
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:35,853
Huh?

121
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:39,153
Doyle!

122
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:42,953
You found him!

123
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,553
I'm glad.

124
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,553
Okay, let's start the experiment.

125
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:55,553
Doyle disappeared from our sight

126
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,753
from the corridor in front of the front entrance.

127
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:04,553
The dog has been found, so isn't that enough?

128
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:07,053
I don't have time to be fooling around

129
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,053
with a child's detectives game either.

130
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,553
Now, now.

131
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:14,553
Mitsuhiko, you can start!

132
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:16,153
Roger!

133
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,853
Not again.

134
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:27,953
First, after hearing the chime of the clock,

135
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:31,553
Doyle headed for the Japanese room where he usually gets his snack.

136
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,253
In the meantime, we went to the kitchen

137
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,053
before going to the Japanese room.

138
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,353
Right?

139
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:38,153
Yes.

140
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:41,553
Then, where do you think Doyle is now?

141
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,353
This is ridiculous!

142
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:46,353
If he was given his snack as usual in the Japanese room,

143
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:48,353
where else would he be other than the Japanese room?

144
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,153
Huh?

145
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,353
He's not here.

146
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:56,753
Besides, the sound of the chime did not come from this room.

147
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,553
Oh, really?

148
00:08:58,553 --> 00:09:01,453
What is going on?

149
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,053
Mr. Kanou.

150
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,953
The sound of the clock came from thus living room.

151
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:08,453
The living room?

152
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:11,853
Don't tell me that

153
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:14,153
the sound was from the speaker of the stereo?

154
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,653
Yes. We rung the chime of the clock a while ago

155
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:21,553
recorded it and played it on this stereo.

156
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:25,453
I used the tape recorder that was in your room.

157
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:28,453
Which means that Doyle was lured to the living room

158
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:29,753
by the sound of the clock.

159
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,453
Just the sound won't do.

160
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:33,053
The cushion has to be here, too.

161
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,353
Cushion?

162
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:35,853
Remember, you said that Doyle pulls out

163
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,853
his own cushion during snack time.

164
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:42,953
But the blue cushion that Doyle like

165
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,553
was in the Japanese room just a while ago.

166
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:48,053
Doyle doesn't necessarily like blue cushions.

167
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,253
A dog's ear can hear four times that of humans,

168
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:53,553
its sense of smell is far more superior than that of humans.

169
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,253
But its eyes can hardly tell one color from the other.

170
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,553
That's why Doyle always pulled out the cushion

171
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:03,653
which had his smell on it at snack time,

172
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,753
and that cushion just happened to be blue.

173
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:07,953
In other words,

174
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:11,853
Doyle was not waiting in the Japanese room at 12:00 noon.

175
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,953
He was trained to think that

176
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:15,753
if he waited on the cushion near the sound of the chime of the clock,

177
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:19,453
he could get his snack.

178
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,153
So, the person who schemed this took advantage of Doyle's habit

179
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,753
and lured him out to the living room.

180
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:28,653
The cushion that Doyle always used had bite marks on it,

181
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:32,253
so it was also easy for the person to tell it apart.

182
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:35,353
But I came here to living room right away

183
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:37,253
with Mr. Tsunashima to look for Doyle,

184
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:40,753
but saw neither the cushion nor the dog.

185
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,653
-Isn't that right? -Right.

186
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,953
There's a good place to hide Doyle.

187
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:46,153
Huh?

188
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:52,853
Look here, behind the stereo.

189
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,753
He's behind the speaker.

190
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:05,153
The person peeled off the sound absorption material

191
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,953
that was stuck on to the inside of the speaker beforehand.

192
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:11,053
Then the person put Doyle's cushion in the space that was made,

193
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,753
and put the cheese on the cushion.

194
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:16,553
Of course, the right speaker was rigged,

195
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:19,153
so no sound came out from it.

196
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:21,153
And the left speaker was rigged

197
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:23,553
so that the sound of the clock that was recorded beforehand

198
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:25,453
would come out of it.

199
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:28,653
Then, Doyle would be lured by the smell of the cushion and cheese

200
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,453
as well as the sound of the clock

201
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,953
went into the right speaker where the back board was open.

202
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,353
In other words, he was lured inside.

203
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:39,053
If so, wouldn't he come out after eating the cheese?

204
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:41,453
He was put to sleep with a sleeping pill

205
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,453
that was buried inside the cheese.

206
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,453
I wonder if it would work out that smoothly.

207
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:50,853
Back then, the clock in the Japanese room indicated 12:00 noon,

208
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:54,153
so the real chime should've been ringing, too.

209
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,853
I don't think it rang.

210
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:00,053
Because it was 12:00 midnight.

211
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,553
Huh?

212
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:06,453
That clock is made to ring only at 12:00 noon.

213
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,953
If the hands of the clock are moved up 12 hours,

214
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:10,753
the chime won't ring.

215
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:13,753
But who would do something like that?

216
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:15,653
Who else?

217
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:17,853
It can't be anyone else but Ms. Hasuki

218
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:21,153
who was going to take this stereo with her, right?

219
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,453
It can't be...

220
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,853
She was probably going to put that doggie in the speaker

221
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,653
and steal it.

222
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,253
No, I would never...

223
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,353
Wait.

224
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,353
Ms. Hasuki would never do a thing like that.

225
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:40,653
But her shoes were in the yard by the incinerator, too.

226
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:43,753
-But... -No.

227
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:46,353
Ms. Hasuki is not the one.

228
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:57,361
Ms. Hasuki is not the one.

229
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,461
What is this boy talking about?

230
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:04,661
Because that stereo was going to be sent out on Saturday, right?

231
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:09,061
No one would look a live dog in a place like that.

232
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:11,361
If it's not Ms. Hasuki,

233
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:13,761
why would someone hid the dog in the speaker of the stereo?

234
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:17,261
The person who did it didn't want to steal Doyle,

235
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:20,861
but rather, just wanted Doyle to disappear for a while.

236
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,361
Disappear for a while?

237
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,061
It maybe a blind spot,

238
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,061
but if the back board of the speaker is removed,

239
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,661
it would easily be noticed.

240
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,861
That's one of the places anyone would look when searching.

241
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:36,961
Right. That's why the person came here first

242
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:40,961
to replaced the back board and hid Doyle.

243
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,561
Isn't that right,

244
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,261
Mr. Tsunashima?

245
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:49,261
Since you said that you came here first thing to look for Doyle,

246
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,261
it would've been easy for you to pretend that you were searching

247
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:53,661
behind the speaker and replace the back board, right?

248
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:55,661
Come to think of it, you said that

249
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:59,461
you looked behind the speaker and didn't come to this side, right?

250
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:01,461
Hey.

251
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,461
I'm sure that

252
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:08,061
you heard about Doyle's snacking habit from Mr. Kanou's parents.

253
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:11,161
As well as about the stereo not being used much.

254
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:15,361
And when you came to this house before,

255
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:17,961
you peeled off the sound absorption material behind the speaker

256
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:22,461
and had prepared a place to hide Doyle beforehand.

257
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,161
All you had to say was that the speaker didn't sound good to pretend

258
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:29,761
that you were trying to fix it. Then, nobody would suspect you.

259
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,561
If you were around when Doyle was eating his snack

260
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:34,661
you could record the sound of the chime, too.

261
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:38,361
You put the tape and cushion behind the stereo

262
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,261
when Ms. Hasuki came before 12:00,

263
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:45,061
and we were all gathered at the front entrance.

264
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:48,661
You then pretended to look for Doyle

265
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:51,161
and went around behind the speaker.

266
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:54,961
You removed the collar from Doyle who was asleep.

267
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,861
You also retrieved the cushion and replaced the back board.

268
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:01,561
You then put the cushion back into the Japanese room.

269
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,161
You returned the hands of the clock that were moved up in time,

270
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,561
back to the accurate time.

271
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,661
You then burned the collar in the incinerator

272
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:10,161
and left the back door open.

273
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,961
Because you wanted everyone to think that

274
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,261
someone who snuck into the house took Doyle

275
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,861
and fled from the back door.

276
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,561
I see.

277
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,561
It seems that you wanted to

278
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:23,461
burn the sound absorption material in the incinerator.

279
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:26,861
But that's glass wool that is also used as a heat insulator.

280
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,861
Most of it was left in the incinerator without being burned.

281
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,161
I see.

282
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,761
That's why when we made Arthur look for Doyle,

283
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:36,661
he brought the cushion from the Japanese room.

284
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:40,161
Because it was Doyle's cushion that was replaced.

285
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:44,561
But why wasn't Arthur able to tell

286
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:47,061
that Doyle was inside the speaker?

287
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,661
He knew but he couldn't go inside.

288
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:52,061
Because this room was a place where he was scolded in the past

289
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,661
and had bad memories about.

290
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,661
But, sonny,

291
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:01,061
I gain nothing from hiding Doyle inside the speaker.

292
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,761
What you wanted was not Doyle,

293
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,661
but the thing that was on his collar,

294
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,261
right?

295
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,961
This gem stone.

296
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:13,361
This is quite an expensive item that

297
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,861
Mr. Kanou grandfather had bought in France.

298
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:18,161
And where did you find that?

299
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,861
Behind the pendulum of the wall clock in the Japanese room.

300
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,861
When I looked at that clock at 12:00, the time was accurate.

301
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,061
But when I looked at 15:00, it was off 3 minutes,

302
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,961
and when I looked at 17:00, it was off 5 minutes.

303
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,561
The clock continued to delay one minute an hour.

304
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,961
That's how I found out

305
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,261
there was something attached behind the pendulum

306
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,361
as well as the person who attached it

307
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:44,661
was the one who was to take the clock home, Mr. Tsunashima.

308
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,461
That person is you!

309
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,561
-Darn it! -Mr. Tsunashima!

310
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:13,661
Darn it!

311
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,761
Stop it, Arthur!

312
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,161
You could never hit a dog

313
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,561
because you like dogs, don't you?

314
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:34,161
That's why you didn't kill Doyle, right?

315
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,961
You didn't screw the back board of the speaker back on

316
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:38,661
because you wanted Doyle to be able to leave

317
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:40,861
when he woke up, right?

318
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,261
Isn't that right, Conan?

319
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:48,661
Mr. Tsunashima, why?

320
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:51,661
Money.

321
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,861
I wanted money to take care of my dogs

322
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:56,661
that multiplied beyond expectation.

323
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:59,961
If so, you could've sold your dogs and reduced the dogs that you owned!

324
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:01,661
The dogs that I have at home

325
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:04,561
are mostly mixed breeds that have been abandoned.

326
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,961
Selling them is out of the question.

327
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,061
There is nobody who is willing to take them.

328
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,761
The only path left for them

329
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:14,061
is to starve to death or be killed by drugs.

330
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:17,761
They only have one in two choices.

331
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,361
Mr. Tsunashima.

332
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,261
Mr. Tsunashima.

333
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:25,561
Here.

334
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:28,661
You may have it.

335
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,961
But...

336
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:33,761
I'm not giving it to you.

337
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:36,761
I'm giving it to the dogs that are at your house.

338
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,561
Kanou.

339
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,261
I'm so sorry.

340
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:48,161
It's okay.

341
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,561
I'm sure

342
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,561
my late grandfather would be more than happy to have you take it.

343
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,861
How audacious can you get!

344
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,461
I feel sorry for the dogs that are owned by someone

345
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,961
who cannot handle them!

346
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:39,361
Come on. After all, he did promise that he'll make sure

347
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,161
the number of dogs he owns won't increase.

348
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:43,861
Arthur and Christie were both great, weren't they?

349
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,061
They were like police dogs

350
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:47,761
when they cornered Mr. Tsunashima who tried to flee.

351
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,861
It's instinct.

352
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:53,661
All Arthur did was go after the person who pushed his master,

353
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:56,761
and Christie is a sheep dog to begin with.

354
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,661
Shetland Sheep Dogs are brought up to bring sheep

355
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,461
that have gone astray from the flock

356
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,361
back into the flock.

357
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,161
They have the habit of going around

358
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:10,361
and stopping anything that suddenly runs off.

359
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,361
Talk about a wet blanket.

360
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:15,961
I can't figure out

361
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:18,861
why Ms. Hasuki's shoes were on the ground

362
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,161
near the incinerator.

363
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,061
He's the one responsible.

364
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,861
Hide here a while, will you?

365
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,861
What are you doing, Conan?

366
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,561
See?

367
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:39,161
Hey, Arthur!

368
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,561
Since when did you start doing a thing like that?

369
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:44,561
Hey, Arthur! Are you listening to me?

370
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,661
Arthur!

371
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:51,561
I wonder if he doesn't like me anymore?

372
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,861
No, he just wants you to stay here forever.

373
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:57,061
Isn't that right, Arthur?

374
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:00,361
Remember, you said a while ago that Arthur would bring your shoes

375
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:04,161
when he thought you were going to take him for a walk?

376
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,561
That's why Arthur came to think

377
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:10,661
that humans cannot go outside unless they wear shoes.

378
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:13,261
He tried to hide your shoes

379
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:15,961
so that you wouldn't be able to go home with Christie

380
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,961
who he really likes.

381
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:21,861
Is that right?

382
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:26,861
But don't worry, Arthur.

383
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,361
Christie and I have also ended up

384
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:32,161
having to go to London just like your master.

385
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:35,961
Huh? Which means...

386
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,461
Yes.

387
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:41,961
That is what I came to tell you today.

388
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,961
Which means that you're going to get married after all?

389
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:47,861
This calls for a celebration.

390
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:50,861
Congratulations, both of you!

391
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:52,761
Congratulations!

392
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:56,061
We've got to have a celebratory party before the move, then.

393
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,861
Silly dog.

394
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:04,361
Don't worry, nobody's angry at you anymore.

395
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,461
All right!

396
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,961
We were all worried about you.

397
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:15,661
Because you looked to be so blue recently.

398
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:19,861
That's why we were trying to think up a plan to cheer you up.

399
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,261
So, I'm not counted in?

400
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:26,161
Because you're always arguing with Haibara.

401
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:27,461
That's right.

402
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:29,361
Oh, I see.

403
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:32,461
-You did it, Arthur! -Good work!

404
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:34,461
Good work!

405
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:44,261
Right, you should always keep smiling Iike that.

406
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,461
Huh?

407
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,361
As long as you're wearing that facial expression,

408
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:50,061
you look nothing but a child.

409
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:56,661
That way, you'll look far from an old lady approaching her 90s.

410
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:57,961
It's a joke!

411
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,261
How rude!

412
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,261
I'm only 84.

413
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:07,761
"Next Episode"

414
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:09,561
Why?

415
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:13,261
Why is he lying on the ground in such an unnatural position?

416
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,961
Hey, take a good look.

417
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:19,461
The wine bottles on the very top of the low shelf are toppled.

418
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:20,961
But there's nothing's wrong with the wine bottles

419
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,961
on the shelves on this side.

420
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,561
I've found the conclusive evidence.

421
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:29,561
I'm sure the criminal still has it!

422
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:35,182
Next Conan, "The Locked Wine Cellar"

423
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,179
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,179
"Cracked wine"
