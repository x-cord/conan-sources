1
00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:02,324
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,124
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:06,024
Everyone is excited for the soccer season.

4
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:07,924
Conan shows his keen deduction skills.

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:13,624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,111
Tokyo Spirits against Noir Tokyo.

9
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,711
The score is still locked at 0-0,

10
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:08,411
will they be playing an extended game?

11
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:12,711
Now, Hide got the ball.

12
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,511
Go, Hide, go!

13
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:15,811
One!

14
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:16,811
Two!

15
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,911
Three! Four!

16
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,811
Go for it! Hide, blast a shot for the goal!

17
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,911
Come on, Hide, one to one against the goalkeeper!

18
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,411
Is he going to kick for goal?

19
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,011
But, the Noir won't let him.

20
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:30,411
They're avalanching behind Hide!

21
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,711
The keeper dashes forward!

22
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,411
The defenders are closing in on him too!

23
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:35,411
Will Hide dare shoot?

24
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,711
He passed it over to the side!

25
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,511
Who is the ball headed for...

26
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:40,111
It's Naoki!

27
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:49,111
Goal!

28
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,811
Naoki broke the deadlock with his header!

29
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,611
The end of the game whistle has sounded!

30
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:04,411
The Tokyo Spirits defeated the Noir Tokyo 1-0 with Naoki's goal!

31
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,911
And won the title of the Tokyo Derby!

32
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:37,011
"Hooligan in the Labyrinth (Part 1)"

33
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,611
It was great!

34
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,011
Hide dodged four Tokyo Noir players!

35
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:46,811
Yeah! All the folks around us in the front row seats

36
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,911
are also got really excited!

37
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,211
He quickly dodged from left to right,

38
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:53,411
just like Baggio!

39
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,511
Naoki was cool too.

40
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,311
Because he had already jumped in the air

41
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,711
before Hide's pass came to him!

42
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,111
The two best strikers combination,

43
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:03,211
Hide and Naoki, are now back again!

44
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:07,011
But I never thought that the Spirits would have a tough game like that.

45
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,111
Yeah. I was afraid that the match

46
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:12,411
would go into the extended game with a score of 0-0.

47
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,911
Oh, well, it couldn't be helped.

48
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:14,911
What?

49
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:18,511
Noir Tokyo's leading players are now injured.

50
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,211
And since Higo, the center forward,

51
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,711
moved on to Big Osaka,

52
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,711
the team lacks goal-scoring players.

53
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,211
So, from the beginning, Noir aimed to tie the game

54
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,111
and played defensively to prevent making a goal.

55
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,611
I see.

56
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:31,511
Oh, say, Higo.

57
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,111
The game between the Noir and the Big Osaka,

58
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:35,611
a couple days ago was awesome!

59
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:38,611
Yeah. Every time Higo had the ball at his feet,

60
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,711
there were lots of booing.

61
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:44,511
But I wonder why the Big Osaka supporters booed him too.

62
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:46,011
Well, it's no wonder, isn't it?

63
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:52,011
Because there is really no room for a traitor.

64
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,211
Hey, hey.

65
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,211
Oh, isn't that true?

66
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,411
The guy is being hated by people on his side,

67
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:58,711
as well as his enemies, right?

68
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:02,511
Big and Noir have had a longstanding grudge against each other.

69
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,011
It's just that the Big supporters

70
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,711
can't seem to cheer for a forward striker

71
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:08,811
who they had considered an enemy till now.

72
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,711
Besides, Higo has scored no goals so far this season.

73
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:18,011
Well, as I recall, his name was in the headlines of a sports newspaper.

74
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,611
It said, "Higo Moving to Spain League"

75
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,911
It was in the sports news too.

76
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,511
It said that he may have joined the Big Osaka

77
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:29,511
to boost up his contract payment when he goes to Spain.

78
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,111
What a jerk!

79
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,411
Hey... Don't take it seriously!

80
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,311
It's just a rumor.

81
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,611
But if the rumor becomes reality...

82
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,911
I'm sure he'll be relieved.

83
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:41,911
Excuse me?

84
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:43,811
He can forget everything

85
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,311
and flee to a place far away

86
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,911
from all the booing.

87
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:52,011
Just kidding.

88
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:01,511
Hey! I think the Big Osaka also has a game today!

89
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:06,311
Yes. The game will be broadcast at 5 pm on Nichiuri TV.

90
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,011
Hey! The game's already begun!

91
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,011
What?

92
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:14,011
Where?

93
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,811
Today, here at Nagai Stadium.

94
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,111
The guy who is greeted by the booing is,

95
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,311
none other than this man!

96
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,211
Ryusuke Higo!

97
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,611
As you well know...

98
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,811
Look at yourself!

99
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:28,211
You deserve it because you betrayed our Noir Tokyo.

100
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,711
"Kadotake Akano (48)" -Once you fall into hell,

101
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,611
you can never climb out of it.

102
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:40,711
Hey, have you seen that guy somewhere before?

103
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,211
I've seen him!

104
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,611
I've seen him on the TV news!

105
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,411
He's been arrested often because during matches,

106
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,311
he used to throw smoke bombs into the field

107
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:51,511
or had huge fights in the seats when he's drunk.

108
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,211
I think his name is...

109
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,911
Kadotake Akano!

110
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,711
He's just a stupid guy who is a fanatic supporter of the Noir Tokyo

111
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,911
and is proud of being a Hooligan!

112
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,911
I hear that his name is on the blacklist

113
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,211
and that some stadiums refuse his entry.

114
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,511
Hey, what's a "hooligan" anyway?

115
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,711
They're wild and unruly football fans in Europe

116
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:15,011
under the pretense of concern for the game.

117
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:19,611
That guy has a website called "Tokyo Hooligan".

118
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:22,411
In his web site diary, he boastfully writes things like,

119
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,611
"I taught a supporter a lesson today" and so on.

120
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,411
So, it's not surprising that

121
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,011
he's not allowed entry to the stadium.

122
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,811
I see...

123
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,011
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

124
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,411
Speaking of the web site,

125
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,111
have you checked it out?

126
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,811
-What? -You know...

127
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:42,511
The one I asked you about a few days ago...

128
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:46,811
About the American movie star, Chris Vineyard!

129
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,511
Oh, well... As you instructed,

130
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,811
I got into the chat room

131
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,111
and asked several fans some questions about her.

132
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,111
And?

133
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,811
But I'm not sure.

134
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:01,311
Chris's mother, Sharon Vineyard, is well known as a great actress,

135
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:03,311
but her daughter Chris' personal life

136
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:06,211
remains shrouded in a veil of mystery.

137
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:10,011
Because the only time she ever appeared before the media

138
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,911
besides shooting films was one year ago that day.

139
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:14,111
That day?

140
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:17,311
The day of her mother, Sharon's funeral!

141
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:21,011
A short footage was aired in Japan. Remember?

142
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,511
Oh, yeah.

143
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:26,511
Rumour has it that lousy reporters slipped into her funeral,

144
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:29,711
and asked a barrage of questions.

145
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,411
Like, "What school did you go to?",

146
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,711
"Is it true that you and your mother were on bad terms?",

147
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,711
"Who is your father anyway?"

148
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:39,311
"Isn't your rumored boyfriend attending this funeral?" and so on.

149
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:43,711
But she still didn't say anything at all.

150
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,811
Then frustrated by her attitude,

151
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:49,611
one reporter asked impatiently, "Got something you want to hide?"

152
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,511
Chris turned her back against her mother's coffin

153
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:56,311
and replied casually, with a smile...

154
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,911
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

155
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:05,311
"A secret makes a woman, a woman."

156
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,911
By the way, a famous Japanese actress was seen attending the funeral,

157
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:14,011
on the news coverage in the U.S.

158
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,411
but since Chris's remark was so impressive,

159
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:20,111
no one remembers who the Japanese woman was.

160
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,911
But is it true?

161
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:29,011
That Chris Vineyard belongs to the Black Organization?

162
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,411
I don't know for sure...

163
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,611
I don't have any conclusive evidence,

164
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:34,011
but if it's true...

165
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:37,011
If... If it's true, then?

166
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:41,411
She's gonna be a tough one to deal with for sure.

167
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:44,411
Tough one?

168
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,011
Shinichi, don't tell me

169
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:49,511
You're still hiding something from me.

170
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:50,711
So, I mean,

171
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:52,711
if she's an actress and also a good talker,

172
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:56,611
I just thought it's gonna be hard to corner her with my deduction.

173
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:57,611
By the way,

174
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,711
isn't it about time to catch a train back home?

175
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:02,711
Yeah, that's right.

176
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,211
Come on, you guys! We're going home!

177
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:06,911
Hey, wait a second.

178
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,611
They are getting to the best part now.

179
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:12,111
It's okay, because I have a radio now.

180
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,311
Really?

181
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:14,911
Let's go!

182
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,311
All right!

183
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:20,911
Hey, Haibara, we're going!

184
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,111
Yes...

185
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:36,811
What's with this train?

186
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:40,011
It's packed with supporters from both the Spirits and the Noir!

187
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,911
That's why I told you,

188
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,011
we should take the next train.

189
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:47,411
But, Genta said he wanted to hurry home, so...

190
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:50,411
I can't help thinking of the Big Osaka's game!

191
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,611
And I wanna watch it on TV at home, don't you?

192
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,711
Come on...

193
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,911
Hey you! That hurts! Idiot!

194
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:00,311
Don't push your weight around just cuz your team won!

195
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,911
I can't help it because it's so crowded here.

196
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,411
That guy is on this train too!

197
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,911
Oh, no.

198
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,211
Don't worry.

199
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,011
If we stay still, he won't mess with us.

200
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,311
That's true but...

201
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,611
Haibara.

202
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:21,611
Hey, how's the game going?

203
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,811
Yes!

204
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,011
With the score at 0-0,

205
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:28,011
the game is just going into the first half of the overtime period.

206
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:32,511
And, is player number 9 of the Big Osaka still on the pitch?

207
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:35,111
Higo is still playing,

208
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,411
but the booing is so loud

209
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:40,811
that his team mates seem hesitant to pass the ball to him.

210
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,411
I see.

211
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,211
Haibara?

212
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:49,311
If anything happens in the game, please tell me.

213
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:51,611
Yes, of course.

214
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,311
What?

215
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:07,711
Haido! Haido!

216
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:11,511
Transfer here for the Haido Subway line.

217
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,861
One stab in his stomach with a knife.

218
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:32,861
Hey, what's up, Conan?

219
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,161
Dr. Agasa! Call the ambulance and the police!

220
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,161
Got it!

221
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:40,361
Will I still make it?

222
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,861
Hey, station manager!

223
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,661
Don't start this train!

224
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:45,961
Someone's been stabbed!

225
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,661
What?

226
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:52,661
Please immediately call the personnel at all the wickets

227
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:54,261
and tell them to check all the tickets

228
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:58,561
belonging to Tokyo Spirits and Noir Tokyo supporters.

229
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,761
Supporters? Tickets?

230
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:06,261
Yes! Look only for those who bought a ticket before 5 pm

231
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,661
and keep them here!

232
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,661
But... Why?

233
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,361
Never mind, just do it now.

234
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:14,261
If you don't hurry, the killer will get away!

235
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:23,861
The victim is Mr. Kadotake Akano, 48 years old.

236
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,561
The murder weapon is a knife with a blade of 15cm,

237
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:28,861
was left at the scene of the crime.

238
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:32,361
When he was killed, there were a number of passengers on the train.

239
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,461
But there are no witnesses so far.

240
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,861
Oh, I think I've seen him somewhere before.

241
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:41,161
You've probably seen him on TV.

242
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:42,361
On TV?

243
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:46,161
This man seems to have been a notorious supporter.

244
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:48,761
He often made the news.

245
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,561
I see.

246
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:55,961
This knife's scabbard and hilt have an unusual design.

247
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:56,961
So if we can locate where it is sold...

248
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,161
About that...

249
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,561
I already talked to some shops about it.

250
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,961
It isn't sold here in Japan.

251
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:05,961
It's a rare knife from overseas.

252
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,461
So, it may take a while longer to find

253
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:10,061
where the killer bought the knife.

254
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,661
I see.

255
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:15,761
He was stabbed in a train,

256
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:17,861
but why is it that no one saw it happen?

257
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,261
It can't be helped.

258
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:23,261
Because the train was jam packed.

259
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,061
You're...

260
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,861
When the train reached this station, everybody rushed out of the train

261
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:30,261
and then we found that man lying on the floor.

262
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,761
And that was when we first realized that someone had been stabbed.

263
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,861
Inspector... Inspector Megure?

264
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:39,161
You guys again?

265
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,261
And?

266
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:42,361
Didn't you see anyone suspicious?

267
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,961
I don't remember.

268
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,361
Besides, everyone was dressed alike.

269
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,861
Dressed alike?

270
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,661
It was right after the soccer game,

271
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:55,361
so the train was full of supporters from both teams.

272
00:14:55,361 --> 00:15:00,161
In that case, the culprit has probably already left the station

273
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:02,761
or changed trains, I think.

274
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:04,961
But...

275
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:08,361
In any case, I explained to the three passengers what happened

276
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,161
and told them to stay here.

277
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:13,061
What? How did you pick those three people?

278
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:18,561
I just did as I was told to, by this boy.

279
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:20,061
This boy? You mean...

280
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,361
Don't tell me he's...

281
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,661
Conan!

282
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:26,261
I knew it.

283
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:28,661
But how did you decide to pick those three people?

284
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,461
Simple.

285
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:33,761
In general, you can't suddenly decide to stab

286
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:36,261
someone to death on the train.

287
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,061
So that's why I thought...

288
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,961
that the culprit probably knew that Mr. Akano was going to be

289
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,061
on that jam packed train of supporters.

290
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,661
So, the culprit probably stabbed Mr. Akano with a knife

291
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,261
just before the train reached this station

292
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,161
at which many passengers got off,

293
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:53,561
and disappear into the crowd.

294
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:57,761
I see. You mean this is a planned murder.

295
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:01,161
Yeah! So, I asked the station manager

296
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,761
to not let the passengers dressed as supporters

297
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,261
out of the gates.

298
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,761
But why the supporters?

299
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:12,761
Because the train was packed full of supporters.

300
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,461
It looks less suspicious if you're dressed like a supporter, right?

301
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,261
So, were there only three supporters

302
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,961
who tried to get through the gates?

303
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:24,261
No. I think there were at least 50 people.

304
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,161
What? The numbers don't match at all?

305
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,361
It's the ticket.

306
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,461
Ticket?

307
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,561
The criminal had to follow Mr. Akano closely

308
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,661
and get on the same train

309
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,261
in order to stab him, right?

310
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:38,661
So, the culprit

311
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,161
had to buy a return ticket in advance!

312
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,661
After the game, if he lined up to buy the ticket

313
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,861
in a station full of supporters,

314
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:50,561
that person might lose sight of Mr. Akano.

315
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:53,461
The game ended at 5 pm!

316
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:55,561
So total of persons who had a ticket

317
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,661
with a time stamp before 5 pm

318
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,361
and tried to get through the gates at that time

319
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,461
are only those three persons.

320
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:04,061
I understand.

321
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:05,561
But still

322
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,961
what if the culprit changed

323
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,261
from the supporter's clothes to another outfit

324
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:11,661
or instead of going out the gate,

325
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,961
transferred to a train on the opposite platform?

326
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,961
I don't see it likely!

327
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,261
If the culprit changes clothes on the platform,

328
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,761
it'll make him look suspicious.

329
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,761
And the restroom of this station is outside the gate.

330
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,761
There are probably fewer supporters on the other side,

331
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:29,661
so there's a chance that someone would remember him.

332
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,961
While waiting for a train,

333
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:34,561
the police might come and order him not to leave.

334
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:36,361
The safest way is

335
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:39,061
to go out the gate with the multitude of supporters,

336
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,561
change his clothes in the restroom and make his getaway.

337
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,661
Haido Station is frequented by passengers who transfer to the subway,

338
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:48,861
so most people get off here.

339
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,061
That's true...

340
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:52,861
Conan.

341
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,561
I always wonder why.

342
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:58,761
Why are you so smart?

343
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,061
What?

344
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,661
You figured all this out just by looking at the corpse in the train

345
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,961
and gave the station manager the instructions, right?

346
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,761
No...

347
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,661
You got it wrong.

348
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:13,161
It wasn't me, but Dr. Agasa!

349
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:16,061
I just did as Dr. Agasa told me to do.

350
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,561
I see. It was you, Dr. Agasa.

351
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,961
Yeah.

352
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:22,061
Of course...

353
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,561
He just did what I told him to do.

354
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:30,361
No way on earth could a kid like him make a deduction!

355
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,961
How frustrating!

356
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:36,361
So did you figure out who did it?

357
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,461
What?

358
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:39,361
You have an idea who did it at least, don't you?

359
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,561
It's...

360
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:48,461
Well, after that, what did I instruct Conan to do?

361
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,961
Gosh.

362
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,661
Hey, Dr. Agasa!

363
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,761
Didn't you say that after the police get here,

364
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,561
you would listen to what the three people,

365
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,361
who were stopped at the gate, have to say.

366
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,961
Hey, hey!

367
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:06,061
We're being branded criminals

368
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,061
because we bought the ticket at a certain time?

369
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,461
The reason I bought a return ticket beforehand

370
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,561
was to avoid standing in line and rush-hour traffic.

371
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,961
-Me too. -Same here.

372
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:20,661
But all of you got on the train full of supporters, after all, right?

373
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,061
If you had a return ticket,

374
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,861
why didn't you go back to the station right away

375
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:27,261
and get on a less crowded train?

376
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,961
Because...

377
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,661
"Hasue Kira (24)" -After the game,

378
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:34,461
I got into an argument with a Spirits supporter,

379
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,561
so I arrived late at the station.

380
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:38,261
My seat was in the front row

381
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,161
where the Spirits and the Noir supporters

382
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,461
were sitting all mixed up together.

383
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:45,961
"Mitsuaki Funato (33)" -Unluckily I got a phone call from my office

384
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,961
just before the end of the game,

385
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:49,061
and the fact that I was took off from work

386
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:50,861
to come to the game was known.

387
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,761
I was getting yelled at for a while,

388
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:54,861
so I couldn't leave if I wanted to.

389
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,661
Thanks to it, I missed seeing the two wings score a goal.

390
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,161
"Etsutoshi Oba (29)" -I was so devastated

391
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:03,161
that I couldn't get up from my seat for a while after the game.

392
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,961
When Hide came close to the goal, dodging one defender after the other,

393
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,261
and Naoki made the goal,

394
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,761
I plunged into despair and grief.

395
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,961
And, which train car were you on?

396
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,361
Who would remember something like that?

397
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,661
But I'm pretty sure

398
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:22,261
that all three of you were on the packed train, right?

399
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:23,261
What?

400
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:24,361
Look!

401
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,361
You see there is still a mark on your right elbow

402
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:29,261
where the ring on your left finger was.

403
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,761
That means for a long period of time,

404
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:33,461
you were carrying your bag with your right hand

405
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:37,161
while holding the mouth of the bag with your left hand, right?

406
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:39,761
And, you, with the long hair,

407
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:42,161
I see a mark on your right arm from your wrist watch.

408
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:44,961
That means, you had your arms folded for a long period of time.

409
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,161
And you, the one wearing glasses.

410
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,461
You've got marks on both of your palms

411
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,361
because you kept a firm grip

412
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:52,561
on the handle of your bag with both hands, right?

413
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:56,561
You can only keep such a posture

414
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,261
for a long time on a crowded train.

415
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:02,961
And the train had already been crowded with people before we got on,

416
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,361
you couldn't have found seats either.

417
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,061
Is what he said true?

418
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:09,161
Oh... Yeah.

419
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:12,261
I heard there are a lot of pickpockets in a crowded train.

420
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,661
I keep my arms crossed

421
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,061
because someone might mistake me for a pervert.

422
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:19,861
Fantastic! It's just as Dr. Agasa said.

423
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,361
Anyway it seems certain that

424
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:29,161
all of you were on that crowded train.

425
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,161
Now I want each of you to take some time to remember

426
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:34,061
which car train you were on.

427
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:36,061
I apologize for the inconvenience

428
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,361
but please follow me to where the crime scene is.

429
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:41,861
I still need to head back to work.

430
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,261
-Why do I have to do this? -Gosh.

431
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,961
What?

432
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,561
Why is that guy...

433
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,061
There are three suspects...

434
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,661
The only thing that was proven was

435
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:18,361
those three were on the crowded train.

436
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:19,861
But...

437
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:23,561
I cannot conclude anything from only that fact.

438
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,661
There must be something more.

439
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:28,061
Something else.

440
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:30,061
Another clue to solve the case.

441
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:08,461
"Next Episode" -Higo got tripped!

442
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:10,161
But listen!

443
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:13,161
To the loud cheer from his supporters!

444
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,961
That guy has the whole world against him.

445
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:19,061
Is there no pitch in Japan where he can play?

446
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,561
Wait a second.

447
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,761
I think today's Tokyo Derby was...

448
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:29,161
"Tokyo Spirit vs Noir Tokyo" -It's just as I thought.

449
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:30,961
Next Conan,

450
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:35,182
"Hooligan in the Labyrinth (Part 2)"

451
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,379
Next Conan Hint:

452
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:39,979
"Uniform"
