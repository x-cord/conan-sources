1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,140
So that person who requested you to investigate

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,040
whether her boyfriend was cheating on her.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,940
Yeah. She passed away.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,340
She fell down a flight of stone stairs.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,440
"Kaoru Mizumori (24), deceased" -Tsuge! You've got the nerve!

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,240
Huh? What're you talking about?

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,540
Don't play dumb with me!

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,440
"Takashi Sasamori(28)" -You intended to have a little fun, right?

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,440
And Kaoru who pressed you to marry her got in your way,

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,340
"Hikari Tsuga (33)" -so you pushed her down the stairs!

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,240
What a stupid thing to say.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,940
I saw you at the top of the stone stairs from where Kaoru fell!

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,340
Wait. Please stop!

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,740
"Mariko Noguchi (30)" -That matter was thoroughly

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,540
investigated by the police and the misunderstanding was solved!

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,740
Silence!

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,840
The police may have been fooled, but not me!

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,140
Please stop!

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,140
Please stop it, both of you!

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,340
"Kazumi Ishikura (25)" -Please don't talk that way in front of Kaoru.

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,840
Let her rest in peace, please.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,240
That young lady is right.

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,740
You should keep in mind where you are.

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,240
No matter how much you detest me,

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,040
I'm not the killer.

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,640
Excuse me.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,940
Wait, Mr. Tsuge.

28
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,340
That was 3 months ago.

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,040
Then, this morning Mr. Tsuge suddenly calls you and says,

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,440
"I'll tell you about the killer back then, so please come."

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,940
Yeah.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,440
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,640
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,340
What was the real purpose of the artist

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,240
behind the queer artifact?

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,340
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:27,379
"Message from a Client"

40
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,579
Did something happen?

41
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,979
Yes, there was a landslide ahead.

42
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,379
This road is inaccessible.

43
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,979
Is that right?

44
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,979
We're on our way to that house over there.

45
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,579
You are, too.

46
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,379
In that case, that road is fine.

47
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,179
Thanks.

48
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,079
Darn it. I can barely see ahead.

49
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,679
Can you handle? Be careful, Dad.

50
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,979
Is anyone else coming?

51
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,979
Yeah, he said he also called the three people

52
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,079
who made a commotion at the funeral.

53
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,679
There are people here before us, as expected.

54
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,479
Mr. Mouri, you were called over by Tsuge too?

55
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,979
Yes.

56
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,279
What heavy rain.

57
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,179
Come, let's go inside.

58
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,979
Whose car is this?

59
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,379
It's Tsuge's car.

60
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,979
He's been cooped up in this atelier for the past three months

61
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,579
working on his artwork.

62
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,779
Oh, no. The door's not locked.

63
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,279
Mr. Tsuge, it's me, Noguchi.

64
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,479
-Here. -Thank you.

65
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,579
I forgot my umbrella.

66
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,979
Thank you.

67
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,379
Not at all.

68
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,379
You'd better hurry and dry yourself up.

69
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,179
Mr. Tsuge!

70
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,079
It's too late.

71
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,379
Ran! Call the police!

72
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,279
Yes!

73
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,179
I will preserve the scene,

74
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,979
so please leave the room, everyone!

75
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,179
Wait.

76
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:47,479
Please don't touch the artifact no matter what.

77
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,079
Huh? Artifact?

78
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,979
It's just junk put together.

79
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,079
Is there any meaning to that stuff?

80
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,979
How rude!

81
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,979
Are you making fun of Mr. Tsuge's artwork?

82
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,579
Okay, okay.

83
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,379
Anyway, I'll inform the police about it,

84
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,279
so please leave this room for now.

85
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,579
Really? I'm really counting on you, all right?

86
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,479
Yes, yes, I got it.

87
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,379
What's this?

88
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,679
There's no dust only on top of the tape.

89
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,379
Which means, there was something on it till just a while ago.

90
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,179
Is that a screen?

91
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,779
"Demurrer"...

92
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,579
If I remember correctly, it means "objection" or something to that effect.

93
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,579
Hey, you!

94
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,879
Don't wander around on your own!

95
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,779
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:43,679
I wonder what on earth was there.

97
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:46,679
And who moved it.

98
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,479
There's nothing inside this room that's a likely object.

99
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,279
Which means that the culprit took it outside, after all.

100
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,379
The victim is Hikari Tsuge.

101
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,779
His real name is Ritsu Hikage, 33 years old.

102
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,079
His profession is a sculptor.

103
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,479
By the way, it seems that Hikari Tsuge is

104
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,279
an anagram of Ritsu Hikage, his real name.

105
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,979
An anagram, you mean like

106
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,579
when the characters are rearranged to make a different word?

107
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,479
Yes. The cause of death was

108
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,079
an occipital blow leading to intracranial injury.

109
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,779
The hammer which is thought to be the murder weapon

110
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,479
was found on the floor nearby,

111
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,779
but the fingerprints were all wiped clean.

112
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,179
I'd like to ask you again.

113
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,579
You were all told by the victim that he would tell you

114
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,779
who the culprit that committed the crime 3 months ago was

115
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,679
and invited you all here, correct?

116
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,279
Yes, Inspector.

117
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,979
However, when we got here,

118
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:44,879
he was already dead and the culprit had fled.

119
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,579
About that, Mr. Mouri...

120
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,779
According to the officer at the checkpoint,

121
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,479
no one had gone down the road that leads out of the atelier.

122
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,479
Which means that the culprit is still somewhere nearby?

123
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,079
That's very likely.

124
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,279
No, there were only 4 cars to begin with that didn't make a U-turn

125
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,979
and came up the slope, the officer said.

126
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,279
Only 4 cars?

127
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,279
Me, and Kazumi, Mr. Sasamori, Mr. Mouri and his party.

128
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,179
Which means that the culprit is among us.

129
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,379
I see. There's only one road coming up here,

130
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,379
and there's a checkpoint up ahead.

131
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,079
Fleeing down the dark slope in this rain is impossible.

132
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,079
It's indeed a closed circle.

133
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,879
No, that can't be!

134
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,779
Because we were the first to get here,

135
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,179
and everybody else came after us.

136
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,579
Right! I was up front.

137
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,779
And behind him was me.

138
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,879
Then lastly, Ms. Noguchi.

139
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,579
We entered the atelier together and found the body.

140
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:52,979
I see.

141
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:56,379
But when we told the officer

142
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,579
that we were coming to this atelier,

143
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,679
the officer said, "You are, too."

144
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,279
Doesn't that mean that there was another car

145
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,479
that came to the atelier before us?

146
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:11,079
If we ask that officer about the model of the car or the driver,

147
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,779
maybe we'll find out about the culprit?

148
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,379
The thing is, he says he remembers that there were 4 cars,

149
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,379
but he doesn't remember the model of the cars

150
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,779
or the face of the drivers.

151
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,279
How would I be able to tell about things like that in this downpour?

152
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,379
Come on, mister.

153
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,279
Okay, so if we organize what's been said, is this it.

154
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,479
There was one car here already at the atelier.

155
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:36,979
This was the car of Mr. Tsuge who was killed.

156
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,679
Then, Mouri and his group arrived.

157
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,679
After that, 3 cars came successively. That makes 4 cars.

158
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,979
However, according to the officer,

159
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,879
a car went by before the one Conan was in.

160
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,679
Which means that...

161
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,079
The car of the culprit arrived first.

162
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,979
Then, after killing Mr. Tsuge,

163
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:58,879
the culprit left the atelier, hid somewhere,

164
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,879
waited for everyone to arrive

165
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,579
and joined everyone as if nothing had happened.

166
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:05,079
Is that it?

167
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,379
What is the motive for the crime, then?

168
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,479
Of course to shut him up.

169
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,679
Hearing that Mr. Tsuge would reveal

170
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,079
who killed Kaoru Sasamori 3 months ago,

171
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,979
the culprit came to the atelier before everyone else,

172
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,179
and killed Mr. Tsuge.

173
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,779
In other words, the culprit for this case,

174
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,779
is also the one who killed Ms. Kaoru Sasamori!

175
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,179
And that person is...

176
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,279
One of you three!

177
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,779
Really cool!

178
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,779
Anyone could see that considering the circumstances.

179
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:49,879
The problem is to figure out who of the three is the culprit.

180
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,929
Hold it.

181
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,029
Let's say the culprit is one among the three of us.

182
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,729
Would Tsuge who knew that,

183
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,129
go out of his way to call the culprit over?

184
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,329
Maybe he wanted to pretend being a detective?

185
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,729
He had a childish side to him, you know.

186
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,229
True.

187
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:23,029
He probably went out of his way to call everyone over

188
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,129
because he wanted to say, "The culprit is among you!"

189
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,129
Don't you think?

190
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,629
It's just like what he would think up.

191
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,329
Well, I'm not the one who did it.

192
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,329
I had a date for a meal with my younger sister that day.

193
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,929
But shooting the film ran late,

194
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:40,529
so I went to meet her where she was waiting, a bit late.

195
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:45,829
Kaoru!

196
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:48,329
Are you all right, Kaoru?

197
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:50,629
Somebody pushed me from behind.

198
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,229
Were you pushed down?

199
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:56,329
Back then, I saw

200
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,529
Tsuge at the top of the stone stairs.

201
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,729
So, I thought that Tsuge was the culprit.

202
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,929
But it wasn't so.

203
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,129
Mr. Tsuge was a witness to the crime.

204
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,929
That's why I could never be the culprit.

205
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:15,629
But you don't have any witness, do you?

206
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,029
Then, are you saying that I'm lying?

207
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,029
Kaoru is my younger sister, you know!

208
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,529
But you didn't get along with her, did you?

209
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,729
I heard from Kaoru

210
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,429
that she was on bad terms with her older brother

211
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,729
over the estate left behind by her parents.

212
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,529
She told you about that, too.

213
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,629
So, angered at her,

214
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,729
you pushed her from the stone stairs, didn't you?

215
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,229
What did you say?

216
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,729
Hold it, Kazumi.

217
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,829
You sure sound like a lady worried over her best friend,

218
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,529
but you also have a motive for wanting to kill Kaoru, don't you?

219
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,629
Just what do you mean?

220
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,029
Tsuge had another woman besides Kaoru.

221
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:55,029
What?

222
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,729
She hired Mr. Mouri here to find out who that woman was.

223
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:03,029
That's right.

224
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,829
Then, who's that other woman?

225
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,529
Right, it's Ms. Kazumi Ishikura.

226
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,529
I didn't know either.

227
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,029
That he was also going out with Kaoru.

228
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,729
What?

229
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,629
I was proposed by Mr. Tsuge!

230
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:24,829
What shall I do?

231
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,429
What's this?

232
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:32,629
What does this mean, Mr. Tsuge?

233
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,329
I'm talking about work, so we'll talk about it later.

234
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,229
Since when have you been going out with Kaoru?

235
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:41,429
-It's not what you think! -Don't take me lightly!

236
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,029
Break up with her! Break up with Kaoru!

237
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:49,529
It's not that you don't have a motive, either, is it?

238
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,129
What?

239
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,029
I heard from Kaoru.

240
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,329
Kaoru, this.

241
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,229
What's this?

242
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:59,229
There's 1,000,000 yen inside.

243
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,329
I want you to break up with Tsuge.

244
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,629
Oh, no.

245
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,729
Ever since he started going out with you,

246
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:06,929
Tsuge's stopped working.

247
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,529
So, take this and break up with him.

248
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:09,929
I'm leaving!

249
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,229
I heard that the clients were looking for other artists

250
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:18,329
because Tsuge virtually didn't work.

251
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,529
If so, you would have to pay an exorbitant penalty fee

252
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,929
for breach of contract.

253
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,529
And that's why you're saying that I killed Kaoru?

254
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,829
It's true that since she passed away,

255
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,229
Tsuge was obsessed in making artwork.

256
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:33,529
But that has nothing to do with me!

257
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,129
Hey, Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,929
What is it, Conan?

259
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,729
Pops Kogoro asked me to tell you something.

260
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,129
He said he wanted you to look for a place

261
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,929
from the checkpoint to here where a car could be hidden.

262
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,329
Okay.

263
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,629
Maybe around here?

264
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,529
I'll go take a look.

265
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,529
Conan!

266
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:10,529
It's true.

267
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:11,929
If here, the car that comes up from the slope

268
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,029
won't be able to see anything

269
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,129
because the hut over there will block the view.

270
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,729
Which means...

271
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,329
So, this is it.

272
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,429
This is what the culprit took away from the scene of the crime.

273
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,429
If so, that was...

274
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,829
Then, everyone.

275
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,729
I would like to ask each one of you some more questions

276
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,629
so please come with me to the station.

277
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,329
-Dad? -It's come! Sleeping Kogoro!

278
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:42,429
There's no need to go to the station,

279
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:45,529
Inspector, I shall settle the case here and now.

280
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,929
What?

281
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:51,229
When I found Mr. Tsuge's body in this atelier,

282
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:54,129
I found that the trace of something had disappeared.

283
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,229
-Something? -Judging from the circumstances,

284
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,829
it's probably something that the culprit took away

285
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:01,329
after committing the crime.

286
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,329
Takagi, bring it, will you?

287
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,929
Yes, sir.

288
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:09,029
Why did Mr. Tsuge, already 3 months after the incident,

289
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,529
say that he would reveal who the killer of that incident was?

290
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:17,829
On the day of Kaoru's funeral, he could've revealed it

291
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,329
when he got into an argument with Mr. Sasamori, couldn't he?

292
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,129
That's true.

293
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,029
Mr. Tsuge probably wanted to accuse the culprit

294
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,629
in his own unique way.

295
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,429
In order to do so, he needed 3 months.

296
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,229
Could that be...

297
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,429
Right.

298
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,429
It's the time he needed to make that artifact

299
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,929
that you see in front of you.

300
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:41,529
The title of that artifact is "demurrer".

301
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,529
It means "objection."

302
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,329
Mr. Mouri, here it is.

303
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,129
I'm sorry, but can you put that in the place

304
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,629
where the vinyl tape is in the room?

305
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:52,429
Yes, sir.

306
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,229
Try to remember.

307
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:56,129
The name Hikaru Tsuge is

308
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:59,329
the anagram of his real name, Ritsu Hikage.

309
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,829
Hikari (Light) Tsuge and Ritsu Hikage (Shadow).

310
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,929
Indeed "light" and "shadow".

311
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,429
And I tried figuring out the anagram for "demurrer",

312
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,229
the title of the artifact.

313
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:13,029
A different title emerges...

314
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,429
"Murderer".

315
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,029
The hidden title "murderer".

316
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:22,329
The hidden title "Murderer"?

317
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,229
It's ready.

318
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:28,229
Ran, please lower the screen above the door

319
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:29,829
and turn off the light of the room.

320
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,329
Okay.

321
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,929
Takagi, the light.

322
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,529
Yes, sir.

323
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,129
What about this is the murderer?

324
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,129
Takagi, turn the pedestal of the artifact slowly, will you?

325
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:49,629
Huh? Yes, sir.

326
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,029
This is...

327
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:58,829
Shadow art.

328
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,329
At first glance, it's an artifact that's incomprehensible.

329
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:04,429
But if you shine the light on it from a certain angle,

330
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,329
a shadow art emerges from it.

331
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:09,129
Through his art,

332
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,029
Mr. Tsuge was trying to accuse the culprit.

333
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,029
Ran, turn on the light.

334
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,429
Ms. Kazumi Ishikura.

335
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,729
You're the one who killed Ms. Kaoru Sasamori

336
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,829
and Mr. Hikari Tsuge, aren't you?

337
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,629
Hold it, Mr. Mouri.

338
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:28,829
I wonder if that silhouetted ballerina artifact

339
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,129
suffices to accuse her as the culprit.

340
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:33,229
True, that the silhouetted picture alone

341
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,329
may not suffice as evidence.

342
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:39,229
But the culprit afraid that the picture would be shown

343
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:41,629
took the light away from the scene.

344
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,129
That move of hers,

345
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:46,929
serves as an immovable evidence that specifies her as the culprit.

346
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,629
Try to remember.

347
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,329
In order to go to where the light was,

348
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,529
you would have to step over Mr. Tsuge's dead body.

349
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,029
However, on the other side, there was a pool of blood,

350
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,429
and you can't step on it.

351
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,429
Because you'd be leaving footprints if you did.

352
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,629
In other words, the culprit, just as Conan did,

353
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:05,329
at the time the body was found,

354
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:08,529
went under the work table and went over to the other side,

355
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:11,129
and took the light away.

356
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,829
No offense but with the physique of Mr. Sasamori or Ms. Noguch,

357
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,329
it would be impossible to go under the work table.

358
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:20,629
The only one who can go through there

359
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:25,129
is you, a ballerina, Ms. Ishikura.

360
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,129
Lastly, one more thing.

361
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,529
When you got off your car at the parking lot,

362
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:33,029
you didn't have an umbrella and were soaking wet, weren't you?

363
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:35,129
However, from what Conan tells me,

364
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:39,529
the driver's seat of your car was also soaking wet.

365
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:40,529
In other words,

366
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:44,029
you were already drenched before you got off your car

367
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:47,729
because you went to get rid of that light stand in this rain.

368
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,029
We were supposed to get married.

369
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:57,229
At least, I thought so.

370
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,829
That's why when I heard he invited you,

371
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,329
I thought he was going to announce that.

372
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,129
So, not being able to wait that long, I came here before all of you.

373
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:09,329
Tsuge had the nerve to show me his shadow art

374
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:12,329
and told me he was going to accuse me of murder.

375
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,929
What are you talking about?

376
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,829
Weren't you going to announce our engagement today?

377
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,429
You said that if Kaoru disappeared,

378
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,029
you'd be able to marry me!

379
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,229
I said that on the spur of the moment

380
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:24,829
because I was fed up that she hired a detective

381
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,029
and was snooping around.

382
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,029
You were dumb enough to take it seriously.

383
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,429
I had no idea that you would actually go through with it.

384
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,629
I mean, she was your best friend, you know.

385
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:42,329
Kaoru!

386
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,729
Are you all right, Kaoru?

387
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:47,029
I really want out now.

388
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:52,929
I advise you to turn yourself in.

389
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,229
I called a detective called Kogoro Mouri over

390
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:57,329
so that you could do so, too.

391
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,529
I'm sure he'll take you to the police.

392
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,229
If you need one, I can get you a good lawyer, too.

393
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,329
But...

394
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:27,629
But, why didn't you destroy his artifact?

395
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:30,729
If you did, you wouldn't have had to hide the light.

396
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,729
It's not that she didn't destroy it.

397
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,829
She couldn't.

398
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,529
Right. I couldn't destroy it.

399
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:43,229
I was happy.

400
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:47,229
Even if it were a piece that he made so that he could accuse me,

401
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:50,729
just to think that he thought about me for 3 months

402
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:54,329
while he was making this artifact,

403
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:56,329
I just couldn't destroy it.

404
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:26,229
Hey, Dad!

405
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:29,029
You're drinking too much beer!

406
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,229
Besides, why are the lights turned off?

407
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:34,729
Shut up! Just wait and see.

408
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,729
I'm going to show you my artistic shadow art from now.

409
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,529
No joke!

410
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,929
Fantastic! It's Mom's profile!

411
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,229
It... It sure looks it.

412
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:51,729
Dad, you had artistic talent too, didn't you?

413
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,229
Sort of.

414
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:57,229
Call me "Art Kogoro" from now on!

415
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,629
Right. Kogoro Mouri Art... What a surprise.

416
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,029
What the?

417
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,329
"Next Episode" -Are you okay?

418
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:12,229
This is not a homicide.

419
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:14,929
Blood characters from 10 years ago...

420
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:18,129
that incident when Dad fled part way.

421
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:20,529
There's no need to call the ambulance.

422
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,329
It seems that more than 9 hours have passed since he died.

423
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,429
But this is not death by illness.

424
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,429
Somebody with ill intent did this.

425
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:36,929
Next Conan, "Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 1)"

426
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,129
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:57,129
"Candy"

428
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,429
-Dad's cold case, huh? -Who's Dad?

429
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:01,929
I meant "dandy". Dandy.
