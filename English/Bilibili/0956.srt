1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,110
So there was nothing left behind that would help us

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,510
identify the culprit.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,310
Their motive was probably a grudge.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,610
They hit him once in the head with a metal pipe.

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,310
You again, Mouri?

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,510
I just happened to be passing by,

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,010
and it seemed like there was a case.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,510
And this kid insisted we take a look.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,710
Anyway, are they the victim's surviving family members?

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,810
Yeah.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,610
We had them come to confirm the identity of the body.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,710
"Yasuko Kadowaki (63)" -His mother, Yasuko Kadowaki,

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,310
"Yuichi Kadowaki (28)" -and his older brother, Yuichi Kadowaki.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,910
Mom, keep it together.

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,210
The father died five years ago.

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,210
The three of them were living together.

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,810
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,710
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,610
A chance encounter with yet another assault case.

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,610
The surprising true face of a troubled family.

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,210
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,010
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,210
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:10,767
"The Mystery-Solving Water Taxi (Part 1)"

25
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,467
"Eiji Kadowaki (23)" -The victim was Eiji Kadowaki,

26
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,167
23 years old, who lives down the way.

27
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,967
He was killed last night around 10 pm.

28
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,967
According to his mother,

29
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:27,967
the victim went out to drink yesterday evening.

30
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:32,667
He was probably attacked on his way home.

31
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,367
So unaware of what happened,

32
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:38,767
his family was waiting for the victim to return home.

33
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,067
No.

34
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,867
Last night, his older brother Yuichi was staying at a hotel in the city

35
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,667
to work on some documents.

36
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,767
Apparently he works as an official in Kasumigaseki.

37
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,267
For the Chuo government office?

38
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,067
So he's an elite.

39
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,367
Inspector Megure! Oh, Mouri and Conan.

40
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,367
Well? How did it go?

41
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:01,767
Right.

42
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,467
The victim Eiji Kadowaki

43
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:08,067
didn't have a very good reputation in the neighborhood.

44
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,767
Since he dropped out of college three years ago,

45
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,567
he hasn't been able to hold down a job

46
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,867
and wanders the area.

47
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,967
Last Friday, he got drunk and argued

48
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,167
with a bar employee.

49
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:25,367
He spent the night in jail.

50
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,667
We also found two interesting pieces of information.

51
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,967
Which are?

52
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,467
The first is passers-by reported that several days ago,

53
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,067
a well-built man in his 30's

54
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,167
appeared to be watching the Kadowaki family,

55
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,767
as though investigating them.

56
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:45,867
He was also questioning the neighbors about the Kadowaki family.

57
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:49,867
Considering the victim's reputation...

58
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,567
It's possible he had some trouble

59
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,067
with that man and incurred his wrath.

60
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,067
Got it.

61
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,267
Keep trying to figure out who that man is.

62
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,267
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:05,767
What's the other piece of information?

64
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:06,867
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,367
According to the neighbors,

66
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,167
it seems the victim Eiji Kadowaki

67
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:15,767
was abusing his mother Yasuko daily.

68
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,867
What?

69
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,867
Furthermore, the older brother, Yuichi

70
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:26,067
would always stop his brother's explosive violence.

71
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,867
I see.

72
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:32,667
So the victim was the problem child of the Kadowaki family.

73
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,867
Yeah, but...

74
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:40,267
That woman seems genuinely sad.

75
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:43,767
They say the worse a child is, the more you love them.

76
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:44,967
Indeed.

77
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,267
But if that's the case,

78
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:53,967
we'll have to question the older brother again.

79
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,067
No.

80
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,067
There's no domestic violence in our family.

81
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:05,867
That's just an irresponsible rumor!

82
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:10,667
Besides, what does that have to do with Eiji's murder?

83
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,867
Yuichi Kadowaki,

84
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:24,767
I'm sorry, but could we talk to you at the station?

85
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,867
You think I killed Eiji?

86
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:34,667
No. Yuichi would never do that.

87
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,467
Didn't I just tell you?

88
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,367
I was working all last night!

89
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,267
Please calm down, Kadowaki.

90
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:45,967
I know. Around 10 pm, I ran into a woman at the hotel.

91
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,467
She was extremely drunk.

92
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:52,567
In any case, find her.

93
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:55,667
Then this will all become clear.

94
00:06:55,667 --> 00:07:00,067
No. Yuichi would never...

95
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,967
"Metropolitan Police Department, Beika Police Station"

96
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,367
Are you listening?

97
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:10,767
I would never do something as stupid as kill a person!

98
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:15,567
I see. So, what about Eiji's domestic violence?

99
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,567
It's not true.

100
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,067
Your father died five years ago, didn't he?

101
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,967
What about it?

102
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,567
According to your neighbors,

103
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:31,567
your mother has been frequently injured since then.

104
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,067
It's a coincidence.

105
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:37,767
And two years later, Eiji dropped out of college.

106
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,167
You managed to protect your mother until then,

107
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,567
but after that, you couldn't handle it anymore.

108
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,067
This is nonsense.

109
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:48,767
Furthermore, you've been busy with work lately,

110
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:52,767
so you've been out of the house a lot.

111
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,467
And around that same time,

112
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:57,967
your mother's injuries became more frequent.

113
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,967
I didn't do it.

114
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,567
If you didn't do something about Eiji,

115
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,967
he might do something that couldn't be undone.

116
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,967
I didn't do it.

117
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,967
So in order to protect your mother...

118
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,167
I didn't do it.

119
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,967
You had no choice.

120
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,267
I didn't do it.

121
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,367
But...

122
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,967
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

123
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:26,967
I didn't do it...

124
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,867
He's become totally stubborn.

125
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:33,667
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

126
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,167
Come in.

127
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,067
Inspector Megure, a moment.

128
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,167
What is it?

129
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,567
Well, actually...

130
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:46,267
We went to canvas the hotel Yuichi was staying at.

131
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,167
What? You found her?

132
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,067
Yes. She's still staying at the hotel.

133
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,467
"Beika Business Hotel" -According to her...

134
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:02,967
That hurts.

135
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,667
Excuse me.

136
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:09,167
It's all right. I wasn't looking where I was going.

137
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,967
Here.

138
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,967
The time displayed on the phone she picked up

139
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,067
was approximately at 10 pm.

140
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,767
Additionally, the hotel employee who happened to pass by

141
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,067
witnessed the scene.

142
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,867
So he has multiple people backing up his alibi.

143
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:26,867
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,967
So I can leave now, right?

145
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,867
My alibi has been verified.

146
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,067
I'm terribly sorry.

147
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,967
We'll give you a ride home.

148
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,867
No, thank you. More importantly...

149
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:44,867
I'll never forget the humiliation I suffered

150
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,667
while being treated like a murder suspect.

151
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,167
Clear the way, please.

152
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,467
Of course.

153
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,667
We came up empty.

154
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,567
Yeah, but it's for the best.

155
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,467
Indeed.

156
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,767
It would be tragic if one brother killed the other

157
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,367
out of concern for his mother.

158
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,667
Anyway, if we were wrong about him...

159
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,767
Yeah. It's the guy Takagi is after.

160
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,267
Chiba, get in touch with Takagi.

161
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,567
Yes, sir.

162
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,867
The well-built man in his 30's.

163
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,567
This guy.

164
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,367
Yeah. This is the guy.

165
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,367
It's definitely him.

166
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,767
He was asking around about Eiji.

167
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:36,967
Excuse me, but could I borrow this video?

168
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:40,667
Sure. I'll get it ready for you.

169
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,067
Thank you.

170
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,567
Hello? Oh, Chiba.

171
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,567
I just finished checking some convenience store security camera footage

172
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,167
for the man's face.

173
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,967
I'm about to bring it to the family.

174
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,067
This is him.

175
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:59,267
Oh, really? This is Takase.

176
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,867
What? You know him?

177
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,667
Who is he?

178
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,667
His name is Rintaro Takase.

179
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:10,667
He was my student back when I taught grade school.

180
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,767
Your old student?

181
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,167
Is this him, then? Did he kill Eiji?

182
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,367
No. Impossible.

183
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,567
We don't know that yet.

184
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,867
I was treated as a suspect because of this man.

185
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:30,367
We still don't know if he did it yet.

186
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,767
I don't think he did.

187
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,767
What?

188
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:39,567
Rintaro was rowdy and caused a lot of trouble.

189
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,167
But at heart, he was a good kid.

190
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:47,167
He's not someone who could've killed another person.

191
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,467
I see.

192
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:52,567
Right? Why would Rintaro kill Eiji?

193
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,367
He has no reason to.

194
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:58,767
So, have you met with Takase recently?

195
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,667
Yes, last week at the hospital...

196
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,567
in the neighborhood.

197
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,067
What? Did you exchange addresses

198
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,667
or contact information then?

199
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,667
No.

200
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:12,067
He just said he was working at a construction site

201
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,767
near Hinode Pier.

202
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,767
"Rintaro Takase (32), Construction Site Worker"

203
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,967
Takase.

204
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:33,967
What?

205
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,367
You're Rintaro Takase, correct?

206
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,667
Graduated from Haido Elementary School One.

207
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,167
What if I am?

208
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,167
We're the police.

209
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,767
Could we have a few minutes of your time?

210
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,567
Sure. Wait for me at the pier.

211
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:56,067
I'll go ask my foreman for his permission.

212
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:03,767
He wasn't even surprised that the police suddenly showed up.

213
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:07,567
He was smirking.

214
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:11,867
And he didn't even ask why we were here.

215
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:15,567
He must've been expecting the police to come.

216
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:32,234
The water taxi for Asakusa is departing.

217
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:39,534
Mrs. Yasuko Kadowaki?

218
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:42,734
Yeah, of course I remember her.

219
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:46,134
I was a rowdy kid.

220
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:50,734
She scolded me all the time.

221
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:53,734
Honestly, I hated her.

222
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,234
But that was 20 years ago.

223
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,334
You've been asking around the neighborhood

224
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,334
about the Kadowaki family recently.

225
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,734
I think it was last week that I ran into her.

226
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,934
I wanted to know how she was doing.

227
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,734
I felt nostalgic.

228
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:17,034
Who suddenly feels nostalgic about someone they hated?

229
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,534
What?

230
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:22,934
Takase, did you know that Yasuko Kadowaki's younger son,

231
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:27,934
Eiji Kadowaki was killed last night?

232
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,134
What? Her son was killed?

233
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:37,634
We came to talk to you as part of the investigation.

234
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,134
I see.

235
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:43,434
So, Takase, where were you at 10 pm last night?

236
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:47,634
I knew it. You think I did it, don't you?

237
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:50,434
But if I wanted revenge,

238
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,634
wouldn't I go after Mrs. Kadowaki directly?

239
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:57,334
Why would I kill her son?

240
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,934
A parent's greatest treasure is their children,

241
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:02,034
no matter how old they are.

242
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,434
Maybe you wanted to make her sad

243
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:07,834
by taking the life of her son.

244
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,634
I see.

245
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,434
The police have put a lot of thought into this.

246
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,734
How informative.

247
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,734
But I didn't do it!

248
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,934
Last night around 10 pm,

249
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,834
I was in the middle of a three hour

250
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:31,234
all you can drink session in Nebada.

251
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,434
What?

252
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,234
"Three Hours 3,330 yen All You Can Eat and Drink! Nebada Brewery"

253
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,734
I remember him well.

254
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:42,234
He was sitting in that corner.

255
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:46,534
He was facing the wall and kept shouting about fighting spirit.

256
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:48,534
Spirit! Spirit!

257
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:53,634
Ten cutlet skewers and a large beer!

258
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,734
He probably went to the bathroom,

259
00:15:56,734 --> 00:16:00,134
but aside from that, he was eating and drinking the whole time.

260
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:03,034
Do you know what time that was?

261
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:08,034
I think it was three hours starting just after 8 pm.

262
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,134
Would you like to check our security cameras?

263
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,134
They're only installed at the entrance, though.

264
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:16,434
You said around 8 pm, right?

265
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,134
Yeah. He's here.

266
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:21,434
It's this guy in the loud Hawaiian shirt.

267
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,634
That's definitely Takase.

268
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:27,434
The time is 8:01 pm.

269
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:30,234
And three hours later...

270
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:35,034
He's leaving the restaurant after 11 pm.

271
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,134
What? He has an alibi?

272
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,434
Yes, sir.

273
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,334
We were able to confirm that he was at a bar in Nebada

274
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,734
from 8 pm to 11 pm, just like he said.

275
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,134
I see.

276
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:01,234
I told you so.

277
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,734
I didn't do it.

278
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:08,334
It seems that way. I'm sorry.

279
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,334
But then who did?

280
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:14,334
How would I know?

281
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:19,134
Isn't it your job to figure that out? Right?

282
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,034
Mr. Inspector.

283
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,734
Well, I'm leaving now.

284
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:30,334
Good luck with your job.

285
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,034
Wait a minute.

286
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,534
Megure here.

287
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,434
What? A fire at the Kadowaki family residence?

288
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,234
I don't believe it.

289
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:54,934
It's completely destroyed.

290
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:58,534
What about them? Where's the Kadowaki family?

291
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,934
Over there.

292
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,734
They're at that ambulance.

293
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,734
Yuichi.

294
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,034
You're all right.

295
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,434
What about your mother?

296
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,334
They just took her away.

297
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,434
They're going to determine the cause of death.

298
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,134
Mrs. Kadowaki...

299
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:32,834
So that was your destiny.

300
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,134
Hey, what's so funny?

301
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:43,234
Darn it.

302
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:52,134
Sometimes there's nothing you can do.

303
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,734
Well, inspector, I'll be leaving now.

304
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,334
Yuichi.

305
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,534
I'm terribly sorry to ask at this time,

306
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,134
but could you tell us what happened?

307
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:13,334
For your late mother's sake, too.

308
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:14,334
All right.

309
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:17,534
"Haido West Third Street Police Box"

310
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,134
When the fire broke out,

311
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:22,534
I was sleeping in my room on the second floor.

312
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:25,634
Perhaps it's because I'd been questioned by the police,

313
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:27,234
but I had a terrible headache.

314
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,334
So by the time I realized something was amiss,

315
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,634
it was a sea of fire.

316
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,534
Mom! Are you there, mom?

317
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:42,234
It was all I could do to save myself.

318
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,934
It may be a coincidence,

319
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,934
but I can't believe he lost his mother right after his brother.

320
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,534
About that...

321
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:58,034
Yuichi, can you think of anyone who might have resented you

322
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:00,034
and the rest of the Kadowaki family?

323
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:06,834
Another one of your family members died today.

324
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:10,934
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

325
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,334
He's not wrong.

326
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,434
But, inspector...

327
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,634
It's a possibility. We should confirm it.

328
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,834
Yes, but...

329
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,034
Well, Yuichi?

330
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:26,934
No. I can't think of anyone like that.

331
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,034
I know what he said,

332
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,334
but check out everyone associated

333
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,034
with the Kadowaki family tomorrow.

334
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:42,034
See if anyone hated that family.

335
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,034
Yes, sir.

336
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:46,634
What is it, Mouri?

337
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:48,134
You don't like it?

338
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:51,634
No, that's not it.

339
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:54,534
In any case, inspector, we should get going.

340
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:56,734
-All right. -Let's go, kid.

341
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:58,034
Okay.

342
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,134
That Takase guy definitely did it.

343
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:05,334
What? But when the fire happened...

344
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,234
The fire is unrelated.

345
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:10,534
I'm talking about Eiji's murder.

346
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:15,134
That fire was just an unfortunate coincidence.

347
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:18,834
It's true that his behavior was unnatural.

348
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:22,434
He wasn't surprised at all that the police suddenly showed up.

349
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:26,134
Or when he heard Eiji Kadowaki was murdered.

350
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:29,734
What? Her son was killed?

351
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:32,334
It seemed so deliberate.

352
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,034
Yeah.

353
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:39,734
He knew that Eiji had been murdered.

354
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,234
Most likely, yes.

355
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,134
"Nebada Brewery"

356
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,034
"Three Hours 3,330 yen All You Can Eat and Drink! Nebada Brewery"

357
00:21:58,034 --> 00:21:59,934
"Nebada Brewery"

358
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:02,834
But he has an alibi.

359
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:07,634
He was taken off the suspect list as a result.

360
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:11,134
He must've used some kind of trick.

361
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:17,234
I, Kogoro Mouri, swear on my name that I'll expose him.

362
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:21,834
But I don't think the Kadowaki family residence fire

363
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,934
was a total coincidence.

364
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:29,534
But if that's true, then these two cases...

365
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:32,034
How in the world are they connected?

366
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,634
"Next Episode"

367
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,934
9:08 pm to 10:35 pm.

368
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:01,434
That's about an hour and a half.

369
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:06,034
You were just saying how I could've killed him, too, weren't you?

370
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:09,234
What proof do you have that I did it?

371
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,834
You get in trouble at school, too?

372
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,234
What?

373
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,734
So that's how it is.

374
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,934
Which means the fire...

375
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,534
Next Conan,

376
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:24,234
"The Mystery-Solving Water Taxi (Part 2)"

377
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,977
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:29,377
"Fireworks"

379
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:31,377
-These two cases... -There's just no connection between them.

380
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:32,377
As if obscured by smoke...

381
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:33,777
The truth is hazy.
