1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:03,424
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:05,224
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:07,824
The relationship between master and apprentice has been broken.

4
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:09,824
But the story of saury will reconcile them.

5
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,224
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:12,824
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:14,624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,219
Sand and fish under the water.

9
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,319
The end of clouds and waters.

10
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,019
What we eat and where we sleep.

11
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:06,519
Where we sleep...

12
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,919
What we eat and where we sleep...

13
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,419
And where you live!

14
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,619
5-39 Beika Town!

15
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,619
I'm not talking about your home.

16
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,919
It's the next line.

17
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,519
You forgot it already?

18
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,019
It's been almost for a week.

19
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:24,919
I can't believe he still haven't memorize the lines.

20
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,219
Yabura-koji and Bura-koji.

21
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,519
Paipo, paipo.

22
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,419
Paipo, paipo!

23
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,719
Paipo, Paipo's hooligan.

24
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,619
Hooligan's Shaolin boxing.

25
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,419
It's Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

26
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,719
Shuringan's Gurindai.

27
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,719
Gurindai's Popokopi and Ponpokona.

28
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,419
Now, the name is Chokyumei Chosuke.

29
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,819
Mouri,

30
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,419
maybe you want to forget about it this time.

31
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,619
I don't think you are the kind of person to do memorization.

32
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:03,019
Don't say that, Inspector.

33
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,719
Well, I think I know why you're doing this.

34
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,019
It's about all-you-can-drink, isn't it?

35
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,519
I understand, but it's not worth embarrassing yourself.

36
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,519
Well, it's not that.

37
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,119
Mr. Mouri, are you going to the hall already?

38
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,819
You're all pumped up, aren't you?

39
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,119
"Nagaro Uwajima (50)" -The famous Detective Mouri

40
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:23,919
is going to do rakugo storytelling. People are talking about it, you know.

41
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,919
He's Nagaro Uwajima, my facilitator.

42
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,319
Did you hear that, Inspector?

43
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,819
Would you still say that I should quit rakugo storytelling?

44
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,719
All right, all right.

45
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,719
I'll teach you a story, but it's a short one,

46
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,019
so you can memorize it easily.

47
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,619
Dear! Please look ahead while you're driving.

48
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,319
There's no deer on the road.

49
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,419
Oh dear, you're talking about that deer.

50
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,219
Now, that's the right one for him.

51
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:57,419
"Meguro Saury"

52
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,619
Hey, it's Master Manrakutei Ichimatsu.

53
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,819
Master Ichimatsu, are you ready for today?

54
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,819
"Manrakutei Ichimatsu (55)" -Yes, Nagaro.

55
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,419
No worries.

56
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,019
He is my childhood friend.

57
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,719
Who was that boy earlier?

58
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,319
Well, he wanted to be my apprentice,

59
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,619
but I told him to come after graduating from school.

60
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,319
Master, tea is ready.

61
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,819
Hi, Uwajima.

62
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,919
Nagaro, why don't you have tea with us?

63
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,919
And you too, please.

64
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,019
Well, what is the master of rakugo storytelling doing here?

65
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,919
He's a helper for this restaurant.

66
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,619
A helper?

67
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,319
Who is that lady then?

68
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,719
Spring has finally come to master.

69
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,319
And now he is out from his bachelor life.

70
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,019
"Miya Meguro (30)" -What kind of fish is that?

71
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,419
It's saury.

72
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,019
That's a lot of saury.

73
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,819
I get it.

74
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,319
Master, your storytelling for today is "Meguro Saury", isn't it?

75
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,719
Yes.

76
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,819
Your "Meguro Saury" is amazing.

77
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,819
People are going to come here to eat saury after your performance.

78
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,919
That's what it's for, isn't it?

79
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,619
Hey, what is "Meguro Saury"?

80
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,219
"Meguro Saury" is a rakugo story.

81
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,919
Long ago, there was a king who was brought up protected from the world.

82
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,519
One day, he went out to Meguro to hunt birds.

83
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,819
There, a farmer served him a meal which was a saury,

84
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,119
which he had never eaten before in his life.

85
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,519
Being so impressed with its taste,

86
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,119
the king ordered a saury again when he went to a different place.

87
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,819
However, the saury that was served

88
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,919
was mealy and flaky because his servant steamed and broke it into flakes

89
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,919
to make it safe and healthy to eat.

90
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,019
Since the saury tasted so different,

91
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,719
the king asked what kind of saury it was.

92
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:52,319
"It was saury that just landed in Boshu", said the servant.

93
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,019
And then, the king said...

94
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,719
-"Meguro Saury is the best!" -"Meguro Saury is the best!"

95
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,119
What happened?

96
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,119
It hurts...

97
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,519
I think I cut my finger with the broken cup.

98
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,319
You're bleeding!

99
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
Hey, I'm alright.

100
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,819
People are watching us.

101
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,619
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,919
You're going to be on stage tonight.

103
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,819
You have to take care of yourself.

104
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,919
Thank you for the tea, Miya.

105
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,519
Master, the party after the show is at Meruhen at 7 o'clock, okay?

106
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,019
All right. Meruhen at 7 o'clock, I got it.

107
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,719
Okay, we're going to head to the hall now.

108
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,519
She is the wife of Master Ichimatsu's apprentice?

109
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,719
Yes. His name is Manrakutei Kisaburo.

110
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,019
He is a famous rakugo storyteller, right?

111
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,319
She's his wife?

112
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,419
She's actually divorced with that man

113
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,219
and Master Ichimatsu is looking after her now.

114
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:03,819
This is just my guess,

115
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:08,019
but it looks like Master Ichimatsu has been helping her out financially.

116
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,919
What a gentleman he is.

117
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,019
Well, I'm more worried about him because she might just be using him.

118
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,719
What do you mean by that?

119
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,819
How could a wife be intimate with someone who ousted her husband?

120
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,219
People are saying that Master Ichimatsu has made a lot of money.

121
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,719
So I thought that she's getting close to him just for that.

122
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,419
Looks can be deceiving, is that what you mean?

123
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,119
I guess people are humane only in rakugo stories.

124
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,619
"Talent Show"

125
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:47,819
Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

126
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,719
Shuringan's Shuringan's...

127
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,319
The short one!

128
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,019
Change it to the short story.

129
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:56,719
Oh, okay.

130
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,619
There's no deer on the road.

131
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,119
Gosh!

132
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,319
How could he say the ending first?

133
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,919
Look ahead! Look ahead!

134
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,119
Look ahead?

135
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,619
Oh, I see!

136
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:14,819
Dear, please look ahead while you're driving.

137
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,419
There's no deer on the road.

138
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,119
Master Ichimatsu, please.

139
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,119
Okay.

140
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,919
So, how did it go, Mr. Mouri?

141
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,319
I didn't know I was that talented.

142
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:35,919
You should've seen the way people were laughing.

143
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,119
They were laughing at you, not your story.

144
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,119
Is that right?

145
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,219
Maybe you should teach me how to do rakugo storytelling?

146
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,419
Is this a saury?

147
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,719
Tell me where you bought it.

148
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:00,119
It is from the riverside of Nihonbashi.

149
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:04,719
I chose the freshest one, my Lord.

150
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:08,219
You dunderhead. Meguro saury is the best.

151
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:22,019
Master, we're going to drink all night!

152
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,019
Next time, I'll get the first prize!

153
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,519
Hey, hey. He's going to do it again?

154
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,919
Excuse me, my friend may be visiting me.

155
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,219
So why don't you go ahead?

156
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,919
There's some work left for me too,

157
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,119
so could you wait for me outside just a little while, please?

158
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,619
Uwajima is a busy man.

159
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,719
Looks like he's done.

160
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,319
Master, we'll head out to the party place now.

161
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,819
Sorry to keep you waiting long.

162
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,619
Where's Master Ichimatsu?

163
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:13,019
His friend hasn't come yet, so he said he'll catch up later.

164
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,219
I see.

165
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,319
This is Megure.

166
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,019
What? Master Ichimatsu has been stabbed?

167
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,519
It was an anonymous call?

168
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,719
It was a man's voice,

169
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:32,719
saying that Master Ichimatsu had been stabbed in this dressing room.

170
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,919
It's a lot of blood.

171
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,719
He was lying unconscious when he was found.

172
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,619
Is he going to make it?

173
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:40,919
I don't know.

174
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,719
What is this?

175
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,819
Megurono?

176
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,319
Isn't that about the rakugo storytelling, "Meguro Saury"?

177
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,119
He wanted to write "Meguro Saury", but he couldn't finish it.

178
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,719
Speaking of Meguro, I need you to see this.

179
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,019
Look at the handle of this knife.

180
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,019
It's kind of scraped off, but it says "Meguro".

181
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,419
Meguro...

182
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,219
Meguro Saury...

183
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:07,519
Saury Lunch...

184
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,719
Inspector Megure, I got it!

185
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,619
The culprit is...

186
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,519
Miya.

187
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,519
She's the lady at Meguro Restaurant.

188
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,119
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,319
It was me.

190
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:21,319
It was me who did it.

191
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,819
This is your knife, right?

192
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,219
Yes.

193
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,119
But why did you do it?

194
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,419
Let me explain instead.

195
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:32,919
You had some financial trouble.

196
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,719
You owed Master Ichimatsu money,

197
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,519
but if you kill him, you don't have to pay it back.

198
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,719
Wasn't that what you thought?

199
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,419
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,619
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

201
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:46,719
To the station, please.

202
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,019
Wait a minute!

203
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:49,719
She didn't do anything!

204
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,419
Excuse me, who are you?

205
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,519
You are...

206
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,919
Manrakutei Kisaburo.

207
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,719
Master Ichimatsu's apprentice.

208
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,019
"Manrakutei Kisaburo (30)" -It was me who did it.

209
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,019
I'm Manrakutei Kisaburo, the one that was ousted a year ago.

210
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,219
I stole the knife from Miya's restaurant

211
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,619
and I stabbed Master Ichimatsu.

212
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,219
Why did you do that?

213
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:18,619
He may not be your master now, but at least he was before, right?

214
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,919
Inspector!

215
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,719
He is lying just to protect me.

216
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,619
It was me who did it.

217
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,919
I became pretty popular and got bigheaded.

218
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,119
So I skipped a show, had some debts gambling.

219
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:32,619
I also had some love affairs.

220
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,619
But I don't think he should have kicked me out!

221
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,119
So that's your motive?

222
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,519
That's a lie.

223
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,419
He loves rakugo storytelling more than anything.

224
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,719
He must be longing to come back on stage again.

225
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,719
Such a person wouldn't do that kind of thing.

226
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:51,219
Then how do you explain these words that master wrote?

227
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,119
"Meguro Saury."

228
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,419
It's my favourite story.

229
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:56,819
Then it's been cleared.

230
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,519
Mr. Mouri, no!

231
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,919
He didn't do anything!

232
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,819
It was me! I did it!

233
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,819
You shut up, got that?

234
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,519
These two think that the other is the culprit

235
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,919
and they're protecting each other.

236
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,419
Anyway, what's the meaning of this message?

237
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,119
Come to think of it, Master Ichimatsu said...

238
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,419
Excuse me, my friend may be visiting me.

239
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,619
So why don't you go ahead?

240
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,319
Who was the master waiting for, anyway?

241
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:40,119
Party at 7 o'clock.

242
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,419
Meruhen?

243
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,419
Wait a minute!

244
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,619
I got it!

245
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,119
That must be it!

246
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:05,411
Okay, we will find out the detailed facts in the station.

247
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,711
-Let's go, Chiba. -Yes, sir.

248
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,911
What are you doing there?

249
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:13,911
Let's go!

250
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,311
Inspector, please wait.

251
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:24,611
Those two have nothing to do with this crime at all.

252
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:30,411
Kisaburo, you visited Master Ichimatsu's dressing room.

253
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,611
Around the time when we were heading down to Restaurant Meruhen.

254
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:37,011
Probably a little before 7 o'clock.

255
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:43,011
He was already down on the floor.

256
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:46,711
And there, you found a knife that had a familiar name on it.

257
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:50,811
So you thought Miya did it. Am I right?

258
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:52,511
That's why you...

259
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:58,011
On the other hand, Miya saw Kisaburo going into this room.

260
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:05,711
As soon as he found Master Ichimatsu lying on the floor, he left the room.

261
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:13,611
When she saw this, she thought Kisaburo murdered Master Ichimatsu.

262
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,811
You saw me there? Now, I understand.

263
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:18,711
Well, what else could I think?

264
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,911
And also, I am your biggest fan.

265
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:24,811
If the police come, I thought I should...

266
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:26,411
I see.

267
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:29,211
But you really thought I killed Master?

268
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,911
How could you even think that?

269
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:33,011
Well, how could you think that I killed him, too?

270
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:36,311
I would never hurt him, ever!

271
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,311
Guys, please!

272
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,811
Mouri, who stabbed Master Ichimatsu?

273
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:47,411
Master Ichimatsu actually wrote the name of the murderer on this board.

274
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:49,911
You mean this "Megurono"?

275
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,111
This can't be a person's name.

276
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:57,111
Officer Chiba, do you see Master Ichimatsu's bag under the whiteboard?

277
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,911
Would you please take the notebook out of it?

278
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:03,311
Now, I would like you to read Master Ichimatsu's schedule for tonight.

279
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:07,611
Party at 7 o'clock.

280
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:08,611
Naruheso?

281
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:11,211
Naruheso?

282
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:14,211
What is Naruheso?

283
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,711
Yeah, it does say "Naruheso".

284
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:19,011
Now, please remember.

285
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:23,011
Master Ichimatsu cut his right finger. We saw it.

286
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:27,511
He probably used his left hand to write "Meruhen",

287
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,211
but it got deformed.

288
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:34,311
So "Meruhen" turned into "Naruheso".

289
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,911
Inspector, tilt your head to the side

290
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,711
and look at the word on the whiteboard.

291
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,711
If you tilt this letter "me", it becomes "na".

292
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:48,011
Likewise, "gu" becomes "ga".

293
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:52,011
"Ro" stays the same, but "no" could be a long vowel.

294
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,811
Now, guess what we got?

295
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:59,711
Nagaro?

296
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:04,011
Uwajima, where do you think you're going?

297
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:07,111
I got some stuff to do so.

298
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,111
Well, you need to hang out with us a little longer.

299
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:14,111
Uwajima, I think Master Ichimatsu wanted to write your name.

300
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:19,011
Yes, he wanted to tell us that you were the culprit.

301
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:20,411
Are you kidding?

302
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:21,811
When did I do it?

303
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:24,211
I didn't have enough time to do it, Mr. Mouri.

304
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,311
You know that, right?

305
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,211
Officer Chiba, please search at the hole on the ceiling.

306
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,811
All right.

307
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,611
There's a bag under the roof.

308
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,211
I asked Conan to search for it a while ago.

309
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:48,311
It showed that this room and the office are connected under the roof.

310
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,711
Now, please check what's inside.

311
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:51,711
Yes, sir.

312
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:59,411
You're selling this at your store.

313
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,411
Women usually put this doll in their room

314
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,811
so it looked like a man is with them.

315
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,811
For the sake of their own safety.

316
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,511
You actually put this by the window,

317
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:08,911
so it looked like you were doing some work.

318
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:11,811
What you were actually doing during this time,

319
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:14,311
you come into this dressing room through the space under the roof,

320
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,811
pick up a knife that you put there beforehand and killed Master.

321
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:18,811
Uwajima...

322
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:23,111
You joined us like nothing happened,

323
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,411
and headed out to Meruhen together.

324
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,611
No. That's nonsense.

325
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,911
It's not me.

326
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:28,911
Where is the evidence?

327
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:31,611
Do you have anything that proves that I stabbed him?

328
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,711
Officer Chiba, do you see the speaker on the wall?

329
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,911
Speaker?

330
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:40,511
-Yes. -Will you search around the speaker?

331
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,311
There should be a MD recorder.

332
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:45,011
A MD recorder?

333
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,411
Please take a look.

334
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,011
The power is on in order to record what is going on in the hall.

335
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:53,611
Master Ichimatsu asked me something just a while ago.

336
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:56,311
So, how did it go, Mr. Mouri?

337
00:18:56,311 --> 00:19:00,611
That means he wasn't listening to my storytelling.

338
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,711
The MD recorder wasn't on.

339
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,011
But now it is...

340
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,311
On.

341
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,011
Who turned it on?

342
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,311
Probably by somebody

343
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:13,811
who wanted to wiretap Master Ichimatsu's "Meguro Saury".

344
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:16,711
It was on the speaker.

345
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:20,711
Officer Chiba, could you please rewind and play it?

346
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:27,611
You dunderhead. Meguro saury is the best.

347
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,711
Uwajima, recorders today are not like the ones before.

348
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:37,711
It can record much, much longer.

349
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:41,611
Officer Chiba, the moment of the incident should be recorded in the tape.

350
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,511
Please fast-forward it to that part.

351
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,511
Yes, sir.

352
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:50,111
Nagaro, what are you doing? Nagaro!

353
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:54,011
Shut up! Getting conceited after being called master!

354
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:57,311
It's all because of you that Miya doesn't listen to me!

355
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,011
Stop talking nonsense!

356
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,911
Miya is waiting for Kisaburo to come back.

357
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,111
Darn it!

358
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:06,811
Please stop it!

359
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:09,211
Stop. It was me.

360
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,311
I stole the knife from Miya's restaurant

361
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,511
and I stabbed him.

362
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:28,011
Hey, kid.

363
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,711
This is master's recording tape. You can have this.

364
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:34,811
This has "Meguro Saury", so forget about your MD.

365
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:37,711
I understand that you like master's storytelling,

366
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,711
but you can never record it like that, okay?

367
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:41,411
Okay! I'm sorry!

368
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,411
Miya! Kisaburo!

369
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,111
I just got a call from the hospital.

370
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,611
They said Master is going to be fine.

371
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:54,411
But, how could you think that I stabbed Master

372
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:56,911
just because you saw me coming out of his room?

373
00:20:56,911 --> 00:21:00,511
-Yeah, because you were holding a knife in your hand. -A knife?

374
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:04,011
Conan, the knife she saw might be that.

375
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,211
Yes. I think so, too.

376
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:12,611
You brought this, right, Kisaburo?

377
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:15,111
So it was there?

378
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:16,811
It was the freshest saury I found this morning.

379
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:20,411
I got it for Master.

380
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,911
You thought this was a knife, didn't you?

381
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:27,411
It was kind of dark and you had a languishing look on your face.

382
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:32,011
You are so stupid!

383
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:34,311
How could a saury look like a knife?

384
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:36,811
Come on, guys.

385
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:39,211
In Japanese, you write "autumn", "sword" and "fish",

386
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:40,511
and you read it as "saury".

387
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,611
It's understandable that you made the mistake.

388
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:46,311
Now, no need to worry about Master Ichimatsu.

389
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:50,011
Why don't you eat that saury together, like you used to do before?

390
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:52,311
Well, I wouldn't mind that.

391
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,011
Me neither.

392
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:57,011
But we have to go and see Master first.

393
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:01,611
Why don't you ask him to let you work as his apprentice again?

394
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,511
You think he'll forgive me?

395
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:05,711
He will,

396
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:09,211
because he's been waiting for you to come back.

397
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:39,111
I was daydreaming again.

398
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:49,311
Conan, you're crying because of my story, aren't you?

399
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,211
Storytelling usually gets kids bored and sleepy, but mine doesn't.

400
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:56,611
I think that tells how good I am.

401
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:58,311
I'm not sleeping

402
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,411
because you're sitting where I'm supposed to be sleeping.

403
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,211
"Next Episode"

404
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,611
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

405
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,411
The sign looks like a haunted house

406
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,811
which you really like!

407
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,711
Somebody's trying to kill you?

408
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:21,911
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

409
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,311
It looked that way to me, too!

410
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:24,311
Wait!

411
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:34,511
Next Conan, "Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

412
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:52,511
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:55,011
"Evil Message"

414
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,311
What? Next week,

415
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:59,111
the two detectives are going to do an hour show?
