00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,040
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,940
Although I've kept you worrying all this time,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,240
since I've changed back to my original self this year,

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,140
I will solve case after case

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,240
as a high school detective from now on...

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,140
Just what do you think you're doing?

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,640
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
I with my childhood friend, Ran...

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,640
Hey!

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,340
What?

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,640
Oh, no...

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,240
Thief Kid's disguise as Shinichi Kudo has been disclosed.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,340
Will he be able to safely make it through?

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Or will he be beat up by her fist?

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,340
Watch what happens on the website.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,740
"No, you can't!"

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,340
Let me try again.

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,740
Happy New Year...

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,140
Thanks to all you viewers out there,

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,540
we did great on TV as well as in the movies last year.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,740
At the end of the year,

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,240
the movie in which we collaborated with the thief was shown.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,040
It was a very good year!

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,340
And this year...

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,440
Congratulations to the 20th anniversary

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,040
of the Detective Conan series...

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,440
Therefore, we, the cast of this series

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,940
will sharpen up even more,

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,940
so we hope for your never changing continued support...

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,140
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,140
are slashed by the light of deduction.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,940
The sparkling red diamond that Kid goes after.

33
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,940
Solve the mystery of the gorgeous and elegant trick.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,240
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:43,753
"Thief Kid and the Blushed Mermaid (Part 1)"

38
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:47,553
Due to the auspices of Advisor Jirokichi's

39
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,353
to capture Thief Kid,

40
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:53,353
he decides to specially run the Bell Tree Express.

41
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:57,053
However, in order to kill Sherry, alias Ai Haibara,

42
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,953
the men in black raid the train.

43
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:03,353
The train is blown up.

44
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,753
Thief Kid who had snuck onto the train to look around it beforehand,

45
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,653
also gets messed up in the incident.

46
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:12,353
Just what do you mean, Superintendent Chaki?

47
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,053
Because of the Bell Tree Express explosion incident the other day,

48
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:18,453
wasn't the gem exhibition supposed to be postponed

49
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:20,653
until the explosion incident is solved?

50
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,753
We did this because Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki

51
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,453
strongly wanted to go through with it.

52
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,653
I think because he got hold of gems

53
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:29,053
that would serve as good bait to catch Thief Kid,

54
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,053
he didn't want to waste the opportunity.

55
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,253
Well, we, the police have also attained

56
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,653
an opportunity to nab Kid too.

57
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,253
But...

58
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:40,753
if that explosion was carried out

59
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:44,253
to get in the way of exhibiting the gems,

60
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:46,353
won't they repeat what they did again?

61
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,453
Nothing about the truth of the case

62
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,153
has been grasped yet, you know!

63
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:53,753
Of course, it's unthinkable that Kid would try to get involved

64
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,653
in such a dangerous case again.

65
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:58,553
Wrong, it seems that Kid already sent

66
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:01,253
a forewarning of the crime to the advisor.

67
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:05,853
He said that he'd come for the gem on the day it is premiered.

68
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:10,953
He left a message for the police

69
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:13,053
saying to check every nook and cranny,

70
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:15,753
so that the exhibition hall wouldn't be blown up this time.

71
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:20,953
Furthermore, the time of which the gems can be exhibited

72
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,353
seem to be limited.

73
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,853
Only for a limited period?

74
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:30,253
That rich man couldn't possibly be renting the gems and yet.

75
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,753
Come to think of it,

76
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:34,953
he hasn't shown us the real gem yet, has he?

77
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:38,253
No. He did tell me that he was going to exhibit it

78
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,953
inside a large glass case, though.

79
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:45,153
According to the advisor, that gem...

80
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:52,253
moves around freely inside that glass case.

81
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:55,053
Moves around?

82
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,553
Why is that?

83
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,153
"Suzuki Museum"

84
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,353
Well, hear me... ladies and gentlemen!

85
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:06,253
Here I have a can of coke!

86
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,253
As you can see it is squashed,

87
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:11,353
and there is nothing inside already.

88
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:14,653
With my psychic power...

89
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,553
It's back to normal.

90
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:26,453
Of course if I rub it like this with my finger,

91
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,053
the pull tab also revives.

92
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,753
Huh? No joke.

93
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,353
Coke is also inside too.

94
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:33,953
You're great, Sonoko!

95
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:36,253
-You're good! -Hey... how'd you do it?

96
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,253
Tell me!

97
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,053
No way. If things go as planned,

98
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:42,453
I'm planning to show this to Thief Kid tonight

99
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,753
and surprise him, you see.

100
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:47,253
I don't think he'd be surprised at all.

101
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,253
Because see...

102
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:52,653
there's a black seal on your finger, Sonoko.

103
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,253
It's stuck on.

104
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:58,853
Besides two small holes are left on that can too.

105
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,553
Huh?

106
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,253
True!

107
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:06,553
Sonoko probably after removing half of the coke

108
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,953
from the hole that she opened with a drill,

109
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:13,453
squashed the can and covered the hole up with glue.

110
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,553
After that, to make it look as if the mouth of the can was opened,

111
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:19,753
stuck a black seal over it.

112
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:20,953
I get it!

113
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,853
If she shakes the can vigorously

114
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:25,953
when she wants to show that the can is completely empty,

115
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:29,053
the coke will foam because of carbonic acid gas,

116
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:30,253
and with the pressure from the gas,

117
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,953
the squashed can will return to its original state.

118
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,753
Then if she rubs the month of the can with her finger

119
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,353
and peels the seal off,

120
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,253
it will look as if the coke can completely returned

121
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,753
to its original state, right, Conan?

122
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:44,453
Yep... I saw this magic on TV the other day, you see.

123
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:47,753
Ran, why'd you bring that cheeky brat along?

124
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,753
But, Uncle Jirokichi's the one who invited him, right?

125
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:56,053
Saying that he wanted Conan over because he's a Kid killer.

126
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,853
I'm more surprised about Sera.

127
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,953
Huh?

128
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:02,953
You didn't seem a bit interested about Kid, and yet.

129
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:04,953
It's not that I'm not interested.

130
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:07,253
With Holmes had Professor Moriarty,

131
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,253
to Kogoro Akechi had the 20 faced monster,

132
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:14,353
it's natural for a detective to have a mysterious rival.

133
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:17,753
Besides, I wanted to ask you about this hat

134
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:20,153
that you picked up in the Bell Tree Express too.

135
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:24,453
Huh? I found it on the floor of the corridor.

136
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,253
Then, did you see him?

137
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:28,953
A man wearing black clothes and a black hat

138
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,053
with a burn on the right cheek of his face...

139
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:33,053
Oh! Shiro's daughter!

140
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:34,553
I'm sorry about what happened

141
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,953
on board the Bell Tree Express the other day.

142
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,953
Look at all this hustle and bustle!

143
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:47,053
Just as would be expected of Thief Kid's popularity!

144
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:48,453
While we're at it,

145
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:51,153
why don't we go take a look at the other exhibition rooms?

146
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:52,653
Yes, sir!

147
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,853
That's terrific!

148
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:14,753
There's a lot of people around the glass case.

149
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,853
I mean, isn't that...

150
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:18,353
An aquarium?

151
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:20,153
Hey... don't tell me that...

152
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:21,853
That's right!

153
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,253
The thing that he's after is...

154
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,553
The gem that this turtle is carrying on its back,

155
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:32,553
the red diamond, the Blushed Mermaid!

156
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,553
Where...

157
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:38,753
True!

158
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:41,553
There's a gold necklace and all attached to its back!

159
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:45,853
There seems to be a lot of gems on its belly too, though.

160
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,253
You mean you tried to exhibit

161
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,553
this approximately ten centimeter fully decorated turtle

162
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,453
on board the first class compartment of the Bell Tree Express?

163
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:54,053
Exactly!

164
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:57,953
The aquarium is made of hard glass.

165
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:01,853
Beyond is a concrete wall two meters thick.

166
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,553
The ceiling and walls on both sides

167
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,653
are made of special alloy.

168
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:09,853
Furthermore, if the prey swims around in the water,

169
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:12,353
so even the so-called Moonlight Magician

170
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:14,553
shouldn't be able to steal it.

171
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:17,053
It's gruesomely of bad taste.

172
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,553
The animal protection league's

173
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,853
probably gonna come down on his head.

174
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:25,553
The fact is this turtle has a shady history behind it.

175
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:27,153
You know about it, don't you?

176
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:30,353
The great Italian actress who died

177
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,553
in a marine disaster six months ago?

178
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:35,053
This turtle is said to be Poseidon,

179
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,953
the turtle that she owned.

180
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:39,453
Poseidon?

181
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:40,553
That's right.

182
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:44,653
She was the owner of the Blushed Mermaid, you see.

183
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:47,653
But, why would she attach gems on a pet?

184
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,053
I heard that just before the ship sank,

185
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,953
she desperately glued the gems onto the turtle,

186
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:53,153
hoping that the turtle would be saved

187
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,253
and taken in by somebody.

188
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:58,753
It was a token of her gratitude

189
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,753
as well as money for turtle food.

190
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:03,353
A local fishermen found it afloat on the sea,

191
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:04,953
along with the aquarium and all.

192
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:09,353
And for some lucky reason, it fell into my hands.

193
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,653
But did you have the gems properly appraised?

194
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:17,153
Yeah, but while appraising the gems,

195
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:20,053
the appraiser as bitten by the turtle.

196
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,453
Well, it seems that turtles shed

197
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,353
during the months of May to November,

198
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,853
so I was actually waiting for the gems to come off naturally

199
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,853
after the turtle shed,

200
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:31,653
and then have the gems appraised.

201
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:33,753
But, I just couldn't wait.

202
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,353
I see.

203
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:38,153
So he wanted to have it out with Kid

204
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,653
while the turtle still had the gems on its body.

205
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:43,953
Hey! That's it for viewing the exhibitions!

206
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,953
All people other than authorized personnel leave this room!

207
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,453
Stop dilly-dallying,

208
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:53,253
hurry and get out of here!

209
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,253
Who is he?

210
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:58,653
Inspector Nakamori of the second investigation division of MPD.

211
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,153
Second investigation division?

212
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,153
Yep. It seems that he specializes

213
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:04,953
with cases having to do with Thief Kid.

214
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,253
Yes...

215
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,153
He's always around when Sir Kid's involved.

216
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:14,053
So, he's the guy that's always being outwitted by Kid?

217
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,053
It's hurt...

218
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:17,553
Hey, boy! Didn't you hear me?

219
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:18,653
I ordered everybody but authorized personnel

220
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,353
to get out of here, didn't I?

221
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,753
Oh, no, Inspector Nakamori.

222
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:25,453
Ms. Sera here is in the same high school as I am...

223
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,353
Besides, she's not a boy.

224
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:29,353
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

225
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:32,453
I just met the inspector for the first time today, you see.

226
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,353
Moreover, I'm sure he pinched my cheek

227
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,053
to confirm whether I was Kid in disguise.

228
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:39,053
Right?

229
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,653
She kicked his balls.

230
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:44,653
She sure is a user of martial arts.

231
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,753
Seeing that you're cold sweating,

232
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:50,453
it seems that you're not in disguise either, eh, Inspector.

233
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,053
Hi there, Ran!

234
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,653
Dad! I thought you weren't coming?

235
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:57,653
Well, I was watching the news you see,

236
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,753
and I couldn't stop myself from not coming.

237
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:03,253
Well, of course I was sort of worried about you too.

238
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:05,753
Sort of?

239
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,953
He's the last thing I need.

240
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,053
Just after I got the customers to all get out of here,

241
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:13,653
why do I have to let these amateurs watch all this?

242
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:17,253
You all stay put in the rear, okay?

243
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,753
Yes, sir!

244
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:22,153
Okay, so I'll go use the restroom now,

245
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,753
since there's still 30 minutes to go before he shows up.

246
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,953
Oh, the restroom near here was crowded,

247
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,453
so I think it's better if you go to the one upstairs!

248
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,553
Roger!

249
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,853
Hey, you say it's crowded,

250
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,553
but when did you go to the restroom, Sonoko?

251
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:37,253
When I was going around inside this building.

252
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:38,853
Didn't you notice?

253
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:39,953
Nope.

254
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:58,453
Kid...

255
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:01,853
Listen to that call for Kid.

256
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,053
Yep.

257
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,553
How many minutes more are there to go

258
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,353
before Sir Kid arrives?

259
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,453
Let's see.

260
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,553
Huh?

261
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,953
Geez, what tight security.

262
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:19,353
Yeah, this time, its perfect.

263
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:22,953
Including the 20 men on the second floor corridor,

264
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:25,453
we've got 100 armed men with searchlights

265
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,753
waiting in the passageway on the second floor with shining eyes.

266
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:31,253
Moreover, the lights have batteries attached to them.

267
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:34,553
There's no way they'll go out.

268
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:39,253
In other words, Kid won't be able to steal in the dark

269
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,153
even though he's good at it.

270
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:53,953
-What? -No way!

271
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,553
Outta the way!

272
00:14:56,953 --> 00:14:59,053
What?

273
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,653
He hid the aquarium!

274
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:05,053
Is he planning to take the aquarium, carpet and all?

275
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:09,053
-Darn. -Three, two, one.

276
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:17,153
Sonoko, Sera, are you okay?

277
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:18,953
Where's the gem?

278
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,753
No joke.

279
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:26,253
It's nowhere in sight.

280
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:29,253
But there's a card in the aquarium.

281
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:34,253
The shy mermaid vanished in foam and is now in my hands.

282
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,853
Thief Kid.

283
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,453
What the...

284
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,253
It can't be...

285
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,053
How'd he do a feat like that

286
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,853
under these circumstances?

287
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,129
The gem vanished along with the turtle?

288
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,229
That can't be!

289
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,229
Look for it!

290
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:04,029
It's got to be somewhere in this aquarium!

291
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,129
Behind the rocks or inside the gravel!

292
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,229
Yes, sir!

293
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,729
This is...

294
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,929
Thief Kid's...

295
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,429
What?

296
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,129
What does it say?

297
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,529
I got a hold of the gem...

298
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:25,729
It says that if I don't believe it, to confirm.

299
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:27,829
What?

300
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,829
Unlock the wire net of the aquarium this minute!

301
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,429
Get the ladder ready!

302
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:35,029
I'll check it out myself!

303
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,029
How about it, uncle?

304
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,629
Uncle!

305
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:53,729
Is it there or not? Which is it?

306
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:57,929
No good...

307
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,629
It's nowhere.

308
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:02,029
That's ridiculous.

309
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,729
Darn!

310
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,729
Stay out...

311
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,329
Don't come in!

312
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,929
Get back...

313
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,029
"Thief Kid got the treasure!"

314
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:24,929
Kid...

315
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,929
Darn! How dare the cheer a perp on.

316
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:31,129
I guess it can't be helped!

317
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:33,929
The aquarium is made of hard glass.

318
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,429
Besides, on the ceiling and both sides of the aquarium,

319
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:39,829
a special alloy wire net was used to cover it and yet,

320
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:42,329
while it was blinded from view with the carpet,

321
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,629
the decorated turtle carrying the gem on its back

322
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:48,029
was perfectly stolen.

323
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:52,629
You... why do you know so much in detail about the aquarium?

324
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:55,329
I heard it on the news!

325
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,529
But wasn't this a little too well done?

326
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,829
-Huh... -A transparent fishing line

327
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,729
was attached to the carpet and it was pulled up.

328
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:06,029
To think that a winch was rigged onto the lighting of the ceiling.

329
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,429
Didn't you check it?

330
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:11,829
Oh, no, sir.

331
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,429
Since we were told that the carpet

332
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,729
and the lighting were changed a few days

333
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,929
before the aquarium was set up here.

334
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,629
What? A few days ago?

335
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:23,729
Since there was a customer who spilled coke all over the carpet,

336
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,229
I had the carpet changed,

337
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,129
but, the interior furnishing employee who came to do that,

338
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:30,729
asked me if I didn't want to change the lighting

339
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:32,529
to match the color of the carpet.

340
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,929
Since I was moving the other artworks

341
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,529
in this room into another room

342
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,529
in order to make space to exhibit the aquarium,

343
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,829
I figured that changing the interior wasn't a bad idea,

344
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:46,329
so I went for his proposal,

345
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:47,629
but on second thought,

346
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,929
the twosome that came from the interior finishing company

347
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,429
maybe were...

348
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,329
What do you mean maybe?

349
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:56,529
They were Kid and his accomplice!

350
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,629
It's so obvious that this is the exhibition room!

351
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:01,629
You really got no balls.

352
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:04,129
Complaining about bygones at this point.

353
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:06,029
What the...

354
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:08,829
Well, I guess we were beat this time,

355
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,129
so let's move everything out of here...

356
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:15,229
He's not here already anyway...

357
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:16,729
Maybe he just wants to make it look that way,

358
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:20,129
although he's still in this exhibition room?

359
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,329
What?

360
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:25,729
Because Thief Kid always works in the dark

361
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,329
or vanishes in smoke, right?

362
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,429
But, this time the lights were left on,

363
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,429
and he hasn't even shown himself yet.

364
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:38,229
If Kid really took the gem along with the turtle,

365
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,629
he should still be in here.

366
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:43,129
The riot police who were guarding the doors

367
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,629
didn't make any funny moves either.

368
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:48,329
If so, I'd like to pinch the faces

369
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,729
of everyone who is here like I just did yours

370
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:54,729
to confirm whether Kid is under disguise as someone else.

371
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:57,729
I feel sorry pinching girls,

372
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,529
so why don't we get into several groups

373
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:02,529
and body check each other?

374
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,429
Body check?

375
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,929
I'll bet that Kid would still have the turtle

376
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,229
with the gem attached to it, even now.

377
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:12,129
Right, Conan?

378
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,529
Yep.

379
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,029
I guess so.

380
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,729
Huh? Is it okay?

381
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:21,529
If I join your group for the body check?

382
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,929
Of course.

383
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,129
I'll check you from head to toe.

384
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,329
Then, who shall we begin with?

385
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,229
Let's start from chronological order of our ages,

386
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,629
so check me first.

387
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:32,929
Chronological order of our ages?

388
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,929
What month were you born, Sera?

389
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,929
I mean how do you know what day we were born?

390
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,529
Well, Sera is a detective, you know.

391
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,729
But, talk about flat boobs...

392
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,029
I'm really sensitive there.

393
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,829
Shut up, be quiet!

394
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,629
I don't get it.

395
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,129
All sides were surrounded by hard glass,

396
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,329
plus the ceiling and both sides

397
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:10,929
were covered with special alloy.

398
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:12,429
Just how on earth could he have stolen it

399
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,929
in such a short time

400
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,529
when the aquarium was blinded from view with that carpet?

401
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,129
Search good and hard!

402
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:21,329
Kid's card was in the aquarium!

403
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,829
It could be that Kid is hiding somewhere too.

404
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:26,829
No.

405
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:30,829
The trick of putting the card in the aquarium is easy.

406
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:31,829
All that needs to be done is to roll the card up

407
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:34,029
and tie it with a string that melts in the water.

408
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,129
Then pull the fishing line

409
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,929
that is tied to the string through the card,

410
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,229
put a pebble at the tip of the line.

411
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:42,229
And hang it on to the lighting.

412
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:45,929
Then if it is rigged to fall using a remote controller,

413
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,329
the card that had fallen will go through the wired net,

414
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:50,729
while the string melts in the water

415
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:54,029
and the card opens up, displaying the message on the card.

416
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,329
Well, if it were Sera, Sonoko, Pops and Inspector Nakamori,

417
00:21:58,329 --> 00:21:59,329
who were able to get near the aquarium

418
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,429
after they got wrapped up in the carpet?

419
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,329
And if it were somebody among the riot police

420
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:06,329
that were standing in front of the aquarium to begin with,

421
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:09,829
they would've probably been able to directly put the card inside.

422
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,229
But back then...

423
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,629
the one who made the most suspicious move was...

424
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:26,029
Ran.

425
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,429
-"Next Episode" -Hey! Undress yourself!

426
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:54,429
Huh?

427
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:56,329
Hey! How is it over on that side?

428
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:58,229
We've finished checking on this side too!

429
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,829
Sonoko?

430
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,929
Are you all right, Sonoko?

431
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,329
I'm fine.

432
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:05,329
I just felt a bit faint

433
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,929
because everyone here is so off the point.

434
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,329
There's just one person here

435
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:12,129
that didn't go through a body check.

436
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:14,529
It's you! Thief Kid!

437
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,529
Next Conan,

438
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:21,529
"Thief Kid and the Blushed Mermaid (Part 2)"

439
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,629
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:41,829
"Magnet"

441
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:43,229
I'm not appearing too much in this episode, great detective.

442
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:45,029
You're appearing under disguise, aren't you?

443
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:46,429
I wonder about that.
