1
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.258
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:06.378
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.378 --> 00:00:10.128
Summer! Ocean! Beach!
Beware of water accidents!

4
00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:11.968
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:13.928
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:16.058
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.071
"The White Sandy Beach Murder Case."

8
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:10.101
It's so pretty...

9
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:11.221
Yeah.

10
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.751
And there are so few people...

11
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.461
We found a nice place, thanks to Dad!

12
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.211
Yeah, huh?

13
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.091
More like thanks to
him taking the wrong road...

14
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:32.391
That hits the spot!

15
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:37.181
And then the next case I solved was...

16
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:37.941
Miss...

17
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.891
Huh? Bartender, where's
that girl who was drinking here?

18
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:45.061
She left a long time ago.

19
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.531
She did?

20
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.491
Dad! I knew you'd be here!

21
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:56.391
Oh, Ran and Conan!
Perfect timing! Come and sit down!

22
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:59.461
Bartender! Another beer and two juices!

23
00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:02.971
That's okay! We're all leaving now!

24
00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:06.101
What? I haven't had enough to drink yet.

25
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.891
What're you talking about?!
It's past 10:00 already!

26
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.221
Wouldn't it be lame
for the great Mori Kogoro

27
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.641
to get wasted in a place like this?

28
00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:19.061
Yeah, that is true.

29
00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:22.491
He's so easy to manipulate.

30
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.451
Umm, are you the famous
detective, Mori Kogoro-san?

31
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:29.661
Yes, that's right.

32
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.391
This is amazing!

33
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:36.311
Could you sit with us and
tell us about your exploits?!

34
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.121
It'll be our treat!

35
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.521
Oh, that'd be great!

36
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.391
Come on, Dad!

37
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:44.091
Quit that!

38
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:47.521
We were having drinks as friends here!

39
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:51.141
Famous detective or not,
to be frank, you'd be a pest!

40
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.101
Hey! Tanaka!

41
00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:55.891
Dad, let's go.

42
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:57.641
Yeah...

43
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.561
I'm sorry! He seems to be drunk!

44
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:02.271
Creep.

45
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.561
Tanaka-san!

46
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:11.581
Tanaka-san!
Have you seen Mitsuko?!

47
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:13.681
Yamada Tomoko Sekine Mitsuko's friend
We made plans for an hour ago,

48
00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:15.601
but she never showed up,
Yamada Tomoko Sekine Mitsuko's friend

49
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.791
and she's not at home!
Yamada Tomoko Sekine Mitsuko's friend

50
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:19.561
Dunno. Haven't seen her.

51
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:22.751
Besides, she and I have
nothing to do with each other.

52
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.051
Could you leave?

53
00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:38.141
I don't feel so good...

54
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:41.351
This is a hangover,
if I ever had one...

55
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.611
Dad!

56
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:45.691
Over here!

57
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:48.151
The water's nice!
You should swim!

58
00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:51.491
I feel sick! Swim all you want!

59
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:56.221
There you have it!
So let's swim by ourselves!

60
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:57.311
Okay!

61
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:02.391
Oh, yeah! I hear it gets a lot
deeper really fast, so be careful!

62
00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:03.931
Okay!

63
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:01.851
So, were you the first to find her?

64
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.771
No, they were the
ones who first found her...

65
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:10.691
This rope...

66
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:12.521
That hurt!

67
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:15.411
Hey, you! Don't scamper
around and get in the police's way!

68
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:22.331
Pardon the late introduction.
I'm Mori Kogoro, a private detective.

69
00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:26.881
Mori... You mean
the famous detective?!

70
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:34.891
Yes! The fact I'm known this far
away puts me at a loss for words!

71
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.101
Whatever. You're not at a loss at all.

72
00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:41.521
Mitsuko!

73
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:42.771
Mitsuko?

74
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:48.441
You know the victim, Miss?

75
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:53.901
Yes, she's Sekine Mitsuko.
My best friend.

76
00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:56.191
I can't believe this would happen...

77
00:06:57.391 --> 00:06:59.241
Excuse me, Detective.

78
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:01.141
Sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:07:01.141 --> 00:07:02.711
Oh, you're...

80
00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:05.641
We meet again.

81
00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:07.971
Oh? You know each other?

82
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.641
No, we just happened to meet once.

83
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:12.351
Oh, I see.

84
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:17.891
In that case, this is Dr. Tanaka.
I asked him to examine the body.

85
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:19.931
He's the most skilled doctor in town!

86
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:22.471
It's a real honor.

87
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:27.351
And this is the famous
detective, Mori Kogoro-san!

88
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:28.861
Your reputation precedes you.

89
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:34.451
If it's not too much to ask,
I'd love to have your help on this case.

90
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:39.641
I have no objections.

91
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:43.601
That's great to hear!
After all, this is a quiet little town!

92
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:46.601
We're not used
to incidents like this at all!

93
00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.381
Umm, shouldn't
I begin my examination?

94
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:51.591
Oh, right! I forgot!

95
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.611
Then I'll get started.

96
00:07:58.181 --> 00:07:59.601
Pardon me.

97
00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:10.311
Well, Doctor?

98
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:15.241
Hmm... I can't say anything for
sure until we get to the hospital,

99
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:18.201
but this may have been a suicide.

100
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:19.911
Suicide?!

101
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:24.721
See? There are no external
injuries or signs of a struggle at all.

102
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:27.721
If it had been a murder,
there would've been a fight

103
00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:30.881
as the killer tried
to throw her into the sea.

104
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:34.591
Yet, she doesn't have
a single scratch on her.

105
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:38.551
Oh, I see! You're absolutely right!

106
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:43.021
She probably rowed out
to sea in a boat or something,

107
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:47.481
tied the rock to her feet,
and drowned herself.

108
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.061
What's with this guy?

109
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.811
He says he can't say much
before going to the hospital,

110
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:55.441
but it's like he's trying to force
the idea she committed suicide.

111
00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:59.601
Though, that's only my guess for now.

112
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:02.161
Now, if you'll please
take the body to the hospital...

113
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.271
I'll come with you.

114
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:08.171
Murderer...

115
00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:13.251
Mitsuko wouldn't
commit suicide! He killed her!

116
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:20.891
Are you saying
that doctor is a murderer?

117
00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:21.931
That's right!

118
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.601
Do you have any sort of proof?

119
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:27.141
I have no proof! But,

120
00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:30.141
he and Mitsuko had been dating!

121
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.931
But he didn't seem to act that way...

122
00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:41.771
He even promised to marry her,

123
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:44.791
but then got engaged to the daughter
of the head of a major hospital!

124
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:47.161
Mitsuko was in the way, so...

125
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:49.931
Even now, he pretended not to know her!

126
00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:54.881
Isn't it strange he didn't even
flinch after his girlfriend died?!

127
00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:57.341
Yes, that is suspicious.

128
00:09:57.971 --> 00:09:59.561
Exactly.

129
00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:03.971
He tried to force the idea of
suicide in his examination just now,

130
00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:10.181
and, judging from the body's condition,
it's very likely he killed her!

131
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:14.521
But, if so, why do something so daring

132
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:17.651
as killing her and then examining her?

133
00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:24.811
Very well, Miss. I, the great Mori Kogoro,
will reveal his true colors

134
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.621
to avenge Mitsuko-san!

135
00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:30.451
Really?! Thank you!

136
00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:34.421
Are you really sure
you can do that, old guy?

137
00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:37.381
Police Department

138
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:41.771
After my examination, it
appears she did drown to death.

139
00:10:41.771 --> 00:10:44.301
All other causes were ruled out.

140
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:49.141
Her estimated time of death
is just past 10:00 last night.

141
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:50.631
Dr. Tanaka.

142
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:51.271
Yes?

143
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:56.231
I heard something from
the victim's friend on the beach...

144
00:10:56.891 --> 00:11:02.191
Is it true that you and the victim,
Mitsuko-san, had been dating?

145
00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:07.141
Say what?! Is this true, Dr. Tanaka?!

146
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:10.911
I apologize. I should've
mentioned it at the very start.

147
00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:17.631
I hear you're marrying the
daughter of the head of a major hospital.

148
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:19.591
What about it?

149
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.511
Did that not make
Mitsuko-san an obstacle?

150
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:26.721
What are you insinuating?!

151
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:30.561
It just seems strange
for someone with a motive

152
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:34.931
to conduct an autopsy when it's
unclear if it was a murder or suicide.

153
00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:36.431
It was clearly a suicide!

154
00:11:36.431 --> 00:11:40.481
No, a lack of external injuries
isn't enough. There isn't even a will.

155
00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:47.951
Could you tell us where you
were at her estimated time of death?

156
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:56.021
Last night, I was at a bar
with a friend, from 8:00 to midnight.

157
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:59.211
Oh, yes. The place where I met you.

158
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:00.671
What?!

159
00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:07.311
By car, it'd take ten minutes
from that bar to the beach, one-way.

160
00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:12.521
If you'd like, you can check
with the owner and my friend

161
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.601
to see if I had left
my seat for that long.

162
00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:24.851
Come to think of it, just after 10:00
was when we came to get you.

163
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:25.571
What?!

164
00:12:26.061 --> 00:12:30.781
In other words, Mori-san,
you can vouch for my alibi.

165
00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:38.421
It's a perfect alibi... Is this
his source of confidence?!

166
00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:45.381
But you gave the estimated time
of death! I want a reexamination!

167
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:48.221
As you like.

168
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:53.311
But you'll have to take responsibility
when I'm proven innocent.

169
00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:54.061
Alright, then!

170
00:12:54.721 --> 00:12:57.561
Detective! Make arrangements at once!

171
00:12:57.561 --> 00:12:58.021
Right!

172
00:12:58.471 --> 00:13:03.481
Say, Detective. This might
take a long time, so can I leave?

173
00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:06.221
Oh, that would be fine.

174
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:11.971
Also, can I borrow a bicycle anywhere?
I want to explore this area!

175
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:13.491
Oh, in that case...

176
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.641
Judging from
his confident manner,

177
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:23.681
a reexamination will
probably give the same results.

178
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:26.801
There has to be some
sort of trick! Something...

179
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:33.101
I will destroy his alibi!

180
00:13:42.685 --> 00:13:45.815
Do you usually sit here
and stare at the ocean, Mister?

181
00:13:45.815 --> 00:13:46.855
Yeah.

182
00:13:46.855 --> 00:13:48.015
Yesterday, too?

183
00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:49.185
Yeah.

184
00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:51.215
Did you notice anything unusual?

185
00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:53.455
Nothing at all.

186
00:13:54.015 --> 00:13:55.685
I figured...

187
00:13:55.685 --> 00:14:01.685
The only unusual thing is
the trash that washes up every day...

188
00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:02.415
Trash?

189
00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:10.095
Yeah, all the trash in these waters
washes up here 'cause of the tide.

190
00:14:10.765 --> 00:14:12.055
Trash, huh...

191
00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:15.015
Say, where is this trash?

192
00:14:15.015 --> 00:14:17.015
I have it piled in the back.

193
00:14:19.015 --> 00:14:23.445
Geez! The ocean isn't a garbage dump!

194
00:14:24.895 --> 00:14:29.115
An inner tube. It's still new;
is it ripped somewhere?

195
00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:33.075
Is this it? There's a small hole...

196
00:14:33.975 --> 00:14:37.145
Hole? Small?

197
00:14:37.145 --> 00:14:39.995
That's it! Could it be?!

198
00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:42.765
Hey, Mister!

199
00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:46.005
Did this inner tube wash up today?

200
00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:47.855
Yeah, that's right.

201
00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.685
Can I have it?

202
00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:51.395
Yeah, sure.

203
00:14:51.395 --> 00:14:55.685
And can I have a couple
of these empty plastic bottles too?

204
00:14:56.065 --> 00:15:00.895
Yeah, dunno what you want
with 'em, but take whatever you want.

205
00:15:03.935 --> 00:15:07.195
The flow of the tide
and the deflated inner tube!

206
00:15:07.935 --> 00:15:11.945
If my theory is correct,
these plastic bottles should make it clear!

207
00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:33.595
Alright! Now I just wait on the beach!

208
00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:43.525
Here it comes!

209
00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:56.325
Just as I thought! That just leaves
the store that sold the inner tube!

210
00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:04.245
The reexamination produced
the same results as mine, Mori-san.

211
00:16:06.895 --> 00:16:10.475
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself, Mori-san?

212
00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:14.515
Is suspecting innocent people
what all great detectives do?

213
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:18.135
Oh, uhh, pardon me a minute...

214
00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:20.645
Oh? Running away?

215
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.855
No, just the restroom.
Don't wanna wet myself...

216
00:16:27.015 --> 00:16:31.655
Damn! I was sure he did it, too...

217
00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:37.995
Alright, here we go!

218
00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:40.895
What was that?

219
00:16:40.895 --> 00:16:41.705
Dad?

220
00:16:42.185 --> 00:16:46.665
I apologize for the wait, everyone!
Please come to the next room!

221
00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:48.625
Dad!

222
00:16:50.145 --> 00:16:53.265
What is this, Mori-san?

223
00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:55.355
Changing rooms
to regain your bearings?

224
00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:56.505
I suppose.

225
00:16:57.145 --> 00:17:01.475
Now, then! Allow me to
reveal the truth of this incident!

226
00:17:03.435 --> 00:17:10.395
This incident was a murder!
And the killer was you, Dr. Tanaka!

227
00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:18.825
But, Mori-san! Wasn't it proved
that Dr. Tanaka has an alibi?!

228
00:17:19.225 --> 00:17:24.785
Yes, he was at the bar at
the victim's estimated time of death.

229
00:17:25.395 --> 00:17:28.755
He killed her while he drank.

230
00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:31.415
I-Is that possible?!

231
00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:37.885
There's no doubt she died at
the location Conan and Ran found her.

232
00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:42.845
However, the actual
crime took place elsewhere.

233
00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:47.815
First, Tanaka-san called
her to a separate location

234
00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:52.275
and knocked her out with
chloroform or some other drug.

235
00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:58.235
As a doctor, obtaining
such drugs would be simple.

236
00:17:58.685 --> 00:18:03.155
You then used rope to
tie a heavy rock to her feet,

237
00:18:03.645 --> 00:18:06.515
placed her in an inner
tube with a small hole in it,

238
00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:09.185
and let her float in the ocean.

239
00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:14.855
Immediately afterward, you
went to the bar with your friend...

240
00:18:14.855 --> 00:18:16.385
...to create an alibi.

241
00:18:17.225 --> 00:18:23.685
During that time, Mitsuko-san
floated along the current, still alive.

242
00:18:24.765 --> 00:18:31.145
There's a tidal current here
that flows toward the swimming area.

243
00:18:31.725 --> 00:18:37.225
So she was washed
toward the beach while still alive.

244
00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:42.705
The inner tube continued to
deflate, and eventually,

245
00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:48.015
the inner tube could no
longer support her weight,

246
00:18:48.015 --> 00:18:51.705
so Mitsuko-san sank into the sea.

247
00:18:52.355 --> 00:18:56.375
All while you were drinking at the bar.

248
00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:03.105
Judging from the speed
at which the inner tube deflated,

249
00:19:03.105 --> 00:19:06.935
you likely sent her adrift at around 7:00.

250
00:19:07.935 --> 00:19:11.315
You arrived at the bar yesterday at 8:00.

251
00:19:11.315 --> 00:19:14.355
Can you prove your alibi for 7:00?

252
00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:17.895
Absurd! That's nothing but conjecture!

253
00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:21.825
She could've used the inner
tube to commit suicide herself!

254
00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:24.785
That's not a possibility.

255
00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:26.065
What?

256
00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:30.435
Detective, show him a
photograph of the victim's feet.

257
00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:36.105
Here we are.

258
00:19:36.105 --> 00:19:37.005
Okay, Ran.

259
00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:41.765
Tie your own feet,
just like in the photograph.

260
00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:42.425
Okay.

261
00:19:45.815 --> 00:19:47.475
All done, Dad.

262
00:19:47.475 --> 00:19:52.855
Detective, please compare
that photograph with Ran's feet.

263
00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:56.515
The knots are reversed.

264
00:19:56.515 --> 00:20:02.525
Normally, if you tie your own feet,
you'll get a knot like Ran's.

265
00:20:02.525 --> 00:20:06.535
Then why is the knot
in the photograph reversed?

266
00:20:07.015 --> 00:20:10.875
It's because the killer
tied her feet facing her.

267
00:20:11.515 --> 00:20:14.165
That doesn't mean that I killed her!

268
00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:19.875
Conan found a brand new inner
tube with a small hole on the beach.

269
00:20:22.685 --> 00:20:24.345
Here it is, Detective!

270
00:20:26.145 --> 00:20:29.055
That's the inner tube you used, isn't it?

271
00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:32.015
I-I've never seen it before!

272
00:20:32.515 --> 00:20:36.815
It was easy finding the shop
where you bought this inner tube.

273
00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:40.395
After all, it is a small town.

274
00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:45.365
This is the inner tube
Dr. Tanaka bought last week.

275
00:20:45.605 --> 00:20:50.245
But he said it was for an
acquaintance's daughter. How strange...

276
00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:55.835
The shop woman clearly
remembered you buying it.

277
00:20:56.515 --> 00:21:00.065
And you must've felt
quite confident about this trick...

278
00:21:00.065 --> 00:21:03.585
Enough not to wipe away
your fingerprints from the inner tube!

279
00:21:04.815 --> 00:21:09.395
Now then, why would your
fingerprints be on an inner tube

280
00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:12.765
you said you've never seen before?

281
00:21:13.265 --> 00:21:15.265
Dr. Tanaka! You--?!

282
00:22:57.315 --> 00:22:59.875
I wish we could've
stayed another day...

283
00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:04.085
So, Dad! I don't mind if
you take the wrong road again!

284
00:23:04.405 --> 00:23:09.115
D-Don't be stupid! I didn't
take the wrong road yesterday!

285
00:23:09.115 --> 00:23:13.195
A case called for the great Mori Kogoro!

286
00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:15.725
I'd never take the wrong road otherwise!

287
00:23:16.735 --> 00:23:19.055
But you got it wrong in the end anyway...

288
00:23:22.115 --> 00:23:24.565
What happened, Dad?

289
00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:27.695
This is the shore we just left from!

290
00:23:27.695 --> 00:23:29.275
That's strange...

291
00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:34.995
I got it! The sea called
us here to stay another night!

292
00:23:34.995 --> 00:23:37.955
That's stupid. Of course it didn't...

293
00:23:37.955 --> 00:23:42.485
But you'd never take the
wrong road otherwise, right?

294
00:23:42.485 --> 00:23:46.665
Yeah! You couldn't help it;
the sea called us here!

295
00:23:47.945 --> 00:23:48.865
Really?

296
00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:50.155
Really!
Really!

297
00:23:50.155 --> 00:23:54.385
Yeah, huh? I'd never take
the wrong road otherwise!

298
00:23:54.815 --> 00:23:57.865
Okay! Another night!

299
00:23:59.065 --> 00:24:01.695
He's so easy to manipulate.

300
00:24:06.815 --> 00:24:08.895
Something doesn't seem right!

301
00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:12.865
She's drowning!

302
00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:14.975
What was that?

303
00:24:17.785 --> 00:24:19.495
That's--!

304
00:24:19.495 --> 00:24:20.955
Don't move her!

305
00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:25.375
Kiwako-san might've
been bitten by a sea snake!

306
00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:27.835
There they are! Bite marks!

307
00:24:28.405 --> 00:24:29.815
On the next Conan--

308
00:24:29.815 --> 00:24:33.505
"The Scuba Diving Murder Case (Part 1)."
