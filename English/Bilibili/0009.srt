1
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:05,603
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,323
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a pill that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:10,143
My mind is still that of
a great detective, though!

4
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,933
Using my keen powers of deduction,

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,603
I solve every kind of case there is!

6
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,303
Today's case takes place
during a spring festival!

7
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,643
Even if it's hidden behind
the lens of a camera,

8
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,233
there is always only one truth!

9
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:59,012
The Tenkaichi Night Festival Murder.

10
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:05,052
We now go live to Saitama prefecture's
Tenkaichi Night Festival.

11
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,812
The Tenkaichi Night Festival
is famous for the bonfires

12
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:10,902
that spell out the word "Tenkaichi"
on three separate mountains.

13
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:13,732
The lighting of the letters
is about to begin!

14
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:16,962
Hey! Can't you look
for it more quietly?!

15
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,902
Jeez. Just when I thought
you went to the festival,

16
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:22,362
you're already back here lookin'
for your wallet or something...

17
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:24,942
Can't even take a nice, relaxin' bath.

18
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:28,062
You haven't forgotten about your
promise for tonight, have you?!

19
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:28,862
Promise?

20
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:33,342
Come on! I came along because
you said you'd celebrate with me...

21
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,522
What's with that get-up?

22
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:39,052
And what happened in here?

23
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,022
Sorry, but tonight's plans are cancelled.

24
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:47,622
After all, the person we
would be honoring tonight...

25
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:51,222
Saitama prefecture's Tenkaichi
Night Festival is now underway!

26
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:54,602
Look! The character for "Ten" has
just been lit up on the mountain!

27
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,802
...is dead!

28
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,602
Nothing personal, Imatake.

29
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:12,022
Um, it sounded like there was a gunshot...

30
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:13,842
Hey!

31
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:44,232
Look! The last character, "Ichi,"
is lit up!

32
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:47,272
Did you know, Conan-kun?

33
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:51,862
At this festival,
the characters for "Tenkaichi"

34
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:56,962
are lit up on three mountains in
the hopes of a good harvest this year!

35
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:02,102
Almost entirely a copy
of Kyoto's Daimonji festival...

36
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:07,522
Staying at an inn and going
to a festival sure is nice!

37
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:10,572
It sure is! Don't you agree, Conan-kun?

38
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:12,212
Yeah.

39
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,692
If I didn't have that, that is.

40
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:18,522
I hate having her treat me like a kid!

41
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:25,952
Excuse me.

42
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,522
Could you take a picture for me?

43
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,762
Certainly!

44
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:31,732
Here's the camera...

45
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,862
Could you take it with that
"Ichi" character behind me?

46
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,262
Ready? Here goes!

47
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,602
Go ahead!

48
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:44,982
A balloon got into the shot...

49
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:46,642
That's fine. Thanks.

50
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:51,522
I'm writing about the various
festivals in this region.

51
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:53,692
That's what these pictures are for.

52
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,562
You're a writer?

53
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,192
You're so tan that I thought you
might play sports or something...

54
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:05,522
I got this from work.
I often go overseas, you see.

55
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,732
Oh, yes.

56
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,042
You can have this.

57
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:12,562
Are you sure?

58
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,002
Norikazu Sasai...

59
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:19,962
I used to write novels under
the pen name of Tomokazu Imai.

60
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:23,482
I've heard of him!

61
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:25,432
I read a lot of his stuff
in junior high!

62
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:27,862
That's strange.

63
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:32,352
I thought that Satoru Imatake
used that name for his debut...

64
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,982
Imatake and I are old friends.

65
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:37,272
We used to write things together.

66
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:39,532
With the Satoru Imatake?!

67
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:42,522
We both came here today.

68
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,812
Thought we'd drink the night away

69
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,622
in celebration of his
winning the Naomoto Award.

70
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:50,482
Sure is hot.

71
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,472
Take off your jacket if you're hot.

72
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:55,902
This would make a good picture!

73
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,382
Could you take a couple
more shots for me?

74
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:59,092
Sure!

75
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,812
Norikazu Sasai-san?

76
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:09,432
Yes...

77
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:13,232
I'm Detective Yokomizo from
the Saitama Police Department.

78
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:16,392
I'd like to ask you
about Satoru Imatake.

79
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:18,862
Has something happened to him?

80
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:20,822
He's been murdered.

81
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,282
In the hotel room you
were both staying in.

82
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:29,022
The murder weapon was a pistol.

83
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,532
The murder took place just
2 or 3 minutes after 8 PM.

84
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,942
The murderer was a young man.

85
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:37,082
He fled the room
immediately afterward.

86
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,152
You're completely sure
about all of this?

87
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:44,052
Yes. The TV coverage of
the festival had just started...

88
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:48,112
Shot cleanly through the head...

89
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,512
Hey, what are you doing?!

90
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:52,972
I'm a detective...

91
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:59,612
Wait, aren't you the famous
detective Kogoro Mori-san?!

92
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,112
Yes, that would be me...

93
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:09,232
I read about those difficult cases
that you solve all the time!

94
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:10,622
I'm glad to hear it...

95
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:14,082
I was the one who solved them all.

96
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:16,692
Please look around as you wish!

97
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:19,002
I'd be honored if you assisted me!

98
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,482
I see.

99
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:32,142
Huh?

100
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,192
What's this?

101
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,492
Toothpaste.

102
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:47,572
A toothbrush! Was the victim
killed while brushing his teeth?

103
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,312
You're always getting in the way!

104
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:52,862
What do you think, Detective Mori?

105
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:56,062
This smells greatly of a robbery.

106
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:58,492
A robbery?

107
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:03,862
Only the money has been removed
from the victim's wallet.

108
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:07,362
Plus the perpetrator
ransacked the room.

109
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,512
This was an ordinary crime
done for monetary gain.

110
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:15,812
Judging from the fact that
the victim fell near the front door,

111
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:18,562
most likely someone had
knocked on the door

112
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:21,692
and shot him the instant he opened it.

113
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,022
But Detective Mori!

114
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:27,112
What do you think about this?

115
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:29,612
The robbery was just a disguise--

116
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,492
the real killer was
the room's other occupant!

117
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,272
Hey now, you can't be serious!

118
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,402
The murder took place around 8, right?

119
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,812
In which case, I have an alibi!

120
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:43,332
I was at the Tenkaichi Night
Festival when it happened.

121
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,112
That's where I met Mori-san
and the others.

122
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,252
Isn't that right?

123
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,982
Yes.

124
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:53,182
But I believe it was during the last
half of the festival that we met.

125
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:56,442
Come on! I was there
from the very start!

126
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,942
If you think I'm lying...

127
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,442
...then have this developed.

128
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,642
It should prove that my alibi is real!

129
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,772
Okay! Get this developed right away!

130
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:06,362
Yes, sir!

131
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,732
Detective Yokomizo is right.

132
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:14,022
This was no robbery!

133
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,902
The victim and the killer
knew each other.

134
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:19,452
It's almost certainly him.

135
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,412
But what's with that big smile?!

136
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:26,312
Just what sort of alibi does
he have in that camera?!

137
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,672
Seven pictures in all.

138
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:35,152
But what do these have
to do with his alibi?

139
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,942
I took this one!

140
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,472
See! It has Conan-kun's balloon in it!

141
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:46,392
That's right. We met Sasai-san
when the "Ichi" character was lit.

142
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:51,272
But it's past 8:40 when "Ichi" is lit.

143
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:53,362
The murder took place at 8:02 or 8:03.

144
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:56,322
I think you could make it
to the festival grounds in 40 minutes

145
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:57,782
if you rushed by car.

146
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,862
Detective Yokomizo.

147
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:04,482
After the first character,
"Ten," is lit at 8:00,

148
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,582
about how long does it continue to burn?

149
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:10,232
Usually until about 8:25 or so.

150
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:12,072
Have a look at this picture!

151
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:20,472
This proves that he was at the festival
grounds before 8:25, at the latest.

152
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,862
The murder was at 8:00.

153
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,022
No matter how fast you drive,

154
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:29,362
it's impossible to go from here
to the festival grounds in 25 minutes!

155
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,732
Congratulations.
Your alibi is airtight.

156
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:35,402
Of course it is!

157
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:38,362
How can this be?
How can that picture be there?!

158
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:43,732
Is photographic alteration
out of the question?

159
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,312
Multiple exposures or something?

160
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,332
Someone good with
cameras could easily...

161
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:51,272
Hey, now. I handed the camera
directly over to you

162
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:53,402
and asked you to develop the film.

163
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,902
And besides, it was a disposable camera.

164
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,052
I could have done no such thing.

165
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:01,812
You were the one who
developed the film, right?

166
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:02,732
Yes, sir!

167
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:05,792
There were no signs of the camera
or film being tampered with!

168
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:06,892
See?

169
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:09,232
Come on, Detective Yokomizo.

170
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:13,522
You already knew
he was at the festival.

171
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:16,902
Yes. I heard from the hotel's front desk
that Sasai-san left around 7:30.

172
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:23,782
They remembered because he was
constantly asking the time.

173
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:28,812
That was because I wanted to make
it in time for the "Ten" character.

174
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,752
As you can see,
I forgot my watch today.

175
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:35,942
Something bugs me about
everything you did!

176
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,062
It's almost as if you were
trying to make an alibi...

177
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:39,682
Come on, now.

178
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:43,442
I would appreciate it if you would
stop wasting time like this

179
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,522
and get to the real task at hand,

180
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:49,602
like finding out who killed my friend.

181
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:55,942
Imatake-sensei!

182
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,002
Sensei!

183
00:11:58,112 --> 00:11:58,742
Where did he go?

184
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:01,562
If you're looking for
Imatake-san's body,

185
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,292
he was taken down to the station.

186
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,202
Who might you be, anyway?

187
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:08,402
My name is Yamada, from the monthly
magazine Literature Era.

188
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:13,182
I rushed here as soon as the police
called me, but I guess he really is...

189
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,092
Literature Era? Didn't Imatake-san...

190
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,362
Yes, it published his
"Heroic Sword Legend" series.

191
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:22,012
Wait, are you Sasai-sensei?!

192
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:23,152
Come to think of it,

193
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:25,732
Imatake did mention that his
deadline was coming up soon

194
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:27,652
but he still wasn't done.

195
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:31,442
That's right!
His deadline was tomorrow!

196
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,612
Oh no!

197
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,942
Even if I ask someone else to write
something, there isn't enough time,

198
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:39,402
and nothing would ever
be as good as his!

199
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,362
I guess I have no other choice.

200
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,152
Here.

201
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,042
What's this?

202
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:51,522
Something I wrote a while back.

203
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,692
Imatake kept bugging me
to show it to him,

204
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:56,402
so I just happened
to bring it with me today.

205
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:59,692
I doubt it compares with
Imatake's series, though.

206
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:04,692
No, seeing as you used
to work with him,

207
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:07,012
I'm sure the editors
will all be delighted!

208
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:08,942
Are you sure?

209
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:11,432
That's only the prologue
to an especially long story.

210
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,482
We would be very grateful

211
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:16,482
if you would continue
to write for Literature Era...

212
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:20,112
I don't know, I'm busy enough
as it is already...

213
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,442
Can't I persuade you somehow?

214
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:25,412
Very well! I shall write for
the late Imatake's sake!

215
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:31,062
Thank you! I have to be going now!

216
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:32,812
Hey, Detective.

217
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,112
You heard that, right?

218
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:38,422
It would seem I must hurry
back home and get to work.

219
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,462
For Imatake, who was killed by
some idiot who just wanted his money.

220
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,862
There's no question about it--
he's the killer!

221
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,762
But he has an alibi.

222
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:53,202
How? How was he able
to take that picture?!

223
00:13:54,732 --> 00:14:00,562
What's more, the camera was untampered
with and he had Ran use it.

224
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:03,942
A picture at 8:50
wouldn't serve as an alibi.

225
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:08,812
Darn it! There has to be something!

226
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,872
Something that will bring
his alibi crumbling down!

227
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,402
Think back to when you met him!

228
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,062
Sorry, but I need to get going.

229
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:18,792
Not so fast!

230
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:21,092
That's right!

231
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,012
Sure is hot.

232
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,482
He didn't take his jacket off...

233
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,062
Or maybe he couldn't take it off!

234
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:28,932
Why not?!

235
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,222
Could you take a picture for me?

236
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:32,682
Here's the camera...

237
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,392
Could you take it with that
"Ichi" character behind me?

238
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,442
Wait! I still want to talk to you!

239
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,402
You just never give up!
Keep harassing me and I'll sue!

240
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:50,072
Aha, so that's it!

241
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,282
Now I've got this trick figured out!

242
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,152
Just as I thought, he is the killer!

243
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:58,612
What's more, this was
a premeditated murder!

244
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,650
I've got the trick behind his
alibi photo completely figured out!

245
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,360
I better let the detective
know before it's too late!

246
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
Whatever. I'm leaving now.

247
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,150
Not so fast!

248
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,940
I have to do something!

249
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,570
Okay! Time for my secret weapon!

250
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,880
Now to set his pose...

251
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,980
...arrange the photographs on the desk...

252
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,020
...and then use this Voice-Altering
Bow Tie to mimic his voice!

253
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,820
Yikes!

254
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,400
How many times do I have to tell you?!

255
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,570
I have photographic proof it wasn't me!

256
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:19,320
Please, Detective. Could you
tell him how incompetent he is?

257
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,620
Incompetent he is.

258
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,620
You really disappoint me,
Detective Yokomizo!

259
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,580
Mori-san!

260
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,090
I kept quiet so you could
have all of the credit,

261
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,190
yet you were still fooled by the trick
used to make that alibi photograph!

262
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,110
So, then he is--

263
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,360
Yes.

264
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,270
The one who killed Mr. Satoru
Imatake is none other than...

265
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,980
...the one standing next to you--
Norikazu Sasai!

266
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,570
Wait just a minute!

267
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,280
Weren't you the one who said
this was a robbery?!

268
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,020
I said that so you would
lower your guard.

269
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,770
I knew from the very instant
I saw the victim

270
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,710
that the murderer was
an acquaintance of his.

271
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,670
Based on what?

272
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,570
The toothpaste foam
in the victim's mouth.

273
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,800
His toothbrush was also
lying on the ground near him.

274
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,150
In other words, the victim
was brushing his teeth

275
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,260
before he was shot!

276
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,190
So? Everyone brushes their teeth.

277
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,070
Yes.

278
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,940
But it's not very common for people
to open the front door for strangers

279
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,160
while still brushing
their teeth, now is it?

280
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,100
One more thing--
this room's condition.

281
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,770
The murderer fled immediately
after the gunshot.

282
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,440
Do you think it would be possible
to ransack this entire room

283
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,510
in such a short amount of time?

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,650
Most likely it was done
purposely before the murder

285
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,730
to make it look like
an ordinary robbery.

286
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,440
I see.

287
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,150
All of the evidence at the scene
of the crime seems to point to me.

288
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,740
But I have an alibi.

289
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,700
How do you explain that photograph?

290
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,690
This is most likely
a picture that you took

291
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,600
when you came
to a previous festival.

292
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,610
You then held on to the camera
until today's festival,

293
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,360
where you ran into Ran and had
her continue taking more pictures.

294
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,440
Although it was
an extremely simple trick,

295
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,190
the fact that you were
wearing the exact same clothes

296
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,890
made it easy to mistake
it for a picture you took today!

297
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,980
That's right!

298
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,480
The reason you endured
the heat and kept your jacket on

299
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,520
was because you didn't want to look
any different than in the 1st photo!

300
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,820
Am I wrong?

301
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,780
What a splendid sense
of imagination, Detective Mori!

302
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,500
But do you have any proof that I took
that picture at a previous festival?!

303
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,300
Why, yes, I do!

304
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,000
What?!

305
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,970
Look! It's right here
in this picture! Your--

306
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,970
Hey, you!

307
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,610
Don't be bothering Dad!

308
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,650
Dad?

309
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,090
Oh no!

310
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,250
I leave the rest to you,
Detective Yokomizo.

311
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,490
Right.

312
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,740
His wrist?

313
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,570
As you can see,
I forgot my watch today.

314
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,020
What are you doing?!

315
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,770
How do you explain this?

316
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:23,680
Your wrist is perfectly tan
in your alibi photograph!

317
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,690
Yet your wrist is white now!

318
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,990
The truth is that you took
this picture one year ago!

319
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,980
Isn't that right, Sasai-san?!

320
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,250
I concede defeat, Detective.

321
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,400
I decided to get rid of
Imatake one year ago!

322
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,760
I wanted to take his place
at the top of the literary world!

323
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,940
Yes. One year ago,
it was decided that my work

324
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,900
would be published as
a series in Literature Era.

325
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,980
But right before the deadline,
the editors switched to Imatake instead!

326
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
Simply because he had
a better reputation than I.

327
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,980
I saw that series as my last
chance to make it as a writer.

328
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,110
But then he had to
go and snatch it away,

329
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,630
almost as if he was ridiculing me!

330
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,420
So, then you killed him?

331
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,880
Yes. I killed him.

332
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,360
Miss.

333
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,470
About Imatake's work
that won the Naomoto Award...

334
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,110
We both thought up the story for it

335
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,900
back when Imatake
and I used to write together.

336
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,870
Though I suppose nobody
would believe me now.

337
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,510
Excellent detective work,
Detective Mori!

338
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,150
It was all thanks to you that
we were able to solve the case

339
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,470
and arrest Sasai!

340
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,770
Case? Arrest? Sasai?

341
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,520
Oh, stop pretending!

342
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,660
Uh oh!

343
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,070
I always knew Sasai was the killer...

344
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,480
...I just wasted time
to make filler! Get it?!

345
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,760
Keep laughing!

346
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,820
Why aren't you going in?

347
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,320
You have business in there, don't you?

348
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,680
You went out with Shinichi?!
