1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.140
If that person is the culprit,

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.040
Mr. Hirasaka didn't commit suicide.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.640
In order to prove that,

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.340
I've got to solve the mystery of the two locked rooms!

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.740
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.240
Tears are the start of all dramas.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.040
So, he was the real culprit!

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.040
Everything is finally clarified!

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
On the night that a seance was held at the residence

13
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.170
of occult cartoonist, Mr. Reiki Hirasaka,

14
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
a series of locked room murders are committed.

15
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.370
The incident was connected with the murder

16
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.670
of the editor in charge of Mr. Hirasaka's work,

17
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.870
Mr. Sawanami that occurred six months ago.

18
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.170
The word "Kira" was found left behind at the scene.

19
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.170
What on earth does this mean?

20
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.170
"Kira"

21
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.370
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (Locked Room Opened)"

22
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.070
Mr. policeman!

23
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.770
Did you see my Gomera badge in the room?

24
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.970
Gomera badge? I got no such report.

25
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.470
May I go look for it?

26
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.070
What?

27
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.170
The two keys were found inside the drawer.

28
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.570
It's possible to throw the keys into the drawer via that window vent.

29
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.670
However...

30
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.170
Is it possible for them to also put a notebook atop those

31
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.170
and lock the drawer?

32
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.170
And...

33
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.070
Kira's posters that were torn apart

34
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.970
and scattered all over the place.

35
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.570
Why was something like that done?

36
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.270
Hey, hurry up out of there.

37
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.170
Just a little while more. One second!

38
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.670
Mr. Policeman, there's something on top of that flower.

39
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.970
Let me see it!

40
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.570
This is a torn piece from Kira's poster!

41
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.570
Why is it on that flower?

42
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.470
I see!

43
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.070
Maybe...

44
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.170
Forensics lady!

45
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.770
My? Sonny, you're the one staying over at Mr. Mouri's.

46
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.870
Did you see my Masked Yaiba card on the floor?

47
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.170
I seemed to have dropped it when I came in here last night.

48
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.770
No, nothing was on the floor.

49
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.070
I'll go take a quick look!

50
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.570
Sonny!

51
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.170
There's no footing to climb up to that window in the room.

52
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.270
Besides, in order to close that window,

53
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.470
that switch would have to be pushed all the while.

54
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.670
However, the door was locked from the inside with a padlock.

55
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.670
You can't lock the door from the outside.

56
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.370
Maybe...

57
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.870
I get it. That's the story.

58
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.370
I'll look for the card for you so...

59
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.770
Yes. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.870
But, why did the culprit have to go out of the way

61
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.970
to create a locked room?

62
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.070
As for Mr. Hirasaka,

63
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.170
it was probably to make it look like he committed to suicide.

64
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.770
Maybe there's a secret way out

65
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.170
of the meditation room or something?

66
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.370
If it's as I suspect,

67
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.770
this locked room is much too sad.

68
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.870
I've solved the mystery of the locked room.

69
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.070
but there's no proof.

70
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.270
Why not check if there's an

71
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.170
escape route out of the meditation room?

72
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.370
There's no such thing. Not in that room!

73
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.870
No use doing something like that!

74
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.970
Because Kira used magical powers to escape from that room.

75
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.270
Isn't this room hot?

76
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.070
Then, why don't you loosen your necktie?

77
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.870
Like always.

78
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.470
But, it's not good to look too untidy

79
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.770
despite the police being here, right?

80
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.370
Maho, do you feel bad or something?

81
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.870
No. I'm fine.

82
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.670
Wait a second. That person just...

83
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.070
I see.

84
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.370
Maybe the culprit left definite evidence behind?

85
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.370
Pops, over this way!

86
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.970
-Hurry up. -Hey, what on earth did you find?

87
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.670
Look, it's just over there.

88
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.170
What?

89
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.970
Wait.

90
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.670
Leave the rest to me, Pops.

91
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.170
Everyone!

92
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.270
From now, I will tell you the truth of this case.

93
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.870
Last night, the body of Ms. Shoko Utakura

94
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.570
was found in this meditation room,

95
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.970
and Mr. Hirasaka was also found dead in his room.

96
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.270
Near Mr. Hirasaka's dead body,

97
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.570
the rope that was used to kill Shoko

98
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.370
was found together with her cell phone.

99
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.270
Judging from this circumstance,

100
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.070
it would look as if Mr. Hirasaka, after killing Shoko

101
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.470
committed suicide.

102
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.470
You mean it's not suicide?

103
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.370
No, it's most likely that the culprit

104
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.470
first went to Mr. Hirasaka's room

105
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.270
and killed him after giving him poisoned wine.

106
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.870
Then the culprit got hold of key

107
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.470
for the padlock and the room.

108
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.670
Then the culprit locked the room from the outside,

109
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.470
then killed Shoko in the meditation room.

110
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.370
The posters were pulled out from all the panels

111
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.070
after which the culprit went back to Mr. Hirasaka's room.

112
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.570
The culprit put the two keys, the murder weapon rope

113
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.470
and Shoko's cell phone in the room

114
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.470
to frame Mr. Hirasaka up as the killer.

115
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.770
Do you have proof?

116
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.370
On the flower that was decorated outside Mr. Hirasaka's room,

117
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.570
a ripped piece of the poster was found.

118
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.770
What? Is that true?

119
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.470
It's this one.

120
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.570
-Here! -This was...

121
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.970
on the flowers that was in the vase?

122
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.370
In other words, the culprit ripped the poster in the corridor

123
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.070
and put the pieces into the room

124
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.170
through the ventilation window.

125
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.970
Why did the culprit do something like that?

126
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.870
The more I don't understand.

127
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.470
I shall replay the locked room trick now.

128
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.270
-What? -Officer Takagi, Officer Chiba!

129
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.070
Yes, sir!

130
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.970
What are you people doing there?

131
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.270
We're preparing to replay the locked room trick

132
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.570
under Mr. Mouri's instructions!

133
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.370
Chiba, what is it that you're carrying?

134
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.170
Oh, this is

135
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.270
a gigantic poster of the Masked Yaiba movie.

136
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.270
I borrowed it from a special effects mania!

137
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.170
Why would you need something like that?

138
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.970
That poster is the same size

139
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.470
as the largest panel of Kira's panel that was over here.

140
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.370
The culprit used this to carry out the locked room trick.

141
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.270
What?

142
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.070
Let's start, then.

143
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.170
First, you roll that poster into the shape of a cylinder.

144
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.570
Then a thin long cylinder of 2m will be made.

145
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.970
Push the cylinder inside the room from the ventilation window

146
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.270
and push the tip of it into the cylinder into the drawer.

147
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.170
Then all that's left to do is to put the key into that cylinder.

148
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.270
After that, use the tip of the cylinder

149
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.570
to place the memo pad on top of the keys,

150
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.370
close the drawer then turn the knob.

151
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.270
You can lock it.

152
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.470
Then the culprit tore up all the posters

153
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.770
and put them inside the room.

154
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.170
Lastly, he sends everybody text mail using Shoko's cell phone.

155
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.370
After throwing the cell phone and rope into the room,

156
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.270
he left.

157
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.270
But, in order to carry out this trick,

158
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.970
wouldn't using just one poster do?

159
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.170
Why did he have to take all the posters that were here out

160
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.770
and rip them?

161
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.970
Besides, how did he create the locked room

162
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.270
in this meditation room?

163
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.870
She used magic!

164
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.870
Kira became a witch, you know!

165
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.370
No, the culprit didn't use magic.

166
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.070
Rather, he used a Ninja technique.

167
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.670
Ninja technique?

168
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.770
Are you saying that the culprit is a Ninja?

169
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.070
I'm not talking about super ninja tricks like

170
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.370
"Dust hiding" and "Ninja split".

171
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.870
You see it a lot on TV, don't you?

172
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.070
The technique where ninjas jump over high fences

173
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.970
using their own swords.

174
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.170
The culprit used that trick to escape from here.

175
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.570
He used ten somewhat posters

176
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.370
that were here in place of a sword!

177
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.770
By using the posters?

178
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.970
I'm completely lost.

179
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.470
Okay, I'll show you how it was done, everybody!

180
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.770
Not again.

181
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.270
You two are my men, you know.

182
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.570
Thanks to the cooperation of Officer Chiba's friend,

183
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.870
we were able to get hold of the same size

184
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.570
and number of posters that were here.

185
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.870
First, the culprit rolled all the posters

186
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.370
he removed from the panels into cylinders.

187
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.070
Posters of the same size are stacked together and rolled up.

188
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.770
Then, four cylinders of different lengths will be made.

189
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.170
You bunch the four up

190
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.670
and a make-shift step-ladder is made.

191
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.170
But, can you really climb up to that window

192
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.770
using paper that you just rolled up like this?

193
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.470
Paper, when you roll it up into cylinders like this

194
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.570
will manifest surprising strength

195
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.870
when it comes to vertical loads.

196
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.770
Officer Takagi, please.

197
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.970
Yes, sir!

198
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.770
But, how will the window be closed after this?

199
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.870
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

200
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.870
By using the trick that was used during the seance.

201
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.270
When the fishing line is pulled,

202
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.470
the easel ends up pushing the switch right through.

203
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.970
Then all he had left to do was go back to Mr. Hirasaka's room

204
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.570
get rid of the poster

205
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.070
and during the chaos of the dead body being found,

206
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.870
return the remote controller into the room.

207
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.270
I see.

208
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.570
And, who's the culprit?

209
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.070
The culprit not only killed Shoko and Mr. Hirasaka,

210
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:46.170
but also killed Mr. Sawanami who died half a month ago.

211
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.370
Characters pointing to the killer was left behind at the scene.

212
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.570
"Kira" was written, right?

213
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.370
Kira resurrected after all.

214
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.270
No!

215
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.370
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami

216
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.870
was trying to point out was...

217
00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:13.667
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami

218
00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:17.067
was trying to point out was...

219
00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:18.767
"Mifune"!

220
00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:25.667
Right, the killer is you, Mr. Mifune!

221
00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:31.167
No, it can't be.

222
00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:34.367
Then, what is the meaning of the character "Kira"

223
00:14:34.367 --> 00:14:35.667
that was left back at the scene?

224
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.467
Mr. Sawanami

225
00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:40.567
tried to write the name "Mifune" in katakana.

226
00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:43.267
But after writing "Mifu", he died.

227
00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:45.067
Shoko, the first one to find the corpse,

228
00:14:45.067 --> 00:14:48.867
saw this and on impulse added on a vertical line

229
00:14:48.867 --> 00:14:50.667
and changed the word to "Kira".

230
00:14:51.167 --> 00:14:52.367
What?

231
00:14:52.367 --> 00:14:56.767
Ridiculous. Why would she have to do something like that?

232
00:14:56.767 --> 00:15:00.567
Wasn't that to protect you?

233
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.667
Everything you're saying is nothing but deductions!

234
00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:05.467
Do you have definite proof to support what you're saying?

235
00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:09.467
I'm sure that you still have the proof on you, don't you?

236
00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:12.467
-What? -That's why you have your necktie

237
00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:13.867
that you usually wear loose,

238
00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:15.167
wrapped tightly and neatly around your neck

239
00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:17.367
despite it being hot.

240
00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:21.967
The proof is hidden under that necktie!

241
00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:23.867
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

242
00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:32.667
When you poisoned Mr. Hirasaka to death,

243
00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:35.567
the wine splattered all over from the glass that was knocked over,

244
00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:38.267
and smeared your shirt.

245
00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:39.967
Since you didn't want to get into trouble

246
00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:42.467
after the interrogation and your belonging are checked,

247
00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:45.467
that you wore it and hid it with your necktie.

248
00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:49.067
If we analyze that smear,

249
00:15:49.067 --> 00:15:53.067
it should match the substance that killed Mr. Hirasaka.

250
00:15:54.267 --> 00:15:56.067
Yeah, that's right!

251
00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:59.067
I killed all three of them!

252
00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:03.267
Mr. Mifune. Why in the world...

253
00:16:03.267 --> 00:16:05.767
It's because they killed Kira!

254
00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.167
The Kira that I love!

255
00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:11.267
What? So, you were going out with Kira after all, Mr. Mifune.

256
00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:12.567
Yeah, that's right!

257
00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:16.567
That's why despite it being necessary to hide the trick that I used

258
00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:20.167
having to tear up Kira's posters with my own hands

259
00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:22.867
was really painful!

260
00:16:22.867 --> 00:16:26.467
But, I did so believing that it was to save Kira!

261
00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:28.967
To save Kira?

262
00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:30.867
Just as I thought.

263
00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:33.667
I thought that it wasn't possible

264
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.567
that Kira who was especially careful about driving safely,

265
00:16:35.567 --> 00:16:37.667
would get into an accident in a place like that.

266
00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:41.367
But the police would not take me seriously.

267
00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:44.067
I suspected that something must've happened

268
00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:47.167
at the party that was held here.

269
00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:49.867
Right before the accident!

270
00:16:49.867 --> 00:16:52.067
In order to find out the truth,

271
00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:55.367
I set up wiretaps everywhere in this mansion!

272
00:16:55.367 --> 00:16:57.467
I listened to everything!

273
00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.767
Hirasaka who was going through a slump back

274
00:17:00.767 --> 00:17:02.767
then drowned himself in alcohol.

275
00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:05.967
That night, Hirasaka got drunk and violent again.

276
00:17:05.967 --> 00:17:09.967
Kira, who tried to calm him down was knocked down by him

277
00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:11.367
and...

278
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:14.667
In order to hide this fact,

279
00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.267
Hirasaka and the others faked the accident!

280
00:17:17.267 --> 00:17:19.067
So, you took revenge.

281
00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:22.167
Yeah, I picked Sawanami to be the first

282
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.667
because he was the least on his guard.

283
00:17:24.667 --> 00:17:26.067
But...

284
00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:32.867
I know everything, you know.

285
00:17:32.867 --> 00:17:34.867
Everything that you did, Mr. Mifune.

286
00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:37.967
But, don't worry.

287
00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:40.367
I won't tell anybody.

288
00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:46.767
Sawanami was saying that another woman as at the party.

289
00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:50.667
He didn't say her name, but I knew it was Shoko.

290
00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:53.667
He was trying to protect the woman he loved.

291
00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:56.267
I was actually planning to kill you first!

292
00:17:56.267 --> 00:17:59.567
Since I knew of the seance from listening to the wiretaps,

293
00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:01.267
I was going to take advantage of it!

294
00:18:01.267 --> 00:18:03.567
But, I changed my mind.

295
00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:05.567
I couldn't forgive the fact that the woman

296
00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:08.767
who was involved in Kira's death dared to blackmailed me!

297
00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:11.167
That's why I decided to kill that woman!

298
00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:12.867
You're wrong!

299
00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:16.667
You're wrong!

300
00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:20.567
I'm the one that was with Kira that day!

301
00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.067
Maho.

302
00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.367
It's a lie.

303
00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:27.167
If so, why didn't Sawanami mention your name?

304
00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:31.467
Mr. Sawanami probably didn't know my name.

305
00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.567
He didn't seem to be interested in a plain

306
00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:35.967
and reserved person like me.

307
00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:38.267
-No. -It's that true?

308
00:18:38.267 --> 00:18:39.867
Yes.

309
00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:43.367
That's why I thought that she was the culprit.

310
00:18:43.367 --> 00:18:46.867
Why didn't you report it to the police right away?

311
00:18:46.867 --> 00:18:52.067
I didn't want to believe that Kira was dead!

312
00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:55.667
She was what kept me living.

313
00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.967
I was bullied in Junior and Senior high school,

314
00:18:57.967 --> 00:19:00.567
and as an adult I used to be confined to myself.

315
00:19:00.567 --> 00:19:05.567
I owe my being able to function fairly normally to Kira.

316
00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:07.567
I encountered Kira coincidentally at a cosplay shop

317
00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:11.767
that I conjured up courage to go to for the first time.

318
00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:15.167
I guess you all think why cosplay.

319
00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:17.567
But, being able to be an inhabitant of dreamland

320
00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:19.267
for even a fleeting moment

321
00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:22.567
helped me forget the painful world of reality I lived in.

322
00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:26.167
Kira was the one who taught me that.

323
00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:31.367
I wished that everything was just a dream.

324
00:19:31.367 --> 00:19:34.567
If I reported the incident to the police and things came into light,

325
00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:37.967
I would have to accept everything as fact.

326
00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:40.967
I was afraid to do so!

327
00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:46.167
I'm sorry!

328
00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:49.667
Shoko.

329
00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:53.767
If only you didn't blackmail Mr. Mifune.

330
00:19:53.767 --> 00:19:55.667
That's wrong too.

331
00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:58.567
Shoko liked Mr. Mifune.

332
00:19:58.567 --> 00:19:59.767
What?

333
00:19:59.767 --> 00:20:02.667
Wasn't Shoko going steady with Sawanami?

334
00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:06.167
No, Shoko told me,

335
00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:09.367
"Mr. Mifune probably likes Kira"

336
00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:13.767
so she said she'd keep her feelings deep down in her heart.

337
00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:15.067
I think that Shoko

338
00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:19.267
"Mifu" -really wanted to help Mr. Mifune.

339
00:20:19.267 --> 00:20:20.667
No.

340
00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:23.667
No.

341
00:20:24.967 --> 00:20:27.867
Which means that I killed somebody

342
00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:32.767
who really wanted to protect me with my own hands?

343
00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:35.967
There was no sign of her fighting back on her body

344
00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:37.867
because when you attacked her,

345
00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:41.767
she probably felt deep grief and gave up on everything.

346
00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:43.667
That's a lie!

347
00:20:43.667 --> 00:20:47.067
A lie!

348
00:20:47.067 --> 00:20:49.667
It's a lie! A lie!

349
00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:53.267
-Hey! Cut it out! -It's a lie!

350
00:20:54.267 --> 00:20:57.767
It's a lie! A lie!

351
00:20:58.867 --> 00:21:03.767
But, why did he have to create a locked room here?

352
00:21:03.767 --> 00:21:06.367
This is just my imagination.

353
00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:09.567
Mr. Mifune, by creating a locked room

354
00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:12.867
probably wanted the police to destroy this room.

355
00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:14.967
Destroyed by the police?

356
00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:16.767
If the locked room trick is not solved,

357
00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:19.067
in order to look for a secret passage or something,

358
00:21:19.067 --> 00:21:22.367
the least they'll do is tear off the floors, right?

359
00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:26.267
And, he wanted the police to find

360
00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:30.367
Kira's body that Mr. Hirasaka and the others hid under the floor.

361
00:21:30.367 --> 00:21:32.267
He wanted the police, the very ones, who concluded

362
00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:35.567
Kira's death to be accidental to find her corpse.

363
00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:40.867
The following day, the police found Kira's body

364
00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:44.767
under the floor of the meditation room.

365
00:21:44.767 --> 00:21:48.767
Now, all the locked rooms have been opened.

366
00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:10.867
"Mouri Detective Agency"

367
00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:13.367
Yatsukawa, I heard you won the Director's Award

368
00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:15.867
because of your reporting the incident!

369
00:23:15.867 --> 00:23:18.667
But, many of my acquaintances died

370
00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:20.467
or got arrested,

371
00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:22.467
so my feelings are a bit complex.

372
00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.067
Cheer up!

373
00:23:24.067 --> 00:23:27.067
Yes! Please help me out on the next case too!

374
00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:29.867
-What? -My next report'll be about a haunted hospital

375
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:32.867
where a series of ghostly phenomenon occur!

376
00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:33.967
What?

377
00:23:33.967 --> 00:23:36.767
Come on! Let's head off right away!

378
00:23:36.767 --> 00:23:39.167
What? Hey! Don't pull me!

379
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:42.767
I'm fed up with occult already.

380
00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:44.767
You can say that again.

381
00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:48.967
Is it true that you were chosen as lay judge?

382
00:23:48.967 --> 00:23:51.667
Why did something like that happen?

383
00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:54.167
Attorney at Law Queen Kisaki, who has never lost a case

384
00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:56.067
and Madonna prosecutor Kujo

385
00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.067
are going to be confronting each other,

386
00:23:57.067 --> 00:23:59.767
and Ms. Kobayashi is going to be a lay judge.

387
00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:03.167
Isn't this picture upside down?

388
00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:07.167
It seems that the defendant had a motive for killing the victim.

389
00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:10.167
What a terrible thing to come out.

390
00:24:10.167 --> 00:24:11.467
Next Conan,

391
00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:15.413
"Courtroom Confrontation IV Lay Judge Sumiko Kobayashi (Part 1)"

392
00:24:16.694 --> 00:24:18.894
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:20.894
"Picture"

394
00:24:20.894 --> 00:24:22.594
Next episode, we will have the woman that's hard to deal with!

395
00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:23.894
Oh, mother.

396
00:24:23.894 --> 00:24:25.298
What's this chill I feel?
