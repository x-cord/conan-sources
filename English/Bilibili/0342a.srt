1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.940
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.040
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.540
Today's episode is a 60 minutes long special.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540
The bell of crime tolls at Huis Ten Bosch.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:00.434
"Wide Map of Huis Ten Bosch"

9
00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:03.534
Wedding at Huis Ten Bosch.

10
00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:06.534
It's so romantic.

11
00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:10.734
I've always wanted to go to Huis Ten Bosch.

12
00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:14.434
But, Sonoko, are you sure it was okay

13
00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.734
for us to come along, too?

14
00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.134
Are you sure it's not going to inconvenience anyone?

15
00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:22.234
It's okay because I'd be bored if I went alone,

16
00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:23.434
and besides, just in case something happens,

17
00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:25.934
you're nice to have around.

18
00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:29.134
In case something happens?

19
00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:30.734
Well, this wedding

20
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:34.234
seems to have had a lot of hassles before it came to be.

21
00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:40.934
But, Shinya and I have been friends since we just started walking.

22
00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:42.534
And there was even a time

23
00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:45.234
when people were thinking of getting us to marry each other.

24
00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.034
It's not only because of that,

25
00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:50.834
but I really want him to attain the happiness he deserves.

26
00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.334
You're cool, Sonoko.

27
00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.834
Drinks?

28
00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:00.034
Conan, would you like anything to drink?

29
00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:01.434
Yes.

30
00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.434
Excuse me!

31
00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:04.634
Yes.

32
00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:08.334
I think I'll have...

33
00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:11.234
-Excuse me, oolong tea please. -Please give me oolong tea.

34
00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:12.234
Yes.

35
00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:20.234
I'm sorry, but this is the last can of oolong tea that is left.

36
00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:22.534
Then, go ahead and take it, sonny!

37
00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:26.434
No, you order the drink faster than me, so you can have it.

38
00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:27.434
Really?

39
00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:29.434
Thank you for letting me have it.

40
00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.034
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:35.134
Please give me one of those paper cups.

42
00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:36.734
Okay.

43
00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.034
Here you go, sonny.

44
00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:49.634
Thank you!

45
00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:51.234
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:52.234
No problem.

47
00:03:52.234 --> 00:03:54.134
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.134
Coffee and tea, any orders for drinks?

49
00:03:56.134 --> 00:03:57.734
"Junichi Takahashi (27)" -Sister and brother traveling together?

50
00:03:57.734 --> 00:03:59.434
How nice.

51
00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:02.434
No, we are not siblings.

52
00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:05.034
I wonder why each time I invite Ran to come with me,

53
00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:09.434
this kid with the glasses tags along, too?

54
00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:12.034
Sonoko, would you like a sip?

55
00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:13.834
It can't be helped,

56
00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:17.934
because if I'm not around, Conan won't be able to eat his meals.

57
00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.034
Right?

58
00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:22.334
Hey, Sonoko.

59
00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:25.134
Gosh, what's bugging you?

60
00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:27.234
I guess I'll try to stay off her nerves at least just for today.

61
00:04:35.534 --> 00:04:41.134
"The Bride of Huis Ten Bosch"

62
00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:47.734
"Huis Ten Bosch Station"

63
00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:55.334
You...

64
00:04:56.134 --> 00:04:57.734
You're the one we met in the Bullet train.

65
00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.734
Well, what a coincidence.

66
00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.934
So, you're all going to Huis Ten Bosch, too.

67
00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:02.934
Yes.

68
00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:05.134
Are you sightseeing alone?

69
00:05:05.134 --> 00:05:08.834
Yes, please don't look at me with such sympathetic eyes.

70
00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:11.534
Then, why don't you come with us?

71
00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:12.934
-Is it okay? -Sure.

72
00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:16.034
How delightful to be able to go around together

73
00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:17.734
with cute girls like you.

74
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.534
Are you sure you don't mind?

75
00:05:19.534 --> 00:05:22.334
But, the escort fee is expensive.

76
00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:25.234
Only joking. Just kidding.

77
00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:28.034
-You really surprised me. -Come off it, Sonoko.

78
00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:32.434
How much longer are you guys going to take?

79
00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:38.234
We're really at Huis Ten Bosche, aren't we?

80
00:05:38.234 --> 00:05:39.834
It's so spacious.

81
00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:43.234
It sure doesn't look like we're in Japan.

82
00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:53.334
Sonoko!

83
00:05:54.134 --> 00:05:58.034
There they are! Shinya, long time no see!

84
00:05:58.034 --> 00:05:59.834
Thank you for coming all the way out here.

85
00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:03.834
It's okay because I came to go sightseeing while I'm here, too.

86
00:06:03.834 --> 00:06:06.134
She's my best friend, Ran and he's Conan.

87
00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:08.634
I'm Ran Mouri, how do you do?

88
00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:10.134
I'm Conan.

89
00:06:10.134 --> 00:06:11.834
I'm Shinya Ohga.

90
00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:14.134
She's my fiance, Akane.

91
00:06:14.134 --> 00:06:17.334
I'm Akane Katori. Nice to meet you.

92
00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:22.534
What a beautiful girl.

93
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:27.534
I'll be on my way then.

94
00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:30.434
Thank you so very much.

95
00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:34.034
Who is he?

96
00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:35.334
His name is Mr. Takahashi,

97
00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:37.934
and he's someone we got to know on the train.

98
00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:40.434
Let's go now.

99
00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:52.134
Look, there's a windmill!

100
00:06:53.734 --> 00:06:56.134
This is Delft Bridge.

101
00:06:57.934 --> 00:07:00.034
Look, there's a swan.

102
00:07:02.034 --> 00:07:03.534
How graceful.

103
00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:05.634
It's like we've really come to Holland.

104
00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.634
I'd really love to go.

105
00:07:08.634 --> 00:07:11.234
Now you know why me and my family

106
00:07:11.234 --> 00:07:13.134
chose to have our wedding here, don't you?

107
00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:15.034
You should have your wedding here

108
00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.834
at Huis Ten Bosch too, Sonoko.

109
00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:19.834
What? I'm still in high school.

110
00:07:20.934 --> 00:07:23.834
But, I'll think about it when the time comes.

111
00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:26.334
Hey, how far in the future is that?

112
00:07:26.334 --> 00:07:30.434
"Hotel Europe"

113
00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:41.334
Dad, I brought Sonoko and her friends along.

114
00:07:41.334 --> 00:07:42.534
Hello, Miss Sonoko.

115
00:07:42.534 --> 00:07:46.534
Thank you so much for coming all this way just for us.

116
00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.534
Oh, my. How you've grown, Sonoko.

117
00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:50.734
I'll bet you're tired.

118
00:07:50.734 --> 00:07:52.034
No, not at all, Mrs. Ohga.

119
00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:55.534
I'm not at all tired, because I'm young.

120
00:07:55.534 --> 00:07:56.834
Oh, my.

121
00:07:57.934 --> 00:08:01.934
This is my best friend, Ran, and he is Conan.

122
00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:04.334
I accepted Sonoko's kind offer and came along.

123
00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:06.234
Nice to meet you.

124
00:08:06.234 --> 00:08:07.334
"Mika Ohga (29)" -I was just thinking...

125
00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:11.334
"Shinya's sister" -that it was kind of sad with so little attendance,

126
00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:13.634
because it seems that nobody will be attending

127
00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:15.234
from the bride's side.

128
00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:18.934
Come, Mika, don't talk like that in front of our guests.

129
00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:22.834
"Tae Ohga (78)" -Miss Sonoko.

130
00:08:22.834 --> 00:08:25.634
"Shinya's grandmother" -Is Chairman Suzuki doing well?

131
00:08:25.634 --> 00:08:28.134
Yes, he's just fine and playing golf every day.

132
00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.634
You seem to be doing really well yourself, Grandma Tae.

133
00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:32.834
Thank you.

134
00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:35.134
Since I have no successor

135
00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:38.734
that I can rely on and entrust the Ohga Financial Group to,

136
00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:42.334
I've got to stay healthy and keep on working.

137
00:08:49.834 --> 00:08:53.334
"Carillon Symphonica"

138
00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:10.934
Hey, Ran! Do you think this would look nice on Mr. Kyogyoku?

139
00:09:10.934 --> 00:09:13.534
They're all okay.

140
00:09:13.534 --> 00:09:16.134
I wonder if Shinichi had one like this?

141
00:09:16.134 --> 00:09:17.634
Oh, brother.

142
00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.934
Here goes, Conan!

143
00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:31.434
Okay!

144
00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:39.534
"Stad Huis"

145
00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.434
Hi, there.

146
00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:47.934
Did you already go take a look at the Glass Museum?

147
00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:50.134
No. I just got here, too.

148
00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:59.534
Sonoko, it's Grandma Tae and Ms. Mika.

149
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:03.834
Grandma likes antique glass.

150
00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:06.534
Conan, take a look at this.

151
00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:08.534
17th Century, it says.

152
00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:11.834
So glass has been around from that long ago.

153
00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:15.034
In Egypt, they seem to have been

154
00:10:15.034 --> 00:10:18.034
making glass decorations since 3000 A.D.

155
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.734
It's been around from that long ago.

156
00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:22.534
During the time of the Roman Empire,

157
00:10:22.534 --> 00:10:25.034
the blown glass method was invented,

158
00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:27.734
and it's also said that they even had window glasses.

159
00:10:27.734 --> 00:10:29.234
Really?

160
00:10:29.234 --> 00:10:31.234
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

161
00:10:32.234 --> 00:10:37.334
Well, I'm a glass craftsman from Hotaru, Hokkaido.

162
00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:39.834
I took time off from work,

163
00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:41.634
and came here wanting to see the glassworks of Nagasaki.

164
00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:43.134
I see.

165
00:10:43.134 --> 00:10:45.534
My liking for glass

166
00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:49.034
developed into my having a glass workshop in the city.

167
00:10:49.034 --> 00:10:52.734
What do you say, we have dinner together tonight?

168
00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:56.334
I'd like to hear about glass in Hotaru, too.

169
00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:58.634
I would like to by all means if you don't mind.

170
00:10:58.634 --> 00:10:59.734
My name is Takahashi.

171
00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:03.134
"Dom Tower"

172
00:11:03.134 --> 00:11:04.934
How tall.

173
00:11:04.934 --> 00:11:06.934
The town is like a toy!

174
00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:10.134
What a nice view.

175
00:11:10.134 --> 00:11:11.834
Aren't you afraid?

176
00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:15.734
I always used to like high places.

177
00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:20.434
See, the people walking below look like swarming ants.

178
00:11:20.434 --> 00:11:22.934
Doesn't it just make you feel so good?

179
00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:53.434
This is Mr. Takahashi, a glass craftsman from Hotaru.

180
00:11:53.434 --> 00:11:57.434
I invited him over because I wanted to hear his story on glass.

181
00:11:58.434 --> 00:11:59.834
I'm Takahashi.

182
00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:01.034
I'm Ohga.

183
00:12:01.034 --> 00:12:03.234
My son, Shinya's wedding is tomorrow,

184
00:12:03.234 --> 00:12:05.534
and that's why we're all spending the night here.

185
00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:07.134
You're most welcome.

186
00:12:07.134 --> 00:12:08.734
"Hideo Mochida (53)" -I never thought it'd be Shinya...

187
00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:11.534
"Shinya's uncle" -that would end up marrying first.

188
00:12:11.534 --> 00:12:14.534
Mika, he beat you to it, didn't he?

189
00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:17.734
That's because I don't buy cheap stuff.

190
00:12:20.134 --> 00:12:21.934
Oh, right. Mr. Takahashi,

191
00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:26.034
I'd like to invite you to attend tomorrow's wedding.

192
00:12:26.034 --> 00:12:28.334
But, I really shouldn't...

193
00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:31.234
You're more than welcome to.

194
00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:35.634
Shinya will have to shoulder the Ohga Finance Group in the future.

195
00:12:35.634 --> 00:12:39.334
I'm sure that attending the wedding will not be a loss to you, too.

196
00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:40.734
How can I attend the wedding?

197
00:12:40.734 --> 00:12:42.934
I'm just a glass craftsman...

198
00:12:44.334 --> 00:12:47.434
Yes, I'll accept your invitation and attend the wedding with honor.

199
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.134
Thank you.

200
00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:55.334
Akane, wear this at your wedding tomorrow.

201
00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:05.034
This is a ring that has been handed down for generations

202
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.634
to the wives of the Ohga family.

203
00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:10.434
The founding president who started a shipping industry

204
00:13:10.434 --> 00:13:12.134
at the beginning of the Meiji Era gave this to his wife

205
00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:14.134
when he first went to Europe.

206
00:13:14.134 --> 00:13:16.034
Thank you very much.

207
00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:17.734
Thank you, mother.

208
00:13:18.434 --> 00:13:21.134
Maybe it's too soon to give it to her yet.

209
00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:25.034
But, I also received it from you

210
00:13:25.034 --> 00:13:27.834
and wore it to the wedding.

211
00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:30.834
It's because in your case, everyone had viewed you

212
00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:34.634
as being the right person as the wife of the family head, to begin with.

213
00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:36.834
The only time the ring is to be handed down,

214
00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:38.934
is when the bride is approved of

215
00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:41.534
as becoming a member of the Ohga family.

216
00:13:41.534 --> 00:13:46.634
Which means you all don't approve of Akane as being my wife?

217
00:13:50.334 --> 00:13:53.734
Well, she can wear it during the wedding ceremony, though.

218
00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:02.734
It seems like we've been invited to a hassle wedding.

219
00:14:17.234 --> 00:14:18.734
What the hell was that?

220
00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:20.334
Is that how the family of somebody

221
00:14:20.334 --> 00:14:23.234
who is going to have a sacred wedding tomorrow supposed to act?

222
00:14:23.234 --> 00:14:25.234
What the hell's going on, Sonoko?

223
00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:27.534
I told you that they went through a bit of a hassle

224
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.234
before the wedding was decided, didn't I?

225
00:14:29.234 --> 00:14:33.334
Sonoko, why is that grandmother so mean to Ms. Akane?

226
00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:36.034
Shinya declared that if they didn't approve

227
00:14:36.034 --> 00:14:39.034
of him marrying Ms. Akane, he would leave home.

228
00:14:39.034 --> 00:14:42.034
So, it seems the Ohga family all reluctantly approved.

229
00:14:42.034 --> 00:14:44.234
But Ms. Akane is such a nice person.

230
00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:47.434
The family of a financial group has all kinds of hassles.

231
00:14:48.334 --> 00:14:50.734
What? You mean they don't like her family lineage?

232
00:14:50.734 --> 00:14:53.034
And it seems grandma doesn't like the fact

233
00:14:53.034 --> 00:14:55.034
that she's two years older than him either.

234
00:14:55.034 --> 00:14:58.834
That's nonsense. There's no reason to be mean to her.

235
00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:02.534
Hey, the show's started!

236
00:15:14.734 --> 00:15:18.034
Ran, I'm going to go over that side and watch.

237
00:15:18.034 --> 00:15:19.534
Be careful, okay?

238
00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:28.434
Gosh.

239
00:15:28.434 --> 00:15:31.934
It sure is inconvenient to have a small body at times like these.

240
00:15:36.934 --> 00:15:40.734
That's Ms. Akane and Mr. Takahashi?

241
00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:58.434
"Palace Huis Ten Bosch"

242
00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:10.134
Ms. Akane, you look fantastic.

243
00:16:10.134 --> 00:16:12.034
You can say that again. You look just marvelous.

244
00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:13.834
Ms. Akane, make sure you throw me the bouquet

245
00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:16.734
after the wedding ceremony, okay? Please, promise now.

246
00:16:18.434 --> 00:16:21.234
All right, I'm not sure if I'll be able to aim right,

247
00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:22.934
but I'll try my best.

248
00:16:26.634 --> 00:16:28.934
Only an hour more to go before the wedding.

249
00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:31.534
Ms. Akane is so beautiful!

250
00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:38.934
Hey, Shinya, how about a word to the bride?

251
00:16:38.934 --> 00:16:40.134
Yes.

252
00:16:43.134 --> 00:16:46.034
You look really dazzling.

253
00:16:48.534 --> 00:16:50.234
Talk about hot, hot.

254
00:16:50.234 --> 00:16:52.634
Come on, Sonoko.

255
00:16:52.634 --> 00:16:57.534
Shinya, how unsightly of you to be entranced by your bride.

256
00:16:57.534 --> 00:17:00.234
Stay in your waiting room until it's time for the wedding.

257
00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:03.034
Akane.

258
00:17:03.034 --> 00:17:07.234
I will take on the role of the bride's father.

259
00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:08.834
Thank you so...

260
00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:17.334
It's your foot, mister. I think you stepped on this.

261
00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:19.634
Is that it?

262
00:17:19.634 --> 00:17:22.134
I'm so sorry, really sorry.

263
00:17:27.534 --> 00:17:30.834
This picture, are they your parents, Ms. Akane?

264
00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.034
Yes.

265
00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:44.034
Grandma!

266
00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:49.234
-Grandma! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

267
00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:51.734
I'll get better after a little rest.

268
00:17:51.734 --> 00:17:54.034
Here. Grab my shoulder.

269
00:17:54.034 --> 00:17:55.934
Rest a while till it's time for the ceremony.

270
00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.834
I wonder if Grandma Tae's okay?

271
00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:01.234
I hope it's nothing serious.

272
00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:09.234
I'm fine.

273
00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:10.434
But...

274
00:18:24.234 --> 00:18:25.934
What's the matter, Conan?

275
00:18:25.934 --> 00:18:28.834
Ms. Akane, do you have the ring?

276
00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:31.434
No.

277
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.234
The ring is gone.

278
00:18:40.234 --> 00:18:42.134
The ring really is...

279
00:18:42.134 --> 00:18:44.534
It's gone!

280
00:18:46.234 --> 00:18:47.934
What's this?

281
00:18:49.534 --> 00:18:51.334
You're in it, Ms. Akane.

282
00:18:51.334 --> 00:18:52.534
Look.

283
00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:55.034
If I remember correctly,

284
00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:58.234
this is a picture that Shinya took for me

285
00:18:58.234 --> 00:19:01.134
when we came to reserve this wedding hall in June.

286
00:19:01.134 --> 00:19:02.734
What does this mean?

287
00:19:02.734 --> 00:19:03.934
Beats me.

288
00:19:06.234 --> 00:19:11.034
If I lose that ring, how am I going to take responsibility for it?

289
00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:12.934
I know I can't simply apologize.

290
00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:15.534
Ms. Akane, what're you talking about?

291
00:19:15.534 --> 00:19:18.034
It's just a ring after all.

292
00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:22.034
Let's all look for it!

293
00:19:41.134 --> 00:19:45.234
What? The ruby ring is lost?

294
00:19:48.634 --> 00:19:50.234
Is that true?

295
00:19:50.234 --> 00:19:51.634
Yes.

296
00:19:53.934 --> 00:19:55.434
Call the wedding off!

297
00:19:56.734 --> 00:19:59.034
We're calling off this wedding.

298
00:19:59.034 --> 00:20:03.234
-What? -There will be no wedding until the ring is found.

299
00:20:03.234 --> 00:20:05.234
We can't do that now.

300
00:20:05.234 --> 00:20:07.534
Come now, mother dear.

301
00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:11.134
Think about it, Masayo.

302
00:20:11.134 --> 00:20:13.134
Ever since talk of this wedding came around,

303
00:20:13.134 --> 00:20:15.534
bad things have been happening one after the other.

304
00:20:15.534 --> 00:20:18.534
And that girl's to blame for everything.

305
00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:22.934
To top things off, she loses the ring, which is a family treasure.

306
00:20:22.934 --> 00:20:25.434
It's not Akane's fault!

307
00:20:27.734 --> 00:20:32.034
What is Akane doing right now?

308
00:20:32.034 --> 00:20:34.734
She says she wants to be alone and is in the waiting room.

309
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.234
I see. She must be in shock.

310
00:20:38.234 --> 00:20:41.734
Everyone, it's almost time for the ceremony to begin.

311
00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.634
Is something wrong?

312
00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:46.034
The ruby ring is lost.

313
00:20:46.034 --> 00:20:50.934
What? You mean that ring that the founder brought back from Europe?

314
00:20:50.934 --> 00:20:54.734
It was definitely there until all of you came.

315
00:20:56.134 --> 00:20:59.234
Hey, Shinya, just what are you trying to say?

316
00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:02.634
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

317
00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.634
When Sonoko and her friends came,

318
00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:07.334
she says she was sure the ring was there.

319
00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:09.834
This means it has to be the work of somebody

320
00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:11.334
who came into the room later, isn't it?

321
00:21:12.334 --> 00:21:16.234
It could be that glass craftsman from Hotaru called Takahashi.

322
00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:20.034
This picture was left behind in place of the ring.

323
00:21:20.034 --> 00:21:22.334
Since Shinya is the one who took this picture,

324
00:21:22.334 --> 00:21:25.334
anybody from the Ohga family

325
00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:28.534
could've got hold of it, isn't it?

326
00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:30.834
You can't really tell.

327
00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:34.034
Akane had the picture too, didn't she?

328
00:21:34.034 --> 00:21:37.934
She could've stolen the ring and left the picture behind

329
00:21:37.934 --> 00:21:40.534
to make it look as if someone from the Ohga family took it, right?

330
00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.434
That's nonsense.

331
00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:44.134
Well, no big deal.

332
00:21:45.134 --> 00:21:49.134
It doesn't feel good being suspected anyway

333
00:21:49.134 --> 00:21:52.834
so let's have them check every nook and cranny of our rooms right away.

334
00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:55.834
However, so long as the whereabouts of the ring is unknown,

335
00:21:55.834 --> 00:21:58.534
this marriage will be cancelled, understand?

336
00:22:15.398 --> 00:22:18.098
The ring's nowhere in sight.

337
00:22:18.098 --> 00:22:21.998
It's so small that it can be hidden anywhere, too.

338
00:22:21.998 --> 00:22:23.798
Right, Ran?

339
00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:25.098
What's the matter, Ran?

340
00:22:25.098 --> 00:22:28.198
I'm worried, so I'm going to go see how Ms. Akane is.

341
00:22:28.198 --> 00:22:29.198
Ran!

342
00:22:31.498 --> 00:22:33.298
What are the bad things that happened

343
00:22:33.298 --> 00:22:35.198
that grandma was talking about?

344
00:22:35.198 --> 00:22:37.398
Oh, that.

345
00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:40.098
Recently, there were two incidents

346
00:22:40.098 --> 00:22:41.998
where we experienced close calls.

347
00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:49.898
Madam, the brakes aren't working!

348
00:22:59.798 --> 00:23:01.598
Madam!

349
00:23:04.398 --> 00:23:07.898
The second time was on a clear, fine morning.

350
00:23:07.898 --> 00:23:10.998
When I was taking a walk with grandma along Holland Slope near our house.

351
00:23:14.398 --> 00:23:15.498
Look out!

352
00:23:17.598 --> 00:23:20.698
Well, we were saved by a hairsbreadth,

353
00:23:20.698 --> 00:23:23.998
but losing the ring is the third bad thing that happened,

354
00:23:23.998 --> 00:23:26.498
so Grandma Tae is probably fed up.

355
00:23:26.498 --> 00:23:27.698
Goodness.

356
00:23:30.698 --> 00:23:32.898
Ms. Akane, this is Ran.

357
00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:37.998
Ms. Akane.

358
00:23:48.598 --> 00:23:49.798
It's strange.

359
00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:53.998
I'm sure that someone who came into the waiting room took it.

360
00:23:53.998 --> 00:23:55.698
Sonoko!

361
00:23:58.998 --> 00:24:00.498
Ran.

362
00:24:01.598 --> 00:24:04.098
Ms. Akane is not in the waiting room!

363
00:24:04.098 --> 00:24:05.098
What?

364
00:24:06.798 --> 00:24:08.898
The wedding dress was on the chair

365
00:24:08.898 --> 00:24:10.898
and Ms. Akane was nowhere in sight.

366
00:24:10.898 --> 00:24:15.498
Don't tell me that Ms. Akane put on an act just as Ms. Mika had said,

367
00:24:15.498 --> 00:24:17.698
and actually stole the ring herself?

368
00:24:17.698 --> 00:24:20.198
Akane's not that kind of person!

369
00:24:21.198 --> 00:24:23.998
Let's go look for her.

370
00:24:23.998 --> 00:24:25.798
But what about the ring?

371
00:24:25.798 --> 00:24:27.998
Without it, there'll be no wedding.

372
00:24:29.598 --> 00:24:34.198
I'm really bothered about the Hydrangea in the picture.

373
00:24:34.198 --> 00:24:36.898
Hydrangeas signify "A change of heart".

374
00:24:36.898 --> 00:24:40.698
I think we'll find the ring in a place where the Hydrangeas are.

375
00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:44.198
Mr. Shinya, what's with the wedding?

376
00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:48.798
Well, Ms. Akane disappeared.

377
00:24:48.798 --> 00:24:52.198
What? The bride's gone?

378
00:24:52.198 --> 00:24:53.498
Yes.

379
00:24:53.498 --> 00:24:56.898
We were just thinking of splitting up and looking for her.

380
00:24:56.898 --> 00:24:58.998
I'll help look for her, too.

381
00:24:58.998 --> 00:25:00.098
Thank you.

382
00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:01.598
I'll go look for the ring.

383
00:25:05.898 --> 00:25:09.798
Hydrangeas. Where do I look for them?

384
00:25:10.598 --> 00:25:12.298
Ms. Akane!

385
00:25:13.098 --> 00:25:15.298
Ms. Akane!

386
00:25:18.398 --> 00:25:21.598
Hydrangea... Change of heart...

387
00:25:21.598 --> 00:25:23.198
Music box?

388
00:25:23.198 --> 00:25:24.498
Change of heart...

389
00:25:24.498 --> 00:25:25.998
Siebold...

390
00:25:25.998 --> 00:25:28.798
Wait a second. I learned of it before.

391
00:25:28.798 --> 00:25:32.798
Dr. Siebold is the one who took Japanese plants back to Europe.

392
00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:37.298
And, one of the main ones was the Hydrangea.

393
00:25:41.798 --> 00:25:46.198
The old scientific name for this flower is Hydrangea otakusa.

394
00:25:46.198 --> 00:25:50.898
The name was taken from Siebold's Japanese wife's name, Otaki.

395
00:25:51.998 --> 00:25:53.998
So, that's the story.

396
00:25:55.198 --> 00:25:56.898
Hold on.

397
00:25:56.898 --> 00:25:59.098
Could it be that Ms. Akane's picture was not about

398
00:25:59.098 --> 00:26:00.298
what the flower signified, but...

399
00:26:04.198 --> 00:26:06.098
Otakusa. "Otaki-san".

400
00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:07.698
"Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

401
00:26:07.698 --> 00:26:09.198
Right!

402
00:26:57.398 --> 00:26:58.698
I found it!

403
00:27:01.598 --> 00:27:04.098
"Otaki-san". "Taki". (Taki means waterfall in Japanese)

404
00:27:04.098 --> 00:27:05.098
My goodness.

405
00:27:05.998 --> 00:27:08.498
I don't know who hid it, but...

406
00:27:10.698 --> 00:27:12.598
I get it.

407
00:27:12.598 --> 00:27:15.798
This fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

408
00:27:16.498 --> 00:27:18.198
Ran!

409
00:27:18.198 --> 00:27:19.398
Conan!

410
00:27:19.398 --> 00:27:20.798
I found the ring!

411
00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:22.598
Really?

412
00:27:22.598 --> 00:27:24.398
Is something the matter?

413
00:27:24.398 --> 00:27:26.098
Well...

414
00:27:29.598 --> 00:27:31.098
This is...

415
00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:33.298
Ms. Akane's high heel shoe!

416
00:27:33.298 --> 00:27:37.298
It's not normal for her to go around with just one shoe.

417
00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:40.198
I'm sure that she was kidnapped here.

418
00:27:40.198 --> 00:27:42.798
We find the ring.

419
00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:44.598
And now Ms. Akane's kidnapped?
