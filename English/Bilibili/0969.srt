Let's get something to eat.

10
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.900
Someplace I can get a drink.

11
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.490
What? But it's still early.

12
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.110
We've experienced enough
of Kanazawa's history.

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.480
Let's taste Kanazawa's food next.

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.110
Nope. We'll have lunch after
we've done some more sightseeing.

15
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.710
No. Food comes first.

16
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.960
Sightseeing!

17
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.170
Food!

18
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.010
What do you want to do?

19
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.810
Huh?

20
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.970
Oh, uh...

21
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.540
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.220
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

23
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.460
Dining or sightseeing? This is Kanazawa!

24
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.350
Cases and new encounters
can be found in spades!

25
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.880
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.570
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.950

Ow!

33
00:03:36.447 --> 00:03:38.567
Excuse me.

34
00:03:41.717 --> 00:03:42.717
Are you hurt?

35
00:03:43.617 --> 00:03:44.157
Hayashi Mari (23)

36
00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.657
No, I'm fine. Thank you.
Hayashi Mari (23)

37
00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:46.827
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

38
00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:51.937
Your clothes are dirty.

39
00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:53.837
Don't worry about it.

40
00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:56.617
But they look expensive.

41
00:03:57.107 --> 00:04:00.247
I won't be wearing it again. It's fine.

42
00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:03.177
What a waste. Why not?

43
00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:07.687
Because it's embarrassing to wear
the same outfit over and over.

44
00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:12.637
This is a pretty heavy bag.

45
00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.187
What's in it?

46
00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:18.777
How rude of you to ask a lady
about the contents of her bag.

47
00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:21.157
I'm sorry...

48
00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:25.547
By the way, I'm trying to get to Yamanakaza.

49
00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:27.457
Tell me the way.

50
00:04:29.187 --> 00:04:30.347
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:34.337
We're here sightseeing and don't
know exactly how to get there.

52
00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.087
How useless.

53
00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:37.977
What?

54
00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:41.467
Then why don't you take a taxi?

55
00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:44.467
If you tell them where you're going,
they'll probably take you there.

56
00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:46.737
A taxi?

57
00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:49.237
Huh? Is something wrong?

58
00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:53.607
Where can I get a taxi? I've
never ridden one before.

59
00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:54.577
What?

60
00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:03.617
Take us to Yamanakaza.

61
00:05:03.857 --> 00:05:04.767
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:07.367
Is this enough of a tip?

63
00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:10.087
Seriously?

64
00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:12.667
You're not traveling overseas.

65
00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.377
You don't need to tip him.

66
00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:15.807
Oh, really?

67
00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:21.337
Aw, shucks.

68
00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:26.607
If we had that 10 thousand yen, we
could've eaten a luxurious lunch today.

69
00:05:26.607 --> 00:05:28.887
Don't be stupid.

70
00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:33.867
She's even more of a
pampered lady than Sonoko.

We should meet up with your dad soon.

74
00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:03.587
He said he'd get something
light to eat on his own.

75
00:06:03.587 --> 00:06:06.777
He has absolutely no patience.

76
00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:11.887
Someone help!

77
00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:13.187
Isn't that...?

78
00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.067
I'm stuffed.

79
00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:19.567
Mister, catch that man!

80
00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:21.377
He's a thief!

81
00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:22.197
What?!

82
00:06:33.347 --> 00:06:35.167
Dad, are you okay?

83
00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:37.567
Ow...

84
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:40.277
This bag is pretty heavy.

85
00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:41.667
What's in it?

86
00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:42.797
What?!

87
00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:53.177
Thank you for getting it back from him.

88
00:06:53.387 --> 00:06:54.437
No problem.

89
00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:57.687
By the way, why are you
carrying so much cash?

90
00:06:58.607 --> 00:06:59.647
I...

91
00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.667
Oh, no. The time!

92
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:08.277
She left.

93
00:07:08.947 --> 00:07:11.617
I wonder why she had all that money.

94
00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.017
Who knows?

95
00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:14.747
She's a rich girl.

96
00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:19.127
I'm sure it's not uncommon for her
to carry around a few million yen.

97
00:07:19.127 --> 00:07:21.127
Without a bodyguard?

98
00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:24.497
What do I know about being rich?

99
00:07:28.017 --> 00:07:29.867
She's back.

100
00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:35.687
Huh? She doesn't have her bag with her.

101
00:07:36.097 --> 00:07:37.437
You're right.

102
00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:40.437
Hey, what happened to your bag?

103
00:07:40.907 --> 00:07:42.287
I left it.

104
00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:44.717
What? But why?

105
00:07:45.947 --> 00:07:47.947
Why did you leave it?

106
00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:54.197
The truth is, that was ransom money.

107
00:07:56.997 --> 00:07:58.077
Where did you leave it?

108
00:07:58.387 --> 00:07:59.707
In the parking lot.

109
00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:02.367
Where?

110
00:08:04.097 --> 00:08:05.047
Over there.

111
00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:10.507
We're too late.

112
00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:16.747
Good. Now Manabu-san
will be returned safely.

113
00:08:18.857 --> 00:08:20.557
I did the right thing, right?

114
00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:25.067
They'll release the hostage because
I gave them the money, right?

115
00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:27.067
No. It's possible that...

116
00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:29.697
What?

117
00:08:29.917 --> 00:08:33.277
It's possible the culprit has
no further use for the hostage,

118
00:08:33.277 --> 00:08:35.947
and no reason to leave them alive.

119
00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.517
But...

120
00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.127
Ran, call the police.

121
00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:41.967
Okay.

122
00:08:51.837 --> 00:08:54.887
Why didn't you call the police?

123
00:08:55.057 --> 00:08:57.337
Hayashi Soichi (52)
Hayashi Draper President

124
00:08:57.337 --> 00:08:58.527
We simply followed the culprit's instructions.

125
00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:00.267
We simply followed the culprit's instructions.

126
00:09:00.437 --> 00:09:00.717
Kaede Yuko (40)
Hayashi Draper Accountant

127
00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:02.227
We did our duty.
Kaede Yuko (40)
Hayashi Draper Accountant

128
00:09:02.227 --> 00:09:03.857
Sir, please calm down.
Kaede Yuko (40)
Hayashi Draper Accountant

129
00:09:03.857 --> 00:09:04.947
Sir, please calm down.

130
00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:06.317
You're just an accountant.

131
00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:08.527
How dare you talk back to the president?

132
00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:09.837
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:11.607 --> 00:09:13.697
This is Saikawa Manabu-san.

134
00:09:15.457 --> 00:09:17.697
When was this sent to you?

135
00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:21.037
It was sent to the office
around 10 this morning.

136
00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:23.207
And you received the
kidnapping call then, too?

137
00:09:23.207 --> 00:09:24.317
That's right.

138
00:09:24.837 --> 00:09:27.757
Manabu-san is all right, isn't he?

139
00:09:29.087 --> 00:09:32.717
Two hours have passed since the
ransom money was handed off.

140
00:09:33.517 --> 00:09:36.257
It's hard to be optimistic
given the circumstances.

141
00:09:36.257 --> 00:09:37.627
No...

142
00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:42.137
I'm having the police review the security
camera footage from the parking lot.

143
00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:47.647
The culprit who carried off the
ransom money should be visible.

144
00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:51.777
But we're already one step behind.

145
00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:56.957
Even if we find evidence that leads
us to the culprit, by that time...

146
00:09:57.617 --> 00:09:59.407
I did nothing wrong.

147
00:09:59.617 --> 00:10:01.657
Anyway, who are you?

148
00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:06.287
Me? I'm Mori Kogoro.

149
00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:08.807
Oh, I've heard of you.

150
00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:11.417
You're a famous detective from Tokyo.

151
00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:13.297
The something Kogoro.

152
00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:15.387
I believe it was...

153
00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:18.627
Yes, that's right. The Drunk Kogoro.

154
00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:23.097
Well, she's not wrong.

155
00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:26.637
You're wrong. It's the Sleeping Kogoro.

156
00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:30.437
Sir.

157
00:10:31.947 --> 00:10:34.737
Rintaro, where have you been?

158
00:10:35.147 --> 00:10:36.987
I'm sorry. I was busy.

159
00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:37.537
Hagino Rintaro (34)

160
00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.987
Is the master all right?
Hagino Rintaro (34)

161
00:10:40.197 --> 00:10:41.667
We don't know yet.

162
00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:42.867
Who is he?

163
00:10:42.867 --> 00:10:44.507
Manabu's apprentice.

164
00:10:44.507 --> 00:10:46.247
Apprentice of what?

165
00:10:46.557 --> 00:10:48.217
Printed silks.

166
00:10:48.217 --> 00:10:52.507
I see. Is the hostage a
printed silk maker as well?

167
00:10:52.717 --> 00:10:56.007
Yes. He used to be a famous
artisan around here.

168
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:59.507
Used to be? Is he not anymore?

169
00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:00.617
No.

170
00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:03.337
Recently he had an accident
in the storage shed.

171
00:11:03.337 --> 00:11:05.517
He lost the use of his dominant hand.

172
00:11:14.137 --> 00:11:16.407
He was forced to give up his practice.

173
00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:18.657
That must be difficult.

174
00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:22.957
Right now his safety comes first.

175
00:11:22.957 --> 00:11:25.117
Is there anything we can do?

176
00:11:26.137 --> 00:11:30.167
Unfortunately, for now we can
only pray for his safety.

177
00:11:37.787 --> 00:11:39.557
It could be the culprit.

178
00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:41.557
Try to converse with them calmly.

179
00:11:45.217 --> 00:11:46.187
Hello?

180
00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:48.937
Sir, it's me.

181
00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:50.937
Manabu? Is that you, Manabu?

182
00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:07.174
I understand.

183
00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:11.584
After being released by the culprit,

184
00:12:11.584 --> 00:12:15.674
Manabu ran to a nearby police box
and was taken into their custody.

185
00:12:16.044 --> 00:12:18.514
Then Manabu-san is all right?

186
00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:20.554
Yes. He seems to be doing well.

187
00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:25.684
He'll return here after being
questioned by the police.

188
00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:39.204
Manabu-san!

189
00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:42.894
I'm glad you're all right.

190
00:12:42.894 --> 00:12:45.454
Master, I'm glad you're safe.

191
00:12:45.624 --> 00:12:45.924
Saikawa Manabu (55)

192
00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:48.544
I'm sorry for making everyone worry.
Saikawa Manabu (55)

193
00:12:48.544 --> 00:12:48.704
I'm sorry for making everyone worry.

194
00:12:49.154 --> 00:12:51.714
Your clothes are dirty. Change into these.

195
00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:53.714
Thank you.

196
00:12:54.454 --> 00:12:58.264
Sir, I'm sorry for the
inconvenience I caused.

197
00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:02.724
How could you inconvenience us?
You're a plague on this company.

198
00:13:03.184 --> 00:13:07.894
Dad, Manabu-san didn't ask to be kidnapped.

199
00:13:08.114 --> 00:13:10.314
Yes, but...

200
00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:14.774
The president can't talk back to
Mari-chan because he adores her.

201
00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:18.154
Although it's a different story
when it comes to boyfriends.

202
00:13:18.704 --> 00:13:22.164
So she's your typical sheltered daughter.

203
00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:29.534
Excuse the interruption, but Manabu-san,
I'm glad you're all right.

204
00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:30.704
Who are you?

205
00:13:31.104 --> 00:13:34.324
I'm Mori Kogoro, a detective.

206
00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:35.654
A detective?

207
00:13:35.654 --> 00:13:38.964
I heard the kidnapper hasn't been caught yet.

208
00:13:39.314 --> 00:13:41.504
I'll help in any way I can.

209
00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:45.644
But I was blindfolded the whole time.

210
00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:47.704
I didn't see the culprit's face.

211
00:13:47.704 --> 00:13:50.044
Do you recall their voice?

212
00:13:50.044 --> 00:13:53.734
No. They used some kind
of device to modify it.

213
00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:56.734
So we have no clues to
the culprit's identity.

214
00:13:57.024 --> 00:13:59.254
You truly are useless.

215
00:13:59.974 --> 00:14:01.114
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:01.344 --> 00:14:04.864
Manabu-san, where and
when were you kidnapped?

217
00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:08.874
I believe it was around nine this morning.

218
00:14:08.874 --> 00:14:11.294
I think I was on my way to the office.

219
00:14:11.594 --> 00:14:17.504
Maybe that means the culprit was
familiar with your regular routine.

220
00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:22.324
If that's true, then it's possible
the kidnapper is an acquaintance.

221
00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:25.294
And it's possible they used a voice changer

222
00:14:25.294 --> 00:14:28.644
because Manabu-san would've been
very familiar with their voice.

223
00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:35.894
You think we did it?

224
00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:39.244
We're just discussing possibilities.

225
00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:42.904
By the way, where were you
around nine this morning?

226
00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:46.014
I was still in bed.

227
00:14:46.014 --> 00:14:48.344
Can anyone verify that?

228
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:54.334
I saw Mari-chan sleeping.

229
00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:58.174
Her door was open while I was cleaning
this morning, and I caught a glimpse of her.

230
00:14:59.224 --> 00:15:02.044
I was preparing for work at the workshop.

231
00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:05.054
I met Yuko-san when she came to clean.

232
00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.984
That's right.

233
00:15:06.984 --> 00:15:11.294
Which means you're able to
verify each other's stories.

234
00:15:11.294 --> 00:15:13.174
You all have alibis.

235
00:15:13.694 --> 00:15:15.314
Sir, what about you?

236
00:15:15.754 --> 00:15:19.254
I was passed out drunk.

237
00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.574
Yuko-san, did you see the president?

238
00:15:22.894 --> 00:15:23.734
No.

239
00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:27.824
In other words, you have no
one to verify your alibi.

240
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.624
W-Wait a minute.

241
00:15:29.624 --> 00:15:34.814
Maybe so, but we were right here when
the ransom money was handed off.

242
00:15:34.814 --> 00:15:36.374
We couldn't have done it.

243
00:15:37.164 --> 00:15:38.874
That's true.

244
00:15:38.874 --> 00:15:42.504
Which means the culprit is
someone not currently present.

245
00:15:43.634 --> 00:15:46.704
Mari, don't you think he's suspicious?

246
00:15:46.704 --> 00:15:48.114
He who?

247
00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.514
That nasty pest that keeps bugging Mari.

248
00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:53.784
Don't say that about him.

249
00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:56.204
Takumi-san is my boyfriend.

250
00:15:57.214 --> 00:15:59.024
I'll never accept it.

251
00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:01.524
In any case, tell him to
come here immediately!

252
00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:15.834
Mari, why did you want me to come to...

253
00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:20.424
Are you Kondo Takumi-san?

254
00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:21.424
Kondo Takumi (24)
Mari's Boyfriend

255
00:16:21.424 --> 00:16:23.504
Yeah. What's all this?
Kondo Takumi (24)
Mari's Boyfriend

256
00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.174
Yeah. What's all this?

257
00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:26.304
You're the culprit, aren't you?

258
00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:29.054
What? What are you talking about?

259
00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:30.524
Don't play dumb!

260
00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:34.304
You're the one who kidnapped Manabu
and took my 30 million yen!

261
00:16:34.564 --> 00:16:38.484
You're accusing me of
kidnapping? Give me a break.

262
00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:40.614
He's right. That's awful.

263
00:16:40.614 --> 00:16:45.274
You only approached Mari for my money,
and you're still playing dumb?

264
00:16:45.574 --> 00:16:47.534
It's not like that.

265
00:16:47.534 --> 00:16:50.164
I'm with Mari because I love her.

266
00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:55.394
Kondo-san, where were you
this morning at nine?

267
00:16:55.394 --> 00:16:57.044
This morning?

268
00:16:57.514 --> 00:16:59.744
I was still asleep.

269
00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:02.284
Can anyone verify that?

270
00:17:02.284 --> 00:17:05.174
I live alone. Of course not.

271
00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:07.504
You don't have an alibi!

272
00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:09.404
So it was you!

273
00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:10.724
Give me my money back!

274
00:17:10.724 --> 00:17:12.184
Hey, calm down!

275
00:17:14.024 --> 00:17:15.434
Are you all right?

276
00:17:15.864 --> 00:17:18.684
I'm feeling a bit exhausted.

277
00:17:19.124 --> 00:17:21.934
You were held captive. It's no surprise.

278
00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:25.064
You should rest for a while.

279
00:17:25.394 --> 00:17:26.724
Excuse me.

280
00:17:26.724 --> 00:17:29.444
I'll take you home.

281
00:17:30.084 --> 00:17:31.344
Thank you.

282
00:17:33.304 --> 00:17:36.584
I'm so glad Manabu-san didn't
have a single scratch on him.

283
00:17:37.154 --> 00:17:41.114
Since he was tied up, I was
worried he'd been assaulted.

284
00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:51.304
Yamashiro Hot Springs Kosoyu

285
00:17:51.594 --> 00:17:54.434
Hattori Shrine

286
00:18:05.514 --> 00:18:07.444
What are you planning to do with the money?

287
00:18:10.104 --> 00:18:11.574
What are you doing here?

288
00:18:11.914 --> 00:18:14.654
We followed you.

289
00:18:14.654 --> 00:18:16.444
Why?

290
00:18:16.444 --> 00:18:22.834
I noticed you were lying
about the kidnapping.

291
00:18:23.114 --> 00:18:26.844
That money you're holding proves it!

292
00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:29.464
I just happened to find this.

293
00:18:29.464 --> 00:18:31.264
Don't lie to me!

294
00:18:31.264 --> 00:18:34.134
You made up the whole kidnapping!

295
00:18:34.134 --> 00:18:36.394
I didn't do that.

296
00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:40.104
Why aren't there any rope
burns on your hands?

297
00:18:40.104 --> 00:18:42.144
Weren't both of your hands tied?

298
00:18:42.494 --> 00:18:45.154
They just disappeared because
some time has passed.

299
00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:48.814
No. You were never tied
up in the first place.

300
00:18:49.244 --> 00:18:54.924
If you look closely at this photo, you
can see your back reflected in it.

301
00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:59.204
You're just holding your hands
behind you. You're not tied up.

302
00:19:01.894 --> 00:19:08.004
It's too bad, but you can't
deceive the eyes of Mori Kogoro.

303
00:19:08.404 --> 00:19:11.304
I'm the one who noticed that.

304
00:19:11.304 --> 00:19:14.574
It just looks that way because of the light.

305
00:19:14.574 --> 00:19:20.004
Mister, did you know everyone's ears are
a different shape, just like fingerprints?

306
00:19:20.004 --> 00:19:22.314
What? What are you talking about?

307
00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:26.834
The security cameras caught the culprit
carrying off the ransom money.

308
00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:31.474
Their face is disguised,
but their ears are visible.

309
00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:36.704
If their shape matches yours, then
we'll know if you're the kidnapper.

310
00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:39.204
Or will you still make excuses?

311
00:19:42.484 --> 00:19:45.324
Manabu, you're unbelievable.

312
00:19:45.324 --> 00:19:47.834
How could you repay my kindness like this?

313
00:19:48.184 --> 00:19:50.414
This is your fault!

314
00:19:50.414 --> 00:19:52.844
You withheld my retirement pay!

315
00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:56.054
You can tell the police all about it.

316
00:19:56.054 --> 00:19:58.724
Damn it! I'm not being arrested!

317
00:20:08.604 --> 00:20:09.694
Stop!

318
00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:13.114
Dad, are you okay?

319
00:20:14.164 --> 00:20:16.444
This is the weight of 30 million yen.

320
00:20:16.974 --> 00:20:19.114
Don't be stupid.

321
00:20:29.584 --> 00:20:30.374
It's so good.

322
00:20:30.704 --> 00:20:33.514
Dad, mind your manners.

323
00:20:34.414 --> 00:20:39.134
Thank you for treating us
to such a luxurious meal.

324
00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:42.254
My 30 million yen was returned to me.

325
00:20:42.254 --> 00:20:44.144
This is nothing.

326
00:20:44.434 --> 00:20:47.104
But Manabu-san escaped.

327
00:20:47.864 --> 00:20:49.874
The local police are looking for him.

328
00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.154
It's a matter of time before he's caught.

329
00:20:52.734 --> 00:20:54.274
Damn that Manabu.

330
00:20:54.774 --> 00:20:57.224
I'll clock him good when they arrest him.

331
00:20:57.784 --> 00:21:02.164
By the way, Manabu-san mentioned something
about his retirement pay when he ran.

332
00:21:02.164 --> 00:21:03.164
What was that about?

333
00:21:03.524 --> 00:21:09.434
He was probably talking about how my dad
reduced Manabu-san's retirement pay.

334
00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.414
Really?

335
00:21:10.954 --> 00:21:13.824
He got himself injured and then quit.

336
00:21:13.824 --> 00:21:16.944
But didn't he get injured on the job?

337
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.984
You're just a kid! What do you know?

338
00:21:18.984 --> 00:21:22.634
I'm the one who suffered
losses from his injury!

339
00:21:23.104 --> 00:21:25.184
S-Sorry...

340
00:21:26.724 --> 00:21:29.734
Good night.

341
00:21:31.334 --> 00:21:32.814
I'm stuffed.

342
00:21:32.814 --> 00:21:34.654
A lot happened today.

343
00:21:34.654 --> 00:21:36.044
Yeah.

344
00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:38.794
The rest is the police's job.

345
00:21:38.794 --> 00:21:43.294
Let's go home, get some sleep, and
go sightseeing again tomorrow.

346
00:21:43.294 --> 00:21:44.244
Yeah.

347
00:21:44.244 --> 00:21:47.634
But before returning to the hotel, let's
get some ramen to round off the night!

348
00:21:47.634 --> 00:21:50.074
What?! You're going to eat more?

349
00:21:50.074 --> 00:21:51.804
Of course!

350
00:21:53.874 --> 00:21:54.964
Let's go!

351
00:22:01.474 --> 00:22:03.554
Why is this happening?

352
00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:06.394
I just wanted my money.

353
00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:24.204
You think you'll get away with this?

354
