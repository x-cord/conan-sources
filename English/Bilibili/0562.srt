1
00:00:03,324 --> 00:00:05,224
Anytime, anywhere.

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:08,224
Whenever and wherever, Nijimura is the bag.

3
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:11,424
Wet with water, no problem.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,124
Bash, struck or hit, worry not!

5
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,324
Anytime! Anywhere!

6
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,024
Whenever and wherever,

7
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,824
you need a bag.

8
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,324
Get Nijimura!

9
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,524
Anytime! Anywhere!

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,924
Whenever and wherever, Nijimura is the bag.

11
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,024
Are Nijimura bags really selling that well?

12
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,924
Yeah. It's their rainbow colored trademark

13
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,224
that makes them so popular!

14
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:38,624
This is that popular?

15
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:42,124
Besides, Nijimura bags are very sturdy

16
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:44,024
and highly waterproof.

17
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:48,324
See. This zipper is said to be the same kind

18
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:50,124
that is used for scuba diving suits.

19
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:52,024
Even if you drop it into the water,

20
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:54,324
the contents inside don't get wet.

21
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,624
However, no doubt this is a celebrity brand,

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,524
there's one too many zeros...

23
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:03,124
No, two more than we can afford!

24
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:06,424
I was hoping to find an affordable pouch,

25
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:07,924
but I guess not.

26
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,224
Not too fast!

27
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:13,224
We've taken on President Nijimura's personal request.

28
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:16,524
If succeed seeing it through, pouch or poncho,

29
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:18,124
I'll buy you all you want!

30
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:21,924
They don't carry ponchos, you know.

31
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,824
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

32
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,024
President Nijimura should be here in a moment.

33
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:27,924
Someone! Help!

34
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,224
What was that?

35
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,124
Conan!

36
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,024
What are you doing?

37
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:36,624
Let me go!

38
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:40,724
Help!

39
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:42,124
President Nijimura!

40
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,124
A kidnapping!

41
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,024
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

42
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:55,624
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

43
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:57,624
Disclose the seven colored mystery

44
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,024
hidden behind rainbow colored bag after the rain.

45
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,724
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:02,624
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,324
No cases is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

48
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:54,963
"Rainbow Colored Kidnapping"

49
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:09,563
We had roadblocks set up five minute

50
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,463
after the incident occurred,

51
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:13,463
but failed to locate any suspicious vehicles.

52
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,463
Perhaps you misread the plate number?

53
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,063
That's impossible.

54
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:18,563
By the way, you are?

55
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:21,063
"Kenzo Katsuragi, age 45" -I'm Inspector Katsuragi from SID,

56
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:23,663
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

57
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,163
SID?

58
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,963
First division of the police headquarters,

59
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:30,063
the Special Investigation Department.

60
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,763
It's a section for handling hostage situations

61
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:34,763
such as kidnappings or hijackings.

62
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:38,263
Oh, you know a lot, don't you, sonny?

63
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:41,863
But then, why is a kid like you in a place like this?

64
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:46,063
I also witnessed the crime scene, so...

65
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:49,663
I'm sorry, we won't interfere with your work.

66
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:52,863
Detective, may I ask you to leave?

67
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,663
Investigating kidnapping for ransom is our job.

68
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,663
But we can't be sure

69
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,963
that this is a kidnapping case asking for ransom.

70
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:00,963
No, it's been confirmed.

71
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,563
"Saki Nijimura, age 35"

72
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:06,963
This was inside our mailbox.

73
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,163
Excuse me, but you are?

74
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:11,763
I'm Nijimura's wife, my name is Saki.

75
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:14,263
I'm the vice president of the company.

76
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:15,563
Allow me...

77
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,563
We have President Nijimura.

78
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:23,863
If you want him released,

79
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:27,163
put 100 million yen in a Nijimura handbag

80
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,663
and have Saki carry it.

81
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,663
At precisely 2.00pm, go to Touto Ikebukuro Station

82
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:34,063
and board the Blue Sky express train,

83
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,763
have her get off at the last stop, Okuho Station.

84
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,763
However, anytime, anywhere,

85
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:42,563
we will be watching closely.

86
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:46,563
If we see any authorities, the hostage will die.

87
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,263
From Black Rainbow?

88
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,263
Darn those jerks.

89
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:56,363
A hundred million yen ransom?

90
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,163
Any idea who they might be?

91
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:01,463
To tell the truth...

92
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:06,163
We've always had problems with copied products of our brand.

93
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:08,863
We have just began filing a lawsuit.

94
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:12,863
It could be that companies like those

95
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,863
have a grudge against you, because of this.

96
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:18,263
It's plausible, since that anytime, anywhere in the ransom note

97
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:21,263
is Nijimura's catch phrase.

98
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:23,563
And also the name with black added

99
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:26,663
in front of rainbow trademark.

100
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:29,363
It's something that an illegal copy business would do.

101
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:30,663
Stop right there.

102
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,463
We will take over the investigation,

103
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,763
so leave immediately.

104
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:36,563
Hold it. Detective Mouri was actually contacted by my husband

105
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,263
to collect evidence pertaining to the lawsuit.

106
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:43,263
I'm also afraid to carry that much money all by myself,

107
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,763
so I'd like him to be my bodyguard.

108
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:47,263
Just count on me!

109
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,063
Allow me to carry it outside.

110
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,963
Oh, no, thanks.

111
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,963
Worry not! Anytime, anywhere...

112
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:12,763
"Touto Ikebukuro Station Inbound, Blue Sky express train"

113
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:19,463
Hey, why do you guys have to come?

114
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:22,963
As camouflage, didn't you say so yourself, Dad?

115
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:25,563
Yeah! Hiking...

116
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,863
Anytime, anywhere.

117
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,263
We don't know when or where the culprit may appear.

118
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:54,963
Understood.

119
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:15,063
Next stop is the last stop, Okuho Station...

120
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:16,663
You may transfer to the Koushu Express Line

121
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,963
or the Touto Okuho Line.

122
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:23,063
"Okuho Station"

123
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:40,763
Hey, let's hurry!

124
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:42,063
Oh, yeah...

125
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,663
Hurry up!

126
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:46,363
Yeah, right.

127
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:48,163
Madam, what did the culprit say?

128
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,163
Transfer now.

129
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:51,063
Transfer?

130
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,963
We'll be late for the train!

131
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:30,363
-We barely made it. -Thank goodness.

132
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,763
It would've taken forever to wait for the next train.

133
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,063
You're right.

134
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,563
I'll go this time.

135
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,163
Wow, it's so fast!

136
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:55,163
Let me see that paper.

137
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,363
Transfer to the Touto Okuho Line,

138
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,763
and when you reach the middle of the Nakatoro Bridge,

139
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,863
toss the ransom money bag outside.

140
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,163
What?

141
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,663
"Nakatoro Bridge"

142
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:12,663
This is...

143
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:14,363
What siren is that?

144
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,863
Shoots! The dam's being discharged!

145
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:38,863
What?

146
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,563
Oh, no! Darn, the culprit's plan is...

147
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:51,363
To flush away the bag!

148
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:54,563
I see, so that's why they demanded that the ransom

149
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:57,163
be put in a sturdy and waterproof Nijimura bag.

150
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,463
Darn, what a cunning criminal!

151
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:01,563
Contact the other squads! Downstream!

152
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:02,563
Have them go downstream!

153
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,563
Yes!

154
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:11,663
Are you all right?

155
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,063
Oh, yeah.

156
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,663
I'm sure your husband is fine.

157
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:16,963
Thank you.

158
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:19,563
What's this? What's eating at me?

159
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,863
I have this terrible feeling.

160
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:24,963
You still can't locate the bag?

161
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:28,063
I see, continue the search.

162
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,163
Our transmitter bug planted on the name tag

163
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,863
seems to have been damaged by the water.

164
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,063
Unfortunately, the terrible feeling I had,

165
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:41,163
soon became true.

166
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:43,963
The handbag swept away by the dam,

167
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:47,363
was retrieved at the riverbank five kilometers downstream.

168
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,363
But the 100 million yen inside the bag

169
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:53,963
was apparently taken by the culprit.

170
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,963
All we had left to do was to wait

171
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,763
for the release of the hostage, but...

172
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:01,963
The next morning,

173
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,763
along with the stolen vehicle that was used during the kidnapping,

174
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:08,763
the murdered body of President Nijimura was found.

175
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,963
Darling, why?

176
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,663
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,663
We will do everything we can to apprehend the culprit.

178
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:21,263
You're sorry? You don't even mean it!

179
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,263
It's because they spotted you police

180
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,363
that they killed my husband!

181
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:27,363
No, we didn't expose ourselves.

182
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,163
Madam, please calm down.

183
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:32,463
Then it was you! You were discovered by the culprit!

184
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:33,963
What kind of great detective are you?

185
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,263
No...

186
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,363
Inspector?

187
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:42,563
Regarding your husband's murder,

188
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,763
we've come across new information.

189
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,463
What?

190
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:01,518
The time Nijimura was murdered

191
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:05,618
was determined to be between 11.00am and noon yesterday.

192
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,118
What? He was kidnapped around 10.30am, so...

193
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:12,118
Those jerks! Hostages only get in their way,

194
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,118
so they killed him shortly after kidnapping him.

195
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:17,318
And still worked up the nerve to demand a ransom.

196
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,818
How horrible.

197
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,618
This...

198
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:23,018
You can't, Conan.

199
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:25,218
Why's that kid here?

200
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:28,818
The name tag with the bag is missing.

201
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:32,418
Stay out of this! Here!

202
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:34,218
Sorry about that.

203
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:35,618
Let's go, Conan.

204
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:41,418
At any rate, the culprit is a cold, ruthless and sly.

205
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:43,018
This is a murder case.

206
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:46,918
Katsuragi, we will be joining the investigation from here.

207
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,118
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,718
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Why at a time like this, you may think,

209
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:53,018
but, no, because it is a time like this,

210
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:54,918
I have to respond to the love

211
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,618
and support shown to our Nijimura bags.

212
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:57,918
I hereby vow to work

213
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:00,818
to live up the reputation of the company.

214
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:03,518
And, regarding the fake products

215
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:06,718
that have been troubling our beloved customers,

216
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:09,018
I demand that law enforcement authorities

217
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,518
reinforce efforts to fight copyright infringement

218
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,418
until total annihilation has been achieved!

219
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,418
Where are you going, Dad?

220
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,918
Where else?

221
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,218
Recheck the crime scenes thoroughly.

222
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,418
It's the motto of the police,

223
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,018
no, rather for detectives too!

224
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,618
In that case, I'll go too!

225
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,718
Don't be stupid!

226
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:26,618
How can I work when a kid's with me?

227
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,218
However, I was at the scene from the beginning this time.

228
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,518
If you forget or miss something,

229
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,518
I might be able to pick it up.

230
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:36,518
Don't you dare talk back to me.

231
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:38,118
See, two heads are better than one.

232
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,718
Three heads are better than two.

233
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:43,118
-What? -I was at the scene from the beginning too.

234
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:44,918
So I won't let you leave me behind.

235
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,118
Okay.

236
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:52,118
"Nijimura Office Backdoor"

237
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,218
The incident started here.

238
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:55,918
How scary,

239
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,618
to think that the kidnapping happened right in front of us.

240
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,018
The police set up road blocks immediately,

241
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:07,418
yet they failed to spot the criminal.

242
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,418
Carrying the ransom,

243
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:12,018
Saki boarded the Blue Sky express train.

244
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:16,018
"Okuho Station" -She then transferred here, at Okuho Station.

245
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,818
Most likely, this was the culprit's attempt

246
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,118
to distract the police.

247
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,918
Then, as the train she transferred to,

248
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:26,318
was just about to pass the bridge,

249
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:27,718
she tossed the bag into the river

250
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,218
from the window of the train.

251
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:34,218
That was just when the dam was scheduled to be discharged water.

252
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,318
Thus, the bag was swept away

253
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:38,318
by the increased amount of water and current of the river.

254
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:41,518
When it was finally found at the riverbank five kilometers downstream,

255
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:45,518
the ransom money had already been taken by the culprit.

256
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:53,418
By the way, the name tag that was rigged with the transmitter

257
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,418
wasn't found on the bag, right?

258
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:58,118
The bag tumbled downstream due to the force of the current,

259
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:00,518
so the tag must've fallen off.

260
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:04,118
The discharge from the dam was surprisingly strong.

261
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:06,418
To think it could have pushed a bag weighing ten kilograms

262
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,618
over a distance of five kilometers.

263
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:12,618
Yeah, Saki must've been carrying a lot of weight.

264
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,818
Come to think of it, at that time...

265
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:17,018
Allow me to carry it outside.

266
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,418
Oh, no, thanks, I'll be all right.

267
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:23,518
Don't tell me...

268
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,318
Don't tell me...

269
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,718
The rain stopped.

270
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:31,918
You're right.

271
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:34,018
Hey, look at that!

272
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:35,818
Oh, a rainbow!

273
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:37,018
Beautiful!

274
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:40,518
Red, orange, yellow, green,

275
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:43,118
blue, indigo, violet!

276
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:50,018
I see, so that's what it is!

277
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,018
Hello, Nijimura speaking.

278
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,618
It's me, Kogoro Mouri.

279
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,818
I've figured out who kidnapped and killed your husband.

280
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,518
Are you sure?

281
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:06,218
Your press conference served as a hint.

282
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:10,618
Tomorrow morning, I will reveal the truth at the riverbank

283
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:13,518
under the bridge where the bag was tossed.

284
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:14,618
Bye.

285
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:21,818
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What did you say?

286
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,418
You know who the culprit is?

287
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,818
Really, Inspector?

288
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:28,018
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

289
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:30,118
Under that bridge, you say?

290
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:31,118
Right that!

291
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,818
Now, for the finale.

292
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:03,018
-What? -The wife?

293
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,218
That's the ransom money?

294
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:11,318
But wasn't the bag swept away?

295
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:13,218
Explain this to us, Mr. Mouri.

296
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:17,318
What? Well, I'm the one who wants to ask, Inspector.

297
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:18,718
What exactly do you...

298
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:28,418
The bag we found downstream was a dummy.

299
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:31,118
If you toss the bag into a dam that is discharge,

300
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:35,118
people would think it'd get washed away downstream.

301
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:36,818
That was your diversionary tactic.

302
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,418
Detective Takagi, try emptying the bag.

303
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:42,518
Yes, sir, right away.

304
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,318
This bag...

305
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:51,018
why is it so heavy even when it's empty?

306
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:52,318
What...

307
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:03,718
This is...

308
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:04,918
An iron plate?

309
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,618
Don't tell me...

310
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:10,718
Correct because of the metal weight planted inside the bag,

311
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,318
the bag stayed under the bridge until now.

312
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,618
We have been fooled

313
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:19,318
by the culprit into believing the dummy bag

314
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:22,518
at the downstream riverbank was real.

315
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:23,618
You must've panicked

316
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:27,018
when you heard that I've reveal the truth here tomorrow morning.

317
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:29,718
As such, you came to quickly collect the money.

318
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:33,518
No, the bag that would've otherwise been unnecessary.

319
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,418
Because you didn't want us to find out that the bag downstream,

320
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,218
unlike the bag with ransom money in it,

321
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:42,618
was a fake.

322
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,418
A fake?

323
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:45,818
That bag was?

324
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,318
Although they look alike,

325
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,718
the fake bag has a slightly different color arrangement

326
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:52,918
than the real one.

327
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:53,918
Isn't that right?

328
00:19:56,418 --> 00:20:01,118
This kidnapping case started off strange to begin with.

329
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,018
The kidnapper seated the hostage

330
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:06,318
in the passenger's seat without restraint.

331
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:07,818
In other words, the kidnapping was actually staged

332
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:12,018
by Saki and Mr. Nijimura.

333
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,318
They wanted none other than me,

334
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:18,318
Kogoro Mouri to become a witness.

335
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,118
As to why the kidnapper's car

336
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,218
wasn't caught in your timely roadblock.

337
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,518
It was because they hid themselves

338
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,618
in a parking garage near the scene.

339
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,418
But immediately after that,

340
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:32,718
you killed Nijimura in the garage.

341
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,818
The rest was simply your solo play.

342
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,918
You mailed yourself the ransom note.

343
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,918
Then, you prepared the kidnapper's instructions yourself

344
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:49,818
while you were among the crowd of passengers at the station,

345
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:54,418
and made it look as if the culprit was really there.

346
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:59,618
But Saki, why did you use a fake bag as your dummy?

347
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:01,518
If you used a genuine bat,

348
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:06,218
perhaps your plan wouldn't have been exposed.

349
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:10,018
I could never have done that.

350
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:14,518
Nijimura's products are my adorable children.

351
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:16,218
So...

352
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:20,118
I could never damage any of them.

353
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:22,618
Not ever!

354
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:25,318
That's why you used a fake.

355
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,918
After all, those fake items are to blame

356
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:31,618
for the financial deficit our company's been going through.

357
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:34,618
Despite this, that man cut a deal with the fake company,

358
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:36,918
getting dirty money from them.

359
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,618
He then used all the money up gambling

360
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,818
and ran deeply in debt.

361
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,718
I can't believe he came up with this staged kidnapping idea

362
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,418
to pay off his debts.

363
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:49,018
That's why I pretended to agree and took him down!

364
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:52,018
This brand is what I created to begin with,

365
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:56,118
and is a result of my design, you know?

366
00:21:56,118 --> 00:21:59,718
I only wanted to take it back!

367
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,718
Anytime, anywhere...

368
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:07,818
Since it was her handmade bag,

369
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:11,818
be it submerged in the water or the dam discharge,

370
00:22:11,818 --> 00:22:14,718
it would definitely protect the 100 million yen.

371
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:17,118
Betting on her confidence and pride,

372
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:19,718
she committed the crime...

373
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:23,718
and lost.

374
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:47,818
"Mouri Detective Agency"

375
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:54,418
How beautiful! A rainbow across the sky!

376
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,518
Conan! Dad!

377
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:04,918
There's a leg across my head.

378
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:09,118
"Next Episode" -Even if's means having to sacrifice you,

379
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:12,818
it's an Organization that I have to crush.

380
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,118
If only Mr. Akai were here,

381
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:17,618
we wouldn't have to fear that Bourbon guy.

382
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:19,618
We don't fear him!

383
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,918
In any case, Shuichi Akai is dead!

384
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:25,218
Shuichi?

385
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:27,818
A gunshot?

386
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:29,118
Don't tell me...

387
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:31,018
Bank robbers.

388
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:32,518
Next Conan,

389
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:36,017
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Clamorous"

390
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:53,854
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,754
"Masked eyes"

392
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:59,154
Stop it! If you cover my eyes, I can't see the truth.

393
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:00,583
You always can't anyway, Pops.
