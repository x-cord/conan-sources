1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.370
Lately...

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.270
Ran's been acting strange.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.670
She's oddly excited.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.170
Curious, the old man and I decided

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.670
to follow Ran on her outing.

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.270
Ran met Sonoko and Sera at a cafe,

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.270
where they began discussing some kind of trip.

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.070
Furthermore...

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.070
I wonder if we'll get to see Okita.

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.970
Okita?

11
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.870
You mean that guy who's just like Kudo?

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.070
Yeah.

13
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670
Come to think of it,

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.370
he said he lives in Kyoto's Kamigyo Ward.

15
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.770
Which means...

16
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.070
Is Ran...

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.270
going to Kyoto to see Okita?

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.070
There's no way.

19
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.870
It's incidental.

20
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.770
She's just incidentally meeting Okita on her trip to Kyoto.

21
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.970
Maybe we'll incidentally run into Shinichi, too.

22
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.070
Yeah.

23
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.870
Incidental?

24
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.070
Seeing me is incidental?

25
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.470
While this was happening,

26
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.670
we heard a scream from the back of the cafe,

27
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.870
where the body of waiter Daiki Saraie was discovered.

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.270
That locker with the broken padlock...

29
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.370
Was that the victim's?

30
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.370
Yes, that's Saraie's locker.

31
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.970
Which means the culprit may have been after its contents.

32
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.570
It's been badly ransacked.

33
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.870
Do you have any idea what was stolen?

34
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.870
I'm not sure. Only its owner would know for sure.

35
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.470
Why is this the only locker with a padlock?

36
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.570
He's been using it since he started working here.

37
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.370
I did think he was overly cautious.

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.270
The culprit really smashed the padlock.

39
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.970
How were they able to break it like this?

40
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.970
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

41
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.170
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

42
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.870
More than the padlocked locker,

43
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.970
the girl's trip to Kyoto has captured my interest.

44
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.470
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.570
His name is Detective Conan.

47
00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:24.828
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 2)"

48
00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:32.028
I see pliers, a hammer, screwdrivers, and a spanner.

49
00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:35.528
None of those could break a padlock like that.

50
00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:37.528
You're right.

51
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:41.528
The only other thing in here are these screws and nails.

52
00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:52.928
Sorry.

53
00:04:58.628 --> 00:04:59.928
"Isuzu Naomura (27), Waiter"

54
00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:02.228
I remember now!

55
00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:03.228
What?

56
00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:07.328
Something Saraie kept carefully locked in his locker.

57
00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:09.228
It was his tablet.

58
00:05:09.228 --> 00:05:12.928
He often typed on it while smoking.

59
00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:15.828
Maybe that's what was stolen.

60
00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:18.528
What was he typing?

61
00:05:18.528 --> 00:05:20.828
I asked, but he never told me.

62
00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:22.228
It was his blog.

63
00:05:22.228 --> 00:05:23.628
"Toshinori Motosu (38), Customer" -His blog.

64
00:05:23.628 --> 00:05:29.028
That man wrote a food blog under the handle "the Stuffed Professor".

65
00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:32.428
He made lots of posts disparaging rival restaurants.

66
00:05:32.428 --> 00:05:34.928
I've seen that blog.

67
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:38.228
It's pretty popular for its funny writing, right?

68
00:05:38.228 --> 00:05:40.128
That's right.

69
00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:42.528
That's why it's so difficult to handle.

70
00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:48.428
My restaurant is hard up because of that blog.

71
00:05:48.428 --> 00:05:50.628
I see.

72
00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:52.628
That's why you stopped Sonoko

73
00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:57.328
from telling him the address of Poirot and its delicious sandwiches.

74
00:05:58.528 --> 00:05:59.528
Yeah.

75
00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.128
Why do you and the manager

76
00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:07.628
have different family names when you're siblings?

77
00:06:07.628 --> 00:06:10.328
Is it because the manager is married?

78
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.728
No, I'm getting married next month.

79
00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:18.228
My brother's father-in-law was apparently a stubborn man.

80
00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:20.228
He said he wouldn't let him marry his only daughter

81
00:06:20.228 --> 00:06:23.028
unless he took his name and took over the restaurant.

82
00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:24.628
He had no choice.

83
00:06:24.628 --> 00:06:25.928
Come to think of it,

84
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:30.128
Isuzu, since your family started its own branch of the restaurant,

85
00:06:30.128 --> 00:06:33.328
have they not been victimized by that man's blog?

86
00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:36.628
Yes. They're barely keeping the place open.

87
00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:39.228
But the restaurant is as deserted as ever.

88
00:06:39.228 --> 00:06:42.128
They're apparently drowning in debt.

89
00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:44.228
So you say.

90
00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:47.228
Are you sure that business isn't going under because of his blog,

91
00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:49.828
so you killed him?

92
00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:53.628
Then I would've complained to him like Motosu instead!

93
00:06:54.628 --> 00:06:59.228
I was the restaurant's poster girl.

94
00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:04.328
I had no idea Saraie was running that kind of blog.

95
00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:07.928
Even though you lived with him for a year.

96
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:11.628
Hey, that's irrelevant right now.

97
00:07:11.628 --> 00:07:13.828
You lived together?

98
00:07:13.828 --> 00:07:16.728
You were living with the victim?

99
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:20.928
Well, yeah. It was five years ago.

100
00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:24.428
Then it's possible he was threatening to show

101
00:07:24.428 --> 00:07:28.728
embarrassing photos of you from when you two dated...

102
00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:33.328
to your fiance unless you paid him.

103
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.128
What?

104
00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:37.728
If he was causing mischief with his blog,

105
00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:39.228
then it's all the more likely.

106
00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.128
He didn't have any money problems.

107
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.728
He was going to become the new manager

108
00:07:44.728 --> 00:07:48.028
after I got married and quit my job.

109
00:07:48.028 --> 00:07:50.428
He mentioned that to me, too.

110
00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.728
He said since he'd be the next manager,

111
00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:55.928
I wouldn't have to worry about money if I became his girlfriend.

112
00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:02.428
Which means the culprit is the former chef.

113
00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:08.528
How did I carry this vase back here?

114
00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:11.728
I returned my keys when I quit.

115
00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:18.428
Which means you had a key once.

116
00:08:18.428 --> 00:08:21.128
You had the opportunity to make a copy.

117
00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:25.128
I told you, I dislocated my wrist.

118
00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:30.328
You can fake that easily by wrapping yourself in bandages,

119
00:08:30.328 --> 00:08:33.728
and make it seem like it was dislocated all along.

120
00:08:35.828 --> 00:08:38.628
Then ask the hospital!

121
00:08:38.628 --> 00:08:41.528
They should have X-rays!

122
00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:44.928
I see. So that's how it is.

123
00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:49.928
But any of them

124
00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:53.228
could've pulled off this trick.

125
00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:56.928
Who did it?

126
00:08:56.928 --> 00:08:58.428
Hey, Ran.

127
00:08:58.428 --> 00:09:00.628
Don't you think he's acting different?

128
00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:02.328
Who is?

129
00:09:02.328 --> 00:09:04.628
Over there. Him.

130
00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:08.828
The brat with the glasses.

131
00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:12.428
Normally, he interrupts with stuff like "huh?"

132
00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:18.428
Or "that's weird" when there's a case.

133
00:09:18.428 --> 00:09:20.128
Yeah, but...

134
00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:25.128
Conan seems to be thinking about the case.

135
00:09:25.128 --> 00:09:27.328
I've seen him scowling.

136
00:09:31.228 --> 00:09:32.928
What's going on?

137
00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:34.728
You can't figure it out?

138
00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:36.028
No.

139
00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:38.528
I don't have a clue.

140
00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:41.128
I figured out the trick.

141
00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:44.128
Unfortunately, I don't know who the culprit is yet.

142
00:09:44.128 --> 00:09:46.528
The culprit?

143
00:09:46.528 --> 00:09:50.328
I figured that out when we entered the changing room.

144
00:09:50.328 --> 00:09:52.428
And the trick they used, too.

145
00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:54.428
What?

146
00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:57.728
Then when you say you don't have a clue...

147
00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:00.628
It's your trip.

148
00:10:00.628 --> 00:10:04.528
She said it's an unusual trip I'd experience when I'm older.

149
00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:07.628
What kind of trip is that?

150
00:10:07.628 --> 00:10:10.328
What? You're worried about that?

151
00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:14.328
An outsider?

152
00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:18.528
You're saying this murder was committed by an outsider, Inspector?

153
00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:21.828
I'm saying it's possible.

154
00:10:21.828 --> 00:10:24.628
But all three of them

155
00:10:24.628 --> 00:10:28.728
had motive to murder Saraie.

156
00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.128
Yeah.

157
00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:33.928
The former chef Toshinori Motosu

158
00:10:33.928 --> 00:10:36.928
had his own restaurant harshly criticized on the victim's blog.

159
00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:41.228
The waitress Isuzu Naomura

160
00:10:41.228 --> 00:10:43.928
was being harassed by the victim.

161
00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:47.628
The manager Tamao Hasunuma

162
00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:49.928
is getting married next month,

163
00:10:49.928 --> 00:10:54.128
and it's possible her ex-boyfriend, the victim, was threatening her.

164
00:10:54.928 --> 00:10:58.028
But when the nearly 30 kilo vase

165
00:10:58.028 --> 00:11:01.228
that is the murder weapon is filled with water,

166
00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:04.328
I doubt any of them could lift it.

167
00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:06.528
And there aren't any tools here

168
00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:11.428
that could be used to break the padlock on the victim's locker.

169
00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:12.828
But, Inspector,

170
00:11:12.828 --> 00:11:17.628
no one else could have brought the vase back here.

171
00:11:17.628 --> 00:11:22.428
This window was open when Saraie's body was discovered.

172
00:11:23.428 --> 00:11:27.028
It's possible he opened it to smoke,

173
00:11:27.028 --> 00:11:29.028
but the manager said

174
00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:33.428
she may have forgotten to confirm that it was locked.

175
00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:37.128
If it was left open,

176
00:11:37.128 --> 00:11:39.628
then someone could have entered through the window at night

177
00:11:39.628 --> 00:11:43.428
and carried the vase here.

178
00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:45.828
They could've seen Saraie smoking

179
00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:47.028
with the window open from outside,

180
00:11:47.028 --> 00:11:49.428
entered through the service entrance,

181
00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:52.828
and clubbed him to death using the vase.

182
00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:59.028
An incredibly strong someone who could swing a water-filled vase

183
00:11:59.028 --> 00:12:02.828
weighing over 40 kilos and smash the padlock.

184
00:12:02.828 --> 00:12:04.828
That's a decoy.

185
00:12:04.828 --> 00:12:06.228
What?

186
00:12:06.228 --> 00:12:10.028
I doubt the culprit was particularly strong at all.

187
00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:11.728
Right, Conan?

188
00:12:14.828 --> 00:12:16.328
Conan?

189
00:12:18.328 --> 00:12:20.228
Darn it!

190
00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:23.928
I got them, Mouri.

191
00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:26.428
A padlock and two spanners.

192
00:12:26.428 --> 00:12:29.628
What? I didn't ask you to buy those.

193
00:12:29.628 --> 00:12:32.928
What? But Sera said...

194
00:12:32.928 --> 00:12:35.028
Let's get started.

195
00:12:37.328 --> 00:12:39.228
I'll show you how to break a padlock

196
00:12:39.228 --> 00:12:42.028
with hardly any force at all,

197
00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:46.028
and club a man to death using a heavy vase.

198
00:12:56.695 --> 00:12:58.695
First, the padlock.

199
00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:03.095
There was a toolbox inside those drawers, right?

200
00:13:05.995 --> 00:13:07.895
It's ready.

201
00:13:07.895 --> 00:13:12.295
And inside there are two spanners just like these, right?

202
00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:15.795
Yeah, they're here.

203
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:16.795
Okay.

204
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:21.795
If you jam both spanners into the U-shaped spanner

205
00:13:21.795 --> 00:13:26.195
of the locked padlock

206
00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:29.195
and apply your weight from above...

207
00:13:34.795 --> 00:13:36.695
See?

208
00:13:36.695 --> 00:13:38.795
It's broken.

209
00:13:38.795 --> 00:13:39.795
You're right.

210
00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:41.495
That's amazing.

211
00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:44.295
Yeah, but...

212
00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:46.995
there weren't any marks left on the locker

213
00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:51.195
that would indicate the padlock was broken using spanners.

214
00:13:51.195 --> 00:13:55.195
Close, Detective, but no cigar.

215
00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:00.895
That's because after killing Saraie,

216
00:14:00.895 --> 00:14:03.295
the culprit took the key from his body,

217
00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:05.295
unlocked and removed the padlock,

218
00:14:05.295 --> 00:14:08.695
broke it using the method I just showed you,

219
00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:12.395
and then reattached it to the locker.

220
00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:14.695
They even ransacked the inside of the locker

221
00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:16.495
so it looked like the culprit

222
00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:21.095
was after the contents of Saraie's locker.

223
00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.395
What about the contents of the locker?

224
00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:28.795
I doubt anything was stolen.

225
00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:35.395
But those tools aren't enough to swing that vase.

226
00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:39.895
They didn't need to swing it.

227
00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:41.195
Oh, my.

228
00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:46.095
Hey, be careful!

229
00:14:46.095 --> 00:14:47.295
Sorry.

230
00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:50.795
Could you get that spanner from underneath the drawers?

231
00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.395
What?

232
00:14:53.395 --> 00:14:55.395
Gosh.

233
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.295
Why do I have to do this?

234
00:14:59.195 --> 00:15:00.495
Darn it.

235
00:15:00.495 --> 00:15:03.495
It's pretty far back. I can't reach it.

236
00:15:06.195 --> 00:15:08.095
They forcefully dropped the vase

237
00:15:08.095 --> 00:15:11.095
on top of the victim's head like this.

238
00:15:11.095 --> 00:15:13.195
I see.

239
00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:18.195
They asked the victim to get something from underneath the drawers

240
00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:19.795
so they could kill him

241
00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:22.795
by simply lifting the vase instead of swinging it.

242
00:15:22.795 --> 00:15:25.795
After propping the victim up like this,

243
00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:28.395
they put the flowers they had in their locker

244
00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.895
in the vase, filled it with water,

245
00:15:30.895 --> 00:15:33.395
and pushed the vase towards the blood splatter

246
00:15:33.395 --> 00:15:37.595
on the floor caused by the impact.

247
00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:40.695
This removed the blood splatter,

248
00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:43.095
while also creating the illusion

249
00:15:43.095 --> 00:15:48.795
that the vase had always contained water.

250
00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:49.895
Remember?

251
00:15:49.895 --> 00:15:53.895
You said you could wrap your wrist in bandages later

252
00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:57.495
to make it seem like it was dislocated all along.

253
00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:59.495
It's just like that.

254
00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:03.795
-And? -Who's the culprit?

255
00:16:03.795 --> 00:16:06.295
The trick you just described...

256
00:16:06.295 --> 00:16:08.795
Could've been used by any of them.

257
00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:14.095
Well...

258
00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:19.495
I know, right?

259
00:16:19.495 --> 00:16:22.095
-Hey, you. -After all that...

260
00:16:22.095 --> 00:16:24.695
You don't know who did it?

261
00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:26.495
Socks.

262
00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:33.795
You were wearing socks earlier,

263
00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:35.995
so why aren't you now?

264
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.195
What?

265
00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:40.695
You were wearing socks when you picked up

266
00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:42.595
the pieces of the glass I broke.

267
00:16:42.595 --> 00:16:45.995
Why did you take them off?

268
00:16:45.995 --> 00:16:48.695
I... I'm a sweaty person.

269
00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:51.595
They were drenched in sweat.

270
00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:53.995
They were gross, so I took them off.

271
00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:57.395
Really?

272
00:16:57.395 --> 00:16:59.595
Yes, really.

273
00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:01.395
I see.

274
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.395
So it's not because you got blood

275
00:17:04.395 --> 00:17:07.295
on your socks when you dropped the vase?

276
00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:10.995
That's it.

277
00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:12.895
Your shoes and pants are black,

278
00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:15.195
so blood isn't visible on them,

279
00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:18.795
but you were forced to remove your socks.

280
00:17:18.795 --> 00:17:20.495
Huh?

281
00:17:24.395 --> 00:17:26.895
There's something under the drawers.

282
00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:32.295
You're right. Is that a pearl earring?

283
00:17:32.295 --> 00:17:35.295
It looks like it's stuck to the floor.

284
00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:38.895
I see.

285
00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:41.495
You asked Saraie to use the vacuum

286
00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:46.095
to suck up the earring underneath the drawers

287
00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:49.495
using the narrow hose attachment.

288
00:17:49.495 --> 00:17:52.495
But if it was stuck there with glue,

289
00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:54.195
it would've been difficult to get.

290
00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:56.495
So while he was lying on the floor,

291
00:17:56.495 --> 00:17:59.695
you dropped the vase on him.

292
00:17:59.695 --> 00:18:03.495
But where did she get all this water?

293
00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:14.195
Gosh. What are you doing, brat?

294
00:18:14.195 --> 00:18:17.895
But isn't this Naomura's locker?

295
00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:19.395
I see.

296
00:18:19.395 --> 00:18:21.495
She divided the water into plastic bottles

297
00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:24.895
and hid them in her locker.

298
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.495
And she could stop the flowers from wilting

299
00:18:27.495 --> 00:18:30.595
by putting them in the filled water bottles.

300
00:18:30.595 --> 00:18:33.295
But why, Isuzu?

301
00:18:33.295 --> 00:18:35.695
Why kill Saraie?

302
00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:40.995
He criticized my family's restaurant on his blog as well.

303
00:18:41.695 --> 00:18:45.695
Though it's gone now since my parents killed themselves

304
00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:48.995
over their debt.

305
00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.695
What?

306
00:18:54.695 --> 00:18:59.395
So you did do it for revenge.

307
00:18:59.395 --> 00:19:03.595
No. At first, I had no intention to kill him.

308
00:19:03.595 --> 00:19:07.795
My father fell ill, so my mother was cooking instead.

309
00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:10.695
It's true that the quality of our dishes had declined.

310
00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:13.595
I decided to get a job here

311
00:19:13.595 --> 00:19:18.395
because I heard the owner of the blog was a waiter here.

312
00:19:18.395 --> 00:19:23.495
I wanted to give him a piece of my mind.

313
00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:26.795
"I'm the poster girl of a restaurant you ruined!"

314
00:19:26.795 --> 00:19:29.595
"Laugh it up!"

315
00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:33.295
But do you know what he said when he met me?

316
00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:35.995
Hey, you're cute.

317
00:19:35.995 --> 00:19:37.595
Are you from Tokyo?

318
00:19:37.595 --> 00:19:39.595
Do you want to go out with me?

319
00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:50.195
He didn't know you were the poster girl?

320
00:19:50.195 --> 00:19:54.195
No. He wrote on his blog that the quality of the food had dropped.

321
00:19:54.195 --> 00:19:55.795
He claimed to be disappointed

322
00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:57.695
after dining regularly at our restaurant for years.

323
00:19:59.495 --> 00:20:02.895
But he never ate our restaurant's food!

324
00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:06.195
He criticized us based only on rumors and our image!

325
00:20:09.995 --> 00:20:12.895
I couldn't forgive him for that,

326
00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:16.195
so I dropped a vase on the head of a man

327
00:20:16.195 --> 00:20:18.695
who called himself "the Stuffed Professor"

328
00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:21.095
with a stomach full of murder.

329
00:21:47.895 --> 00:21:50.495
What an awful case.

330
00:21:50.495 --> 00:21:54.595
I guess you shouldn't trust blogs like that.

331
00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:56.995
That was amazing, Conan.

332
00:21:56.995 --> 00:21:59.895
I can't believe you noticed her socks.

333
00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:01.595
It was a coincidence.

334
00:22:01.595 --> 00:22:05.595
Didn't you know the moment we entered the crime scene?

335
00:22:05.595 --> 00:22:10.195
I saw that she wasn't wearing any socks,

336
00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:14.095
and the victim's elbow was dirty.

337
00:22:14.095 --> 00:22:17.395
I thought he might have been doing something while lying on the floor

338
00:22:17.395 --> 00:22:20.195
and looked under the drawers

339
00:22:20.195 --> 00:22:23.095
and saw the earring stuck to the floor.

340
00:22:25.295 --> 00:22:26.995
What are you talking about?

341
00:22:26.995 --> 00:22:28.895
You can't tell if something's stuck to the floor

342
00:22:28.895 --> 00:22:30.795
just by looking at it.

343
00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:31.995
I could tell.

344
00:22:31.995 --> 00:22:34.495
"Floor" -Normally, if a pearl earring fell on the floor,

345
00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:37.695
the post would be touching the floor due to its weight,

346
00:22:37.695 --> 00:22:40.395
but the post of that earring was pointing upwards.

347
00:22:45.695 --> 00:22:47.595
Wow!

348
00:22:47.595 --> 00:22:50.395
Conan, you might be a genius!

349
00:22:50.395 --> 00:22:52.595
There's nothing amazing about it.

350
00:22:52.595 --> 00:22:53.795
What?

351
00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:58.395
I spent all that time thinking about it,

352
00:22:58.395 --> 00:23:00.495
but I still don't understand your trip.

353
00:23:06.895 --> 00:23:09.295
Conan, you're so cute.

354
00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:12.295
He really is a little kid.

355
00:23:12.295 --> 00:23:13.995
You stupid little kid!

356
00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:18.095
I told you...

357
00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:20.195
That trip is...

358
00:23:20.195 --> 00:23:22.995
Your standard high school...

359
00:23:22.995 --> 00:23:25.195
School trip!

360
00:23:28.595 --> 00:23:30.195
Really?

361
00:23:30.195 --> 00:23:32.495
I gave you the handout.

362
00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:34.895
I totally forgot!

363
00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:39.495
I doubt even Shinichi would miss this trip.

364
00:23:41.095 --> 00:23:43.095
You think he'll come?

365
00:23:43.095 --> 00:23:45.295
I'm excited.

366
00:23:45.295 --> 00:23:47.695
Well, yeah.

367
00:23:47.695 --> 00:23:49.495
I...

368
00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:52.395
I really want to go!

369
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.195
"Next Episode"

370
00:23:56.195 --> 00:24:00.695
But we saw him smoking cigarettes. Right, Ran?

371
00:24:00.695 --> 00:24:05.095
Yeah. From right around here, when we gave them our gift.

372
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:08.995
It's probably safe to assume there was no foul play.

373
00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:11.295
It's become clear to me

374
00:24:11.295 --> 00:24:14.995
that this is a murder made to look like an accident.

375
00:24:19.095 --> 00:24:24.295
Next Conan, "The Murderous Carpool"

376
00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:27.938
Next Conan's Hint:

377
00:24:27.938 --> 00:24:29.438
"A cushion"

378
00:24:29.438 --> 00:24:30.638
The elementary school's...

379
00:24:30.638 --> 00:24:31.738
School trip...

380
00:24:31.738 --> 00:24:33.038
Isn't for a while.

381
00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.138
Darn it!
