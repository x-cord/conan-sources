1
00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:04.791
Rena Mizunashi, is the only clue we have to closing in

2
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.191
on the Black Organization.

3
00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:08.491
Eisuke Hondo, who has an older sister that looks exactly like her,

4
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.791
is on the search for her and his whereabouts become unknown.

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.691
We also find out that he underwent surgery for leukemia

6
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:15.191
when he was a child.

7
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:18.591
That boy had leukemia!

8
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:20.891
Furthermore, a member of the Black Organization

9
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.491
sneaks into the hospital that she is staying in.

10
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.291
I met all three suspects in person

11
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.691
and tracked down who the one that snuck into the hospital was.

12
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:34.891
The only possibility left is probably the one lying,

13
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.691
saying that he has fainting spells and nausea because of his sprained neck

14
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:40.891
and is extending his hospital stay.

15
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:44.691
And that man is Rikumichi Kusuda.

16
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:46.691
There's only him.

17
00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:48.191
Should we nab him right away?

18
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:51.691
No. Let's watch him for a while.

19
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:55.291
We can nab him after he gives himself away.

20
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.391
Although very slight,

21
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:58.891
there's a possibility that he's an ordinary patient

22
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.391
who's after insurance money too.

23
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:05.291
Well, I think it's safest if we watch him with a lot of men,

24
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.791
and as soon as he makes any queer moves, we nab him.

25
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.091
Right.

26
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.391
By the way,

27
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.891
please think seriously

28
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.691
about moving Rena Mizunashi to another hospital.

29
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:20.691
Yeah.

30
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:23.891
I'll go talk it over with the head of the hospital now.

31
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:25.891
I'll ask him whether he has any doctor acquaintances,

32
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:29.091
who is understanding and can keep secrets.

33
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.291
I'd sure like to move her somehow

34
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.291
before we nab Kusuda, though.

35
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.691
Maybe we should take her to the States with us after all then.

36
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.991
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:01.691
Sizzling hot suspense.

38
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:03.191
A red scream and black bullet

39
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:04.291
whizz through the darkness.

40
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.291
The Black Organization finally finds out

41
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.191
where Rena Mizunashi a.k.a Kir are!

42
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.691
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.491
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.091
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

45
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.490
"Red and Black Crash: Awakening"

46
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.590
"Haido Central Hospital"

47
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.990
Well, should I check the second floor?

48
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.890
Yes, thank you.

49
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.990
Could you check on Mr. Chikada for me too?

50
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.390
All right.

51
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.890
"Nurse Station"

52
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.890
My, Mr. Nezu's nurse call again at this time of night.

53
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.090
I wonder if it's a mistake again?

54
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.390
Mizunashi.

55
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.690
She not in this hospital ward either.

56
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.990
Hey, you? What're you doing?

57
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.290
I got lost.

58
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.590
I was looking for the men's room.

59
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.290
Oh. It's down the stairs right up ahead.

60
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.090
Thank you.

61
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.590
Come on, hurry up and do what you have to do

62
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.190
and go back to your room!

63
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.490
Here.

64
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.390
Thank you.

65
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.190
Isn't it kind of strange, nurse?

66
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.990
I mean if you look at this camera,

67
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.590
it's only natural for you to imagine that

68
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.290
I was in the nurse station taking pictures of something

69
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.890
and yet, you're letting me get away with it.

70
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.690
Who the heck are you?

71
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.890
FBI.

72
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.490
Put both hands around your head in clear view

73
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.390
and get down on your knees!

74
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.490
FBI?

75
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.090
Which means that the place Rena Mizunashi

76
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.190
is taking her beauty nap is here in this hospital.

77
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.990
Yes. We were going to let you go about a bit,

78
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.790
and grab more conclusive evidence

79
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.690
but I guess it wasn't necessary.

80
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.790
Come on, hurry and get down on your knees

81
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.890
before you wake up the other patients!

82
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.390
I guess I'll wake them up, then.

83
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.090
By setting this C4 off!

84
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.690
A plastic bomb!

85
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.290
Don't move!

86
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.590
Or I'll blow this entire floor up.

87
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.790
Don't move! Don't you dare move.

88
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.090
I'm sure that he's going back to his room

89
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.590
to remove any evidence

90
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.890
and will flee through the window!

91
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.890
Get outside so he doesn't get away!

92
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.090
Okay!

93
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.390
No? He didn't go back to his room,

94
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.090
but instead went out the emergency exit to the parking lot

95
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.990
and got in his car?

96
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.390
He foresaw our plan?

97
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.990
Shu!

98
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.590
We're counting on you, Akai!

99
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.290
We've got to somehow manage to nab him

100
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.190
before he contacts the Organization!

101
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.990
Roger. But, we won't be able to stop him from doing so,

102
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.690
if he has the cell phone on him now.

103
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.490
Don't worry!

104
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.290
I looked for his cell phone while he was out of his room

105
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.590
and sunk it in water.

106
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.390
Darn! Doesn't work at a time like this?

107
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.690
You didn't believe us?

108
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.090
I just wanted to be 100% sure.

109
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.090
But, I'm sure that you already foresaw that rushing to nab him

110
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.190
by openly keeping an eye on him

111
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.090
would probably bring about this result.

112
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.090
Right, Mr. Akai?

113
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.290
Well, I wonder about that.

114
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.990
Oh, Akai... Shuichi?

115
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.290
You stopped him?

116
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.890
You stopped him from contacting the Organization?

117
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.090
But he got away to the world beyond with a gun.

118
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.790
If he committed suicide shooting himself,

119
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.490
the bomb that he had on him was just a bluff.

120
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.890
But, thank god the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi

121
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.290
is still not known.

122
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.390
No.

123
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.990
Now, they know for sure where she is.

124
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.390
I'm sure that he was in some way

125
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.290
reporting his investigation results of this hospital

126
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.590
on a regular basis to the Organization.

127
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.990
So, if he had been making the report ever day

128
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.590
and it stopped coming in completely.

129
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.190
They'll come, maybe as soon as tomorrow.

130
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.690
Those guys!

131
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.490
Haido Central Hospital,

132
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.290
that's where they caged Kir up.

133
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.690
Yes.

134
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.290
The man that we snuck into that hospital

135
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.190
suddenly stopped reporting back,

136
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.390
so we made another man go check out what was going on.

137
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.390
Then, there they were, a whole lot of them.

138
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:06.790
FBI agents on guard, hiding here and there all over the place.

139
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.890
I guess they increased the number of agents, thinking that we found out.

140
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.490
You owe me gratitude.

141
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.590
Because I'm the one who got information that Kir was hurt badly

142
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.190
and taken to a hospital somewhere.

143
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.590
It seems that the FBI has that kid in custody though.

144
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.490
He's only a kid.

145
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.490
I guess it wouldn't hurt to leave him as is for now, no?

146
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.890
But, how do you propose we get Kir out,

147
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.690
from the hospital that the FBI is guarding so tightly?

148
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.990
Any false moves and we risk the existence

149
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.190
of the Organization being disclosed to the public.

150
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.190
True.

151
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.590
It'd be hard to snatch Kir away from the FBI

152
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.290
as if nothing ever happened.

153
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.890
That is, if we were to snatch her away.

154
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.690
Huh? Just what do you mean, boss?

155
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.590
Don't worry, Vodka.

156
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.990
I've made quite a few arrangements already.

157
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.490
Well, I warn you, do be careful, Gin.

158
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.390
Silver Bullet is on their side with the sharp eyes of an eagle.

159
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.990
Shuichi Akai.

160
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:20.190
That FBI agent that skimmed my cheek bone with a lead bullet.

161
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.590
I'm going to use this incident against him and get rid of him.

162
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.390
You're shooting him?

163
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.890
Yeah.

164
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.290
I don't know what that person is afraid of about him,

165
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.290
but one silver bullet

166
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.790
doesn't have a chance against a cannon.

167
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.690
No. Silver Bullet who is able to pierce through

168
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.890
the Organization (Our) heart has one more bullet.

169
00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:03.359
Move! We've got to move!

170
00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:06.459
Now that they know Rena Mizunashi is here,

171
00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.059
we can't stay here anymore!

172
00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:11.059
We've got no time to be debating over the matter, do we?

173
00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:16.359
But we can't just haphazardly move her around when she's in a coma,

174
00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:20.759
not even having a definite hospital where she can be hospitalized.

175
00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:23.859
Besides, if we move now,

176
00:12:23.859 --> 00:12:27.559
it's more likely we'll end up with bullet-ridden bodies.

177
00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:30.359
The agent who's guarding the back area says

178
00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:32.759
he verified a suspicious figure squirming around

179
00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:35.259
on the roof of the next building.

180
00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.259
Then, the Organization is already...

181
00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.459
We've got to tell the hospital head about this

182
00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.359
and think up some strategy right away.

183
00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:45.759
No. I don't think that's a good idea.

184
00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:50.559
If we explain the situation and make him cooperate,

185
00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.459
it would look as if the hospital

186
00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:55.559
sheltered Rena Mizunashi to begin with.

187
00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:59.859
However, if the hospital makes no move despite the circumstances,

188
00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:02.559
they may conclude that this hospital is an ordinary hospital

189
00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:06.659
that has nothing to do with the FBI.

190
00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:10.459
True, now that it's turned out this way,

191
00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:13.259
maybe that's the only way we can protect the hospital.

192
00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.159
But, there are many patients

193
00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:17.759
who cannot move from here, you know?

194
00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:21.659
We can't just do nothing and wait when we know that

195
00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:24.859
the guys of the Organization will be raiding this place.

196
00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:26.559
We're not just going to wait.

197
00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.859
We're pulling out.

198
00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:29.559
Pulling out?

199
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.659
You mean we're leaving her behind and pulling out?

200
00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:32.959
No.

201
00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:35.359
We're pulling out the strings and waiting.

202
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.659
Let's meet our enemy, the black wolves,

203
00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:43.659
who will come to get their comrade who has gone astray.

204
00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.459
I guess we have no other choice.

205
00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:50.959
After all, we did summon more agents over this afternoon.

206
00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:53.159
If I knew it were going to turn out this way,

207
00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:55.559
I shouldn't have stopped the guy who took pictures

208
00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:57.859
in the nurse station.

209
00:13:57.859 --> 00:13:59.759
I just didn't want him to give the Organization

210
00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:03.059
information on the patients who are not involved.

211
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.559
Well, they would've found out either way

212
00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:09.959
because Conan seems to have destroyed his cell phone.

213
00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:13.359
No, the boy destroyed the cell phone

214
00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:17.259
not to keep the guy from contacting the Organization

215
00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:20.059
but rather to find out how to get in touch with them.

216
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:22.659
If the guy locked himself in the restroom or his room

217
00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:25.959
and used the cell phone mail to make contact,

218
00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:28.759
there's no way he could've figured out how contact was being made.

219
00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:30.359
But if the cell phone is destroyed,

220
00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:33.859
he would be forced to choose a different method.

221
00:14:33.859 --> 00:14:34.959
I see.

222
00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:37.559
If the method he chooses to make contact is something we can see,

223
00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:40.959
like at a phone booth or an internet cafe,

224
00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.659
we would be able to find out to who,

225
00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:45.559
in what words and writing style he was making contact with.

226
00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:48.659
Therefore, we would be able to keep in touch with them,

227
00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:51.559
pretending to be him even after nabbing him.

228
00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:55.459
Yes. In other words, we, not this boy, are the ones who goofed.

229
00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:59.259
We, the FBI.

230
00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:04.059
That includes me, who never even thought of something like that.

231
00:15:07.059 --> 00:15:10.859
Let's rest in shifts and wait prepared for them!

232
00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:13.559
If we keep on being uptight,

233
00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.959
we'll be had it before those guys get here.

234
00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:18.659
Yes, you're right.

235
00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:21.659
Well, if I come up with a good idea to counter them,

236
00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:24.759
I'll come over and let you know about it.

237
00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.859
What do think about Shu?

238
00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:30.759
What do you mean what do I think?

239
00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:34.559
I can't help feeling that he almost feels happy

240
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.259
about the Organization raiding this place.

241
00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:40.559
If I said I didn't feel the same way, I'd be lying.

242
00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:43.359
If he gets to confront the Organization,

243
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:46.959
he'll be given a chance to avenge her death too.

244
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:48.859
Avenge her death?

245
00:15:48.859 --> 00:15:51.959
Shu's girlfriend was killed

246
00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:54.359
several months ago, by them.

247
00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:55.559
His girlfriend

248
00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:58.059
seems to have been connected with the Organization.

249
00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:02.059
Shu said that she was killed because she tried to quit the Organization.

250
00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:05.059
Why was Mr. Akai going with a girl like her?

251
00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:07.459
In order to close in on the Organization.

252
00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:08.759
Although it seems that

253
00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.559
she wasn't all that deeply involved with the Organization but,

254
00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:15.059
it seems that her younger sister was one of the scientists there.

255
00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:17.359
Younger sister? A scientist?

256
00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:21.459
Yes. Akai became acquainted with her younger sister,

257
00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:25.459
and started making connections with the people around her.

258
00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:27.659
Then, he eventually succeeded in sneaking in.

259
00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:29.359
Although only for three years,

260
00:16:29.359 --> 00:16:31.959
he was a member of the Organization

261
00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:36.859
under the alias of Dai Moroboshi from 5 years ago until 2 years ago.

262
00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:40.859
He really did a good job within the Organization.

263
00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:42.459
He kept a low profile to start

264
00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:45.059
and gradually started showing his horns.

265
00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:49.859
He was given the code name "Rye" and eventually go to work

266
00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:54.159
with one of the executives of the Organization called Gin.

267
00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:57.259
Gin.

268
00:16:57.259 --> 00:16:59.159
We, the FBI figured that so long as we mark that man,

269
00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:01.459
we would be able to get to their boss,

270
00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:04.759
so, we went to their gathering site beforehand

271
00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.059
and hid there waiting.

272
00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:10.059
But they didn't come.

273
00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:12.659
Although we waited till the break of day.

274
00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:15.159
Don't tell me that they found out that he was an FBI agent.

275
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:19.659
Yes, by a slight mistake that the agent who was staking out made.

276
00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:22.859
So, Shu was brushed off by the Organization, you see!

277
00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.759
Then, Mr. Akai's girlfriend was killed then?

278
00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.359
Nope.

279
00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.859
It seemed that her younger sister

280
00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:32.859
was an important person to the Organization

281
00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:35.159
that they couldn't lay a hand on her.

282
00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:39.559
Shu thought likewise and it seems he never met her since.

283
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.159
Well, even if he wanted to contact her,

284
00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:45.459
he couldn't since their address was moved since then

285
00:17:45.459 --> 00:17:47.959
and he had no way of getting in touch with them.

286
00:17:47.959 --> 00:17:50.659
The Organization, however, would never leave

287
00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:53.659
a woman who pulled in an FBI agent,

288
00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:56.859
and may still in the future contact him, to roam free.

289
00:17:56.859 --> 00:17:58.959
Therefore, not being able to take it any longer,

290
00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:00.959
the Organization makes her an offer.

291
00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:02.559
They tell her that if she carries out a certain job,

292
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:06.459
they will let her as well as her younger sister leave them.

293
00:18:06.459 --> 00:18:08.159
Of course, the condition was that if she fails,

294
00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:11.859
she and her younger sister would have to die.

295
00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.859
It seems that the Organization wanted to kill her saying that

296
00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:17.459
she was killed for failing to do the job right, but...

297
00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:23.259
She succeeded in carrying out the job of stealing 1 billion yen

298
00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:26.559
and ended up being killed for no reason.

299
00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:29.359
What was her name...

300
00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:31.659
Her real name was Akemi Miyano.

301
00:18:31.659 --> 00:18:33.859
Alias, Masami Hirota.

302
00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:35.359
I'd never forget.

303
00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:38.659
So, she was no doubt Haibara's older sister.

304
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:43.459
That scientist must've been Haibara!

305
00:18:43.459 --> 00:18:46.259
The reason we know about this in such detail is because

306
00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:49.159
Akai got a mail from her on his cell phone,

307
00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:52.559
the day before she carried out this job.

308
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.959
Since she found out two years before, that he was an FBI agent,

309
00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:59.059
he was not once contacted by her.

310
00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:03.259
She probably couldn't forget Akai even after finding out that

311
00:19:03.259 --> 00:19:06.759
she was used by the FBI.

312
00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:12.559
And judging from how Akai acted after she died.

313
00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:17.859
Yes. Shu also probably liked her.

314
00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:51.259
I'm sorry! I was careless!

315
00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:54.659
No, I was absent-minded too.

316
00:19:54.659 --> 00:19:58.259
Doesn't your head hurt? How about your body?

317
00:19:58.259 --> 00:20:00.159
I'm fine.

318
00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:01.959
I'm glad!

319
00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:04.059
I'll go get the doctor right now!

320
00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:05.159
Hey!

321
00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:08.259
What's your name?

322
00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:10.559
Akemi Miyano.

323
00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:14.759
I'm Dai Moroboshi.

324
00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:17.459
Nice to meet you.

325
00:20:17.459 --> 00:20:19.459
Same here!

326
00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:22.459
Dai.

327
00:20:22.459 --> 00:20:26.559
If I get to quit the Organization after this job,

328
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:30.959
will you go out with me as my real boyfriend?

329
00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:37.759
"Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job"

330
00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.159
"will you go out with me as my real boyfriend? Akemi"

331
00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:42.559
Hey.

332
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.259
May I talk to you for a while?

333
00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:48.459
If you're thinking of the strategy to counter-attack them,

334
00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:50.659
I'm still thinking about it.

335
00:20:50.659 --> 00:20:54.659
But, I was looking at you, and thought

336
00:20:54.659 --> 00:20:59.859
that maybe you're thinking exactly what I'm thinking.

337
00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.959
Time to rest.

338
00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:12.759
-We've got a long night. -Oh, yes.

339
00:21:21.459 --> 00:21:24.059
Mr. Akai! An emergency session will be convened.

340
00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:28.359
-Strategy meeting? -Yes.

341
00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:34.359
I hope we've got a good strategy.

342
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:52.959
Hey, get up, Rena Mizunashi.

343
00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:56.059
If you don't wake up,

344
00:21:56.059 --> 00:22:00.259
I can't ask you how my older sister Hidemi is doing!

345
00:22:00.259 --> 00:22:02.359
Hey, get up! Please get up!

346
00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:04.859
You're going to be taken somewhere again, aren't you?

347
00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:08.559
Before that happens! Please open your eyes! Hey!

348
00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:14.059
I'm telling you, open your eyes. Hey, do you hear me?

349
00:22:17.959 --> 00:22:20.759
No. Ei-chan.

350
00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:27.959
Wait, are you one of the agents that have been summoned here?

351
00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:30.859
Yes.

352
00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:32.659
I'm Andre Camel!

353
00:22:32.659 --> 00:22:34.959
I just happened to get a call from my wife.

354
00:22:34.959 --> 00:22:37.059
Then, please hang up quickly!

355
00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:38.859

We launch a strategy to get Rena Mizunashi out of the hospital

359
00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:23.759
and get a threatening declaration of war

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.359
from the Black Organization.

361
00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:30.359
Simultaneously, multiple accidents happen one after the other,

362
00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:32.959
