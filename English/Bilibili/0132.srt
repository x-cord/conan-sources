1
00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:03.782
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:05.782
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:07.482
This is a 3 part episode that we haven't seen in a long time.

4
00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.382
A magic-like crime has occurred.

5
00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:10.982
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.882
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:59.795
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 1)"

9
00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:02.795
Okay everyone, may I have your attention?

10
00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:06.495
Here is a sheet of white handkerchief.

11
00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:09.895
And, here is a red string and gold ring!

12
00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.195
Yes, yes.

13
00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:16.295
Please make a knot in the middle of the string, Miss.

14
00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:18.895
Like this?

15
00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:22.195
Then, the string with the knot is placed on the palm of your hand,

16
00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:24.595
and the ring is placed beside it.

17
00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:27.195
The handkerchief is placed on it.

18
00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:32.095
I slide my devil lured finger inside the handkerchief,

19
00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:35.295
and chant a mysterious chant.

20
00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:43.595
Oh my, how strange. The string has gone through the ring!

21
00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:45.495
Wow! Fantastic!

22
00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:47.595
How'd you do that, Sonoko?

23
00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:49.795
It's a secret, secret!

24
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.295
I'm going to be doing this in front of everybody tonight!

25
00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:54.895
I see! The people that are getting together tonight

26
00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:56.895
are all magic lovers, right?

27
00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:59.895
Right, I got to know all of them on the internet!

28
00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:02.195
It's a so-called off the net gathering!

29
00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:05.895
The daughter of the rich Suzuki family

30
00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:08.595
corresponding over the internet,

31
00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:13.295
My, the internet is indispensable in this information packed world!

32
00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:16.695
Why don't you install a computer in your office too?

33
00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:19.895
What a surprise,

34
00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.595
though that you suddenly started the internet

35
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:24.795
and magic as well, Sonoko.

36
00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:28.795
Well, I met a great guy.

37
00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:30.895
A great guy?

38
00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:34.695
He's Mr. Katsuki Doito, age 21!

39
00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.595
He is a regular member of the Magic Lovers' Group

40
00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.195
that I am participating in!

41
00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.295
He has a polite manner of speech and his jokes are full of wit.

42
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:45.995
He sometimes puts on airs...

43
00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.295
But I'm sure he's a great guy.

44
00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:53.395
Which means you never met him?

45
00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:55.995
I'm meeting him for the first time today!

46
00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:59.695
I'm going to show him this magic today, and surprise him!

47
00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:02.995
I don't think he will be surprised.

48
00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:06.495
That's just beginners' magic that is usually shown on TV.

49
00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:07.895
All you did

50
00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.195
was push the knot of the string through the ring,

51
00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:13.295
then pushed your thumb through and pulled it out, right?

52
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.295
Oh, I see!

53
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.395
What a smart aleck, like always.

54
00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:17.895
Don't let him bother you.

55
00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:20.095
He's been in a bad mood ever since I decided to

56
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:22.095
participate in the off the net gathering.

57
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.995
Is it really okay for me to go, though?

58
00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.995
No problem! I already told them that I would be

59
00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:28.995
bringing my girlfriend along with me.

60
00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:30.495
Girlfriend?

61
00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:34.295
What?

62
00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:37.895
You were on the net under the pretense of being a male?

63
00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:41.095
Right! A 30 years old man!

64
00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:43.795
It sure was a lot of fun!

65
00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:48.295
But, isn't the name Sonoko Suzuki going to give you away?

66
00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:49.595
No problem!

67
00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:53.795
Because we're all communicating using aliases called handle names.

68
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:57.095
Like, I'm called "The Witch's Apprentice"

69
00:04:57.095 --> 00:04:59.295
and he's called the "Red Herring."

70
00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:01.995
It's an old vocabulary used in ancient magic.

71
00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:04.795
Then, why do you know his real name?

72
00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:06.995
I asked him directly by e-mail.

73
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.195
Oh, so you used your usual love attack.

74
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:11.795
Exactly.

75
00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:13.395
How about it?

76
00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:15.195
People who are conversing on the internet

77
00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:16.695
that have never seen each other are going to meet each other,

78
00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:17.895
all of a sudden.

79
00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:19.795
Isn't it so exciting?

80
00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:20.995
It sure is!

81
00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:23.695
It's just like going to a masked party.

82
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.895
Doesn't something smell funny?

83
00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:41.095
Hello. I am here to attend the off the net gathering.

84
00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:43.095
Welcome.

85
00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:46.395
Oh, you're the "Witch's Apprentice," aren't you?

86
00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:47.395
Yes.

87
00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:49.395
We've been waiting for you!

88
00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:51.795
How did you know?

89
00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:54.895
That I was the "Witch's Apprentice?"

90
00:05:54.895 --> 00:05:58.295
It's obvious from your remarks that

91
00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:02.295
a girl is trying desperately to act like a middle-age man.

92
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.495
Right, everyone?

93
00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:07.495
I was always having my thrills on the other side of the monitor!

94
00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:08.595
Right!

95
00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:10.695
Oh, my God.

96
00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:11.795
If you are going to do something like that,

97
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:14.595
you've got to do it good like Ms. Tanaka.

98
00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:15.995
Oh?

99
00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:20.695
I wasn't trying to fake being a man like you say.

100
00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.095
On the contrary, I thought that the "Disappearing Bunny"

101
00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:25.495
was a woman.

102
00:06:25.495 --> 00:06:28.495
Oh, is that right? I'm glad I did a good job.

103
00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:30.795
What do you mean you did a good job?

104
00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:33.495
I thought he was a woman

105
00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:38.195
so I even talked about underwear with him.

106
00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:41.895
Yeah, I was flustered when you did.

107
00:06:41.895 --> 00:06:43.995
Oh, let me introduce myself,

108
00:06:43.995 --> 00:06:48.095
I am Yoshinori Ara, the owner of this lodge.

109
00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:52.495
And, behind me is, the part-timer that I hired, Mr. Sugama.

110
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:53.895
Hello.

111
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:55.595
Hi.

112
00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:57.795
Katsuki...

113
00:06:57.795 --> 00:07:00.695
Mr. Red Herring hasn't arrived yet?

114
00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:03.895
Oh, he's upstairs.

115
00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:05.895
Oh, there he comes, down the stairs.

116
00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:06.895
Huh?

117
00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:11.595
Huh?

118
00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:14.295
Are you "The Witch's Apprentice"?

119
00:07:14.295 --> 00:07:17.095
I am Katsuki Doito!

120
00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:18.695
Oh, no.

121
00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:21.195
My image of him is collapsing.

122
00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:25.995
So, you were a girl after all!

123
00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:27.795
I am overwhelmed.

124
00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:30.595
By the way, who are you?

125
00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:33.395
I am Ran Mouri, who was invited to come here with her.

126
00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:35.795
I am Ran's father who came to drop them off.

127
00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:37.995
Oh, how rude of me.

128
00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:39.595
Please come in.

129
00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:42.895
Oh, let me hold your bags for you.

130
00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.495
I'm sure you intend to be nice,

131
00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:47.195
but let me warn you not to get funny with the girls.

132
00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:51.095
-Dad! -Please, I assure you...

133
00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.595
Hey!

134
00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:54.495
We're going home!

135
00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:56.895
I am staying over too.

136
00:07:56.895 --> 00:08:00.795
You idiot! You've got a cold!

137
00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.895
Take care of the girls, okay?

138
00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:05.295
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:09.795
So the one s who aren't here yet

140
00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:13.895
are Board leader "Escape King" and "Shadow".

141
00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:17.395
Huh? Is "Shadow" also coming?

142
00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:19.795
What's the matter, Sonoko?

143
00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:21.595
Well, "Shadow"

144
00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:26.595
always writes weird things like, "I can fly,"

145
00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:29.195
or "I can disappear at will".

146
00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:30.195
Huh?

147
00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:33.995
Well, we can't get started unless the board leader arrives.

148
00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:38.295
Does anybody know Escape King's phone number?

149
00:08:38.295 --> 00:08:42.195
I know it, as well as his real name.

150
00:08:46.095 --> 00:08:47.795
This is the Nishiyama residence!

151
00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:49.595
I can't come to the phone right now.

152
00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:52.695
Huh? It's the answer phone.

153
00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:55.095
Please leave a message after the tone.

154
00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:59.595
"He is but the first one... Shadow"

155
00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:05.895
We've got no choice, let's live it up until he gets here.

156
00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.695
I'll get dinner ready together with Mr. Sugama,

157
00:09:09.695 --> 00:09:13.395
then, so why don't you all go to your rooms and change the sheets?

158
00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:15.295
Okay.

159
00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:18.295
Wow! What a large back yard!

160
00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:19.695
How nice.

161
00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:21.395
I'm glad we came.

162
00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.995
If Mr. Doito was how I imagined him to be,

163
00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.395
it would be just perfect.

164
00:09:27.395 --> 00:09:29.895
Hey, come on, that's not nice.

165
00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:38.195
Dinner is ready.

166
00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:39.295
Oh, thank you.

167
00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:45.095
He scared me.

168
00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:47.695
Gosh, there're no guys worth anything here.

169
00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:53.195
The one adore is only him, after all.

170
00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:55.495
You still have another man that you adore?

171
00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:59.595
Yes, my prince that I haven't met yet.

172
00:10:00.395 --> 00:10:03.395
What're you going to do about my dinner?

173
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:06.195
I'll make you porridge or something.

174
00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:07.895
Sleep till we get home.

175
00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:11.495
Mr. Tsutomu Nishiyama, 41, a resident of Haido-cho

176
00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:13.595
was found dead in his apartment.

177
00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:15.595
His mother who came to clean the apartment

178
00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:17.595
reported his death to the police.

179
00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:19.795
A mysterious phrase, "He is but the first one... Shadow."

180
00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:21.895
was found displayed on the monitor

181
00:10:21.895 --> 00:10:24.195
of his personal computer that was nearby.

182
00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:25.195
The police

183
00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:27.695
are investigating on the connection of this phrase to his death.

184
00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:30.695
Mr. Nishiyama seems to have been into the internet,

185
00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:33.295
and he was just about to leave for a gathering

186
00:10:33.295 --> 00:10:35.095
with the Magic Lovers' Group

187
00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:36.795
before the occurrence of this misfortune.

188
00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:39.795
The next news is...

189
00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:44.295
Hey, don't tell me this is the gathering that Ran is at now.

190
00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:45.895
Pops, turn the car back.

191
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:46.995
Hurry!

192
00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:50.695
Huh? A Japanese magician that I respect?

193
00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:54.095
I liked Mr. Toichi Kurobane.

194
00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:57.395
His stages were full of hope and dream.

195
00:10:57.395 --> 00:10:59.795
Yeah! I like Mr. Kurobane too!

196
00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:04.095
I like Yoshiro Kinoshita.

197
00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:05.995
A genius who stole all the championship titles

198
00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:08.495
at the young age of 20.

199
00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:12.595
I like his teacher, Mr. Motoyasu Tsukumo.

200
00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:15.695
What's with all of you? They're all dead already.

201
00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:18.695
I like Mr. Kazumi Sanada who is super popular now!

202
00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:20.095
How about you two?

203
00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:22.595
Of course, who else but

204
00:11:22.595 --> 00:11:24.695
The Thief Kid!

205
00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.195
Huh?

206
00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:28.395
But, he is a thief.

207
00:11:28.395 --> 00:11:31.395
No matter what anybody says, it's the Thief Kid for me!

208
00:11:31.395 --> 00:11:34.095
Don't tell me that the prince you adore is...

209
00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:35.595
Yes, does it bother you?

210
00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.395
Quick, Pops, hurry!

211
00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:40.495
Shut up! I can't go any faster!

212
00:11:40.495 --> 00:11:42.595
What is that?

213
00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:44.295
Fire?

214
00:11:49.195 --> 00:11:51.395
The suspended bridge is burning!

215
00:11:51.395 --> 00:11:55.495
The only way to get to the lodge is by using this suspended bridge!

216
00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:59.295
Pops, call the police.

217
00:12:01.395 --> 00:12:02.595
Hey!

218
00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:03.695
Ran,

219
00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:04.795
I'll be right there!

220
00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.195
Ran!

221
00:12:11.895 --> 00:12:13.095
Huh?

222
00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:14.695
Strange...

223
00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:16.695
The phone is dead.

224
00:12:17.395 --> 00:12:18.995
What's the matter, Ran?

225
00:12:18.995 --> 00:12:22.595
I just felt like somebody called me.

226
00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:25.095
Somebody calling you in the mountains like this?

227
00:12:25.095 --> 00:12:27.195
I'll go check the entrance.

228
00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:31.095
Don't! I'm sure there's nobody around!

229
00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:40.095
-Conan? -Huh? Why?

230
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:44.495
Why is he lying on the ground here?

231
00:12:45.695 --> 00:12:47.295
He's got a high fever.

232
00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:48.695
Ran...

233
00:12:48.695 --> 00:12:50.295
get out of here.

234
00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:53.995
Hurry, and get out of here.

235
00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:57.495
Conan!

236
00:12:57.495 --> 00:12:59.395
Get a hold of yourself, Conan!

237
00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:02.695
Conan! Conan!

238
00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:09.284
What?

239
00:13:09.284 --> 00:13:11.384
That kid was lying on the ground by the entrance?

240
00:13:11.384 --> 00:13:13.584
But, why?

241
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.084
He probably wanted to spend the night here.

242
00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:17.984
I don't think that's it.

243
00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:19.584
Huh?

244
00:13:19.584 --> 00:13:22.284
Conan was saying...

245
00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:23.684
"Get out of here."

246
00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:27.384
"Hurry and get of here."

247
00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:28.684
What?

248
00:13:30.584 --> 00:13:32.584
Just... just what does that mean?

249
00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:36.484
I don't know. He fainted right after saying so.

250
00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.984
I brought some aspirin.

251
00:13:39.984 --> 00:13:42.284
He seems be suffering from a common cold,

252
00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:46.384
so I'm sure he'll be fine if he drinks this and rests.

253
00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:47.584
Thank you.

254
00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:49.984
-Not at all. -How can you tell?

255
00:13:49.984 --> 00:13:51.484
I may not look it,

256
00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:54.284
but I am a student of medical university.

257
00:13:54.284 --> 00:13:57.884
Well, let's try and contact the board leader once more.

258
00:13:57.884 --> 00:13:59.584
What?

259
00:13:59.584 --> 00:14:03.284
What do you mean you can't do anything till morning, Inspector?

260
00:14:03.284 --> 00:14:05.884
Don't yell like that, Mr. Mouri.

261
00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:08.784
It is extremely dangerous to go to the mountains

262
00:14:08.784 --> 00:14:10.484
by another route at night.

263
00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:11.884
Even flying a helicopter

264
00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:14.784
would risk crashing into trees and telephone poles

265
00:14:14.784 --> 00:14:16.984
if we fly low during night time like this.

266
00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:19.684
Then could you at least try calling them?

267
00:14:19.684 --> 00:14:22.384
I've been trying to call them for some time now,

268
00:14:22.384 --> 00:14:23.984
but the phone doesn't seem to be working.

269
00:14:23.984 --> 00:14:27.084
It will be right over, so you stay put!

270
00:14:27.084 --> 00:14:29.284
Darn!

271
00:14:29.984 --> 00:14:32.184
Huh? The phone's dead.

272
00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:35.684
Maybe the telephone line is severed somewhere?

273
00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:38.084
We sure are in a fix.

274
00:14:38.084 --> 00:14:39.484
He was in charge of planning everything

275
00:14:39.484 --> 00:14:42.284
that was to take place tonight, so...

276
00:14:42.284 --> 00:14:45.684
Shall we decide on a temporary leader, then?

277
00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:46.884
I guess so.

278
00:14:46.884 --> 00:14:49.784
Huh? I don't want to be leader, now.

279
00:14:49.784 --> 00:14:51.984
Why don't we be fair and decide by stone, paper, scissors?

280
00:14:51.984 --> 00:14:53.384
Hey, wait,

281
00:14:53.384 --> 00:14:55.684
just deciding is no fun.

282
00:14:55.684 --> 00:14:59.484
Why don't we decide like magic lovers would?

283
00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:01.384
By magic?

284
00:15:01.384 --> 00:15:03.784
Please help me then.

285
00:15:03.784 --> 00:15:06.584
Huh? Me?

286
00:15:06.584 --> 00:15:07.984
Yes.

287
00:15:09.384 --> 00:15:15.884
First, I will hide beautiful Sonoko's eyes with this handkerchief.

288
00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:19.884
Does anyone have a paper and pencil?

289
00:15:19.884 --> 00:15:22.784
Oh, how about this, Mr. Magician?

290
00:15:22.784 --> 00:15:23.784
Okay!

291
00:15:23.784 --> 00:15:27.784
Please take one sheet each and write your names on it.

292
00:15:27.784 --> 00:15:28.884
Yes, yes.

293
00:15:32.884 --> 00:15:34.884
After all the names are written, please collect them,

294
00:15:34.884 --> 00:15:37.884
turn them over and give them to Sonoko.

295
00:15:37.884 --> 00:15:41.084
Uh, so that's all the members who are here.

296
00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:45.984
Here you go, Sonoko.

297
00:15:45.984 --> 00:15:47.684
Oh, give her the pen too.

298
00:15:47.684 --> 00:15:49.584
Okay, there.

299
00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:52.684
Please back down everyone.

300
00:15:52.684 --> 00:15:53.884
Sonoko.

301
00:15:53.884 --> 00:15:55.384
Without showing anyone,

302
00:15:55.384 --> 00:15:59.084
please mark the sheets with a circle, a cross or a triangle!

303
00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:00.884
A circle, a cross and a triangle?

304
00:16:00.884 --> 00:16:02.884
The one with the circle becomes the temporary leader.

305
00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:03.784
The one who gets the cross

306
00:16:03.784 --> 00:16:06.784
is in charge of livening up tonight's gathering.

307
00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:08.484
And the one who gets the triangle

308
00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:11.284
can make the bath or something.

309
00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:13.884
I'll go make the bath.

310
00:16:13.884 --> 00:16:15.384
It's okay.

311
00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:16.284
It's a game,

312
00:16:16.284 --> 00:16:19.284
so it's more fun if we have punishments.

313
00:16:19.284 --> 00:16:21.784
I've finished marking the sheets!

314
00:16:21.784 --> 00:16:25.584
Please put someone's sheet on the table, then.

315
00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:28.384
Make sure the name is facing down.

316
00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:35.184
Okay, so let's see who's to be the leader.

317
00:16:35.184 --> 00:16:36.484
Wait!

318
00:16:36.484 --> 00:16:39.284
I'll prophesy whose name is written on that sheet

319
00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:41.084
before you flip it over!

320
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.184
Prophesy?

321
00:16:43.284 --> 00:16:46.184
If my sixth sense is correct...

322
00:16:47.184 --> 00:16:50.384
The temporary leader is you, Naoko Kuroda!

323
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.384
Huh?

324
00:16:51.384 --> 00:16:52.684
It can't be.

325
00:16:54.384 --> 00:16:56.084
"Kuroda" -No way.

326
00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:57.684
He's right.

327
00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.584
Next, for the one who's going to make the bath,

328
00:17:00.584 --> 00:17:01.984
Kikue Tanaka, it's you!

329
00:17:01.984 --> 00:17:04.284
Huh? Me?

330
00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:08.284
Wow! Bull's eye!

331
00:17:08.284 --> 00:17:09.684
See!

332
00:17:09.684 --> 00:17:11.484
Right.

333
00:17:12.184 --> 00:17:15.184
You better not be hiding the real sheets somewhere else.

334
00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:17.484
No way. You saw for yourself,

335
00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:20.384
I never touched the sheets of paper

336
00:17:20.384 --> 00:17:21.784
and the one who marked the paper

337
00:17:21.784 --> 00:17:24.384
was Sonoko who was blindfolded.

338
00:17:26.184 --> 00:17:27.384
All right,

339
00:17:27.384 --> 00:17:29.884
be it making the bath or anything else, I'll do it.

340
00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:31.084
Sorry.

341
00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:35.384
Do you know where the firewood is?

342
00:17:35.384 --> 00:17:37.684
It will be just fine! I was taken on a tour of this place

343
00:17:37.684 --> 00:17:40.084
as soon as I got here.

344
00:17:44.284 --> 00:17:47.084
Now, all that's left is the cross mark.

345
00:17:47.084 --> 00:17:49.584
The honored person in charge of tonight's gathering is...

346
00:17:49.584 --> 00:17:50.984
you, Mr. Doito!

347
00:17:50.984 --> 00:17:54.384
What? Give me a break.

348
00:17:54.384 --> 00:17:55.684
Let's see.

349
00:17:56.484 --> 00:17:57.684
What?

350
00:17:59.184 --> 00:18:00.984
The name of the person in charge is...

351
00:18:00.984 --> 00:18:04.184
Your name is written, Mr. Hamano.

352
00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:05.784
Huh?

353
00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:07.384
See, there's no mistake about it.

354
00:18:07.384 --> 00:18:10.184
Oh, that's strange.

355
00:18:10.184 --> 00:18:13.684
Okay, so go into your room and think something interesting up!

356
00:18:13.684 --> 00:18:16.484
Don't make a mistake the next time around.

357
00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:18.284
Well, well...

358
00:18:19.384 --> 00:18:22.384
The last time I ever sewed as leader

359
00:18:22.384 --> 00:18:25.184
was when I was in the Girl Scouts.

360
00:18:25.184 --> 00:18:27.784
Well, you are only serving temporarily.

361
00:18:27.784 --> 00:18:31.484
I'll go choose a good wine from the cellar.

362
00:18:31.484 --> 00:18:35.384
Mr. Sugama, please go make us some light snacks that we can nibble on!

363
00:18:35.384 --> 00:18:36.484
Yes, sir.

364
00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:39.584
We're counting on you, leader.

365
00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:40.984
Okay, then...

366
00:18:40.984 --> 00:18:44.884
Sonoko, will you go check on the boy who is sick in bed?

367
00:18:44.884 --> 00:18:47.884
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:50.984
Shall we line the glass cups on the table, then?

369
00:18:50.984 --> 00:18:51.984
All right.

370
00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:57.784
How's Conan doing?

371
00:18:57.784 --> 00:18:58.884
Yep.

372
00:18:58.884 --> 00:19:01.184
It seems his fever has come down quite a bit,

373
00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:03.284
thanks to Mr. Doito's medicine.

374
00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:05.084
I'm glad.

375
00:19:05.084 --> 00:19:08.084
I don't think he's that bad as to disillusion you,

376
00:19:08.084 --> 00:19:09.884
as you say, Sonoko.

377
00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:14.684
Oh? Well, it did interest me a bit that he's a medical student.

378
00:19:14.684 --> 00:19:18.784
But, I really wish you could've seen Mr. Hamano's magic, Ran!

379
00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:23.884
Although he goofed at the end, he was really neat.

380
00:19:23.884 --> 00:19:26.384
He's going to do something during the gathering too,

381
00:19:26.384 --> 00:19:27.584
so come downstairs to watch, Ran.

382
00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:28.884
But, I have to watch Conan.

383
00:19:28.884 --> 00:19:31.584
He'll be okay! His fever already went down,

384
00:19:31.584 --> 00:19:34.984
so no harm leaving him for an hour or two.

385
00:19:40.384 --> 00:19:42.184
Oh, so everything's ready.

386
00:19:42.184 --> 00:19:44.784
Sit down! Sit down!

387
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.984
Huh? Where are the others?

388
00:19:47.984 --> 00:19:49.884
Mr. Hamano who is in charge of tonight's gathering

389
00:19:49.884 --> 00:19:52.984
is in his room thinking up some magic!

390
00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.384
Mr. Arai is in the wine cellar.

391
00:19:55.384 --> 00:19:56.984
It sure is cold.

392
00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:58.984
Oh, there he is.

393
00:19:58.984 --> 00:20:02.084
"Escape King" and "Shadow" are not here yet, are they?

394
00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:04.784
Those two don't get along, so maybe they met some place on the way

395
00:20:04.784 --> 00:20:06.384
and got into a fight or something.

396
00:20:06.384 --> 00:20:08.184
They don't get along?

397
00:20:08.184 --> 00:20:11.984
Yes, they got into an argument about a magician.

398
00:20:11.984 --> 00:20:16.084
Well, let's not talk about unpleasant things at a time like this.

399
00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:17.884
I don't know about "Shadow,"

400
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.884
but, I'm sure board leader, "Escape King" will be here in time.

401
00:20:20.884 --> 00:20:23.184
-He won't come. -Huh?

402
00:20:23.184 --> 00:20:25.084
Conan?

403
00:20:25.084 --> 00:20:28.784
He's been killed at his apartment.

404
00:20:28.784 --> 00:20:30.684
Killed?

405
00:20:30.684 --> 00:20:32.884
What do you mean, Conan?

406
00:20:32.884 --> 00:20:36.084
His name is Tsutomu Nishiyama, right?

407
00:20:36.084 --> 00:20:38.284
Right.

408
00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:41.384
Then, it's just as the radio said. There's no doubt about it.

409
00:20:41.384 --> 00:20:44.384
I came back to let you know about him.

410
00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:46.884
And that you are all in danger.

411
00:20:46.884 --> 00:20:49.584
Huh? Why us?

412
00:20:49.584 --> 00:20:51.584
There was a message

413
00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.884
left on the computer of Mr. Nishiyama who was murdered.

414
00:20:54.884 --> 00:20:58.584
It said, "The first will be... from Shadow!"

415
00:20:58.584 --> 00:21:00.884
"The first will be... from Shadow"

416
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.484
What?

417
00:21:02.484 --> 00:21:05.984
Mr. Hamano also said his piece when they were having the argument

418
00:21:05.984 --> 00:21:07.984
and got into hot water too.

419
00:21:07.984 --> 00:21:11.784
We've got to let him know about this too.

420
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.284
Mr. Hamano?

421
00:21:18.284 --> 00:21:20.484
I'm coming in, Mr. Hamano.

422
00:21:20.484 --> 00:21:22.384
Huh? He's not here.

423
00:21:22.884 --> 00:21:24.784
The window is open.

424
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.484
Don't tell me...

425
00:21:31.184 --> 00:21:33.184
At least he hasn't fallen.

426
00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:34.284
Hey.

427
00:21:35.784 --> 00:21:37.784
Look at that.

428
00:21:37.784 --> 00:21:40.284
-Isn't that Mr. Hamano? -Oh, no.

429
00:21:43.884 --> 00:21:45.684
It can't be.

430
00:21:47.084 --> 00:21:48.484
Mr. Hamano?

431
00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:50.384
What's wrong, Mr. Hamano?

432
00:21:53.884 --> 00:21:55.084
Don't come!

433
00:21:57.684 --> 00:22:00.584
It's no use. He's already dead.

434
00:22:00.584 --> 00:22:01.684
Oh, no.

435
00:22:01.684 --> 00:22:04.684
Besides, we don't want to mess the scene up anymore than it already is.

436
00:22:04.684 --> 00:22:06.184
The scene?

437
00:22:06.184 --> 00:22:08.384
Can't you tell?

438
00:22:08.384 --> 00:22:11.784
The corpse is more than 10m away from the lodge,

439
00:22:11.784 --> 00:22:15.884
and the only footprints left are those of the man who just ran up to him.

440
00:22:15.884 --> 00:22:17.984
But then...

441
00:22:17.984 --> 00:22:21.584
Right. This is a crime that couldn't have been committed

442
00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:24.184
unless the murderer had wings.

443
00:22:24.184 --> 00:22:26.084
This is an impossible crime!

444
00:24:03.384 --> 00:24:06.484
You've figured out who "Shadow" is?

445
00:24:06.484 --> 00:24:09.684
There is a suspicious person in that lodge

446
00:24:09.684 --> 00:24:14.584
that was communicating using a mysterious I.D.

447
00:24:15.784 --> 00:24:16.884
What is it?

448
00:24:16.884 --> 00:24:19.484
An arrow suddenly came flying.

449
00:24:19.484 --> 00:24:21.184
Who is it? Come on out!

450
00:24:21.184 --> 00:24:23.184
-Don't! -Get away from the window!

451
00:24:27.684 --> 00:24:29.284
Next Conan,

452
00:24:29.284 --> 00:24:33.305
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 2)"

453
00:24:33.986 --> 00:24:36.286
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:36.286 --> 00:24:37.986
"The sail of a yacht"
