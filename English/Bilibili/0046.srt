1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,130
As times change,
difficult cases grow in number!

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,940
Today's case is in a
mountain lodge in a blizzard!

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,840
The murder victim
doesn't stay quiet, either!

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,180
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,100
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,600
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:33,427
The Snowy Mountain Lodge Murder Case.

8
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:37,387
Yahoo!

9
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,767
Eh? You're not going to ski, Dad?

10
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:43,977
Don't be stupid!

11
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:49,897
I'm taking in this nice,
cloudless sky first...

12
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:54,867
Along with the grandeur
of this snowy white landscape!

13
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:05,787
Damn. I knew
I shouldn't have come...

14
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,477
Eh?! You lost the
key to the rental cabin?!

15
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,427
Geez! It's all thanks to you two!

16
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:18,717
Guess all we can do is call the
manager to bring a duplicate key.

17
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:21,477
There aren't any
phone booths around here,

18
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:23,307
that cabin is
still under construction,

19
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:25,017
and the ski bus already left...

20
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:30,227
The only thing nearby
is that one lodge up there...

21
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:36,197
Me, ask help from some upstart
with a lodge there? Forget it!

22
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,097
No choice!
We'll open it by force!

23
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:40,057
Stop, Dad!
No, don't!

24
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,787
Say! Are you...

25
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:47,537
Oh! It is Mori Kogoro-san,
the detective!

26
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:52,087
I always read about your
brilliant work in the newspaper!

27
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:55,047
Wow, what a magnificent lodge!

28
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:58,847
Such an elegant color and design!

29
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,307
Who was talking about
rich upstarts just a minute ago?

30
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:06,687
Come to think of it,
I haven't heard your names yet.

31
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,687
Are you Mori-san's daughter?

32
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,187
Yes! I'm Ran!

33
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:15,397
This is Edogawa Conan-kun.
We're watching him for a friend of ours.

34
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,147
Oh!

35
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:21,117
This lion-shaped door
decoration is superb, too!

36
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,477
I was hoping for a horse,

37
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,537
but I guess that was asking too much...

38
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:27,997
A horse?

39
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:31,457
T-That's true. Horses
would be better than lions...

40
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:34,057
No, no, that's not what I mean...

41
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:35,627
Dr. Oyama!

42
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,087
Oh! Nakahara-kun!

43
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:38,807
What took you so long?!

44
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:41,147
Everyone's been waiting!

45
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:42,557
Who are these folks?

46
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:47,017
Oh, some friends I ran into just now.

47
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:52,807
Oh? You're all doctors
at the same university?

48
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:57,447
Yep! We're all assistants for Dr. Oyama!

49
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,727
Doctors are very factional, you see.

50
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:05,367
I've been studying under the
doctor for dozens of years now.

51
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:11,647
I transferred here three years
ago from some future-less professor.

52
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,837
I'm really glad to be where I am now.

53
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:19,047
The essay he presented
the other day was wonderful!

54
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:25,647
Oh, "Gene Therapy as Treatment
for Cancer of the Large Intestine"?

55
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:29,017
The whole medical school
is praising his essay right now!

56
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:33,227
Come now, with my brains,
it was a piece of cake!

57
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,027
Thank you for the meal!

58
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,517
Oh no! I forgot to buy
snacks to go with our drinks!

59
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:46,977
I'll go pick some up at the
shop at the bottom of the mountain.

60
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,407
Could you get some chips?

61
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:49,477
Dried cuttlefish for me!

62
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:50,457
I'll have a salad!

63
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:54,187
Yes, yes. Here, write it all
down so I know what to buy.

64
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:54,957
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,647
The convenience store
closes before 10:00, so hurry!

66
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,357
Yeah, I know.

67
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,267
Hey! What time is it?!

68
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,137
8:58...

69
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:09,637
Uh oh!

70
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:14,267
What's going on?

71
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,517
A TV show.

72
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:20,347
He's addicted to a melodrama
that gets 30% ratings!

73
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:22,767
Oh, I watch that show, too!

74
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,447
Huh? Where are you off to, Dr. Tobita?

75
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:32,517
Night skiing.
I haven't gotten my fix yet.

76
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:34,267
I should be back by around 11:00.

77
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,807
Well, I guess I'll take a nice,

78
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:45,297
relaxing bath until the snacks arrive.

79
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:49,677
Say, did you call the cabin
manager about our key?

80
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,597
I completely forgot!

81
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:55,767
That's all right!
You can stay the night here!

82
00:05:56,477 --> 00:06:00,227
Your father can't exactly
leave in his state...

83
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,737
I'm going to throw out the trash.

84
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:06,697
Okay!

85
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:16,597
Wait! Tsutomu-san!
Don't leave me!

86
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:21,167
I have to, Mitsue-san.
We can never be together.

87
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,877
So, please! Forget about me!

88
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:27,467
Why?! Why can't we be together?!

89
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:32,637
I'm back!

90
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,147
Welcome back, Kaori!

91
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:38,107
It must've been rough
with the sudden blizzard!

92
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,147
Dr. Tobita!

93
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:44,647
Man, can't possibly night ski
with that blizzard out there!

94
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,557
That warms me up!

95
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,977
Oh, are we drinking?

96
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,517
How was your bath?

97
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:55,367
Just wonderful!

98
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:58,557
Oh? I had asked for a salad...

99
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,837
Sorry, they were sold out.

100
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,977
And there was no ice cream.

101
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:07,547
Who asked for ice
cream in this weather?

102
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:11,767
Maybe it was Dr. Oyama?
He does love ice cream...

103
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,147
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

104
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:18,227
His TV drama ended at 10:00,
so where could he be?

105
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:21,147
Dr. Oyama always tapes the show

106
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:23,647
and replays the
best scenes afterward.

107
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:34,727
Damn you... This was
your original intent all along...

108
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,977
But you won't get away with this!

109
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:41,807
The great detective,
Mori Kogoro, is here!

110
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:45,757
I'm sure that he, if anyone,
will get this message!

111
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,717
Eh? Mori Kogoro?

112
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:51,067
The guy always in the newspaper?

113
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,177
Yes! My dad's a detective!

114
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,637
It's past 11:00 now.

115
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,687
I think he's taking a bit too long...

116
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,017
I'll go see what's up.

117
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,807
Huh? He's that famous detective?

118
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,847
Looks sure can be deceiving...

119
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:10,977
K-Kaori!

120
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:13,407
Hey! What happened?!

121
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:18,707
Dr. Oyama!

122
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:24,227
It's too late. He's dead.

123
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,307
This can't be!

124
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,307
For now, let's untie his ropes...

125
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,797
Stop right there!

126
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:35,597
I'd appreciate it if you don't
mess up the murder scene!

127
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,147
Dad! They can't get police cars

128
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,557
or an ambulance
here in this blizzard!

129
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,847
That so? Then I have no choice.

130
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:48,187
Looks like I, the great Mori Kogoro,
will have to take charge here!

131
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,407
You're still so drunk!

132
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:54,337
I'll ask just to be safe--

133
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,647
no one's touched
anything in the room, right?

134
00:08:57,647 --> 00:09:00,727
No, nothing aside
from Dr. Oyama's body.

135
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,807
You found him first,
Nakahara-san.

136
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,667
I assume the same goes for you?

137
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,057
That's right.
I saw him covered in blood

138
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:09,627
and fell down in the doorway.

139
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:13,977
Was there anything
of value in this room?

140
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:16,847
He does have a safe in the
cabinet to the right of the TV.

141
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,187
Here?

142
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:24,017
It's all scratched up!

143
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:26,857
Do you know what's inside this safe?

144
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,307
Cash, I assume.

145
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:32,777
He always carried large
sums of money with him.

146
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:36,237
So I guess they were after money...

147
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:38,517
What's with this blood trail?

148
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,657
It's almost as if he
crawled to the wall...

149
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,747
And why is he sitting formally?

150
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,877
The blood on the table stops cleanly...

151
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,517
Ah. The tablecloth slipped off...

152
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:55,967
Marks from the bloodied rope!

153
00:09:56,227 --> 00:10:00,927
Could this be a dying
message from Dr. Oyama?!

154
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:06,727
So they used tape on the window
to muffle the sound, then snuck in...

155
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:12,987
They were even nice enough to
leave footprints outside the window!

156
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,557
I think I've got this figured out!

157
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:17,557
Hmmm...

158
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:20,907
No "hmmms"! Get outta here!

159
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:27,437
I hate to ask, but could
you examine him for me?

160
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:30,807
As doctors, you're more
qualified than I am.

161
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:31,837
Right.

162
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:37,477
Man, this is bad!

163
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:41,017
Even his beloved gold
watch is covered in blood!

164
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,977
Quit joking around at
a time like this!

165
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:48,937
I estimate his time of death to
be between 9:30 and 10:00 pm.

166
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:53,897
I see. So it was
during his TV drama?

167
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:54,647
Yes.

168
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:57,347
There are countless cuts
all over his body,

169
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,647
but it appears
he died of suffocation

170
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:02,847
after having both lungs punctured.

171
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,117
Suffocation?

172
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,477
Basically, with holes in his lungs,

173
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:11,147
he couldn't hold air to breathe.

174
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:16,297
He probably suffered terribly
for ten or fifteen minutes...

175
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:16,977
That's horrible!

176
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,547
Who on earth would do this?!

177
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:22,187
This was most likely
done for monetary gain.

178
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:24,647
After breaking in
through the window,

179
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:28,227
the killer attacked and tied up
Dr. Oyama, who was watching TV,

180
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:32,727
then demanded the safe
combination, but didn't get it.

181
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:38,157
Enraged, the culprit stabbed
Oyama-san and fled back out the window.

182
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:41,117
Ugh, talk about dense...

183
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:45,037
Oh! This man has a cool watch!
It's all sparkly!

184
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:46,307
Conan-kun!

185
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,877
Say, he was tied up, right?

186
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:53,837
Then he was super lucky the
killer didn't take his gold watch!

187
00:11:55,307 --> 00:12:01,347
How odd for someone after
money to overlook a watch like that...

188
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,177
Then that means...

189
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:08,057
...that the killer must be pretty stupid!

190
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:12,517
But don't you think the
killer must've been gutsy?

191
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:16,987
See? Look at the footprints outside!

192
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:20,567
They come straight to this room!

193
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,977
So what?

194
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,807
If it was me, I'd be afraid
someone else was in the room

195
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:32,667
and would sneak around
and peek in before going inside!

196
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:36,127
Dad! Does that mean...

197
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:41,147
Scratching the safe and tying
Oyama-san up was camouflage,

198
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:46,137
meant to make it look
like this was about money...

199
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:52,607
The killer knew Oyama-san
would be watching TV alone then...

200
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:57,567
In other words,
one of you four is the killer!

201
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,207
What?!

202
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,017
What the hell?!

203
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:05,907
Then let's hear each of your
alibis between 9:30 and 10:00.

204
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,147
I was at the convenience store.

205
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:13,187
I left at 9:00 and
returned at around 9:50.

206
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:20,877
The only snacks that were sold
out were salad and ice cream.

207
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,807
But you could've finished
sooner if you rushed in your car.

208
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,097
It takes over forty
minutes round-trip!

209
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,637
If you think I'm lying,
you can try it with my car!

210
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:35,107
I went night skiing, a ski slope
also forty minutes round-trip.

211
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,867
Do you have proof of this?

212
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,227
Sure do.

213
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:41,347
This lift ticket has today's date.

214
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:43,157
See, it even has the time.

215
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:48,867
I cleaned up and washed things
with Ran-chan and Conan-kun.

216
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,477
That's true, Dad.

217
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:53,827
She only left for two or three
minutes to throw out the trash.

218
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:57,547
I was taking a bath from
9:30 until shortly after 10:00.

219
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:02,057
There's one other person besides
Kanazawa-san with a flimsy alibi.

220
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,307
B-Blood stains?!

221
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,267
Huh? But why isn't
there any blood on the sofa?

222
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:14,727
Did someone put it
here after the blood dried?!

223
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:19,397
Wait a minute. The blood-smeared
tablecloth... Could it be?!

224
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,647
It matches perfectly!
This lighter was sitting here!

225
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,617
Could this be...

226
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,267
Come to think of it,
this afternoon, Oyama-san said...

227
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:34,347
I was hoping for a horse,
but I guess that was asking too much...

228
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:37,627
That was when he
asked me and Ran our names...

229
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,097
That's it! A horse!
That's what he meant!

230
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,177
This really is Oyama-san's
dying message!

231
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:46,517
It explains his
formal way of sitting,

232
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:50,637
and the bloody lighter on the sofa!

233
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:55,057
And just as his dying message says,

234
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,737
the killer was that person!

235
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:08,302
Hey, mister. There's
something weird on the sofa--

236
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,922
Knock it off, you damn kid!

237
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,732
What's wrong, Dad?!

238
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,812
I think he's drunk.

239
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:20,742
Don't be stupid! I ain't drunk!

240
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,772
I figured it all out!

241
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,872
Eh?! What, now?!
What did you figure out?!

242
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:32,152
The killer. I just now figured
out who stabbed Oyama-san!

243
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:37,912
First is Tobita-san,
who went night skiing.

244
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:40,832
He wouldn't have made up a
fake story that could be easily verified.

245
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,242
Next is you, Ezumi-san.

246
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,452
You only left Ran and
Conan for two or three minutes.

247
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:49,842
Not enough time to
have killed Oyama-san.

248
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:54,302
Which only leaves Kanazawa-san
and Nakahara-san without alibis.

249
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:58,642
Hold on! I bought the snacks
that everyone asked--

250
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:01,352
Then how much did it all cost?

251
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,992
I forget!

252
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:07,312
No, you didn't forget.
You don't know.

253
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:13,032
Because you bought large amounts
of all kinds of snacks in advance.

254
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:18,082
You bought them this afternoon
when you bought the food for dinner.

255
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:21,742
Before the murder,
you took everyone's orders,

256
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:25,122
and then pretended
to leave in your car.

257
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:28,082
You then stopped somewhere

258
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:32,242
and pulled out
the snacks they ordered.

259
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:36,972
Now that you had an alibi,
you went and murdered Oyama-san.

260
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:40,222
Don't be stupid; you have no proof!

261
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:43,082
No, you know yourself
that there's proof

262
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:48,652
in this room that you did it.

263
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,612
Have a look at the table.

264
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:52,992
The blood ends cleanly.

265
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,152
Doesn't it seem like
something was on it?

266
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,912
The tablecloth!

267
00:16:56,912 --> 00:17:01,122
Please put it on the table so
that it matches with the blood stains.

268
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:10,502
That is Oyama-san's dying message.

269
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,502
How is this a message?

270
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:18,952
Think back. Oyama-san
died while sitting formally.

271
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:21,622
It should start to become clear.

272
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:26,982
Each of your names includes characters
used in shogi (Japanese chess).

273
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:28,522
S-Shogi?

274
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:33,952
Say, Dr. Oyama always said how
a horse would make the full set.

275
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,972
Yes. You make up all
the pieces but a knight.

276
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:44,122
Ran. Take the lighter on the
sofa and put it on the tablecloth.

277
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:44,882
Right.

278
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:51,582
There's only one place the blood
on the lighter matches the tablecloth.

279
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:52,962
Here.

280
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:55,832
Kaori

281
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,632
This is a lance!

282
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:01,202
Yes. That is a lance's starting position.

283
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:07,562
This is a dying message that
gives your name, Nakahara Kaori-san!

284
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:12,662
But how did you know that before
putting the tablecloth on the table?

285
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:14,272
Look closely.

286
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:17,702
That square is the only
one with long blood trails.

287
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:21,202
In other words, it was on
the very edge of the table.

288
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,452
I see!

289
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,242
It just coincidentally
turned out that way!

290
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:29,462
Then why did you move it?

291
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:33,742
It was you who tossed
the tablecloth aside, yes?

292
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:38,512
No! It must've happened when
the killer and Dr. Oyama struggled!

293
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:43,582
No. The blood on
the table ends cleanly,

294
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:48,522
and the sofa the bloody lighter
was on has no blood at all.

295
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:53,262
This is proof that someone
moved it after the blood dried.

296
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:59,742
In other words, the killer
must've returned to the scene,

297
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:04,012
noticed the message,
and tossed it aside!

298
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:08,612
Am I wrong, Nakahara Kaori-san?!

299
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:09,662
Kaori...

300
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:17,452
Your undoing was that you noticed
the message after you screamed.

301
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,082
And one other thing--

302
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:23,082
you said they were out
of salad and ice cream,

303
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:26,202
but setting aside the salad,
selling out of ice cream is--

304
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,532
That's enough!

305
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,852
That's right! I killed him!

306
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:33,742
Why would you do that to him, Kaori?!

307
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:36,162
You got along so well!

308
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:39,082
Yes, he was like a father to me.

309
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,862
That's why I couldn't forgive him...

310
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,742
I couldn't believe he'd
steal my paper from me!

311
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:46,582
Paper? You don't mean...

312
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,202
"Gene Therapy as Treatment for
Cancer of the Large Intestine"?!

313
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:52,622
That's right!
He stole it from me!

314
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:57,932
After I had spent six whole
years pouring my life into that essay!

315
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:03,932
Yes, the paper I wrote
for my late father's sake...

316
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:09,892
My father died of large intestinal
cancer when I was very young.

317
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:14,282
The reason I became a doctor
devoted to large intestinal cancer

318
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:17,102
was to prevent any
more cases like my father's!

319
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:23,862
Yet, after he stole the paper
I had finally completed, that man...

320
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,082
There's no point.

321
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:30,412
Nobody'll listen to
you if you said you wrote it.

322
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:35,372
But society will pay attention if
a famous professor makes it public!

323
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:40,132
I'm sure your father
would be happier that way!

324
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:44,082
It was then that I devised this plan.

325
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:47,332
I decided to kill the man who
stomped on my feelings for my father

326
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:52,102
by puncturing his lungs,
one of the worst ways to die...

327
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:57,582
But I never once imagined
he would leave a dying message

328
00:20:57,582 --> 00:21:01,522
during those ten to fifteen minutes of agony!

329
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,372
But great detective.

330
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:06,452
There was one mistake in your theory.

331
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:11,162
I had predicted the ice cream and salad.

332
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:14,912
They were sold out of salad,
but I did buy ice cream.

333
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:16,622
Then why?

334
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:19,582
It melted inside the car.

335
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:23,122
I had everyone's snacks ready,

336
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:26,032
and told myself,
"OK, time to kill him."

337
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:28,552
And then I suddenly
thought back to my father.

338
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:32,512
After spacing out for a while,
the car's heater had melted it...

339
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:38,192
To think his ice
cream would trip me up...

340
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,162
It's ridiculous!

341
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:19,252
Dying messages. Sometimes,
they're expressed in unusual ways.

342
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:21,782
Got your angel!

343
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,712
Your silver general is going to waste!

344
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:28,032
Alright! Now it's finished!

345
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,832
Sometimes, when you change
your perspective of something ordinary...

346
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:33,382
Look from above!

347
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:36,992
Idiot

348
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:37,682
Idiot?!
Idiot

349
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:40,262
Why, you!

350
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,822
Dead in the pool?!

351
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:50,032
He drowned to death.

352
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:53,282
Just because you've
been in water before

353
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:54,782
doesn't make you an expert!

354
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:58,492
Don't tell me you painted
what you saw from here?!

355
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:04,042
This is! Ah, now I get it!
That person was the killer!

356
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,542
Yes, this was a murder
made to look like an accident!

357
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:09,412
On the next Conan--

358
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:12,622
"The Sports Club Murder Case."

359
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,629
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:16,631
Next Conan's Hint:
Cap.

361
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:18,770
Cap.
