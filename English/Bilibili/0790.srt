About the thing that you asked me to do the other day.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.340
As a result of scrupulous investigation,

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.740
Mr. Kanzaki...

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.940
There is no one who has a grudge against you!

"Yukio Kanzaki (23)" -But, I got a call saying,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.440
"I'm going to kill you for sure."

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.440
Yeah, you mentioned you got such a call about twice.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.240
I think it's a prank that your friends are playing on you.

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.440
Prank?

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.740
No matter who I ask, you have a great reputation.

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.840
You're just being teased.

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
Well, I guess he's right.

about somebody not wanting to come after Mr. Kanzaki's life.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040
You're Mr. Udagawa, was it?

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.940
I understand you worrying about him being his superior, but...

18
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.240
If someone were really planning to hurt him,

19
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.740
no warning would be given.

20
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.040
Because that will only serve to put him on his guard.

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.240
The perpetrator has nothing to gain from it.

23
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.940

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.940
but was the victim really the target?

33
00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:53.395
I'm sorry to have to ask you the same thing repeatedly.

34
00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:57.695
Mr. Mouri.

35
00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:00.995
Inspector Megure, who's the victim that was stabbed?

36
00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:05.195
It was employee, Mr. Gosuke Shimomura, age 25.

37
00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:08.495
Just like Mr. Kanzaki, he works under me.

38
00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:12.295
He was taken to the hospital by ambulance just now.

39
00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:17.395
The perpetrator mistook Mr. Shimomura for Mr. Kanzaki,

40
00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:18.695
is that true?

41
00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:20.395
Yeah.

42
00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:22.795
Just because he was inside Bekapon outfit.

43
00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.195
Bekapon?

44
00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:27.995
It's Beikado's mascot character, right?

00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:31.395

Bekapon distributes fliers and balloons to the customers.

48
00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:43.495
At this Josai store,

49
00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:48.195
we always have Mr. Kanzaki wear the Bekapon outfit.

50
00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:49.195
You?

51
00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:52.795
Yes. I was supposed to wear it today too,

52
00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:55.295
but I had an upset stomach from this morning.

53
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.895
And so, he talked it over with Mr. Udagawa

54
00:04:57.895 --> 00:04:59.295
in charge of the sales floor and...

55
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:06.495
"Gosuke Shimomura (25)" -You're telling me to wear Bekapon in his place?

56
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:09.995
You're the next youngest to Mr. Kanzaki.

57
00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:12.195
Please, Mr. Shimomura.

58
00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.395
The children are looking forward to meeting Bekapon.

59
00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:18.595
Not good. Here it comes again.

The medicine I just gave you is really effective.

61
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:24.395
After going to the bathroom, go rest in the break room.

62
00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:26.395
I... I'm sorry.

63
00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:30.595
It's an emergency. Please.

64
00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:33.495
Be at the store by 11:00 as always.

65
00:05:33.495 --> 00:05:36.695
I guess I've got no choice since it's a business order.

66
00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:38.395
Right, Bekapon?

67
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:40.895
At 10:50...

68
00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:42.595
I guess I better get going.

69
00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:51.395
"Teruko Akaiwa (62)" -Gosh, I know it's my job,

70
00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:53.395
but I really don't want to do this.

71
00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:00.895
Die!

72
00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:02.395
Kanzaki!

73
00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:12.495
I see, the perpetrator said "Die! Kanzaki!"?

74
00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:14.595
Yes, definitely.

75
00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:18.095
The perpetrator knew that Mr. Kanzaki was the one

76
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:20.195
inside Bekapon all the time, then?

77
00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:22.195
But, the perpetrator didn't know

78
00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:24.995
that somebody was taking Mr. Kanzaki's place just for today,

79
00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:26.795
and attacked Mr. Shimomura

80
00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:29.895
thinking that it was Mr. Kanzaki and fled.

81
00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.395
He attacked the wrong target.

82
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:35.195
A mistake.

83
00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:40.495
The murder threat was not a joke after all, Mr. Mouri.

84
00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:45.595
And, Mr. Shimomura was victimized in my place.

85
00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:48.895
So, my investigation wasn't thorough enough.

86
00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:51.695
But, I wonder why the perpetrator attacked him

87
00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:54.895
when he was wearing the mascot outfit?

88
00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:57.695
Probably because that way, he could avoid

89
00:06:57.695 --> 00:07:00.395
getting the victim's blood from splattering on him.

90
00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:02.495
Maybe so but...

91
00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:05.795
To think that he stabbed the wrong person just because of that,

92
00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:08.195
he really did a sloppy job.

93
00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:15.595
But, that sloppy jobber is going to find out soon that he goofed.

94
00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:18.095
Which means that he's going to come after me for real next time.

95
00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:19.195
Yeah.

96
00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:20.495
But, don't worry!

97
00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:23.795
I'll find that guy before he gets to you.

98
00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:25.695
I swear on my job that I will!

99
00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.395
-Mr. Mouri? -Mouri!

100
00:07:28.995 --> 00:07:32.695
Hey... How are you going to find him, pops?

101
00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:36.295
Inspector Megure.

102
00:07:36.295 --> 00:07:37.695
On the security camera,

103
00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:39.995
there was no man wearing the kind of clothes

104
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:41.695
the eye-witness described.

105
00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.895
But I saw it with my very eyes!

106
00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:48.995
He was wearing a yellow top and red slacks!

107
00:07:48.995 --> 00:07:52.195
Then, he probably took off the balaclava that he was wearing

108
00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:55.195
and took off his flashy clothes and changed.

109
00:07:55.195 --> 00:07:59.295
The perpetrator probably took them with him when he fled,

110
00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:02.195
or if it's somebody from inside who did it,

111
00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:06.995
it could still be hidden somewhere in this store.

112
00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:09.895
You're suspecting our employees?

113
00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:13.195
Well, if it's somebody from the inside,

114
00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:15.995
he would know that Mr. Kanzaki was always wearing Bekapon's outfit.

115
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.995
Well, that's true, but...

116
00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:22.795
Boss! Let's have them check the place out thoroughly.

117
00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:25.595
To see if the balaclava's hidden somewhere.

118
00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:28.495
It would help to clear suspicion from the everybody too.

119
00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:29.995
Yeah.

120
00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:33.295
Okay! I'll have everyone cooperate.

121
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:36.495
Please check everything including everyone's belongings.

122
00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.095
Thank you very much!

123
00:08:38.095 --> 00:08:39.495
Officer Takagi! Officer Chiba!

124
00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:40.595
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

125
00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:43.295
I'll start by talking to you, Mr. Kanzaki.

126
00:08:43.295 --> 00:08:44.995
Yes, sir.

127
00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:48.795
This case sure is full of incomprehensible things.

128
00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:52.495
I have no idea who the perpetrator could be.

129
00:08:52.495 --> 00:08:56.295
That's why I went to ask Mr. Mouri to find out who it is...

130
00:08:57.295 --> 00:09:01.295
But, I'm sure you have at least a little idea of something, don't you?

131
00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:03.495
First, the warning of the threat of murder.

132
00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:06.695
Why would the perpetrator go out of his way to warn of the murder?

133
00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:09.895
A yellow top and red slacks.

134
00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:12.695
The perpetrator must be young.

135
00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:14.795
No, it's also possible that he chose flashy colors

136
00:09:14.795 --> 00:09:18.695
to make everyone think so.

137
00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:21.595
Since the perpetrator isn't shown on the security camera...

138
00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:25.795
He must've attacked the victim wearing the flashy clothes,

139
00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:29.295
then changed again to the original clothes that he was wearing.

140
00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:32.095
Why would he do something so troublesome?

141
00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:36.495
It's much easier to attack his target on a dark street at night and yet...

142
00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:39.095
It seems to be nowhere here.

143
00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.295
Let's check the personal belongings.

144
00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:42.895
Yes.

145
00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:47.395
I'm sorry to make you do this.

146
00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:51.395
We're missing two young ones so it can't be helped.

147
00:09:57.995 --> 00:09:59.795
Here.

148
00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:01.595
It's hot.

149
00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:05.095
Mr. Udagawa, you're sweating a lot too.

150
00:10:05.095 --> 00:10:06.895
You should take off your top.

151
00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:08.995
Or at least roll up your sleeves.

152
00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:10.395
Oh, well...

153
00:10:10.395 --> 00:10:12.595
I have a slight cold, you see.

154
00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:15.895
More importantly, don't you think the police is rude

155
00:10:15.895 --> 00:10:18.295
to suspect the employees.

156
00:10:18.295 --> 00:10:19.995
True...

157
00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:27.195
I'm sorry, it's Bekapon's day off today.

158
00:10:27.195 --> 00:10:28.695
What?

159
00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:31.195
And the thing that bothers me most is...

160
00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:34.095
When the perpetrator committed the crime he warned, he would carry out.

161
00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:37.895
It just so happened that a substitute was inside Bekapon.

162
00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:42.995
Wait a second...

163
00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:45.395
What if it wasn't just a coincidence?

164
00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:49.395
If so, everything falls into place...

165
00:10:50.395 --> 00:10:53.095
"Noriko Izumi (24)" -You want to know if Mr. Kanzaki and Mr. Shimomura

166
00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:55.195
were on good terms with each other?

167
00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.695
Yes, I was told to ask you.

168
00:10:58.695 --> 00:11:01.995
Mr. Kanzaki is a nice and optimistic person,

169
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.895
But Mr. Shimomura is the exact opposite.

170
00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:07.995
Which means they didn't get along, right?

171
00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:09.395
I guess not...

172
00:11:10.695 --> 00:11:12.595
What's wrong?

173
00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:14.195
Oh, boss.

174
00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:16.195
Something about he's running an errand for Mr. Mouri.

175
00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:17.795
What did Mr. Mouri want?

176
00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:20.095
I don't know for sure myself.

177
00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:22.195
Thank you, miss. See you.

178
00:11:29.495 --> 00:11:32.295
You're still here?

179
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:37.295
Mr. Kanzaki, where were you when Mr. Shimomura was attacked?

180
00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:38.695
Why do want to know?

181
00:11:38.695 --> 00:11:41.595
Pops asked me to ask you.

182
00:11:41.595 --> 00:11:42.895
Mr. Mouri did?

183
00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:47.195
So, Mr. Mouri also suspects the employees.

184
00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:52.195
But, back then Mr. Kanzaki was resting in the break room.

185
00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.595
At around a little past 11:00 am, Ms. Izumi...

186
00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:00.495
Oh, there you are, boss!

187
00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:04.395
I came to look in on Mr. Kanzaki because I was worried.

188
00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:06.195
He's fast asleep.

189
00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:07.895
More importantly, boss!

190
00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:10.095
Mr. Shimomura was stabbed!

191
00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:11.095
What?

192
00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:14.795
I'm the witness to his alibi.

193
00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:17.295
Go and make sure you tell Mr. Mouri that.

194
00:12:17.295 --> 00:12:19.095
Okay...

195
00:12:19.095 --> 00:12:21.195
How's your stomach?

196
00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:22.895
Thanks to the medicine you gave,

197
00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:24.295
I've completely recovered...

198
00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:26.695
Then, will you go back to the sales floor?

199
00:12:26.695 --> 00:12:30.495
All right, as soon as I finish my lunch.

200
00:12:30.495 --> 00:12:33.295
Mr. Mouri suspects me.

201
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:34.795
Well, not really.

202
00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:37.895
There was no warning of a murder to begin with.

203
00:12:37.895 --> 00:12:41.895
That I faked being ill, had Mr. Shimomura wear Bekapon's outfit,

204
00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.195
then after making it look like a mistake,

205
00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.295
I tried to kill him.

206
00:12:46.295 --> 00:12:49.595
He probably thought it that way.

207
00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:53.495
That's what I thought.

208
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:10.329
You really did receive a warning of murder, right?

209
00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:14.229
Yes. I received the first one on my cell phone.

210
00:13:14.229 --> 00:13:17.629
But the one that really surprised me was the second one.

211
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:21.029
Is there a Mr. Kanzaki here?

212
00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:23.029
Oh, yes.

213
00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:27.829
Yes, I'm Kanzaki.

214
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:31.529
Kanzaki, I'm going to kill you for sure.

215
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:35.429
How did he know I was here?

216
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:39.229
Oh, Kanzaki?

217
00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:40.929
You were here too?

218
00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:43.929
What's wrong? You look pale.

219
00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:47.829
I got really scared so I decided to tell boss about it.

220
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:51.029
He told me that I should have a detective check it out.

221
00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:54.129
So, that's why you came to ask Pops to help you out.

222
00:13:54.129 --> 00:13:57.929
And, about your stomachache...

223
00:13:57.929 --> 00:14:01.929
Nothing was wrong with me until I came to work

224
00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:07.129
Around 9:00 am, I was making arrangements over tea.

225
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:08.629
Mr. Kanzaki.

226
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:12.929
I'd like Bekapon to hand out fliers in front of the station today.

227
00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:15.029
What's wrong?

228
00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:17.629
I'm sorry. I've got to go to the restroom.

229
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:21.129
I suddenly came down with a stomachache.

230
00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:23.629
You have no idea how you got it?

231
00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:26.829
Nope.

232
00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:31.329
Yes, back then...

233
00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:36.529
I was cleaning because I was asked to do so.

234
00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:38.429
Oh... Is that right?

235
00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:40.329
But, I was really shocked

236
00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:43.429
because I got mixed up in the incident as soon as I was hired.

237
00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:45.029
As soon as you were hired?

238
00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:48.529
I just started working here from yesterday, you see.

239
00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:50.729
I'm new here.

240
00:14:50.729 --> 00:14:53.529
That's why she was chosen.

241
00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:55.429
I get the picture.

242
00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:57.829
So then...

243
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:59.429
If he were to hide it,

244
00:14:59.429 --> 00:15:01.029
this room would be the only place...

245
00:15:04.929 --> 00:15:09.029
Darn, where the heck are the yellow and red clothes?

246
00:15:10.729 --> 00:15:12.329
I see.

247
00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:13.929
That's why he...

248
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:18.829
"Beikado Supermarket"

249
00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:28.329
Inspector! I hear you found out who the perpetrator is!

250
00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.129
Just what are you talking about?

251
00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:34.529
You're the one who called and said to get everybody together

252
00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:37.629
because you figured out who the perpetrator was.

253
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:41.629
I got a call from you...

254
00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:47.629
Bekapon...

255
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:51.329
It's the famous, Sleeping Kogoro!

256
00:15:52.229 --> 00:15:58.429
Who is it that mistook Mr. Shimomura for me and stabbed him?

257
00:15:58.429 --> 00:16:00.429
It was no mistake.

258
00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:04.229
The perpetrator was after Mr. Shimomura to begin with.

259
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:07.829
Just what do you mean?

260
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:11.829
The perpetrator wanted to erase Mr. Shimomura from this world.

261
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:14.129
However, if he simply killed him,

262
00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:15.329
from motive and so forth,

263
00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:18.429
suspicion might be pointed at him.

264
00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:20.329
So in order to avoid that,

265
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:22.629
he decided to fake it

266
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:26.829
to make it look as if the perpetrator mistakenly stabbed Mr. Shimomura

267
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:29.429
when actually wanting to kill Mr. Kanzaki.

268
00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:32.229
If Mr. Shimomura coincidentally turned out to be the victim

269
00:16:32.229 --> 00:16:34.229
because of a mistake,

270
00:16:34.229 --> 00:16:38.129
we wouldn't check on Mr. Shimomura.

271
00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:41.229
In other words,

272
00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:44.529
this case was a calculated murder scheme to deceive the eyes of the police

273
00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:48.829
by making it look like a mistaken target case.

274
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:51.229
Correct, Mr. Udagawa?

275
00:16:54.129 --> 00:16:55.829
Boss?

276
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:59.229
But, since Mr. Shimomura is still not dead,

277
00:16:59.229 --> 00:17:02.529
at this point it's not murder yet, only alleged murder.

278
00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:05.129
Just what is your remark based on?

279
00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:08.329
All circumstances speak for themselves!

280
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:13.329
Firstly, you called Mr. Kanzaki and warned him of the murder.

281
00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.629
Kanzaki, I'm going to kill you for sure.

282
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:20.229
Oh, Kanzaki?

283
00:17:20.229 --> 00:17:22.929
You're here too.

284
00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:25.129
You mean you made that phone call, boss.

285
00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:27.429
I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

286
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:34.129
Then, you made Mr. Kanzaki come and ask me for help.

287
00:17:34.129 --> 00:17:38.029
Because you needed a witness who knew that

288
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:41.929
somebody was after Mr. Kanzaki's life.

289
00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:44.129
And for that witness...

290
00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:47.829
you used me because I'm a well known detective.

291
00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:53.529
And today, you inserted laxative into Mr. Kanzaki's tea.

292
00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:56.029
You then told Mr. Shimomura to wear Bekapon's outfit

293
00:17:56.029 --> 00:18:00.129
as a substitute and schemed to kill him.

294
00:18:00.129 --> 00:18:02.529
Die! Kanzaki!

295
00:18:05.229 --> 00:18:08.529
To make it really look like a mistake,

296
00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:13.829
you had to have somebody hear you yell, "Die, Kanzaki!"

297
00:18:13.829 --> 00:18:18.229
That's why you told me to clean over there back then.

298
00:18:18.229 --> 00:18:19.829
It was just a coincidence!

299
00:18:19.829 --> 00:18:21.529
A coincidence...

300
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:25.529
Newcomer Teruko was just the person for that role.

301
00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:26.729
Because if it were someone

302
00:18:26.729 --> 00:18:28.129
who had been there for a long time,

303
00:18:28.129 --> 00:18:30.729
the person may remember it to be Mr. Udagawa's voice.

304
00:18:30.729 --> 00:18:32.929
After stabbing Mr. Shimomura,

305
00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:35.329
you came fleeing into this break room.

306
00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:39.029
Although you were in this room,

307
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:41.629
Mr. Kanzaki you were fast asleep.

308
00:18:41.629 --> 00:18:44.329
Probably because of the sleeping pills

309
00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:46.529
that were mixed into your drink.

310
00:18:47.829 --> 00:18:50.129
When you changed into your clothes

311
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.829
after removing the balaclava and clothes you were wearing...

312
00:18:53.829 --> 00:18:56.129
Oh, there you are, boss!

313
00:18:56.129 --> 00:19:00.029
I came to check on how Mr. Kanzaki was doing.

314
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:02.629
He's fast asleep.

315
00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:04.129
That's all a bunch of baloney!

316
00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:08.529
Why on earth would I want to kill Mr. Shimonura?

317
00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:11.929
I didn't have time to figure out what your motive was.

318
00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:15.229
I had to hurry since I didn't want you

319
00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:17.429
to get rid of the concrete evidence.

320
00:19:17.429 --> 00:19:20.429
Concrete evidence, you mean the yellow top...

321
00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:21.929
And red slacks.

322
00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:24.129
And the balaclava.

323
00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:27.829
Since there was commotion as soon as the incident happened,

324
00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:30.629
you probably didn't have time to take it outside.

325
00:19:30.629 --> 00:19:33.129
But, if he hid it somewhere,

326
00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:35.129
why would he say what he did?

327
00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:39.729
Boss! Let's have them make a thorough check.

328
00:19:39.729 --> 00:19:43.029
Because there was no use looking for it in the store.

329
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:44.829
Correct, Mr. Udagawa?

330
00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:49.129
Because you're still wearing it.

331
00:19:49.129 --> 00:19:50.229
Wearing it?

332
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:55.729
That's why you can't take off your uniform.

333
00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:59.329
Mr. Udagawa, you're sweating a lot too.

334
00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:02.629
Oh, well... I have a slight cold, you see.

335
00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:06.329
Let me go!

336
00:20:06.329 --> 00:20:07.629
Pardon me!

337
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:11.129
Reversible!

338
00:20:11.129 --> 00:20:16.229
A yellow cloth was sewn on to the inside of his uniform.

339
00:20:16.229 --> 00:20:18.929
Which means...

340
00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:20.729
Just as expected.

341
00:20:20.729 --> 00:20:23.829
He didn't change into something else.

342
00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:27.529
All he did after committing the crime was turn his top

343
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:31.029
and slacks inside out.

344
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:34.629
I got it about his clothes, but what about the balaclava?

345
00:20:34.629 --> 00:20:38.429
The only thing thinkable is that Mr. Udagawa is still wearing it...

346
00:20:38.429 --> 00:20:41.029
Exactly!

347
00:20:46.629 --> 00:20:49.329
I know it's nothing to laugh about but...

348
00:20:50.829 --> 00:20:52.529
You shouldn't use something

349
00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:55.129
that's supposed to be worn on your head as underwear!

350
00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:56.929
You know...

351
00:20:56.929 --> 00:20:59.229
You'll be punished by the gods.

352
00:20:59.229 --> 00:21:00.929
Why?

353
00:21:00.929 --> 00:21:04.129
I didn't know where else to hide it.

354
00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:07.029
Not that. I mean, why did you stab Mr. Shimomura?

355
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:08.829
You just got an offer to become

356
00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:12.729
the store manager for Beikado store number five that is opening soon.

357
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:16.129
It was an important time for me.

358
00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:17.329
But that Shimomura!

359
00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:21.029
He found out that I was embezzling cash sales

360
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:24.529
and told me he was going to turn me in.

361
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:27.029
So, I had no choice but to kill him

362
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:29.429
if I wanted the position that I always longed for, did I?

363
00:21:29.429 --> 00:21:31.329
You idiot!

364
00:21:33.829 --> 00:21:36.429
Yeah, Megure here.

365
00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:40.229
I see. I got it...

366
00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:43.629
Mr. Shimomura seems to have made it.

367
00:21:43.629 --> 00:21:44.729
I'm glad.

368
00:21:44.729 --> 00:21:46.429
Yeah.

369
00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:48.729
It seems that the outfit was thick,

370
00:21:48.729 --> 00:21:51.329
so the stab wasn't lethal.

371
00:21:51.329 --> 00:21:54.129
I should've stabbed him deeper.

372
00:21:54.129 --> 00:21:55.429
What?

373
00:21:55.429 --> 00:21:59.729
Take this unsightly character away right this minute!

374
00:21:59.729 --> 00:22:00.729
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

375
00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:06.829
Very true. He sure is an unsightly perpetrator.

376
00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:31.529
Everybody, gather round.

377
00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:33.829
Take a look at this bandage.

378
00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:38.329
Everybody's Bekapon is invincible.

379
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:41.929
Beka...

380
00:23:41.929 --> 00:23:44.829
Everybody's Bakapon's bandaged...

381
00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:48.429
Everything's for sale, Bekapon.

382
00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.429
"Next Episode"

383
00:23:53.429 --> 00:23:55.129
The whereabouts of a suspect being convoyed,

384
00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:59.429
along with the Officer he was with has become unknown.

385
00:23:59.429 --> 00:24:02.629
What the heck is Takagi doing?

386
00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:04.829
You're Ms. Chie Konaka?

387
00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:07.429
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.

388
00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:10.329
What's this? Something's not right.

389
00:24:15.429 --> 00:24:20.929
Next Conan, "Handcuffed Officer Takagi on the Run"

390
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:38.929
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:41.029
"Stalker"

392
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:43.129
The title for the next program is inexcusable!

393
00:24:43.129 --> 00:24:44.329
I think the next episode's going to be a "bad" one.

394
00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:45.829
Conan!
