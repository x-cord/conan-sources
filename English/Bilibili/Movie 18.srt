00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,800
(Conan Series  20th Anniversary)

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,550
What do you think? We, the Suzuki group,
put in all our efforts to build this.

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,020
How's the view from this Bell Tree Tower?

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,950
It's amazing, Sonoko! Thank you for inviting me!

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,600
You guys also better be thankful.

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,900
Usually, for opening ceremonies,

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,350
people other than invitees aren't allowed inside.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,120
Yeah!

9
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,520
This is awesome!

10
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,070
Thank you very much!

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,850
Look who's talking? You invited us here yourself.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,450
Hey, I think it's time to go home.

13
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,720
What are you talking about, Dad? We just came up here!

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,700
Ah, why did I come up to such a high place?

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,850
Come here, Dad. It's a beautiful view from here!

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,420
Huh, are you kidding me? I'm leaving now.

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,650
Geez.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,720
Besides, there's an old saying that
fools and something rises to high places!

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,300
Though you're saying that, in reality,
you're just scared, aren't you?

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,500
No-Nonsense! This height is nothing for me.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,220
Then it's okay to see the floor, right?

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,970
Huh? The floor?

23
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:43,270
Ah! T-There's... no floor!!

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,100
Scary! Scary! Scary!

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,120
Hey, Dad!

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,520
I'm afraid of heights!!

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,650
S-Sir?

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,050
This elevator is...

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,170
(Currently at 341 m)
This elevator brings you

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,220
(Currently at 350 m)
to the special observation deck.

31
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,970
(Currently at 360 m)
Please enjoy

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,670
(Currently at 370 m)
the world from

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,180
460 m above the ground.

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,370
Take it down!!

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,470
Geez, Dad...

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,150
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

37
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,200
It's okay.

38
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,650
- It's the usual level of disturbance.
- What's he doing?

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,050
Come on, let's enjoy the spectacular view from the Bell Tree.

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,400
Hey, Sonoko, what is that building?

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,770
Oh, that little one? It's the Asakusa Sky Court.

42
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,100
It's got nothing to do with the Suzuki group.

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,450
Even if it is completed, it will probably only be
as high as this first observation deck at most.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,570
Then the Bell Tree Tower wins, right?

45
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,170
Of course!

46
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,520
Hey, hey, look at that river.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,770
There are a lot of bridges.

48
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,850
Yeah, the Sumida River.

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,250
The blue one over there is Komagata Bridge
and the red one is Azuma Bridge.

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,100
The railway bridge in the foreground is the Touto Bell Tree Line.

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,670
Oh, there's a train coming!

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
That's so cool!

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,920
It's going to stop on the bridge.

54
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
It's just slowing down.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Because Asakusa station is right across the bridge.

56
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,770
Oh, that's right! Should we make a miniature model
of this Touto Bell Tree Tower

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,420
and its surrounding area for our summer vacation homework?

58
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,400
Oh! That sounds great!

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,420
Sounds fun! Let's do it together with Conan-kun and Ai-chan.

60
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,560
Yes, that's quite a challenge.

61
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,500
Okay.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:23,950
What?

63
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,070
That's great!

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,970
Then it's settled!

65
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,940
Let's make something awesome!

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,650
It was worth coming here.

67
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,750
Let's take lots of pictures together!

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,220
I'll take a video.

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,770
I'll look into the Bell Tree.

70
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,570
I wonder if a certain someone doesn't need to
do their summer research assignment.

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,270
Leave me alone.

72
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,500
There, the yellow building.

73
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh, wow! It's amazing!

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,300
Oh, I see it. What a lovely building.

75
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,800
This building was built 30 years ago. And now,

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,770
with the completion of the Bell Tree Tower,

77
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,500
the view alone is worth four stars.

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,150
It is definitely a five-star property.

79
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,300
Isn't 30 years too old?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,450
Oh?

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,870
What's up?

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,250
Oh, nothing.

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,200
Snipers! Everybody, get down!

84
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,800
Don't move!

85
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,720
Calm down!

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Damn it, it's caused panic.

87
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,320
So it's from there after all.

88
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,120
All right.

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,370
Professor, give me the car key.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,750
The car?

91
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,520
I want to fetch my skateboard.

92
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,620
- Okay.
- Professor, you're heavy...

93
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,270
Conan-kun.

94
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,670
(Detective Conan: Dimensional Sniper)

95
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,800
I am Shinichi Kudo, high school detective.

96
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,350
When I had gone to an amusement park
with my childhood friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

97
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,270
I witnessed a man in the Black Organization
making a dubious dealing.

98
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,370
While I was concentrating on watching the dealing,

99
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,550
I didn't notice his partner coming up behind me.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,180
That man made me drink a poison

101
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,750
and when I woke up,

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,620
my body had shrunk.

103
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,150
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

104
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,620
they'll come after my life again and can harm everyone around me.

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,320
I decided to hide my true identity
with the advice of Professor Agasa.

106
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,320
When Ran asked me my name,
I introduced myself as Conan Edogawa on a whim.

107
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,450
To gather information about them,

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,850
(Detective Mouri's Agency)
I crashed at Ran's house, whose father is a detective.

109
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,450
The Black Organization that is shrouded in mystery...

110
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,550
Besides me, there are others who are secretly pursuing them.

111
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,570
From the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI,

112
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,920
James Black, Andre Camel,

113
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,800
Jodie Starling, and Shuichi Akai.

114
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,150
He was the sharpest guy in the FBI, and a sharp sniper.

115
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,400
Then, a CIA officer infiltrated the organization

116
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,350
introducing yet another person among the infiltrators.

117
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,400
Masumi Sera. She calls herself a detective

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
and is a transfer student in Ran's and my class.

119
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,300
Then there's Subaru Okiya, a graduate student in engineering.

120
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,730
While I've been away from my house, he has been staying there.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,740
His true identity is...

122
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,860
Even though I've become smaller, my mind remains the same.

123
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
I'm the unbeaten great detective...

124
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,420
Only one truth will prevail!

125
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,120
That accurate sniper shot from that distance...

126
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,200
Don't tell me...

127
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,620
it's The Black Organization!

128
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,520
I must confirm it somehow.

129
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,150
If I'm correct, that's the building.

130
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,880
Shit!

131
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,250
What?

132
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,870
A kid fell off!

133
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,010
It's right next to that building from earlier.

134
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
That's the building. All right.

135
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,700
They might not have gone too far away yet.

136
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,000
To escape from all the traffic in this area,

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,870
did they go on foot or on a motorbike?

138
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,950
Is that the person?

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,550
That size and thickness... There's no doubt. That's a rifle case.

140
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,900
Haibara, can you hear me?

141
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,700
Damn, this rubbish!

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,420
Haibara, Haibara! Answer me, Haibara!

143
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,900
What? The noise is terrible. Where are you?

144
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm chasing a motorbike that looks like the culprit.

145
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,600
Professor, call the police.

146
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,820
What? Okay...

147
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,370
The license plate number is "Shinjuku Se 3317",
heading north on Mitsume Street.

148
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,350
He made a left turn! Damn! As if I'd let you go!

149
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,550
What's wrong? Are you okay, Edogawa-kun?

150
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,670
Yeah. I've just crossed the Sumida River at Kototoi Bridge.

151
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,620
Shit.

152
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,820
Is this distance the limit for this badge?

153
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,700
Damn it, I'm in a blind spot!

154
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,850
Where is he?

155
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,120
Backwards down a street. No way!

156
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,720
Watch out! He looks like Gulliver.

157
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,620
Damn, he must have noticed.

158
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,420
What?

159
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,150
Why are you here,

160
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,970
Sera-Neechan?

161
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,820
I'll explain later. Let's fly!

162
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,550
(2 Shinjuku Ma  ・5 31)

163
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,000
The license plate number of the suspect is "Shinjuku Se 3317".

164
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,120
According to the latest eyewitness accounts,

165
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,500
he has crossed Kototoi Bridge
and seems to be going southward along the Sumida river.

166
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,570
All vehicles in the vicinity should rush to the scene
and take him into custody.

167
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,050
What? Were you at the Bell Tree?

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,770
I was following the guy who got shot. As a detective that is.

169
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,000
Then you were also there when it happened.

170
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,720
Yeah, but I didn't think he would get killed.

171
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,020
Found him! Hold on tight!

172
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,700
Yeah.

173
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,700
He has turned left on Route 6 and entered Kuramae Bridge.

174
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,470
Catch him from both sides.

175
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,770
Copy that. The sealing off is complete on this side.

176
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,670
Shit! Let's go after him! Hold on tight!

177
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,720
No, it's not safe to provoke him further.

178
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,100
Don't worry. We'll know where to go soon enough.

179
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,920
It's stopped.

180
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,170
Maybe there's another means of escape ahead.

181
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,270
That's not good. Let's hurry.

182
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,900
Yeah. But be careful.

183
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,020
I know. I'm just checking.

184
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,820
Looks like it is just down the road.

185
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,870
Yes.

186
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,470
That motorbike...

187
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,450
Yeah, there's no doubt.

188
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,870
Did he walk from here?

189
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,370
Hah!

190
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,470
Damn it! Sera! Hey, Sera!

191
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,420
Agent Camel!

192
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,370
Ah!

193
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,120
You are mine!

194
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,620
Bring it on!

195
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,700
Ouch, ouch--- Are you all right, Sera-Neechan?

196
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,770
Yeah. If I hadn't worn this, I'd have been dead instantly.

197
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,900
Looks like neither of you are hurt.

198
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,070
More importantly, are you okay, Agent Camel?

199
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,400
No problem. I am wearing this after all.

200
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,950
I see.

201
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,270
But Jodie-san's pistol is...

202
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,970
I should keep it a secret, right?

203
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,550
I couldn't make it. He got away.

204
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,070
It cannot be helped.
Let us leave the rest to the Japanese police.

205
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,470
We will have the shores around the bay searched immediately.

206
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes. Well, it is going to be hard to catch him.

207
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,520
For the SEALs, the bay is like a garden.

208
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,470
SEALs?

209
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,270
Please look at these.

210
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,950
Based on the photos we got and that sniping skill,
we think that the culprit

211
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,550
is this person.

212
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,720
(Timothy Hunter (37))
Timothy Hunter, 37 years old.

213
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,860
A former Navy SEAL sniper from the Navy Special Forces

214
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,600
and a battlefield hero

215
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,220
who participated in

216
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,570
the Middle East war from 2003 for three years.

217
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,850
Why would that hero do that?

218
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,020
The cause likely is this Silver Star.

219
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,720
Silver Star?

220
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,800
In combat against hostile armed forces,

221
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,970
(Silver Star)

222
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,250
this medal of honor is awarded to soldiers
who have demonstrated bravery.

223
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,200
Hunter was awarded this badge of heroism in 2005.

224
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,400
But, in the following year,

225
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,480
he was stripped on the suspicion of
breach of the rules of engagement.

226
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,770
Stripped?

227
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,020
Yes. There was a complaint from an army officer that

228
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,250
Hunter shot and killed an unarmed civilian.

229
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,070
Of course, he denied it
and the investigation found insufficient evidence.

230
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,020
It did not go to court, but

231
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,670
this incident changed Hunter from being a hero on the battlefield

232
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,570
to being called a hero of suspicion.

233
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,350
Perhaps this Silver Star incident influenced him and

234
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,850
when Hunter returned to combat, he lost his usual calmness.

235
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,600
He isolated himself on the battlefield
and was shot in his head by the enemy.

236
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,050
That's terrible.

237
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
So, what happened to Hunter?

238
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,770
Fortunately, the surgery was a success and he survived.

239
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,050
However, given the situation, he was discharged from the army,
and he returned home soon after.

240
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,620
But his misery did not end there.

241
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,070
After returning home,

242
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,420
Hunter sought a peaceful life
and moved to rural Seattle, Washington.

243
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,770
However, the horrible memories of the battlefield never left him

244
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,570
and continued to torment him.

245
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,220
And the misfortune was not limited to him,

246
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,720
but also to his wife and sister who were living with him.

247
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,670
Bankruptcy due to investment failure,
suicide of his sister due to broken engagement,

248
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,620
death of his wife due to drug overdose...

249
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,820
Hunter lost his honor, his fortune,

250
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,370
and even his beloved family in quick succession.

251
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,620
For the next six years, Hunter's whereabouts
have been completely unknown.

252
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,120
Why would such a person be a suspect in this murder case?

253
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,950
It was three weeks ago.

254
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,600
In Seattle, a reporter for a local newspaper named Brian Woods

255
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,320
was shot and killed with a rifle.

256
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,370
(The Suspected Hero)
When the police investigated the victim,

257
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,750
in a series of articles called "The Suspected Hero",

258
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,220
the victim interviewed Hunter and his wife relentlessly.

259
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,350
It turned out that he had driven them both into a neurosis.

260
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,420
This led the police and the FBI
to investigate the suspect Hunter,

261
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,220
and we found out that he had entered Japan two weeks earlier.

262
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,370
At the time, we happened to be in Japan on vacation,

263
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,300
when the FBI ordered us to take custody of Hunter.

264
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,720
I see. So that is how you got to where you are now.

265
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,250
Yes. By the way, what happened to Hunter after that?

266
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,220
We are still searching the bay, but there are no leads...

267
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,670
It is not unreasonable.

268
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,970
As you know, SEAL is

269
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,050
an acronym for sea, air, land,

270
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,420
(SEAL)
and they are particularly good at swimming

271
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,820
as well as rifle sniping.

272
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,600
About that sniping, however,

273
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,470
we found something strange on the roof of the building

274
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,250
from where he was supposed to have fired his rifle.

275
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,620
Something strange?

276
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,450
Chiba-kun.

277
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,300
Yes.

278
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,920
In the rail space for window
cleaning on the Bell Tree Tower side,

279
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,800
a die and a 51 mm long empty cartridge was found.

280
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,420
As for the cartridge,
it is the same caliber as the 7.62 mm bullet

281
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,770
that was used in the crime.

282
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,450
It matches the caliber of Hunter's favorite rifle,

283
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,720
the MK-11 and its NATO ammo.

284
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,920
So, Hunter's...

285
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,750
About the die... was one also placed
at the Seattle sniping spot along with

286
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,600
an empty cartridge?

287
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,370
No. We haven't heard of anything like it.

288
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,170
There is a connection between Hunter and the dice.

289
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,100
What?

290
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Hunter likes to play the dice game

291
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,600
and seems to have a tattoo of dice right here on his left arm.

292
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,050
I-I see.

293
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,300
That is a very weak connection, but

294
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,720
it wouldn't be surprising if Hunter is using it

295
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,350
to leave some sort of a message.

296
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,070
Yes. Besides, they are saying that
the crime this time was committed by Hunter.

297
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,400
The best evidence is on the victim.

298
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,800
That means...

299
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,620
Do you mean to say that Hunter has a definite motive
for killing Fujinami-san?

300
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,400
Yes, this Hiroaki Fujinami is the one who

301
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,420
(Hiroaki Fujinami (40))
sold a high-risk property to Hunter in Japan seven years ago

302
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,150
and drove Hunter into bankruptcy.

303
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
What?

304
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,320
So...

305
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,520
Then, the culprit is undoubtedly Hunter.

306
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,400
By the way, why was Sera-Neechan following Fujinami-san?

307
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,720
Indeed.

308
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,320
Why did you follow Fujinami-san?

309
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,670
A relative of a classmate of mine was going to marry Fujinami.

310
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,470
She thought he was a shady guy,
so she asked me to do his background check.

311
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,950
According to my research,

312
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,750
- Background check?
- Fujinami seems to have been

313
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,970
- How cheeky.
- deceiving good-natured foreigners

314
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,720
and selling high-risk properties in Japan.

315
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,350
Oh right. At that time...

316
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,700
Well, I feel sorry that he was murdered.

317
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,920
But, I guess it's a good thing that
it resulted in breaking off her remarriage.

318
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,370
By the way, from what you said just now,
I don't think this will be

319
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,170
the end of Hunter's crime spree.

320
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,550
Yes. That is true.

321
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,350
Who else could Hunter attempt to kill?

322
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,200
Jodie-kun, get the pictures.

323
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,650
Yes.

324
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,150
We, the FBI, believe that there are at least three more people.

325
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,600
Th-Three people?

326
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,050
Yes. The people most likely to be killed

327
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,350
are these ones.

328
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,750
Jack Waltz, 45 years old.

329
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,270
He is a retired Army captain
who accused Hunter of breaching the rules of engagement.

330
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,450
Currently, he runs a company in San Diego that manufactures

331
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,320
equipment for the military.

332
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,870
Next, Bill Murphy, 35 years old.

333
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,220
He is a former Army third sergeant who served under Waltz

334
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
and was a witness to Hunter's breach of the rules of engagement.

335
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,520
After his discharge, he joined Waltz's company
and became his secretary.

336
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,670
He can't kill people who are in San Diego.

337
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,950
No, these two are currently in Japan.

338
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,020
What?

339
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,120
For the past two days, Waltz has been in Kyoto with his family.

340
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,150
Murphy is staying in Nikko.

341
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,650
Kyoto and

342
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,020
Nikko?

343
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,620
Yes. They are supposed to stay for eight more days.

344
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,170
And finally, one more person, Hitoshi Moriyama, 34 years old.

345
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,050
He is the one who broke off the engagement
that led to the suicide of Hunter's sister.

346
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,520
Moriyama was a trading company employee in Seattle.

347
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,500
He has been retired for four years
and we do not know where he is now.

348
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,250
I can't believe two out of the three of them are in Japan.

349
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,000
They will definitely be targeted.

350
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,750
Let us alert the Kyoto
and Tochigi prefecture police immediately.

351
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,880
(Timothy Hunter (37))
All right. We search urgently for

352
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,400
(Timothy Hunter (37))
Timothy Hunter as a material witness.

353
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,270
Yes sir.

354
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,370
A former SEALs sniper.
That's a hell of a guy who has appeared on the scene.

355
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,250
But for now, it is clear that this has nothing to do
with the Black Organization.

356
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,200
Anyway, why did this Hunter guy
start taking revenge now, after six years?

357
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,620
That's true.

358
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,620
That's a good point.

359
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,000
It's just a coincidence, of course.

360
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,520
Anyway, it's time you finished playing detective.

361
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,750
You were this close to dying.

362
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,570
Hey, kid, don't go wandering around too much!

363
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,650
Understood.

364
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,370
Geez.

365
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,670
Sera-san, I'm really glad you have no injuries.

366
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,770
But please don't put Conan-kun

367
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,170
in danger ever again.

368
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,550
Don't worry. I'll definitely protect Conan-kun.

369
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,300
And as of now, no bullet has hit Conan-kun's heart.

370
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,850
And of course, your heart either.

371
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,100
- What?
- Huh?

372
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,200
Okay, my motorbike's over there. See you later, Conan-kun.

373
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,600
Seriously, does she even understand what she's saying?

374
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,850
How is it that it won't hit my heart?

375
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,220
Oh! Because if it's Ran, you'll dodge it with karate, right?

376
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,350
That's ridiculous.

377
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,300
No, if it's you, it could be possible.

378
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,650
What's wrong with you guys?

379
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,420
We're finally getting to light fireworks,
but you all seem so down.

380
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,670
Of course not. A man was shot in front of us.

381
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,500
Well, it can't be helped.

382
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,850
That's not all!

383
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,220
Huh?

384
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,300
The police took the pictures we taken.

385
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,970
And all the digital cameras too.

386
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,700
They're just holding it for awhile. They'll give them back soon.

387
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,900
It could be a clue to the investigation.

388
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,970
Oh, it's over.

389
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,420
Mine, too.

390
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,770
Mine, too.

391
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,050
Ah...

392
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,900
Ah...

393
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,920
That's it.

394
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,520
How is it? Has your mood improved a little?

395
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,320
This much isn't enough.

396
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,850
It seems like we're missing something.

397
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,170
We should have bought more.

398
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,570
Hahaha, I knew it would come to that.

399
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,120
I've prepared something for you.

400
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,550
The Ball Dispensing Belt?

401
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,770
This is the new version of it.

402
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,750
Kick it as high as you can.

403
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,220
All right, just make it quick.

404
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,700
Okay, first set the timer...

405
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,950
Here we go!

406
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Wow, so high!

407
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,900
All right, good!

408
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,020
Whoa! Amazing!

409
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,370
It's called a fireworks ball.

410
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,870
But you'll get complaints from the neighbors.

411
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,370
Eh, that will be bad.

412
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
Ai-kun, what should I do?

413
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,970
Geez.

414
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,350
It's not fair, with just Conan-kun.

415
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,750
That's not fair, Professor!

416
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,950
Don't you have anything for us?

417
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,500
Ah... I give up.

418
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,520
Hmm~, It's morning already, huh.

419
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,150
That guy Hitoshi Moriyama...

420
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,920
I'm pretty sure I saw an article about it
in the newspaper or something.

421
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,350
I wonder if I was wrong?

422
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,500
This was sent from FBI headquarters.

423
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,320
They are the people Hunter is most likely to contact.

424
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah.

425
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,370
(Mark Spencer (65), Kevin Yoshino (32), Scott Green (43))
Currently, three teams are on their way to interrogate them.

426
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,570
Could you please share the information that
the FBI has collected with us once again.

427
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,170
Of course.

428
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
First, Scott Green.

429
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,600
A former Chief Petty Officer in the Navy,
he now combines his hobby with his practical interests

430
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,950
by running a motorbike shop in Machida. When he was in SEALs,

431
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,750
he was an instructor at a sniper school

432
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,600
and Hunter was one of his students.

433
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,000
Next, Kevin Yoshino.

434
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,700
Former Marine Corps Staff Sergeant,
now runs a military shop in Fussa.

435
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:38,020
He has been using his own channels to procure

436
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,650
U.S. military surplus items and sell them.

437
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,850
And lastly, Mark Spencer.

438
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,770
He was not on the list yesterday.

439
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,470
Yes. He isn't directly involved with Hunter, but

440
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,850
he is a good counselor for American soldiers living in Japan.

441
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,420
He is a former commander.

442
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,170
He is a person on whom Hunter,
who has limited circle of friends, can rely on.

443
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,100
I see. Considering the route he took to get the rifle

444
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,300
it wouldn't be wrong to assume that
one of these people is a collaborator.

445
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,050
What? Tim? Is Hunter-san the culprit?

446
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,800
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

447
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,470
When you were in combat in the Middle East,

448
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,050
Hunter-san saved your life, correct?

449
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,770
Yeah, if he wasn't there, I would have been dead.

450
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,570
What if that lifesaver comes to you asking for help?

451
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,320
For example, for procuring MK-11, the gun that was used

452
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,850
(MK-11)
in the shooting.

453
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,950
We don't have anything like that.

454
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,850
Do you think that is real?

455
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,050
If you want to check it out, I can sell it to you.

456
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,450
Have you met with Hunter?

457
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,520
Yeah, he said he just came to Japan the other day.

458
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,020
So, where is he?

459
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,850
I'm sorry, but I don't know where he is right now.

460
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,650
The culprit's means of escape was a motorbike.

461
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,370
Ah!

462
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,500
It is a used one that was repaired and has a fake license plate.

463
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,970
Are you trying to say that I provided it?

464
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,670
I'm sorry, but we only sell new bikes.

465
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,420
As for Hunter-san's breach of the rules of engagement,

466
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,620
what do you think?

467
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,570
It is probably true.

468
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,600
A brave attempt to protect an ally...

469
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,020
He misunderstood that he had weapons and shot him.

470
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,120
No, it's not! It isn't just limited to Hunter-san,

471
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,770
everything is made up!

472
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,000
Made up?

473
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,350
As a former sniper, that Waltz was jealous of Hunter-san.

474
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,420
Was Jack Waltz also a sniper?

475
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,950
He stole the Silver Star from Hunter-san.

476
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,550
And...

477
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,820
Are you saying that there was no breach
of the rules of engagement?

478
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,370
Yeah, of course.

479
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,550
Hunter-san is a hero who saved my life
as well as those of many of our comrades-in-arms.

480
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,870
If he comes asking for help, I plan to help him.

481
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,600
I don't know this person called Hunter.

482
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,900
I have never met him
and don't have any information on him either.

483
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
I see.

484
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,370
Then, as for Hunter-san's breach of the rules of engagement,

485
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,520
what do you think?

486
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,850
Whether it is true or not is no longer the issue.

487
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,200
If Hunter is the culprit this time,

488
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,670
as a fellow ex-Navy man, I absolutely cannot forgive him.

489
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,800
Shoot him dead as soon as you find him.

490
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,970
Shoot him to death?

491
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,020
However, a police sniper would not stand a chance against Hunter.

492
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,000
If you want, I can lend you my chauffeur.

493
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,150
Carlos.

494
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,870
Yes.

495
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,200
Carlos Lee is a former Marine sniper.

496
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,120
In the Middle East, he shot and killed 36 enemy soldiers.

497
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,720
Those are the confirmed records.
Including the unconfirmed ones, it's 78 people.

498
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,320
Oh yes. That is how it is. Well,

499
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,220
Still, it doesn't measure upto 79 of Hunter's.

500
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,400
Only a sniper can beat a sniper.

501
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,450
What do you think? Do you want to take him with you?

502
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,900
(Beika Library)

503
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,670
If it's not a newspaper article,
it's probably a womens' magazine.

504
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,850
But this is going to be a huge load of work.

505
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,700
Okay, spread out the map on the desk.

506
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,300
Yes!

507
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,750
First of all, let's decide the scope of production.

508
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,100
Oh, looks like you are starting your summer homework early.

509
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,520
Of course!

510
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,850
That's great. I need to reward you for your hard work.

511
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,020
What is it? What is it?

512
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,900
Will you also give us the fireworks belts?

513
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,820
No, that would be a nuisance to the neighbors.

514
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,920
This is more practical for you.

515
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,870
Hmm?

516
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,270
Detective badges?

517
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,970
Yes, the new version.

518
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,370
I made some improvements in their communication sensitivity.

519
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,220
You were quite concerned
when a certain someone called it rubbish.

520
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,550
What's this? You heard it, huh?

521
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,750
It's kind of the same as the last one.

522
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,170
Is it only the communication that was improved?

523
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,720
That's no fun.

524
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,290
Ahem, that's not all.

525
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,570
On changing the settings
and pressing this communication button...

526
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,770
Oh, it flashing!

527
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,420
Those are LED lamps, right?

528
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,430
Oh, that's cooler than the last one.

529
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,070
Yes.

530
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,550
We can also choose the color of the flash
and the person to communicate.

531
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,870
Awesome!

532
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,720
But doesn't it sound weird?

533
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,570
Hmm?

534
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,520
Sound?

535
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,170
Eek!

536
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,070
I don't hear anything.

537
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,500
Huh? You can't hear this, Professor?

538
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,750
That's a mosquitone.

539
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,500
High-frequency sounds become less audible with age.

540
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,100
Adults can't hear them.

541
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,150
It became like that by chance in the process of improving.

542
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,820
I will have to fix it later.

543
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,170
I think this is a good thing in a way.

544
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,150
The mosquitone might help, too.

545
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,370
But in the end, this means it's defective.

546
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,250
I'm so disappointed.

547
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,450
I feel like my excitement is all gone.

548
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,450
All right. Then let's have a quiz to cheer you up.

549
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,550
Oh!

550
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,050
Again?

551
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,670
It'll be a pun anyway.

552
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,370
Oh, no...

553
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,800
Why don't we just listen to him?

554
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,500
If Ai-chan says so.

555
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,850
We'll do it for Haibara-san.

556
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,250
There's no choice.

557
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,170
All right, then here it is.

558
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,050
You have to play rock-paper-scissors

559
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,220
with a sniper who is looking for vinegar.

560
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
What will you put out to win?

561
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,320
The clue is the English word "sniper".

562
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,150
What's a sniper?

563
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,400
English?

564
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,070
Conan-kun, did you understand it?

565
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,120
Yeah. But this is going to get you in trouble again.

566
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,470
I don't know anything about English.

567
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,600
I give up.

568
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,120
What's the answer?

569
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,800
The correct answer is "scissors". He's a sniper.

570
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,020
No vinegar? So, the one who has the advantage
in rock-paper-scissors

571
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,700
is scissors.

572
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,700
He said, "No vinegar"?

573
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,270
Is Kaa, Paa?

574
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,870
So, do you mean he would pick paper,

575
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,950
and I could win with scissors?

576
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,870
Eh?

577
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,850
No vinegar...?

578
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,870
Yeah, so, Su-naika?

579
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:17,970
Eh?

580
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,850
Which of the following sports is a sniper good at?

581
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
1. Baseball   2. Soccer   3. Golf

582
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,150
Th-That's...

583
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
The answer is 3.

584
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,150
(Sniper? Nice par)
Because if you rearrange the sniper, it becomes a nice par.

585
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,000
That's great, Ai-chan!

586
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
That's Haibara-san!

587
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,670
Nice par?

588
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,070
From now on, Haibara should be in charge of quizzes.

589
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,700
My virtue of words...!

590
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,120
Leave the Professor alone. Let's do our summer homework.

591
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,170
Yeah.

592
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,270
Let's do it.

593
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,870
I'm so sorry.

594
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,070
By the way, you dropped your phone, right?

595
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,920
Looks like there was an inquiry from the police.

596
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,950
Seriously that Professor...
that should take priority over a quiz, right?

597
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Also, Masumi Sera.

598
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,200
Be careful of her. She's dangerous.

599
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,500
Look who's talking.

600
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,220
Huh, Conan-kun?

601
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:20,620
Hmm?

602
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
He's going to get back the phone he dropped.

603
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,700
Let's just start with us.

604
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,120
Thank you very much for visiting.

605
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,770
Beika Library will be closing soon.

606
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,160
This is so strange.

607
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,870
Was it my misunderstanding...?

608
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,520
Oh! Bingo!

609
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,200
(Hitoshi Yasuhara-san and Nami-san)
Hitoshi Yasuhara? Huh? It's not Moriyama?

610
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,600
He started a private import business four years ago.

611
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,120
His wife is a charismatic cooking expert.

612
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,820
She has a cooking school in Honjo, Sumida-ku.

613
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,870
Excuse me... it's about time.

614
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,670
Yes, I'll clear it up right away.

615
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,350
I'm sorry.

616
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,420
Yasuhara-san chose his wife Nami-san's surname
at the time of their marriage.

617
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,050
Oh, right, he changed his last name in their marriage.

618
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,770
We are supposed to be taking on the Black Organization,
but we've been involved in a troublesome case.

619
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:13,970
Yes.

620
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,700
On top of that, the opponent is nasty.
He's a former SEALs sniper.

621
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,070
I wish Akai-san was here.

622
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

623
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,970
It's okay.

624
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,770
Because I was thinking the same thing.

625
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,170
Shu, I wanted to ask you something.

626
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,770
Between police shooters and military snipers,

627
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,900
who has better sniping skills?

628
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,900
It depends on the conditions.

629
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,020
Why?

630
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,570
If it is within 100 meters, a police shooter is better.

631
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,100
In terms of shooting accuracy,
the police shooters are more accurate.

632
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,570
Is that so?

633
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,500
Yeah. Police shooters are mainly used in hostage incidents.

634
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,870
In such cases, the shooter is required
to shoot with unmatched accuracy

635
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,350
that instantly takes away the target's physical capabilities.

636
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,900
If you want to kill a man instantly with a single bullet

637
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,050
without causing any seizure,

638
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,000
there's only one place to aim.

639
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,700
The brain stem.

640
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,220
Yes. In the case of all other parts,

641
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,870
even if it bullet went through a person's heart,

642
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,050
they can keep fighting for about 10 seconds.

643
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,500
In the meantime, of course, the hostages

644
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,400
or other officers could be killed.

645
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,770
But where do I aim?

646
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,600
Face the target and aim for the tip of their nose.

647
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,350
What do you think? Can you do it?

648
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:47,520
Don't worry. As long as I'm with you, I won't let you do that.

649
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,770
Never.

650
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,050
Shu...

651
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,250
Thank you very much.

652
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,570
Be careful to not drop it again.

653
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,570
Yes.

654
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,650
Conan-kun, what have you been doing all this time?

655
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,320
Oh, I dropped my phone.

656
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,700
So that's why I couldn't get in touch with you.

657
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm sorry. That aside, what's up?

658
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,370
Yeah, I found someone who looks like Hitoshi Moriyama.

659
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,350
I'm going to check if it's him.

660
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,170
Wait, I'm coming with you.

661
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,550
But where are you now?

662
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,170
In front of Azuma Bridge Police Box, Honjo, Sumida-ku.

663
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,870
Surprise, surprise. I'm in Honjo, too.

664
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,950
What? Really?

665
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,720
Yeah. It seems like

666
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,820
we're destined to solve this case.

667
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,750
Yeah, turn left there.

668
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,650
You came fast, Conan-kun.

669
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,050
Yeah. Is there any movement?

670
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,950
No, Not yet.

671
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,420
All right, shall we get in?

672
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,270
Yeah.

673
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,650
A vehicle will be leaving.

674
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,500
- Oh, no!
- Please be careful.

675
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,550
Oh, no! Run, Conan-kun!

676
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,250
N-No way!

677
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,870
There are two possible sniping spots.
Which one do you think it will be?

678
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,720
I'll put my bet on the high one. Are you in?

679
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,150
Yeah, I think it's that building, too.

680
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,250
If we connect the windshield
and Moriyama-san's bullet hole with a straight line,

681
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,200
the low building in the foreground becomes the sniping spot.

682
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,620
But Moriyama-san's car was still in the middle of
the underground parking lot at that time.

683
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,820
That means that the angle of incidence
added to the angle of the slope.

684
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,170
It should be the true ballistic trajectory.

685
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,500
And there's only one skyscraper on that trajectory.

686
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,800
It's this building, isn't it?

687
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,300
Wait, Conan-kun! It's risky to go alone!

688
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,450
Damn it!

689
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,670
Sir, please fill in the form!

690
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,870
Seriously, you're too reckless.

691
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,050
Hunter could also be nearby somewhere.

692
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,170
Three? Could it be...

693
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,170
Conan-kun!

694
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,850
Hey, look. Here.

695
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,350
Oh, I knew this was the sniping spot.

696
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:58,920
Yeah.

697
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,200
(Metropolitan Police Department)
I didn't know Moriyama-san was back in Japan.

698
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,400
(Hiroaki Fujinami (40) Hitoshi Moriyama (34))
Yeah, it was careless of me.

699
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,050
If these two people were murdered,

700
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,320
it seems certain that Hunter is the culprit.

701
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,650
Yes. The bullets also match the caliber of

702
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,720
Hunter's favorite MK-11.

703
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,220
The scene of the shooting of both victims also tells us that

704
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,450
Hunter is the culprit.

705
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,370
What does that mean?

706
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,350
Regarding that... Akahoshi-kun.

707
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,200
Yes.

708
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Fujinami-san always invited his customers to high places

709
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,950
and introduced them to high-risk properties.

710
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:41,820
Yes.

711
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,620
Hunter was probably also fooled in the same way.

712
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,920
So, he dared to target at the time
when Fujinami-san was introducing his property.

713
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,200
Yes, sir.

714
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,870
According to a real estate agent,
Fujinami-san obtained a large number of pre-opening tickets

715
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,850
for the Bell Tree Tower through back channels

716
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,800
and presented his properties from there every day.

717
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,620
And as for Moriyama-san,
he broke off his engagement to Hunter's beloved sister

718
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,470
and married another woman.

719
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,570
Hunter probably chose the place
in front of Moriyama-san's home, his love nest,

720
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,650
as the scene of his murder.

721
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,050
Moriyama-san picked up his wife at the same time every day

722
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,330
after she finished her cooking class.

723
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,920
Perhaps he was targeted during that timing.

724
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,450
On the day of the incident,
the door and the security camera were broken down with a gun

725
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,350
and the culprit got in.

726
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,500
He went to the site many times, gathered information,

727
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,150
and carefully planned the sniping.

728
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,700
It's typical of a sniper from SEALs, isn't it?

729
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,220
Yes. Speaking of meticulous planning,

730
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,400
was there an empty cartridge and a die again this time?

731
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,870
Oh, yes. At the sniping spot.

732
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,200
This is the photo of that.

733
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,200
This time, the number on the dice is three...

734
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,700
I believe the last one was four, right?

735
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,920
Could this be... a countdown?

736
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,150
What?

737
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,820
Could be!

738
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,500
If so, there are a total of four people

739
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,350
that Hunter is targeting here in Japan.

740
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,100
Hiroaki Fujinami-san and Hitoshi Moriyama-san
have already been murdered.

741
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,000
He might kill the remaining two next and leave

742
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,150
a die rolled to two and one at each of the sniping spots.

743
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,850
That would be bad. If this reasoning is correct,
then the other two are...

744
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,050
Yeah, definitely.

745
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,320
(Jack Waltz (45) Bill Murphy (35) )
Jack Waltz-san and Bill Murphy-san I guess.

746
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,900
They both heard about the sniping
from the respective prefecture police

747
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,870
and drastically changed their sightseeing schedule in Japan.

748
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:48,800
The original schedule was for them
to meet up in Tokyo two days later.

749
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,550
But they decided not to leave their accommodation

750
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,870
until the case was solved.

751
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,550
It seems that Waltz-san's family
wants to return home as soon as possible.

752
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,320
But they are stuck in a situation where Hunter, who has

753
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,820
committed planned crimes, might predict their actions

754
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,420
and thus feel completely helpless.

755
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,520
It would be better if they did not move.

756
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,450
Yes. While the police keeps an eye on them,

757
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,550
Hunter won't take action on them easily.

758
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,470
It will not be easy for Hunter to enter Kyoto or Nikko now,

759
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,570
which have strict checkpoints in place.

760
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,620
But that does not mean we can just sit on our hands and watch.

761
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,870
There is a high possibility that Hunter is still in Tokyo!

762
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,770
Do whatever it takes to find out where he is!

763
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,700
Yes sir!

764
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,200
What's the matter, Conan-kun?

765
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,400
Yeah, yeah. What?

766
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,070
Hunter was shot dead?

767
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,000
Their identity is currently still being confirmed,

768
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,220
but it's probably Hunter.

769
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,070
Yeah. I'll call you back when I get more details.

770
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,550
A dairy was found from the room in which Hunter was holed up.

771
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,250
On translating it, it turned out to be a surprise.

772
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,470
This is the picture of it.

773
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,250
August 3rd. He has snatched my prey yet again
and is provoking me.

774
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,900
He is obviously challenging me. I will find a way to kill him

775
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,450
and get the last two targets myself.

776
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,570
This means that someone has gotten ahead of Hunter and

777
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,650
and killed Fujinami-san and Moriyama-san.

778
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,450
Could it be that the real culprit challenged Hunter

779
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,050
to a direct confrontation and won?

780
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,850
If that is the case, that person we saw wasn't Hunter either.

781
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,600
The culprit may have shot from the floating boat

782
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,800
across the Sumida River.

783
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,850
This time as well, an empty cartridge and

784
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,300
a die showing a roll of two was found on the floor.

785
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,970
The difference between the sniping this time
and the previous cases

786
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,990
is that the distance was about 150 m
compared to the past two incidents

787
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,900
which is even closer than the past sniping incidents.

788
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,300
One bullet shot, which could have been a sniping error,

789
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,450
was found lodged in the door of the room.

790
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,550
A bullet hole was also found on the floor of the float ship,
which could have been a sniping error.

791
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,320
Right now, the crime lab experts are investigating the area.

792
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,650
Information about the empty cartridges and dice
is not supposed to be revealed to the media, right?

793
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,670
Yes. The fact that they were left at the sniping spot means

794
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,270
that including Hunter's murder this time,
all three murders were definitely

795
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,250
committed by the same person.

796
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,820
So that is why, there were no dice or cartridge

797
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,070
at the first Seattle sniping spot.

798
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,100
So does that mean that the murder of Brian Woods
was the only one committed by Hunter?

799
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,420
Yes, it makes sense if we think that way.

800
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,700
If that is correct,

801
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,420
we should focus on the number on each die.

802
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,150
four, three, two and next would be one.

803
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,420
So there will be one more sniping after all?

804
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,820
Yes. But there is nothing we can do to stop it.

805
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,520
I see.

806
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,770
Then the two people Hunter had a grudge against,

807
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,050
(Jack Waltz (45) Bill Murphy (35))
Jack Waltz-san and Bill Murphy-san...

808
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,600
There is no reason left for them to be targeted anymore.

809
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,900
Yes and we have no idea

810
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,970
who the next target will be.

811
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,720
Things have taken a turn for the worse.

812
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,520
Early this morning, at an abandoned building
in Azumabashi 1-chome, Sumida-ku, Tokyo,

813
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,020
the third shooting incident has occurred.

814
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,870
The murdered person was an American,
Timothy Hunter-san, 37 years old.

815
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,850
He was a former sniper of the U.S. Navy SEALs

816
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,980
(Timothy Hunter, 37, Former U.S. Navy SEALs Soldier)
and the police had been pursuing him

817
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,300
(Timothy Hunter, 37, Former U.S. Navy SEALs Soldier)
as a suspect in a series of shootings.

818
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,470
The police have not released any further details yet, but

819
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,210
don't you think that there's no problem in assuming that

820
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,580
the last two shootings were done by the same criminal?

821
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,050
(What will happen?! The case of sniper spree...)
Huh? That means...

822
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,100
It means that this isn't the end of the sniping case.

823
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,690
And we don't know who is being targeted.

824
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,320
Huh? Then are you saying that it is a random murder?

825
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,450
I wouldn't say it like that, but...

826
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,520
If the culprit is not caught soon...

827
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,770
Did you hear that? They're saying
it could be random killings. So scary!

828
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,520
There are helicopters flying over the Sumida River.

829
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,320
Is it the downtown area that's dangerous after all?

830
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,170
No, I heard that Shibuya might be targeted this time.

831
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,000
Really?

832
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,670
It would be safe if we go through the underpass.

833
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,570
I heard that Harajuku's dangerous too!

834
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,450
(It's Harajuku
Harajuku       Harajuku)

835
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,100
Of course it's fake news. Don't be fooled, you idiot.

836
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,550
Takeshita Street is empty. I'm really impressed!

837
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,100
I've never seen anything like this before.

838
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,850
It's Asakusa, after all.

839
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,050
Apparently, children are not allowed outside.

840
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,900
Are you kidding? Every person
who has been targetedtill now has been an adult.

841
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,370
There are no old people at the temple.

842
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,820
What's going on?

843
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,470
The Bell Tree Tower, which was the first shooting site,
is still closed, isn't it?

844
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,500
By the way, I heard that we can see the Bell Tree Tower

845
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,300
from the last two shooting sites.

846
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,320
You can see the Bell Tree Tower, can't you?

847
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,600
Are you saying that the key to this case is the Bell Tree Tower?

848
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,150
Even if it's far away, being able to see the Bell Tree Tower

849
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,450
means that place is dangerous, right?

850
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,050
An umbrella, if we use an umbrella,

851
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,270
no one will be able to see us from above, so it'll be safe.

852
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,200
This is super funny!

853
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,930
(Detective Mouri's Agency)

854
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:22,700
We are reporting from the site in Kinshicho,
where five people were seriously injured.

855
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,400
Looks like all of Tokyo is freaking out.

856
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,600
The word "indiscriminate killing" spread everywhere
within the blink of an eye.

857
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,470
Well, it is no wonder.

858
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,550
There has been no precedent in Japan for a sniper spree.

859
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,520
Go ahead.

860
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,070
Thank you, Ran-chan.

861
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,300
Thank you.

862
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,120
So? Do you have any idea about who might have done it?

863
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,490
About that...

864
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,050
To be honest, Hunter's murder

865
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,200
has made us confused as well.

866
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,170
So we were thinking of asking for your opinion.

867
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,850
I see.

868
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,000
Hey, hey. It's no use asking Mister.

869
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,170
The only thing that is certain is that the culprit is

870
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,020
someone who is related to Hunter in some way.

871
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,750
Yes. Speaking of people related to Hunter who live in Japan,

872
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:15,570
a former sniper school instructor and SEALs sniper himself,

873
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,750
Scott Green.

874
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Or Kevin Yoshino, a former Marine Corps Staff Sergeant.

875
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:24,200
Actually, these two have been missing since last night.

876
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,060
- Eh?
- What?

877
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,350
It's just that, the two of them have no motive to kill Hunter.

878
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,220
Then, are the police not sure about the culprit?

879
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,450
We are thinking it is a third person
who hasn't been suspected in the investigation yet.

880
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,420
No, you are still forgetting one person.

881
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,700
Retired Navy Rear Admiral, Mark Spencer,
former commander of Yokosuka Base.

882
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,800
But...

883
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:54,300
His chauffeur, Carlos Lee, former Marine sniper.

884
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:58,050
But neither Spencer-san nor Lee-san were involved with Hunter.

885
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,200
Yes. To begin with, what motive could they have?

886
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,800
His motive is the sniper's pride.

887
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:03,770
Pride?

888
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,970
Yeah, Hunter's got 79 battlefield kills. What about Lee's?

889
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:14,120
Huh...? L-Let's see... 36 people in the Middle East.

890
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,450
Those are the confirmed battlefield result.

891
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,070
If you include the unconfirmed ones,

892
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,420
Huh? Oh, yes.

893
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,050
It was 78 people if I recall correctly.

894
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,870
That is correct. That is what Lee couldn't stand.

895
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,500
He wants to insist that his skills are better...

896
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,320
At that time, Lee heard that Hunter had shot Woods in Seattle.

897
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,850
The total number of Hunter's killings was 80.

898
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,500
That is why Lee went ahead

899
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,550
and sniped Fujinami-san and Moriyama-san!

900
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:49,570
This makes it 80-80. Lee finally caught up with Hunter

901
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,250
and challenged him to a fight to end it.

902
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,650
Bang!

903
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,350
I understand!

904
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,900
Eh?

905
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,300
We will look into it along that line!

906
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,920
Y... Y-Yeah.

907
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,500
Thank you very much!

908
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,850
Thank you very much!

909
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,820
Dad, that's great!

910
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,550
It's an outlandish theory, but it makes sense.

911
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,700
But regardless of whether Mister's guess is right or not,

912
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,520
I need more information.

913
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,700
New information?

914
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,270
Oh, by the way, the bullet removed from Hunter's body was

915
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,450
a 5.56 x 45 mm bullet.

916
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,400
It was the lightest bullet found
among the cases so far, so it didn't penetrate.

917
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,750
A different bullet?

918
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,070
Yes. Despite the fact that the aim was his head,

919
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,120
we could tell right away that it was Hunter.

920
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,300
There wasn't much damage to his body.

921
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,970
Did the culprit switch to a lighter bullet from a different gun
because of the closer distance?

922
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,370
Could be. He might have tried to lighten the recoil
and increase the accuracy.

923
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,050
But he made one mistake.

924
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,050
Oh, this is strange.

925
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,220
Did you find out anything else?

926
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,800
There is one thing I am curious about.

927
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,350
When I saw Hunter's body at the university hospital,
he had become very skinny.

928
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:08,900
Skinny?

929
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:13,670
Yes. It looked as if it was a different person than
when he had won the Silver Star.

930
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,400
It will be better if in addition to a judicial autopsy,

931
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,050
a pathological autopsy is also conducted on the body.

932
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:20,720
What?

933
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:23,370
And an X-ray of his head.

934
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,000
All right. I will talk to Inspector Megure.

935
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,420
I will call you later.

936
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,200
Conan-kun, where are you going?

937
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,320
Don't go too far. It's not safe.

938
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:38,800
Yeah, don't worry, I'll just ask Professor Agasa
to return my skateboard.

939
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,020
Hey, Conan-kun...!

940
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,870
Yeah, I heard.

941
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,370
But who would want to kill Hunter?

942
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,650
Yeah, I have no idea.

943
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,420
But at least I don't have to worry about Hunter

944
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,200
coming after me anymore.

945
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,750
Remind me to thank his killer.

946
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,820
Right, but we still better be careful.

947
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,270
Yeah, as always.

948
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,600
Setting aside the shooting in Japan,

949
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,020
in fact that Brian woods has been killed

950
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,320
means we're also still in danger.

951
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,170
You always did worry too much.

952
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,520
Even if I was just following your orders,

953
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:25,250
I still regret what I did on the battlefield back then.

954
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,520
What are you going on about now?!

955
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,820
You lead a life of luxury precisely

956
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,270
because you followed my orders

957
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,070
and took the Silver Star from Hunter. Don't forget it!

958
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,050
Yeah, yeah, sure, I'm sorry.

959
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,420
Nah, forget it. Look,

960
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,370
My family is going back to the US as soon as we get tickets.

961
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,500
The Japanese police are useless. You'd better get out here, too.

962
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,520
Get on home, and quick.

963
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,400
Yes, sir.

964
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,150
I'll see you in stateside.

965
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,670
Mr. Murphy.

966
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,620
I'm at the front reception. We have a special delivery for you.

967
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,420
All right, thank you.

968
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:10,620
(Nikko → Asakusa)

969
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,470
From Yokosuka base?

970
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:14,150
But, who?

971
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,300
I know everything you did in the Middle East.

972
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,730
What?

973
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,020
I don't want to cause a stir.

974
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,750
But we need to look into Hunter's breach of

975
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,320
the rules of engagement.

976
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:31,350
Your ticket is enclosed. Come to Tokyo to face

977
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,350
court martial!

978
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,320
Do not tell Waltz, and destroy this massage immediately.

979
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,500
Ma-Mark Spencer?!

980
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,380
Oh, Christ...

981
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,320
(Nikko → Asakusa)

982
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,570
It is strange after all.

983
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,570
It's the closest-distance among all the cases,
and yet he missed each shot.

984
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:56,500
Yeah.

985
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,120
Did he get nervous when the snipers faced each other?

986
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:05,470
Besides, all the crimes were committed
in the vicinity of Asakusa.

987
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,870
This is also strange.

988
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,900
Indeed. The distance, ballistics, and dice...

989
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,120
There might be a more special meaning to all of them.

990
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,000
Ah!

991
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,050
What's the matter, Ms. Jodie?

992
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,070
We have done a pathological autopsy on Hunter, as you said.

993
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,050
From its results, we found
a large amount of painkillers in his stomach.

994
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,620
And pretty strong ones at that.

995
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,920
Painkillers?

996
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,270
And we found the reason for it from the MRI of his head.

997
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,920
There was a bullet fragment near his brain stem.

998
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,150
And it isn't from this time.

999
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,050
It's the bullet he took in the war zone eight years ago.

1000
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:46,800
Yeah, the removal surgery was a success, but

1001
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,500
the pieces were still there.

1002
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:52,300
It pressed on the optic nerve system and other nerves.

1003
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,250
I'm sure he suffered from raging headaches on a regular basis.

1004
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,650
It is also possible that he couldn't see very well.

1005
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,120
Couldn't see? How could he snipe Woods in Seattle with that?

1006
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,150
If that's also what this culprit did...

1007
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:10,200
Huh? But if that's the case,
then what's the point of confronting Hunter?

1008
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:13,220
No. There's only one thing that makes sense.

1009
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,100
Could it be...

1010
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:21,920
If that is the case, then the two other murders
as well as Hunter's murder in Japan

1011
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,700
could have different motivations.

1012
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:30,200
Yes, I'm Takagi. Oh, Conan-kun.

1013
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,720
Great timing! I wanted you to tell Mouri-san

1014
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,950
that unfortunately, Lee-san has an alibi, and...

1015
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,420
That aside, where are Waltz-san and Murphy-san?

1016
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:40,170
(Detective Takagi    Talking    End Call)
Yeah.

1017
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,420
Waltz-san is still in Kyoto.

1018
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,900
And Murphy-san said I'm safe now.

1019
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,550
So, he didn't even listen to the police

1020
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,250
and took the 9:00 A.M. Limited Express Oruri to Tokyo.

1021
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,800
He said that someone sent him the train ticket to meet.

1022
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,350
What?

1023
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,050
Ticket?

1024
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,400
Leaving at 9:00 means...

1025
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,300
I heard he's arriving in Asakusa at 11:00.

1026
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,650
Not good!

1027
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,450
If it turns out to be a trap set by the culprit...

1028
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,770
The best sniping point is where we can see the station platform.

1029
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,220
After all, the prey will be sitting still

1030
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,770
in the sniper's assigned seat.

1031
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,100
That means, it's near Asakusa station.

1032
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,320
At any rate, let's hurry! We only have three minutes left!

1033
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,000
We have a problem!

1034
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,650
Murphy-san is being targeted!

1035
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:18,570
Eh?

1036
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,070
What do you mean, Conan-kun? Conan-kun?

1037
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,470
The Express... it's already here!

1038
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,650
It will slow down on the bridge.

1039
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:37,550
What's with that car? Stopping like that
in the middle of the bridge... No way!

1040
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,120
Oh, the rifle!

1041
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,060
No way! He's going to shoot from there?

1042
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,390
We don't have any time to go back from there!

1043
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,250
Conan-kun! Could it be that he's going to shoot while driving?

1044
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,170
We need to somehow block it until the train passes.

1045
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,550
Please make it in time!

1046
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,220
Go!!

1047
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,220
Hey, come on, Murphy-san!

1048
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,850
We will soon be arriving at Asakusa station.

1049
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,320
Please, notice the abnormality!

1050
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:09,720
Hey!!

1051
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,450
O-Oh, no!

1052
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,870
Hey!!

1053
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,500
Murphy-san!!

1054
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,550
Conan-kun!! Watch out!!

1055
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,520
What...? Se...ra...?

1056
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,350
Huh? What? What's that?

1057
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:44,820
Die.

1058
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,320
Sera, are you okay? Sera!

1059
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,020
How did it come to this? Sera!

1060
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,070
Damn! Damn! Damn!!

1061
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,120
Damn it!!

1062
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,720
(Touto Asakusa Hospital)

1063
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,220
(EMERGENCY)

1064
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:30,020
Are you okay? No injury?

1065
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:30,970
No...

1066
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,170
There's blood on your clothes.

1067
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,750
This is not my blood.

1068
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,450
Conan-kun.

1069
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,270
Inspector Megure.

1070
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,320
Can I have a word?

1071
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,820
I don't like injections. Can we go home?

1072
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,320
Has my mom come yet?

1073
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:53,770
So it wasn't a random murder.

1074
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,850
The culprit has been targeting Murphy-san since the beginning.

1075
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,400
Yes.

1076
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:59,820
Thank you. We wanted to confirm that.

1077
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,800
Are you saying that the culprit and Hunter
are accomplices after all?

1078
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,750
What? What do you mean?

1079
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:11,370
Just a short time ago, with the help of the FBI,
we got some new facts.

1080
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,100
New facts?

1081
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,300
Due to the after-effects of a bullet he had received
in the head eight years earlier,

1082
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,220
it turns out that Hunter was
no longer physically capable of sniping.

1083
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,550
What? But in Hunter's diary,

1084
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,020
he wrote as if he had confronted the culprit this time.

1085
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:33,270
It was all a lie and Hunter himself probably

1086
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,870
asked the culprit to kill him.

1087
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:36,970
Couldn't be!

1088
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:37,850
Really?

1089
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,470
By shooting himself, the most important suspect,

1090
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,520
he disrupted the investigation and made the next target,

1091
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,250
Murphy-san, more vulnerable and easier to shoot.

1092
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,770
It must have been a plan that was set from the beginning.

1093
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,800
When the culprit shot and killed Hunter,

1094
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,000
even though it was a short distance of 150 meters,

1095
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:01,950
he missed a bullet once.
Even though Hunter himself asked the culprit to do so,

1096
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,320
he must have hesitated...

1097
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:07,300
Only in this sniping,
a lighter bullet from a different gun was used.

1098
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,600
Perhaps he didn't want to
damage Hunter's body as much as possible.

1099
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,100
I think it was a sign of the culprit's feelings.

1100
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,470
I see.

1101
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,350
So even though Hunter attempted the sniping
when he couldn't see properly

1102
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,350
was because he never intended to
shoot the culprit from the beginning.

1103
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,950
It was a message from Hunter who sympathized with the culprit.

1104
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,950
Yes. If we think about it in this way,
we can make sense of the bizarre scene

1105
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,170
where two very skilled snipers miss one shot

1106
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,920
even while they're facing each other.

1107
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,450
But isn't it dangerous to make decisions

1108
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,500
based on circumstantial evidence alone?

1109
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:43,350
No.

1110
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,420
Evidence has also been found to support these inferences.

1111
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,270
Evidence?

1112
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,470
The video taken by Conan-kun and his friends

1113
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,520
at the Bell Tree Tower, the site of the first shooting,

1114
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,150
was analyzed at the FBI headquarters.

1115
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,620
Apart from the culprit,

1116
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,550
there was another person in the video

1117
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,670
who seemed to be an accomplice.

1118
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,300
There really is one.

1119
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,820
There definitely are two people there.

1120
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,750
Hunter is an observer, a so-called spotter.

1121
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,570
SEALs wouldn't normally use spotters.

1122
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,750
It was his first time shooting in Japan.

1123
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,370
Were they being cautious?

1124
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,300
Or...

1125
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:27,850
Realizing that he would never be able to escape

1126
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,320
the raging headache and loss of vision,

1127
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,300
Hunter asked the killer to take revenge, including his own death.

1128
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,420
Wait. There is still the mystery of the dice.

1129
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:42,770
Yes. As in the previous cases,
we have once again found a cartridge and a die

1130
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,450
left at the sniping spot.

1131
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,920
The roll on the die was

1132
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
It was five, not one.

1133
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,070
What?

1134
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,000
It wasn't a countdown then?

1135
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,970
Four, three, two, and not one.

1136
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,900
What does that mean?

1137
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:05,400
We thought that it was a message to Waltz-san

1138
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,800
that he was going to kill him
by counting down the roll of the dice.

1139
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:14,970
It seems that we have been
thinking about things too conveniently.

1140
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,320
There is something else that makes Waltz-san

1141
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,870
more special than the person who drove his family to suicide.

1142
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,350
Anyway, Kevin Yoshino and Scott Green.

1143
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,650
We need to get a hold of both of them as soon as possible.

1144
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,120
There is no doubt that

1145
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,000
- they had something to do with this incident.
- Either way, I'll never forgive him.

1146
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,600
I'll make sure the next sniping is stopped.

1147
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:40,970
Asakusa area, and the dice.

1148
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,470
Do you have any idea of what's going on?

1149
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:48,520
I've told you before. I don't care about Asakusa or dice anymore.

1150
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,570
Put Scott Green on the wanted list as soon as possible.

1151
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,870
It must be him.

1152
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:58,620
But there isn't enough evidence at this stage.

1153
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,720
Seriously, it seems that talking to you Japanese police

1154
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,420
is a waste of my time.

1155
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,450
Waltz-san.

1156
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,120
What?

1157
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:11,350
No matter what happens, please stay away from Tokyo.

1158
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,600
As you can see from the map,

1159
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:18,370
the culprit must be planning to shoot near Asakusa next.

1160
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,900
Who would go to such a sinister place?

1161
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:26,370
Better yet, get me tickets from Kansai Airport
right away for my return home.

1162
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,720
Murphy risked his life for us

1163
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,400
to tell where to find the culprit.

1164
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,070
If we don't return home while we still can,
his death will be in vain.

1165
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:37,950
What a guy.

1166
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,120
Even though it was his friend who was murdered.

1167
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,150
The emergence of a successor to Hunter's will means that

1168
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,900
he must also be knowing about the sins
I committed eight years ago.

1169
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,700
Damn it. I have to do something.

1170
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,900
What a hell?

1171
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:59,750
Hello?

1172
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,250
Y-You, you!

1173
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,670
(406 Masumi Sera)

1174
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,610
Conan-kun,

1175
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:14,360
leave Sera-san to us.

1176
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,220
Yes.

1177
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:23,450
Don't worry. The doctor said it's not life-threatening.

1178
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,670
I'll call you as soon as she wakes up.

1179
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:27,450
Okay?

1180
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,950
Yeah. Then, see you tomorrow.

1181
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,670
But it surely was a fortunate thing.

1182
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,150
If Sera-san wasn't there,
the kid would have been in danger, right?

1183
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,820
She was protecting Conan-kun at her own expense.

1184
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,770
It's truly risking ones life.

1185
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,070
Sera-san also said it back then.

1186
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,450
Don't worry. I'll definitely protect Conan-kun.

1187
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:01,050
And as of now, no bullet has hit Conan-kun's heart.

1188
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:04,120
And of course, your heart either.

1189
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:09,550
Oh, yeah, she did say that
the bullet wouldn't hit Ran's heart either.

1190
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:10,800
I'll never forgive them.

1191
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,470
I'll never forgive the culprit

1192
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:20,070
who put Conan-kun and Sera-san in such danger.

1193
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,000
Ran.

1194
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:28,800
Shu... Shu...

1195
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,250
She said Shu...

1196
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,370
Could she be calling for her Onii-san?

1197
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,920
She said before that she had a brother who had died.

1198
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:39,400
Huh? Was there a bouquet of flowers placed there before?

1199
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:43,450
You're right. Did someone come here?

1200
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,670
Who is it from?

1201
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:51,520
I don't know. But look at this, Sonoko, it's so beautiful.

1202
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,250
Yeah. We should arrange it near the window.

1203
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,470
I'll go borrow a vase.

1204
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,850
What's wrong, Ran?

1205
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,350
No, it's nothing.

1206
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,400
Any whereabouts of Green and Yoshino?

1207
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:32,770
In the Kansai area, there have been many sightings of
a person who looks like Green.

1208
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:37,230
So it seems that a large scale manhunt
is being set up mainly in Osaka.

1209
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,770
Is he targeting Waltz-san,
who was going to fly home from Kansai Airport.

1210
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,070
That would be bad.

1211
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:45,120
The timing is too good.

1212
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,570
If this was just a decoy to make Yoshino's actions easier...

1213
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:51,870
Oh?

1214
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,270
Inspector Megure...

1215
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:56,020
Yes, sir.

1216
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,670
James-san, I need to tell you something.

1217
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,000
What is it?

1218
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,770
Camel told me about Green's sighting.

1219
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:04,900
No, this is something worse than that.

1220
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,570
Waltz-san has disappeared.

1221
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,200
Huh, what do you mean?

1222
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:15,400
We are confused, too. According to the Kyoto Prefecture Police,

1223
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:19,700
after the interrogation, he told his wife that
he would be back tomorrow

1224
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,700
and went away from the back door of the hotel.

1225
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,550
Why? What in the world happened to him?

1226
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,350
- Something must have happened.
- Yes, yes, yes...

1227
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,920
We will let you know
as soon as we have new information on this as well.

1228
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,600
(Detective Mouri's Agency)

1229
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,570
What's the matter, Ms. Jodie?

1230
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,470
I secretly heard about Green's sighting from Detective Takagi.

1231
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:48,120
Yeah. And then?... Huh, Waltz-san?

1232
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,070
Just what in the world is he thinking?

1233
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,020
If we can figure out the meaning of the dice
that the culprit left behind,

1234
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,850
we can guess where Waltz-san is heading, but...

1235
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,370
Do you think he himself would head to the next sniping spot?

1236
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:06,220
I don't know. But there might be a connection between

1237
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,570
the culprit and Waltz-san which we don't know about yet.

1238
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,350
Maybe there is a special connection.

1239
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:16,550
That is possible. I will once again go over the relationship

1240
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:17,900
between the suspect and the victim.

1241
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,620
Well then, I will call you later.

1242
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,320
Sorry for making you wait, Camel. Let's go.

1243
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,100
Yes sir.

1244
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,700
We are going to meet up with the Investigation Division
and re-examine the information.

1245
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,170
Oh, please.

1246
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:42,070
Waltz-san said that he would be back tomorrow and disappeared.

1247
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,250
That means...

1248
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,320
(Sending mail    Sending)

1249
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,470
There must be another shooting incident in the next 24 hours.

1250
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,850
(Email Preview    Subject: No Title    Attachment: Report.xlsm)

1251
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,370
(Body: All materials have been sent.
Please help us when the time comes.)

1252
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,270
I got everything you wanted.

1253
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,550
All untraceable.

1254
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,750
And the scopes?

1255
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,470
All adjusted.

1256
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:30,050
I expected nothing less from you, Carlos.

1257
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,150
You are the best after all.

1258
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,220
You and Hunter, that is.

1259
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:38,200
How about I let you take out the shooter this time?

1260
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:41,120
Then you'll truly be a No.1.

1261
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,750
Weren't you one kill behind Hunter’s records in the war?

1262
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:50,850
Rear Admiral Spencer's orders were just to procure the weapon.

1263
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,720
Never mind.

1264
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:56,450
If I know the target, I don't need your help anyway.

1265
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,320
Thanks for the gun.

1266
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,350
I have a message from Admiral Spencer.

1267
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:05,500
He says there'll be no inquiry into the origin of

1268
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,500
the shooting spree.

1269
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Just eliminated the sniper at all costs.

1270
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,820
Preserve the credibility of the US military.

1271
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,020
Origin of the shooting spree?

1272
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,120
How much does the Admiral know?

1273
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,300
Probably everything.

1274
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,820
What? But how?

1275
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:25,700
Only one person alive knows about that operation,

1276
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,220
and that's me.

1277
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,050
The sniper used the Admiral's name to

1278
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,770
threaten Bill Murphy.

1279
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:36,220
Murphy was scared. The day before he was killed,

1280
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:41,190
he asked for reduction of charges. He emailed the admiral,

1281
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,770
confessed the plan to steal Hunter’s Silver Star,

1282
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,770
your orders afterward, everything.

1283
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,520
What?

1284
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,120
Your crimes from 8 years ago, they're unforgivable.

1285
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,350
But, we have to stop the former American soldier

1286
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:03,100
from committing any more murders on foreign soil.

1287
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,800
Well, if he knows everything anyway,

1288
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,520
please tell the Admiral,

1289
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:13,700
after this case is settled, I'd like a meeting.

1290
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,100
There is one more thing.

1291
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,220
What?

1292
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,770
Did you figure out the meaning behind the dice?

1293
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:24,650
Why bother? They're irrelevant now we know the shooter.

1294
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,530
(This is the fourth! U.S. Army soldier shot again!)
This is

1295
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,100
(Bill Murphy-san, 35, former U.S. Army sergeant)
the news that just came in.

1296
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,070
At around 11:00 A.M. yesterday,
on the Touto Railway Express Ooruri,

1297
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:37,770
a man called Bill Murphy-san was murdered.

1298
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:41,620
Information has come in that
he was related to Timothy Hunter-san,

1299
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,220
the man who was murdered earlier.

1300
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,400
Meanwhile, the woman who was caught up in the shooting

1301
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,450
is also recovering.

1302
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,450
That is all. This was Rinji News.

1303
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:54,400
(Is this still going on?! Sniper spree)
Huh? Then, it wasn't a random murder?

1304
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,000
I told you, didn't I?

1305
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:59,270
That irresponsible statement two days ago

1306
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,970
had the whole of Tokyo in panic.

1307
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,520
Oh, really? Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

1308
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,920
Seriously, he's a real bastard.

1309
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:13,500
Mister, Sera-Neechan seems to be awake.

1310
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,600
We're all going to visit her now.

1311
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,420
Okay. I'm sorry but you guys go ahead.

1312
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,170
I need to think about this some more.

1313
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,600
- Mister... he's been up all night and still...
- If the last one we found is what I think it is...

1314
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:27,550
then I've solved the mystery of the dice.

1315
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,970
Huh? Really?

1316
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:34,850
Of course! One night is enough for this great detective!

1317
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,970
Then, what does it mean?

1318
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:42,800
It's a countdown. The bridge shook.

1319
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:45,620
So the last number on the die

1320
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,170
changed from one to five.

1321
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,500
You know, it all make sense if we think so.

1322
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:55,170
Hm? Huh? Hey, kid! Where did he go?

1323
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:59,420
That's not a countdown. It has some meaning.

1324
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,100
I should get there early and check with Sera
about what happened yesterday.

1325
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:14,070
Here, a clear line of fire.

1326
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:16,520
Yes, I found it.

1327
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:20,870
The perfect position to target Chigusa...

1328
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,650
(Wagashi shop     Chigusa)

1329
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:24,970
The game is mine.

1330
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,100
Y-You!

1331
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:34,570
I've taken care of Murphy. Now it is your turn.

1332
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,670
Why? Why you?

1333
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,220
Is it the money? How much did he pay?

1334
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:41,500
I'll double it.

1335
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,800
You never change, Waltz.

1336
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,800
Look, let's make a deal.

1337
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,420
You, here in foreign country, you could use some cash, right?

1338
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,970
Tomorrow night,

1339
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:57,620
come to Chigusa in Asakusa at 8 P.M. sharp.

1340
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,890
We'll discuss it then.

1341
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,700
Uh, okay.

1342
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,720
Chigusa in Asakusa.

1343
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,960
If you confess everything and admit your guilt,

1344
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:09,200
I'll let you live.

1345
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:12,920
However, if you're even late,

1346
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:16,050
say goodbye to your family.

1347
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,320
Understood?

1348
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:21,020
Hello? Hello? Hey, I--

1349
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:23,070
Urgh! Damn it!

1350
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,920
Helen, Sarah...

1351
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,470
Waltz-san, we are in trouble.

1352
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,820
Scott Green has been spotted on
a surveillance camera at Shin-Osaka Station.

1353
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,220
It's dangerous to go to Kansai Airport now.

1354
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,420
I am sorry, but you will have to give up your return tomorrow.

1355
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,950
Damn. Then it's kill or be killed.

1356
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,120
Here, the perfect position to target Chigusa.

1357
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:55,420
He'll pick this spot. It's textbook. Any sniper's dream.

1358
01:20:55,450 --> 01:21:00,150
But tonight it's not me that's going to be the target. It's him.

1359
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:04,250
Takes a sniper to beat a sniper.

1360
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,050
It all comes down to second-guessing.

1361
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:15,000
Anticipating your opponent's moves, gaining tactical advantage.

1362
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:19,300
Most of all, superior position guarantees victory.

1363
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:22,650
The fact that I have found this position means...

1364
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,300
Victory is mine.

1365
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,570
You challenge me? You lose.

1366
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,400
Say "Hi" to Hunter in hell.

1367
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:37,000
Huh? Conan-kun, did you come alone?

1368
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,970
Yeah, they're all coming by car later.

1369
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,950
I see. We were just about to go downstairs to the shop.
Do you want to go together?

1370
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:47,050
No. I'll wait here.

1371
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,250
Then, let's go, Sonoko.

1372
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,320
Sera-san, we're going out for a bit.

1373
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,570
Yes, thank you.

1374
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,600
We'll be right back.

1375
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,500
Call me if you need anything.

1376
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:57,900
Yes.

1377
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,450
Hi, Conan-kun.

1378
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,950
It looks like the bullet didn't hit you after all.

1379
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,570
Yeah. I haven't thanked you for helping me out, have I?

1380
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:13,320
It's okay. I was just keeping my promise to Ran-kun.

1381
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,570
More importantly, who was the culprit?

1382
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,200
Both suspects are still out of sight.

1383
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,850
I see. When I got shot yesterday, something felt worrisome to me.

1384
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,050
At that time, the culprit was shining a laser sight.

1385
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,250
Don't you think that's strange?

1386
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:33,420
It's not usually used for sniping.

1387
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:37,400
Because the target will know
and it will also expose the sniper's location.

1388
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:43,050
I see. So Hunter didn't kill himself,
but set the confrontation...

1389
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,700
What? What do you mean?

1390
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,200
A suicide would be a better way to end the investigation

1391
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:50,750
and catch Murphy-san and the others off guard.

1392
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,520
Ah!

1393
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,320
But he didn't do that.

1394
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,470
I got it. Was that some kind of a final test

1395
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,050
for the culprit to become a real, cold-hearted sniper?

1396
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,750
Yeah.

1397
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:08,400
The first sniping was at MK-11's maximum range.

1398
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:11,370
Second sniping was at night and a moving target.

1399
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:16,520
And the third sniping was to test the mental toughness
no matter who the opponent is.

1400
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:19,050
Before Hunter died,

1401
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:22,100
he wanted to train the culprit to be the ultimate sniper.

1402
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,550
Which means the culprit is...Ouch!

1403
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:25,720
Are you okay?

1404
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,370
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1405
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,900
Hey, we're here to visit you!

1406
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,250
Hey, Genta-kun, your voice is too loud.

1407
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,500
Hahaha, sorry, sorry.

1408
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,020
Oh, Conan-kun.

1409
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,000
What did you guys bring?

1410
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:39,970
It's really good stuff.

1411
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:43,050
Yes, we hope it makes Onee-san cheer up.

1412
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:43,770
Right?

1413
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,470
Yeah!

1414
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:45,100
Yes!

1415
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,770
Wow, this is amazing!

1416
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,720
Did you guys make this all by yourselves?

1417
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,530
Yeah.

1418
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,880
It's our summer research assignment.

1419
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,050
It's not finished yet.

1420
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:59,200
We wanted to show it to you.

1421
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:00,420
Thank you.

1422
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,950
It's really amazing!

1423
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,950
Yeah, well done.

1424
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:06,320
The shapes of buildings are different, but...

1425
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,670
their sizes and position are correct.

1426
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,270
Ai-chan checked them.

1427
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:15,600
Somebody still hasn't done anything about it though.

1428
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,670
And it's still unfinished?

1429
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,100
It's done well enough though.

1430
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,520
What else are you going to do?

1431
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:24,920
We need to paint them.

1432
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,670
But the last time we went to the Bell Tree,

1433
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:30,020
we could only take pictures of the west side.

1434
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:32,600
We're having trouble because we don't know
the colors of the buildings.

1435
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,970
We wanted to go up there again before we started painting.

1436
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:37,900
Then, shall we go again?

1437
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:41,020
The repairing is finished, but it hasn't reopened yet,

1438
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,320
so the whole place is yours at the moment.

1439
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:43,700
Are you serious?!

1440
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,800
Really?!

1441
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,870
Yay!!

1442
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,650
Ah!

1443
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,070
What's wrong?

1444
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,320
Now we can easily get our summer research assignment.

1445
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:57,350
Haibara, that model scale is correct, isn't it?

1446
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:58,270
Yeah.

1447
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:02,450
All right. Let's hurry up and get the camera from home.

1448
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,450
Yes!

1449
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,720
Hm? What's wrong, Conan-kun?

1450
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,970
What is this?

1451
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,350
I feel like I can see something that
I couldn't see on the map before.

1452
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,800
Do help us in coloring them, okay?

1453
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,170
What's the matter, Conan-kun?

1454
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,470
What is it? Can you see something, Conan?

1455
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:24,620
Uh... Wow! Incredible!

1456
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,620
Hmm? What is?

1457
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:30,900
If I squat down like this,
there's a point at which all the buildings we built

1458
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,020
look of the same height.

1459
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:33,670
Ah!

1460
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,770
Conan-kun!

1461
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:37,400
Genta, I'm sorry, let me see.

1462
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:37,900
What?

1463
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,820
Take a look.

1464
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,370
Yeah, you are right!

1465
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:42,220
That's fantastic!

1466
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,350
So that's it. That message did not express in two dimensions.

1467
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,100
We had to see it in three dimensions.

1468
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,620
It's here.

1469
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,800
(1st Spot)
Seeing from here,

1470
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,120
(2nd Spot)
the heights of the first and second sniping spots are the same.

1471
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,420
Where are the rest of the sniping spots?

1472
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,350
(3rd Spot)

1473
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:01,600
The third spot is on the float ship

1474
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,800
(4th Spot)
and the fourth spot is Komagata Bridge.

1475
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,500
Including these, if I see from the earlier position again...

1476
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:09,150
(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
It's an isosceles trapezoid!

1477
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,720
Wait a minute.

1478
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,520
And if I include the Bell Tree Tower
observation deck in the middle,

1479
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,700
it's a regular pentagon!

1480
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:22,700
It's impossible for such a figure to appear by chance.

1481
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:25,950
There's no doubt about it. This was a deliberate set-up.

1482
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,980
Ran-Neechan, I forgot something, so I'll go home early.

1483
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:34,100
Hey! Ah, Conan-kun, aren't you going to the Bell Tree?

1484
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,320
Be careful, Conan-kun.

1485
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,670
Yeah, not today.

1486
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,970
Waltz-san disappeared, leaving a word that he
would be returning to Kyoto by the end of today.

1487
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:10,470
That means that in order to get on the bullet train,

1488
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,700
they should be settling this close to 8 P.M.

1489
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,070
Damn, I must hurry!

1490
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:19,250
Hi, cool kid! Here's some new info.

1491
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:22,570
The Osaka Prefecture Police have taken Scott Green into custody.

1492
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:22,950
What?

1493
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:26,400
Apparently, he was hiding out in Osaka
and trying not to being caught

1494
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:30,270
until this time today at the behest of Hunter.

1495
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,120
I thought so.

1496
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:34,700
Yeah. He was kind of aware of that

1497
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,770
Hunter came to Japan for his revenge.

1498
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,070
But when he saw Hunter's face as if he was prepared to die,

1499
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:42,520
Green decided to let him do whatever he wanted
in the last part of his life.

1500
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,650
If he's the decoy, that means the culprit is...

1501
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,200
Yes.

1502
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:50,300
Oh, also new information has come in right now
from the FBI headquarters.

1503
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:54,970
There were witness accounts that said
that after Hunter lost his family

1504
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,750
he was living with an oriental man.

1505
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,070
If that was Kevin Yoshino...

1506
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,500
He's capable of carrying out this sniper spree.

1507
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,970
Yeah. Thank you, Ms. Jodie.

1508
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,350
By the way, Conan-kun, where are you now?

1509
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,350
I'm heading to the place that could be the next sniping spot.

1510
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:10,800
What?

1511
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,720
Have you solved the mystery of the dice?

1512
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:16,020
No, I'm not sure. I'm going to find out.

1513
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,200
I don't have time.

1514
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,170
Is there anything I can do to help?

1515
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:21,050
If my deduction is correct,

1516
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,750
it would have some connection with
the Bell Tree Tower observation deck.

1517
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:28,250
Bell Tree. Okay, we will go there.

1518
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:28,920
Yes.

1519
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,770
Be very careful.

1520
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,450
Let's go.

1521
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:33,050
Yes.

1522
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,220
It should be somewhere around here according to the model.

1523
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:50,150
If it's from that building, it would be possible to see.

1524
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:04,920
Where's the Bell Tree?

1525
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,460
The building from which Fujinami-san was shot

1526
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,040
and the building from which Yasuhara-san was shot...

1527
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:22,120
As I though, they're the same as the model,
almost at the same level.

1528
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,850
Which means that if I connect the third and fourth sniping spots,

1529
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,580
It's an isosceles trapezoid.

1530
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,820
And if I include the first observation deck
of the Bell Tree Tower,

1531
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,800
it's undoubtedly a pentagon.

1532
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:41,250
By applying the roll of each die to each sniping point,

1533
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,450
and applying the remainder die numbers to the Bell Tree Tower...

1534
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,750
That's it! So that's what it was!

1535
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:51,820
The culprit wanted to show his final target,

1536
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,970
Waltz-san, the Star shape.

1537
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,610
The star symbolizes the Silver Star that was stolen from him.

1538
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,900
Hunter and the culprit wanted to show this star-shape,

1539
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,670
the Silver Star to Waltz-san from the beginning.

1540
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:11,120
Which means that the first die must been placed on
the first observation deck of the Bell Tree Tower.

1541
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:13,170
And the roll of the die is one.

1542
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:15,270
The place where the culprit is going to snipe is

1543
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,800
also the first observation deck.

1544
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:22,750
There it is! The culprit is Kevin Yoshino, after all!

1545
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:26,270
Damn it! Where's he aiming?

1546
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,750
To get a more accurate representation of the star shape,

1547
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,100
he'd have to go to a slightly higher place than here.

1548
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:34,750
That's where Waltz-san is supposed to show up.

1549
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:35,780
Is it over there?

1550
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:42,870
Say "Hi" to Hunter in hell.

1551
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:47,350
Come on, Waltz. Come to the window.

1552
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,000
The moment you decipher our message

1553
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,750
will be your last.

1554
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,920
I'm definitely going to stop him this time!

1555
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:00,550
Today I'll finally be rid of Hunter's ghost.

1556
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:03,000
Settle the score, once and for all.

1557
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:04,570
W-W-What the?

1558
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,150
That wasn't here before.

1559
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:12,700
Did they leave this for me to see?

1560
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,820
Go!!

1561
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,000
Die.

1562
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,900
What? That flash...

1563
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,270
It came from that building.

1564
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:48,020
What? That kid, interfering again!

1565
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,700
Oh, shit!

1566
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,720
You...

1567
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,600
You'll pay for that.

1568
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:57,120
You brat!

1569
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,250
Damn it, there's nowhere to run on the roof.

1570
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,370
M-My leg...

1571
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,920
This is bad...

1572
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,370
You twerp!

1573
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:25,450
You ruined everything, everything!

1574
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,820
Did he get shot?

1575
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:47,120
But where is the best place around here to aim that high?

1576
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,600
From there?

1577
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,420
Another sniper?

1578
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,920
But how?

1579
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:05,220
The only place with a shot is Asakusa Sky Court.

1580
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:08,250
But, that building is...

1581
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:11,370
If you snipe from this Bell Tree
for the last sniping, you'll be safe.

1582
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,470
But what if Waltz finds out about the Silver Star message

1583
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,870
and targets me from the Asakusa Sky Court?

1584
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:18,020
Don't worry.

1585
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:22,620
There is no one left who can snipe accurately at this distance

1586
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:23,820
while looking up.

1587
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,770
Yeah, I know. Tim's eyes are already...

1588
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,920
That's not it. If it's this long a range, even I can't do it.

1589
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:34,770
Was there a better sniper than you, Tim?

1590
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:39,820
There was one in FBI.
He was a really skilled person called Silver Bullet.

1591
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:42,650
But there's no need for you to worry.

1592
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:46,620
He has disappeared and some even say he's already dead.

1593
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,470
N-No way... Is he...

1594
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,420
Does this mean that Silver Bullet is still alive?

1595
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:59,820
What? Subaru-san? Why is he there?

1596
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:05,670
I see. So Subaru-san has also solved
the mystery of the dice, huh.

1597
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:11,120
Conan-kun, we are at the the Bell Tree Tower.
We are currently negotiating to go up there.

1598
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,670
Good. Please go up to the observation deck roof fast.

1599
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,220
Yoshino's there.

1600
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,350
I knew it was him.

1601
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,420
Yeah. So, can you go up?

1602
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,150
No.

1603
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,700
The owner has a private party today and won't let us in.

1604
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:31,050
Oh, right. Ms. Jodie, that private party
is held by Ran and others.

1605
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:31,600
What?

1606
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,500
Tell them what happened,
go up to the observation deck, and get Yoshino!

1607
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,100
All right. I will immediately ask
Inspector Megure to arrange something.

1608
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,820
Wow, so beautiful!

1609
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:46,070
See? The Bell Tree Tower has a great night view, too!

1610
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,600
It's so high!

1611
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,420
It's definitely more beautiful at night!

1612
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:51,150
I agree with you.

1613
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,250
Then let's go to the other side,
of which we haven't taken any pictures yet.

1614
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,020
Okay!

1615
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:56,220
Let's go!

1616
01:34:58,270 --> 01:34:59,000
Ah.

1617
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,700
(Shinichi Kudo, Incoming Call)
Shinichi?

1618
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,750
Oh, I couldn't get him down...

1619
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:13,050
I can't give up after coming this far.

1620
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,620
I made a promise to Hunter-san.

1621
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:22,520
Yeah. It's getting better. Now you just need to
get some experience in a real battle.

1622
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,020
Okay, let's start with Brian Woods.

1623
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:27,320
And be sure to get Waltz.

1624
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,100
Are you really sure about this?

1625
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:29,770
What?

1626
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:34,320
After all this time, I do regret getting you into this mess.

1627
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,050
What are you talking about, Tim?

1628
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,820
You've saved my life many times on the battlefield.

1629
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:43,050
I'm finally getting the chance to return the favor.

1630
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:44,250
But...

1631
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:48,320
And you should never forgive Waltz and the others.

1632
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,470
Just because your achievements out-shined his,

1633
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,800
he accused you of a crime you didn't commit
and stole the Silver Star from you.

1634
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,520
And as soon as we asked for a reinvestigation,

1635
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:02,800
Waltz ordered Murphy to kill you.

1636
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,600
Yeah, you're right.

1637
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:17,770
If you hadn't been suspicious
and checked the bullet removed from my head

1638
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:19,520
against Murphy's gun,

1639
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:22,020
the truth would have remained unknown.

1640
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:26,250
But, that evidence was taken away
before we knew it. And eventually...

1641
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,950
Kevin, I will ask you again,
please take revenge of my wife and sister,

1642
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:34,020
and send Waltz and the others

1643
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:35,400
to hell for ruining my life.

1644
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:38,920
Yeah. I promise, I will.

1645
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,620
I'll definitely make sure they go to hell.

1646
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,150
I'm counting on you!

1647
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah, I can't give up yet.

1648
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,250
If I escape as planned, I should be able to make it through.

1649
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,000
And Waltz...

1650
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,620
That's right. That's why all of you
get down from there right now!

1651
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,120
What? But who did it?

1652
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:02,350
Don't worry about that! The FBI's is on its way there!

1653
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:03,950
I understand.

1654
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,320
The fire escape is this way.

1655
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:12,120
Yes.

1656
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:16,300
Onee-chan!!

1657
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,550
What's with you?!

1658
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,000
Give Ayumi-chan back!!

1659
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:21,570
What are you guys doing?! Hide!

1660
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,420
But!

1661
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,400
Ayumi is...!

1662
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,020
Kids should stay out of this!

1663
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,170
Oh, no! Sonoko!

1664
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:32,650
Don't cause a ruckus, you brats! Stay there like good kids!

1665
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,050
I'm borrowing this girl!

1666
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:37,750
Don't come here!

1667
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:41,120
This is the FBI! Drop your gun!

1668
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:45,100
Shut up! If you get any closer, this girl's dead!

1669
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:50,220
Muzzle flash?,Damn it. He hasn't give up yet?

1670
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:54,350
Don't let him go to the back. Bring him over here.

1671
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,370
Don't move. You want to get your kid killed?

1672
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,550
All right, we'll help Ayumi.

1673
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,220
Yes.

1674
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:07,520
Don't be silly!

1675
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:09,620
He's got guns.

1676
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,870
We have to help her somehow.

1677
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:14,220
Sonoko! Come on, Sonoko.

1678
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:19,050
Shinichi, what should I do? Help me.

1679
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:21,950
Shit! There's nothing I can do from here!

1680
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:25,950
Enough! If you don't do as I say, I'll kill this girl!

1681
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:30,000
To safely rescue the hostages, I will have to kill him instantly.

1682
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,900
But if I have to do that...

1683
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:35,170
If you want to kill a man instantly with a single bullet

1684
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,150
without causing any seizure,

1685
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,070
there's only one place to aim.

1686
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:40,950
Brain stem.

1687
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,450
That's correct.

1688
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:44,300
I guess I just have to do it!

1689
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:47,320
Shit, I can't go over there.

1690
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:49,800
Jodie-san!

1691
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:53,870
Yoshino!

1692
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:56,650
I got him!

1693
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,220
Oh, no! What's happened?

1694
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:16,420
Oh no, I can't see anything!

1695
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,420
Is the power out?

1696
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,670
Be quiet you two! Step back!

1697
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:24,970
Oh no, he destroyed the lights!

1698
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,820
This way Subaru-san can't aim for him!

1699
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:32,820
I see. So he was planning to
take advantage of the darkness and escape.

1700
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,650
What should I do?

1701
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:38,300
This is bad! At this rate Ayumi will be taken away!

1702
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,070
(Night Vision Mode)

1703
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,520
No way! Is he wearing night vision goggles?

1704
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:49,050
Run, Ms. Jodie!

1705
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:55,900
Yoshino, stop your useless resistance!

1706
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,320
Camel!

1707
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,150
Answer me, Camel!!

1708
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,450
This is bad! At this rate, they'll all get killed!

1709
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:09,970
If I can somehow illuminate it,

1710
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:14,770
Subaru-san could snipe him, but with my pivoting leg like this...

1711
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:18,050
How do I point out Yoshino?

1712
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:23,720
Oh, wait. I'm pretty sure those night vision goggles
are the older model. If that's the case,

1713
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:27,020
then all that's left is for me to light up the Bell Tree Tower.

1714
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,770
Is that it? If I use this height, can I make it?

1715
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:36,520
No, I've got to do it!

1716
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,220
Edogawa-kun?

1717
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,400
Hello?

1718
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:44,620
Use Lights. Illuminate him using lights.

1719
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,220
What?

1720
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:48,350
He's wearing night vision goggles. He'll get blinded.

1721
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:50,870
But where is he? Hah!

1722
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:52,570
Yeah, use that!

1723
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:53,320
Got it.

1724
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:55,300
He'll go passing near you soon.

1725
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,520
Listen, don't move for 30 seconds
without looking suspicious. I'm hanging up.

1726
01:41:00,450 --> 01:41:03,820
Okay, for 30 seconds from now, absolutely don't move.

1727
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:05,050
Yes.

1728
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:17,500
Another chance will definitely come.
That little boy can make it happen.

1729
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,920
Please, just make it work!

1730
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,450
Are you ready?

1731
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:23,850
Yes.

1732
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:25,970
Go.

1733
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:38,500
Where is it? Where is it coming from?

1734
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,120
Wait.

1735
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:46,220
There it is.

1736
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:47,950
All right, go!

1737
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,700
Now!

1738
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:52,600
What?

1739
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,500
Yoshida-san, come here!

1740
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,650
Ai-chan!!

1741
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,250
Brats!!

1742
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:09,750
Everyone, run!!

1743
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:11,620
Ran-san!

1744
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:13,470
No, Ran!!

1745
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:24,850
Ran, damn it!!

1746
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:26,870
I don't have time to think about it!

1747
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,470
What should I do, Shinichi?

1748
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:43,820
Huh, you cheeky bastard! I'm switching hostages.

1749
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,770
It's all or nothing! I'll give it a shot!

1750
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:52,220
Hang on. Ran!!

1751
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,400
Go!!

1752
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:35,800
Here it comes!

1753
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,870
Ahh!!

1754
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,120
What?

1755
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,020
What is this?

1756
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,800
Aaargh!

1757
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:11,820
Ran!

1758
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,970
Avenge Sonoko!

1759
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,450
Avenge Ayumi-chan

1760
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:32,550
and Sera-san!

1761
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,500
Yes, sir. We've secured Yoshino.

1762
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:48,550
We did it!

1763
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:50,420
That's great, Ran-san!

1764
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:52,810
Sonoko!

1765
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,560
You're so cool, Ran!

1766
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:57,850
Hey, are you okay, Sonoko?

1767
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:00,700
I don't know what happened, but I'm fine. I'm fine.

1768
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:04,550
Oh, by the way, why are the lights out? Is it closed?

1769
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:07,150
Geez, Sonoko...

1770
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:14,900
Oh. Ran, you're something.

1771
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:19,270
Target is silent. It's all clear.

1772
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:23,300
Oh, yeah. I just received a call from Jodie-kun.

1773
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:27,000
Thank you for the hard work. I will call you later.

1774
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:31,820
Roger that.

1775
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:40,800
I gently looked for you in the light I drew.

1776
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:46,920
I'll keep on shining with my invisible love light

1777
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:02,620
Hey, I held my breath in a dream I had today.

1778
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,000
You're like a stranger next door.

1779
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:09,270
In the darkness of uncontrollable anxiety

1780
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:12,800
Don't shut out the light that's shining

1781
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:18,470
Always, always alone.

1782
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:24,470
I slept and slept to get through the night.

1783
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:31,650
I gently looked for you in the light I drew.

1784
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:37,970
I'm sure it's an invisible love light,
and it'll always be there for you.

1785
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:46,550
Just now, far, far away... Even though our hearts are far apart

1786
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:53,450
Forever and ever... I'll never let you go.

1787
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:04,070
Hey, I've started running, my thoughts are welling up.

1788
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:07,220
I'll grab that hand, like a prayer.

1789
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,570
I won't keep my steps in the darkness of time.

1790
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:13,870
I don't want you to miss out on anything.

1791
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:19,750
I want to see you, I want to see you, if it's just the two of us

1792
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:26,270
It goes around and around. The night overflows.

1793
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:31,470
With a swaying light

1794
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,050
I've been looking for you.

1795
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:46,270
I finally found you in the light I drew.

1796
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:52,420
I'm sure I'll keep shining my light on you
with my invisible love light.

1797
01:47:53,400 --> 01:48:02,620
I've been hiding my heart far, far away... until now.

1798
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:09,370
Forever and ever... I'll never let you go.

1799
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:20,920
All the time.

1800
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:23,220
I won't let you go.

1801
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:28,400
You'll finally be discharged from the hospital tomorrow.

1802
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:31,350
Yeah. Thank you for taking care of me till now.

1803
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:33,350
It's okay, don't worry about it.

1804
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:37,770
Oh, well, I saw Waltz-san on TV.

1805
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:40,600
In the wake of a sniper spree,

1806
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:44,450
it seems that a series of crimes that
he committed in the past has come to light.

1807
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:47,650
He'll probably spend the rest of his life in prison.

1808
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,470
It's like the culprits this time were also the victims

1809
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,070
of the crime and were trying to get revenge.

1810
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:56,250
But Ran, you sure tackled that man
with the machine gun pretty nicely!

1811
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,270
I was desperate at the time.

1812
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:03,700
I'm really glad it was only a scratch on your cheek.

1813
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:07,450
I'd be scared if it hit you in the heart.

1814
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:10,250
See? I'm pretty lucky.

1815
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:17,180
It's okay. That person is the only one
who can snipe Ran-kun's heart.

1816
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:17,950
Eh?

1817
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:24,170
Oh, that's right! Her beloved Shinichi-kun!

1818
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,600
Geez, Sonoko...

1819
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,900
For now that is.

1820
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,500
Are you all right, Conan-kun?

1821
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,770
It's no use even if you try to get our attention.

1822
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:37,870
To make up for all the slacking off you did,
we'll have you work hard.

1823
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:39,870
So then, let's go to the pool!

1824
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:40,370
Yeah.

1825
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:42,300
I'll miss you, Haibara-san.

1826
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:44,450
Please keep an eye on Conan-kun.

1827
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:45,300
Yes, yes.

1828
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:46,600
Your hands are idle.

1829
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:51,600
Huh? Seriously, these guys...
are they planning on making me do all the remaining work?
