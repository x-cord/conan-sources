1
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,870
Isn't it happening yet?

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,470
It's already started.

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,370
Come on.

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,770
Nothing has changed from a while ago.

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,670
Well, it takes time to change.

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,770
You've got to be patient.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,470
Be patient?

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,070
This lake is called the tidal lake

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,370
and is made by drawing in ocean water.

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,870
In other words, the scenery changes with the rise and fall of the tide.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,070
It's just like the Hamarikyu Gardens.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,070
Yes.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,570
So, what's the difference in tidal level?

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,270
Wait.

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,070
It says approximately 2 meters.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,670
Which means you'll be submerged, kid.

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,070
So will you, Pops.

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,170
Hey, the submerged bridge will be appearing soon.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,570
There it is, there it is.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,170
All right. Let's move on.

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,870
Let's go eat all the fresh seafood!

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,370
What is it, Conan?

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,970
Somebody's lying on the bridge.

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,370
-What? -What?

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,670
A canvas stained black with crime.

26
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,170
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color.

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,870
A park lake that joins the sea.

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,270
The case occurs at ebb tide.

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,270
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:41,827
"The Turn Over Case of Shioiri Park"

33
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:46,227
Did you find out his identity?

34
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,927
He's the well known

35
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,327
Mr. Ryuji Kimijima, age 48.

36
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,927
"Officer Motoi (45)" -Everybody knows him around here.

37
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:56,727
He's the 2nd generation president of a food manufacturing company.

38
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:57,927
I see.

39
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,527
Did he drown?

40
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,927
No. Please look closely around his neck.

41
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,627
There are traces of strangulation around his neck.

42
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:09,227
What? Which means he was strangled to death?

43
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:10,927
Is it murder?

44
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:14,027
It could be murder, or it could be an accident.

45
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,627
Accident?

46
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,927
Maybe something got caught around his neck.

47
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:22,527
Hey, something's wrong with his shoes.

48
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:23,527
What?

49
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:28,027
He's wearing his shoes on the wrong feet.

50
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,427
Why would he do that?

51
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,327
Officer Motoi.

52
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:39,327
"Officer Keitoku (28)" -I brought the manager of the park, Mr. Tanba.

53
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:41,327
Hello.

54
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:44,527
I have something I'd like to ask you.

55
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:48,427
He avoided the subject because he couldn't come up with anything.

56
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:52,727
Were you at the park at ebb tide in the morning?

57
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,427
"Eizaburo Tanba (65)" -I was.

58
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,227
Back then, was the corpse there?

59
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:58,227
Of course not.

60
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:00,227
Which means

61
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,527
the corpse came from the ocean through the floodgate

62
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:05,027
and probably drifted over here.

63
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:17,527
She is Aoi, the victim's wife.

64
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,627
She's very beautiful.

65
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,127
Yes, I guess.

66
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:24,427
I heard she used to be a pin-up girl and an actress as well.

67
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:25,827
I see.

68
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,627
Dear!

69
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,127
Why did you have to die

70
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:36,027
"Aoi Kimishima (28)" -and leave me behind?

71
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:37,527
Dear.

72
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:41,227
Talk about dorky acting.

73
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:43,327
Who is he?

74
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:45,227
He's the older brother of the victim

75
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:48,327
and is an executive at the same company, Yuta.

76
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,627
"Yuta Kimishima (50), older brother of the victim"

77
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:04,527
By the way,

78
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:08,127
did you notice any changes in your husband lately?

79
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,227
No. Nothing in particular.

80
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:13,827
How about you, Yuta?

81
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,327
Beats me. I have no idea.

82
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:19,127
I only saw my kid brother sometimes, you see.

83
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:22,127
What? Despite working at the same company?

84
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:27,727
I may be an executive, but it's just a title.

85
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,427
By the way, what's the cause of his death?

86
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:32,027
We're waiting for forensics to give us the results.

87
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:34,627
You can't even tell if it was an accident or suicide?

88
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,327
No, not yet.

89
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:40,727
I think we'll be investigating this case from both sides.

90
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,327
A case?

91
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:45,327
Do you mean murder?

92
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:49,127
Yes. We can't rule out that possibility.

93
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:52,027
I'd like to ask you, just in case.

94
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:55,227
When Ryuji died last night around 10 p.m,

95
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:58,327
where were you two?

96
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:01,027
I... I was with a friend.

97
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:03,027
What's your friend's name?

98
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,627
Well...

99
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:07,627
His name is Kazuma Nishikikoji.

100
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,427
Is he an actor friend?

101
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:11,727
I guess.

102
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,727
And what about you?

103
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:16,527
I was out night fishing.

104
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:19,827
Can someone testify for you?

105
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:23,827
No. I was out at the shore alone on my cruiser.

106
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:35,127
Why are you sighing like that?

107
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:39,127
What I really want to eat is fresh seafood.

108
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,727
He's still thinking about it.

109
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,827
Mr. Mouri.

110
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,227
Aoi says she wants to talk to you.

111
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,527
What did you want to talk to me about?

112
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,727
I want to talk about my brother-in-law.

113
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,127
Your brother-in-law?

114
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,727
Well...

115
00:07:54,727 --> 00:08:00,627
It seems that Yuta doesn't think well of Ryuji.

116
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,827
Is there a reason for it?

117
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:07,627
He thought that he was going to be the successor,

118
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:12,127
but his father decided to make Ryuji as the successor.

119
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,527
I see.

120
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,827
Is there anything else?

121
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,727
That cruiser that Yuta mentioned a while ago,

122
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:20,627
Ryuji was the one who paid for it.

123
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:21,727
-What? -What?

124
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:24,527
I'm sure he got a lot of executive remuneration,

125
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,827
stock dividends and others.

126
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:30,827
Yet he came to Ryuji, asking for money saying he didn't have enough.

127
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,527
A cruiser...

128
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,327
Well, maybe...

129
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,827
I'd like to do a little experiment.

130
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:39,027
Will you help me?

131
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:40,327
-Yes, sir. -Okay.

132
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:41,527
Excuse me.

133
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:43,227
Wait, Dad.

134
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,527
Gosh.

135
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,227
Hey!

136
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,927
Paper bags must go in here!

137
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,827
Cans in there, and PET bottle over there!

138
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,227
Yes, sir. Understood...

139
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,627
Value and treasure nature.

140
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,327
"Treat Nature and the Environment With Care" -Understand?

141
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,727
We're sorry...

142
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,027
I guess with this old man,

143
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,227
even the police can't talk back.

144
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:13,427
Young people these days.

145
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,427
Hey, Mr. Tanba!

146
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,627
You're late!

147
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:22,027
"Keisuke Sugao (26)" -I'm sorry.

148
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,127
It took a while to finish the job before this.

149
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,427
Never mind excuses.

150
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:30,127
In any case, you've caused me a lot of trouble.

151
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,227
This time something even worse than garbage washed up.

152
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:35,027
Like what?

153
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:36,727
A human body.

154
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:39,327
What? A human body?

155
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,527
No way.

156
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:43,027
I see. That's why the police was here.

157
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:44,827
That's right.

158
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:47,327
Now hurry up and fix it.

159
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,427
Is this where you operate the floodgate from?

160
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,127
That's right, sonny.

161
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:58,327
The floodgate is opened and closed using this control panel.

162
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,627
This is not good.

163
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,827
It won't close.

164
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:11,127
Did somebody broke it?

165
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:15,227
I don't think so.

166
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:27,427
Who threw away their garbage here?

167
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,927
There's some over here. Who did this?

168
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:33,927
That old man seems to complain a lot, doesn't he?

169
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:35,327
You mean Mr. Tanba?

170
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,627
He sure does, but he's not a bad person.

171
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:41,227
Maybe he's just too serious.

172
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:45,227
He's been working at this park since I was a child.

173
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,527
He's like the master of the place.

174
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:48,927
Really?

175
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,127
Row!

176
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,327
Yes, sir!

177
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:01,527
Conan, where were you?

178
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,827
I got lost.

179
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,227
By the way, how's the experiment going?

180
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,527
-Row! -Yes, sir!

181
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,427
Faster!

182
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:22,427
How is it, Mr. Mouri?

183
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:25,327
Well, let's finish the experiment here,

184
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:27,927
and hear what Yuta has to say.

185
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,327
What?

186
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:40,627
It's true that I didn't like my little brother.

187
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:41,927
I see.

188
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:45,427
But I didn't have any reason to kill him.

189
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,027
Why not?

190
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,327
Think about it.

191
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:50,627
Thanks to him,

192
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,727
I get to play around and get paid at the same time.

193
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,227
But with him gone,

194
00:11:57,227 --> 00:12:00,227
I'll have to work for myself.

195
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:03,527
But now that Ryuji is dead,

196
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,627
aren't you going to be the next president?

197
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:08,927
I guess so.

198
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,227
But I think I'll only take on the title

199
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:13,727
and let someone else handle the job.

200
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,727
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

201
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:19,227
Ryuji couldn't swim at all.

202
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,627
He didn't fish either.

203
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,427
And yet, I wonder why he died at sea?

204
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:31,227
Maybe somebody wanted to frame me

205
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:34,427
so they killed him at sea?

206
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:36,527
What do you mean?

207
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,127
You know what I mean, right?

208
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:40,727
It's that woman.

209
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,027
Be it her alibi or whatever,

210
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:47,427
I don't think you should believe what she says.

211
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,427
I mean, she was a former actress after all.

212
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,527
My little brother was probably deceived by her, too.

213
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,227
Excuse me then.

214
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,227
I bet Mr. Tanba is going to get really angry.

215
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:11,227
What?

216
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,227
Styrofoam?

217
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:25,827
That is...

218
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,827
This is the fiber of a rope.

219
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,027
Which means...

220
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,894
What? A rope?

221
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:54,994
Yes. Did you see one this morning when you patrolled the area?

222
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:57,294
No, I didn't.

223
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,694
Really?

224
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:00,294
Yes.

225
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:02,894
What time do you make your rounds in the morning?

226
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,994
A little after 5:00 a.m.

227
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,094
That's early.

228
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,294
Old people usually get up early.

229
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,194
Mr. Tanba.

230
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,394
The battery was dead.

231
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:15,994
The battery?

232
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:18,794
It hadn't been change for a while, right?

233
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:21,294
I changed it to a new one.

234
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,794
I see.

235
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,694
By the way, Mr. Tanba.

236
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,694
-I heard today's going to be your last day. -What?

237
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:31,194
Thanks for all your hard days of work till now.

238
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:32,594
No.

239
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,494
I'm the one who should thank you for everything.

240
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,194
I see.

241
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:40,494
So this old man is retiring today.

242
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:54,094
It's not here after all.

243
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,494
Well, it's just as I expected.

244
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:02,294
"Treat Nature and the Environment With Care"

245
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:06,294
I see. I know what's happening.

246
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:17,794
Well, in other words...

247
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:21,594
It's the water ski principle.

248
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,694
Water ski?

249
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:28,594
Wait, Mr. Mouri. What are you talking about?

250
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,794
While he was being pulled along by the motor boat,

251
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:36,494
the rope he was holding got caught around Ryuji's neck

252
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:39,694
and dragging him along at tremendous speed,

253
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,494
leading to his death.

254
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:43,294
That is what happened.

255
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:47,594
So, is it homicide or an accident?

256
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,094
Which one is it?

257
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:52,994
Is there anyone who would go water skiing in the middle of the night?

258
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,594
No. Which means...

259
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,594
Right! This is unmistakably a mur...

260
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:07,094
-Mr. Mouri? -What's the matter?

261
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:10,594
It would probably look like nothing but a murder case.

262
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,794
In reality, water skiing is not possible.

263
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:16,894
What?

264
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,594
Then...

265
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,594
You mean it was an accident?

266
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:27,294
Firstly, I'm not sure whether Ryuji really died at sea.

267
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:28,294
-What? -What?

268
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:32,694
If he didn't die at sea, where did he die?

269
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:35,694
He died in this park.

270
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,894
Near Azumaya.

271
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:41,294
That means, the body didn't drift over from the sea,

272
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:44,794
but was in this park from the beginning all along?

273
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,894
No, it drifted here from the sea.

274
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,094
What do you mean?

275
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,094
He died at the park

276
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,594
and yet drifted over here from the sea.

277
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:57,594
The body couldn't possibly move on its own.

278
00:16:57,594 --> 00:17:01,194
A certain person moved the corpse.

279
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:05,294
He placed the body on styrofoam and put it in the lake.

280
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:09,794
Usually, the lake and sea are separated by the floodgate,

281
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,594
so the perp first opened that.

282
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:17,294
Then, Ryuji's body rode the ebb tide

283
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:19,594
and went through the floodgate into the sea.

284
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:22,694
All that was left to do was to close the floodgate.

285
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:24,994
However, due to a malfunction with the control panel,

286
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:27,494
the floodgate didn't close.

287
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,594
The cause of this was the battery.

288
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,894
Because of this, during the next high tide,

289
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:35,494
the corpse came back through the open floodgate,

290
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:38,694
fell off for some reason

291
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:42,694
and Ryuji's corpse sunk onto the submerged bridge.

292
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:47,794
But why do something so bothersome like that?

293
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:53,094
That means the perp didn't want the corpse to be found in the park?

294
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:55,194
Yes, that's right.

295
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:56,994
What kind of reason is it?

296
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,494
Never mind that, who is the perp?

297
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:02,494
Office Keitoku, show them the footage.

298
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:04,594
Yes, sir!

299
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:10,894
It was just by coincidence, but Aoi uploaded a picture on her SNS.

300
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:14,694
It was posted at almost the same time as his ETD.

301
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,794
Therefore, Aoi's alibi has been established.

302
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:22,194
Next, Yuta.

303
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,594
You know that it is forbidden

304
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:29,394
to chum the waters here for recreational purposes, don't you?

305
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:31,294
Of course.

306
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,194
If the patrols caught you doing it,

307
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,894
that would mean serious trouble.

308
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,394
I'll bet you wouldn't try to do anything

309
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:40,194
in an area that's so closely watched.

310
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:42,094
So you're innocent, too.

311
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:45,894
Wait a minute, Mr. Mouri.

312
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:47,594
It's not his wife.

313
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,394
It's not his older brother.

314
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,994
Then who did it?

315
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:54,394
There's another person, isn't there?

316
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:59,894
Mr. Eizaburo Tanba.

317
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:02,194
What... what do you think you're saying?

318
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:03,394
How rude!

319
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:08,694
Wait. He's the manager of this park, isn't he?

320
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:12,694
What's his motive? What's his motive for killing Ryuji?

321
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,894
He has no motive.

322
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:18,594
Ryuji was not killed.

323
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:20,594
He committed suicide.

324
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,794
Suicide?

325
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,594
That's ridiculous.

326
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:27,294
If it's suicide, all he had to do was report it to the police, right?

327
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:29,894
Why would he go through all that trouble?

328
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:33,894
Actually, Mr. Tanba is retiring today.

329
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:39,294
Mr. Tanba, who had worked as the manager of this park for years,

330
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:44,494
enthusiastically wanted to conclude his career successfully.

331
00:19:55,494 --> 00:20:00,594
However, he found the corpse of Ryuji who committed suicide.

332
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:04,594
If things are left as it is, his important day would go to waste.

333
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,194
After thinking,

334
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:08,294
"Suicide letter" -Mr. Tanba decides to carry the corpse

335
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,894
out of the park.

336
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,294
But the corpse was heavy

337
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:18,094
and it would've taken too long for Mr. Tanba to move it on his own.

338
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:22,594
Therefore, he decided to take advantage of the low tide

339
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:25,594
and float the corpse out to the sea.

340
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:29,994
Gosh. What an awful world we live in.

341
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,394
People don't respect the elderly anymore,

342
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,494
rather they make criminals out of them.

343
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:37,594
If you think that hiding corpses is not a crime,

344
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:40,094
you're wrong.

345
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:42,194
Suit yourself.

346
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:46,194
Although you probably can't accuse me without proof.

347
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:50,394
By proof, do you mean the rope?

348
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:53,994
The rope which matches the strangulation marks left on Ryuji's neck?

349
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:56,394
What is it?

350
00:20:56,394 --> 00:21:00,494
That rope may have turned to ashes by now.

351
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:03,994
No, it hasn't.

352
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,594
Why not?

353
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:09,894
The rope was made of heat-resistant polypropylene.

354
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,594
So it is not burnable.

355
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:14,594
If you consider the environment,

356
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:17,494
Mr. Tanba would never burn this in the incinerator.

357
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:19,694
I'm sure he would put it together

358
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:22,494
with the rest of the inflammable garbage.

359
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:31,794
I found it, Mr. Mouri!

360
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:35,794
Mr. Tanba. Do you still insist on playing dumb?

361
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:41,694
I don't know what has gotten into me.

362
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:45,294
Today was your special day.

363
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:49,194
It was all the more reason to report it to the police.

364
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:51,594
You're right.

365
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:56,594
That's right. I found a suicide letter near the corpse.

366
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,694
"Suicide letter"

367
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:02,094
"Aoi, Yuta.

368
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:04,594
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

369
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:08,994
I bought stocks wanting to increase assets for the company."

370
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,594
What? Bankrupt?

371
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:12,594
No way.

372
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:39,894
"Fresh-Caught Seafood, All You Can Eat Seafood"

373
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,394
My seafood!

374
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:45,494
My all-you-can-eat seafood!

375
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,994
Talk about a high tide of tears.

376
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,694
We won't be seeing ebb tide for a while.

377
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,394
"Next Episode" -It looks like he fell off.

378
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,394
Yeah.

379
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,594
-Pops! -What?

380
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:03,194
Miss! Are you okay?

381
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,194
It's a murder robbery case.

382
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,694
-A murder robbery case? -What?

383
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,594
This place is a secret.

384
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:14,894
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help myself.

385
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:18,294
-Do you want to see it that badly? -Yes.

386
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:24,294
Next Conan, "A Beauty, A Lie and A Secret"

387
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:27,337
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,437
"Cigarettes"

389
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:30,937
Dad, you're ogling girls again.

390
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,337
I'm not ogling anybody.

391
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,137
He sure can't lie.
