1
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:08,998
I see.

2
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:11,298
So, we still don't know where she is.

3
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:15,698
Sorry, we're trying the best we can, though.

4
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:19,298
I still can't believe it.

5
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:24,298
It's hard to believe he'd disappear from there.

6
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:30,698
If his corpse wasn't there, it just means that he wasn't killed.

7
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:34,898
We've got to look for her fast and bring her before me.

8
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:40,298
We can't afford her talking about us to anybody.

9
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:46,298
Of course, I don't care if you get him dead or alive.

10
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,898
What? They went inside the newspaper agency?

11
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,698
Yeah. All five of them saying that they'll come again

12
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:58,998
after they find proof.

13
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:00,698
-Darn! -Hey.

14
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:02,298
Those idiots.

15
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:04,898
They could be...

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,098
Of all things, the Youth Detective Squad made it into the site

17
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:09,898
of where counterfeit bills were being made.

18
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,898
The woman with the black hat

19
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,198
and the gun that is pointed at the children await their entry.

20
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:19,598
Is she really connected to the men in black in some way? Or...

21
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:22,098
Conan runs up the stairs to truth

22
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:24,698
in order to reveal the mystery of it all.

23
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,298
He runs to save his friends,

24
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:30,498
as well as to gain his real identity as Shinichi Kudo back.

25
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:36,198
Darn, Genta and the others.

26
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:40,298
After I told them not to move from in front of the police box.

27
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:43,098
Hey, Genta, let's go back already.

28
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:45,098
If somebody comes, we'll be scolded.

29
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:46,398
Shut up!

30
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,398
If you wanna go home, why don't you go home alone, Ayumi?

31
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:53,198
It's seems like everybody is safe yet.

32
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:56,798
Okay then, I'll have to get everybody out of here now.

33
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,298
That's it for your detective game, kid.

34
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:07,998
What?

35
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,998
Hey, look at this!

36
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:15,998
A lot of 10,000 yen bills.

37
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,698
That's cool!

38
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:22,298
God know how much eels over rice I can eat with that much money.

39
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:25,698
But, there's something strange about these 10,000 yen bills.

40
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:28,698
Yukichi Fukuzawa's left eye is not drawn in.

41
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,798
It's like the daruma doll.

42
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:36,198
We're drawing in both eyes when our wish is granted.

43
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,898
And when that 10,000 yen bill is perfected.

44
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,398
Who are you guys?

45
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:45,898
How's about a touching reunion of the two brothers?

46
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,198
Toshiya!

47
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:51,998
Brother! Brother!

48
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:52,998
Toshiya!

49
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:56,098
Hey, cut it out, you guys!

50
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:58,398
That's right, I'll contact Conan.

51
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:03,398
-What do you think you're doing? -Let her go!

52
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:07,798
Shut up! You don't seem to know what this is, do you?

53
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,398
Don't you dare touch the children!

54
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,798
If you do, I won't cooperate with you anymore.

55
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:17,698
Don't worry, I'll save your little brother for last.

56
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,398
Bring the girl with the headband here.

57
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:24,298
Ayumi!

58
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:25,898
Hey, what're you going to do?

59
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:29,898
I'm going to make you speed your work up.

60
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:31,298
If they die one after the other,

61
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,698
maybe you'll want to work harder?

62
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:37,298
Help, Conan!

63
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:38,398
Conan?

64
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:42,398
If it's that boy with glasses that were loitering around the stairs,

65
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,898
he's already dead.

66
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:47,798
Conan's dead?

67
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:49,198
No way.

68
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:50,598
It's a lie!

69
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,998
There is only one way in and out of this building!

70
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,898
When can you kill him?

71
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,098
The surveillance camera was watching all of you all this time.

72
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:03,198
The outside stairway is also guarded.

73
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:04,798
You didn't know, did you?

74
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:07,598
I had Inuyama come all the way around to this entrance

75
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,898
from the emergency exit so that you guys wouldn't be able to run away.

76
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:15,098
Just then, the boy with the glasses came along, so I killed him.

77
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,598
Hey, come on, don't cry.

78
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:22,698
You'll be just fine. I'll let you go to him right away.

79
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:25,198
Bye, bye, young lady.

80
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,498
No!

81
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:32,298
Who is it?

82
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:37,098
Same as the daruma doll, you say?

83
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:38,598
What a laugh!

84
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,898
Yukichi Fukuzawa's eye is not drawn in

85
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:44,098
because the sculptor that was carving him got hurt.

86
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:45,298
What?

87
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:48,598
See, the man over there with the white beard and his hand wrapped up.

88
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,398
He's the real sculptor, isn't he?

89
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:54,198
You panicked and made Toshiya's brother take his place

90
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:57,798
because the sculptor got hurt just before completion.

91
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,698
After seeing his talent for art at the exhibition,

92
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:04,198
you lured him out and confined him here.

93
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:06,198
The ink beside the printer,

94
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,898
and the container with magnetic steel powder inside it.

95
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:12,398
Seeing that you've got all these prepared.

96
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:15,698
I'll bet you're going to put it through a machine next?

97
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,198
You plan to pass it through the counterfeit detection machine,

98
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,898
and use these counterfeits that are difficult to detect even by appearance

99
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:24,498
through the change machines of banks, game centers, and pachinko parlors,

100
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,698
to change them in large amounts.

101
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,398
By the time your deed is made public,

102
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,998
you plan to be some place far away.

103
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,698
Isn't that right, lady in the black hat?

104
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:36,498
Who...

105
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:38,898
who are you?

106
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:45,398
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

107
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,798
Conan!

108
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,998
It can't be. Inuyama got rid of you.

109
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:59,198
Oh, so this dog of a man is called Inuyama?

110
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:05,998
I'm sorry, but I put him to sleep with an anesthetic gun.

111
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,598
Anesthetic gun?

112
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,098
Oh, yes, yes.

113
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,598
The gun I threw at you a while ago was Inuyama's gun.

114
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,498
I kicked it right at you.

115
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,498
Kicked it?

116
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:21,698
Yes, with this super kick shoe.

117
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:22,998
There!

118
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:57,598
Ai Haibara?

119
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:21,902
Cool.

120
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:23,602
You're fantastic, Ai.

121
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:26,202
You're just too much.

122
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:29,602
This is the first time I've ever seen a real gun.

123
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:31,702
She...

124
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,002
Well, at any rate, I'm glad.

125
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:35,302
Brother!

126
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:36,302
Toshiya.

127
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:39,202
So, now I guess the case is closed.

128
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:40,502
I'm glad!

129
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,002
Aye! The Youth Detective Squad's great victory!

130
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:47,202
Is anything the matter?

131
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:09,402
Thanks for coming. The case has been solved!

132
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:12,302
This is the counterfeit, which is evidence.

133
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:17,902
And that's Toshiya's brother, the one who was kidnapped.

134
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:20,102
Hello.

135
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:22,802
They were telling the truth.

136
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,102
Leave it to the Youth Detective Squad,

137
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,902
and cases are solved in a jiffy...

138
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:29,502
Right, Conan?

139
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,502
Yes.

140
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,702
Being reckless like this, we'll need more than nine lives.

141
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:41,202
Twenty minutes later, Inspector Megure arrived.

142
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:43,702
They were all taken away,

143
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:46,102
and Toshiya's brother was set free.

144
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:48,402
And...

145
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:53,202
What a goof, to be arrested over such a measly crime.

146
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,202
You may as well spit it all out at the station.

147
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,502
About the big organization

148
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:00,202
that is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

149
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,602
Organization?

150
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,102
Don't play dumb with me.

151
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:07,802
You also had code names like "Gin" and "Vodka", didn't you?

152
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,502
Gin, Vodka?

153
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:13,602
I'm sorry, but I quit drinking quite some time ago.

154
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:18,102
Hey, hey, just what are you talking about, Conan?

155
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:20,602
These people are notorious for making counterfeit bills

156
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,402
and go by the name "Silver Fox".

157
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:23,802
Although she's fixed up a bit by plastic surgery,

158
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,802
I would never forget the face of this woman boss.

159
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,002
But, this time you'll have to serve for kidnapping,

160
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,002
possession of dangerous weapons, and firing a gun, too.

161
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:33,902
You'll be spending some time in jail this time.

162
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:37,802
My, I'm not the one who fired the gun.

163
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,002
It's that girl with the brown hair over there.

164
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:42,602
What?

165
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:46,802
What a dangerous thing to do?

166
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:49,302
But... Because...

167
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:53,102
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have scolded you.

168
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:56,802
So, she's a girl after all.

169
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,702
Hey, don't cry.

170
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:08,202
Your house is near here, isn't it?

171
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:12,402
Gosh, why me?

172
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,702
I'm thrower off finding out that those people dressed in black

173
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:15,402
were not the people I was after,

174
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:18,002
and why do I have to baby-sit a crying girl,

175
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,202
moreover, walk her home.

176
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:24,702
Hey, you can go home alone from here, can't you?

177
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,702
See you tomorrow...

178
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,202
at school, then.

179
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:35,802
APTX 4869.

180
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,402
-What? -Do you know what it is?

181
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:41,802
It's the name of the medicine you were given.

182
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,302
What're you talking about?

183
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,302
I've never been given such a strange medicine.

184
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:49,902
Oh, I'm sure that the name of the medicine is not wrong

185
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:52,402
because I'm the one who made it...

186
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:55,902
by order of the organization.

187
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:59,502
Organization? Made it?

188
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:02,102
A child like you could never do.

189
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,802
I drank it just like you did.

190
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:07,502
Through the accidental effects

191
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,002
of the self-destructive program of the cells,

192
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,702
everything from bone structure, muscles,

193
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:14,802
internal organs, to bodily hair, all but the nervous system,

194
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:16,902
regress to that of the childhood years.

195
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,402
It sure is a mystical poison.

196
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:23,202
Haibara, don't tell me you're...

197
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,202
It's not Haibara.

198
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,702
It's Sherry.

199
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,702
This is my code name.

200
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:35,802
Well? Surprised?

201
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,402
Shinichi Kudo.

202
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:48,702
Then, you're a member of the organization of the men in black.

203
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:52,402
You've got no time to be surprised, slowpoke detective.

204
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,202
What?

205
00:11:56,102 --> 00:12:01,202
Didn't I tell you that I live at Beika 2-22 now.

206
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:07,402
Yes, next door to your real house.

207
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:09,302
You know where it is, don't you?

208
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:12,602
It couldn't be...

209
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,402
Dr. Agasa's house?

210
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,602
Hey, Dr. Agasa!

211
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,502
-Answer the phone! -No use.

212
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:27,702
No matter how much you call, you'll get a busy signal.

213
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:31,602
The phone is off the hook, he can't pick it up.

214
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:38,902
That's because he is no longer of this world.

215
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:41,502
Why you...
