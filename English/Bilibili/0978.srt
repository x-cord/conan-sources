1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,390
Found a heron.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,490
That's a sandpiper, isn't it?

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,750
Those are mallards. There're a bunch of them!

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,970
Look! There's a kingfisher.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,610
What? Where? Where is it?!

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,010
Huh? What?

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,720
Let's see...

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,000
Now this is a rare find.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,680
That's a thrush.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,390
A woodpecker, maybe?

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,920
And... a turtle dove.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,740
Just kidding.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,450
Hey, Conan-kun!

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,380
Huh?

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,530
Conan-kun, what are you doing?

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,780
P-People watching...

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,300
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,420
A case breaks out in a pair of binoculars!

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,340
Use your powers of observation
to catch the culprit!

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,910
Always determining the one truth

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,740
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,010
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:53,791
The Case On the Opposite Shore

25
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,951
"The Case On the Opposite Shore!"
The Case On the Opposite Shore

26
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,991
The Case On the Opposite Shore

27
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:10,071
Didn't we agree to go bird
watching together today?

28
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:14,151
Why are you looking at people
when we came to look at birds?

29
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,071
Sorry. I couldn't help it.

30
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,141
Please, Conan-kun.

31
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:22,771
But this seems pretty interesting, too.

32
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,271
People watching.

33
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,121
Oh? Looks like they're arguing.

34
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:30,021
What?

35
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:34,531
You're right. It looks like
that woman is mad at that man.

36
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:38,411
"I'm sorry. Please cheer up."

37
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,391
"Tell me. What's more
important, me or your job?"

38
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,471
"I don't know what to say."

39
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:48,941
"I don't like men who don't
communicate clearly. Hmph!"

40
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,541
"Hey, wait!"

41
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,551
That's not what this is about.

42
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,801
What is it about, then?

43
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:59,181
Basically, for example...

44
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:06,101
See that man in the white polo shirt
playing with the child by the slide?

45
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:09,441
What about him?

46
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:13,821
You observe him and guess his profession.

47
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:14,681
What?

48
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,781
How?

49
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,491
That's impossible.

50
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,531
It's not impossible.

51
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,291
Huh?

52
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:29,951
First, that watch on his left arm is a
luxury watch that costs several million yen.

53
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,171
All the clothes he's wearing are
simple, but they're designer brands.

54
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,231
Based on that, we can reason
that he works a high-paying job.

55
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:41,111
And more than anything, there's the
red strap hanging from his neck.

56
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,641
At the end of it is...

57
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,821
A cell phone for medical use.

58
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,991
In other words, this man is...

59
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,651
This man is?

60
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,471
A doctor.

61
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:53,871
That's right.

62
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:56,031
A cell phone for medical use?

63
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:58,951
Because the waves they transmit are weak,

64
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:02,911
they're widely used for internal
communication systems within hospitals.

65
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:05,331
Really? Is that right?

66
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:11,391
You know those signs in hospitals and
trains telling you to turn off your phone?

67
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:12,051
No Cell Phones

68
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:14,721
They're warnings intended
to prevent adverse effects
No Cell Phones

69
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:18,341
on people with pacemakers
and hospital equipment.
No Cell Phones

70
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,391
Additionally, that red strap indicates
that he's a healthcare worker.

71
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:23,851
Medical Use PHS
Additionally, that red strap indicates
that he's a healthcare worker.

72
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,651
Conan-kun, that's amazing!

73
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,221
I can't believe you figured that
out just by looking at him.

74
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,481
You guys could do it, too.

75
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:31,101
What?

76
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,401
Really?

77
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:36,771
Yeah. When you observe carefully, you
can figure out all kinds of things.

78
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,311
Let's all try it to improve
our detective skills.

79
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,971
Yeah!

80
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:56,191
Okay, then...

81
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:01,871
Let's look at that woman in the light
blue dress carrying that big bag.

82
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:06,581
She's a singer-songwriter!

83
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,211
A makeup artist!

84
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,831
No, she sells eels!

85
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,621
You're all wrong.

86
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,261
Any hints?

87
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:19,571
You should focus on her unique
way of walking and her large bag.

88
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,171
She's slender but muscular overall.

89
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,701
You're right.

90
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,771
That's a bold way of walking.

91
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:32,111
But what's inside that bag?

92
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,611
Perhaps a stage costume, like a tutu.

93
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,961
What's a tutu?

94
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:43,551
I've got it! She's a ballerina.

95
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,831
Correct, Ayumi-chan.

96
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,051
Yes!

97
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:50,371
The basic position of ballet
is called "en dehors."

98
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:53,161
It means turning your feet outwards.

99
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:58,441
So even while walking, she points her toes
outwards and maintains a straight posture.

100
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:02,261
Not only does ballet use a lot
of costumes and equipment,

101
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:06,251
but most people have to
carry their own things,

102
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,951
so they tend to carry large bags.

103
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,701
Really?

104
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,311
See?

105
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:16,081
When you observe carefully, you can
figure out all kinds of things, right?

106
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,351
Yes, you're right.

107
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,501
All right! I'll guess the next one.

108
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,501
Hey, Edogawa-kun.

109
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:28,641
Look at the hedges to the
right of the water fountain.

110
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,171
Huh? Isn't that...?

111
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:47,721
I-Is that Detective Takagi?

112
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:48,681
Yes.

113
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,031
And look at the cardboard
box behind the fountain.

114
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:53,771
Huh?

115
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:55,751
Behind the fountain?

116
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,051
Let's see...

117
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:00,801
That's Detective Chiba.

118
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,541
Why is he dressed like that?

119
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,301
Maybe they're on a stakeout.

120
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,011
A stakeout?

121
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:13,311
If we follow their gaze,
we'll find their target.

122
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,861
Let's see...

123
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,061
There! In front of the fountain!

124
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,721
He looks the part.

125
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,961
What does that mean?

126
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,791
He's delivering the ransom
in a kidnapping case.

127
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,701
What?!

128
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,001
All officers, report.

129
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,001
Nothing strange here.

130
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:39,741
Nothing strange.

131
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,161
Nothing strange.

132
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:47,701
Nothing strange.

133
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:51,511
What should we do?

134
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,941
Is there anything we can do to help?

135
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,131
Are we going to the other shore?

136
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,271
But in order to cross the river,

137
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:03,861
whether we go upstream or downstream,

138
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:06,031
it would take a lot of time.

139
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:12,291
We can't go over there and cause confusion.

140
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,861
Let's watch from here.

141
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,041
You're right.

142
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,041
Yeah.

143
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:22,021
Two guys are coming down
the stairs in the middle.

144
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:27,691
They're probably construction workers
building houses in the area.

145
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,411
They're unrelated to the case.

146
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,051
One person is coming from the left.

147
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:37,031
It's hard to imagine a kidnapper
dressed in a sailor uniform.

148
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,221
Huh? What's that?

149
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,861
It's a boat.

150
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:45,081
Now we can't see the opposite shore.

151
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:47,901
Hurry up and move!

152
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,911
Hurry.

153
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:57,411
Hurry up!

154
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,641
All right.

155
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:15,681
That running woman is heading
towards the fountain.

156
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,111
No, it's not her.

157
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,671
She's meeting the man by the river.

158
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:29,571
Edogawa-kun, what about the
man next to the swings?

159
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:31,461
Huh?

160
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:37,791
He looks the part.

161
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:41,901
He's clearly watching his surroundings
and acting suspiciously.

162
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,851
Is that man the kidnapper?

163
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,621
Bingo. It's him.

164
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,101
Excuse me.

165
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,611
Yes?

166
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:12,361
I represent Iwabe-san.

167
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:15,031
Could you hand over the money?

168
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,221
What?

169
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:17,621
Arrest him!

170
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:23,411
No, wait!

171
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:30,921
You're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan!

172
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,041
They got him!

173
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,761
Case closed!

174
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,721
Yes!

175
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:48,051
The culprit's been arrested,
but something not right.

176
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,098
I knew it!

177
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:11,198
Is something wrong?

178
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,518
It's not him.

179
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,308
What?

180
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,308
He's probably not the kidnapper.

181
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:18,358
Huh?

182
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:23,548
I mean, he is a culprit,
but not of this case.

183
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,808
What are you saying?

184
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,148
I don't understand.

185
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:32,628
That man is probably a
communications fraud con artist.

186
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,948
A con artist?

187
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,128
Huh?

188
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:40,588
I thought it seemed strange for a
kidnapper to behave so apprehensively.

189
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:45,138
That man was probably shocked
to hear the charges.

190
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:47,268
You're right.

191
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:50,638
Now that you mention it, he
doesn't seem like a kidnapper.

192
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,648
I need to let them know immediately.

193
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,648
It looks like you won't need to.

194
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:56,778
Look.

195
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:05,598
I told you, I don't know
anything about a kidnapping.

196
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,358
Lying about it won't help.

197
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,908
I'm not lying.

198
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,768
Yes. Yes, I see. Understood.

199
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,458
I got confirmation.

200
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,928
They've got an elderly woman named
Iwabe Sayuri-san at Beika Bank.

201
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,308
I-In other words, it's unrelated
to the kidnapping?

202
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:28,658
That's what I've been saying.

203
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,438
Take him away.

204
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,358
Yes, sir.

205
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,638
All officers, regroup.

206
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,498
Return to your positions quickly.

207
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:40,258
Got it.

208
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,578
Did it work out okay?

209
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,388
The kidnapper probably hadn't come
to the hand-off location yet.

210
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:51,118
What?

211
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,618
The suspect doesn't seem to have noticed.

212
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,128
No movement.

213
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:06,138
I wouldn't say that.

214
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,888
What? Did the kidnapper show up?

215
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:12,268
I don't know that, but look.

216
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:15,468
The police officers are on edge.

217
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,158
The kidnapper should make his move soon.

218
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:32,488
All right.

219
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:36,668
Then I'll observe the scene
carefully and find the kidnapper.

220
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,488
Me, too.

221
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:41,208
It's time to demonstrate the
results of our training.

222
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:42,898
Me, too.

223
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:52,728
All right. I'll start.

224
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:58,718
I've chosen that man sitting
on the bench to the left.

225
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:03,408
Why? Because he hasn't
done anything in a while.

226
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:07,488
If he works in an office, he
wouldn't be hanging around a park.

227
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,368
I'm next.

228
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:15,128
I've chosen the large man
wearing a yukata in the field.

229
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:20,398
At first glance, it looks like he's
searching for a four-leaf clover,

230
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:23,048
but he has an evil-looking face.

231
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:26,798
I've chosen that person.

232
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:32,478
That man wearing a hat who's been doing
exercises by the horizontal bars.

233
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:37,558
Since he's been doing warm-ups for so long,
he must intend to do something after this.

234
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,848
Well? What's your deduction?

235
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:49,038
If the police are on edge,

236
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:52,078
it must mean that it's nearly the
time scheduled by the kidnapper.

237
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:57,818
It's likely the kidnapper
is already in the park.

238
00:15:58,588 --> 00:16:01,958
Who is the kidnapper?

239
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:10,758
It's an emergency!

240
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,548
Someone fell in the river!

241
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:18,348
Someone help!

242
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,658
I can't swim!

243
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:22,978
I'm going.

244
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:23,928
Help!

245
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,058
Call the emergency line!
Help!

246
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:25,388
And the police!
Help!

247
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:25,978
And the police!

248
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,418
Give me the bag!

249
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,128
Who are you?

250
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,918
Tell me! Where is Mika?

251
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,698
Where is she? Is she all right?

252
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:47,878
Shut up!

253
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:50,168
That's definitely him this time.

254
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:51,138
Arrest him!

255
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,008
Yes, sir.

256
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:56,008
Gotcha!

257
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:00,518
You're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan!

258
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,148
Yes!

259
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:07,948
This time the case is closed!

260
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,598
That's great!

261
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:10,528
You're wrong.

262
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:11,448
Huh?

263
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:15,948
That's a decoy. There's another culprit.

264
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,208
That's definitely him. He's the culprit!

265
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,588
He, who?

266
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,068
I'll tell you later.

267
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,848
Where is Mika-chan?

268
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,908
How should I know?

269
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:40,848
I was just asked to receive the money here!

270
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:47,008
Don't play dumb! You can't
talk your way out of this!

271
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,858
Confess!

272
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,178
Detective Takagi, please! Answer your phone!

273
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,578
What? He's in the middle
of arresting the kidnapper!

274
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,238
He's not noticing!

275
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,028
Detective Takagi!

276
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,848
What are we going to do?

277
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:03,368
All right. How about this?

278
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,258
Hey!

279
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:18,628
That's Conan-kun and his friends.

280
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:20,588
Someone's calling.

281
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:23,458
There's no time. Listen quietly.

282
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,398
Huh?

283
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:27,268
The kidnapper isn't that
man. There's someone else.

284
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:28,518
What?

285
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:30,418
Run to the swings immediately.

286
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:31,738
O-Okay.

287
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,198
The man who fell in the river

288
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,098
and the man who came to get the
ransom money were probably just hired.

289
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,838
They shouldn't know anything about the case.

290
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:46,288
How do you know about the kidnapping?

291
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:47,678
Just be quiet and listen.

292
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:49,748
Since time is short, I'll
start from the conclusion.

293
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:52,948
The culprit is the man
wearing the gray jacket.

294
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:53,988
Arrest him immediately!

295
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,358
G-Got it.

296
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:02,018
The kidnapper first had a hired man
jump into the river to distract you.

297
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,058
While that was going on, he had another
man attempt to seize the ransom money.

298
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:11,428
The kidnapper himself isn't going to receive
the money because he's cautious of the police.

299
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:18,318
But how did you figure out that the man
in the gray jacket is the kidnapper?

300
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:22,828
Normally, when a person falls in a river,
everyone looks that way out of surprise.

301
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:30,198
If after that, someone attempted to steal an
old man's bag, naturally you'd look at that, too.

302
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:31,458
Y-Yeah.

303
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,728
But the man in the gray jacket
wasn't surprised at all.

304
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:36,978
I see.

305
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:40,298
That man knew that someone
would fall into the river

306
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,338
and that there'd be an attempted robbery.

307
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:44,218
That's right.

308
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:47,388
The kidnapper is attempting to flee the park.

309
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:50,998
He's surely mad at the victim
for breaking their promise.

310
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:57,688
If you don't arrest him here, the kidnapping
victim's life could be in danger.

311
00:19:57,688 --> 00:20:00,468
So you can't let him escape!

312
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,748
I know, but Conan-kun...

313
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:04,548
Huh?

314
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:09,028
He's not here. The man in
the gray jacket is gone!

315
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:12,748
That's not possible. How?

316
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,428
What? He was there until a second ago.

317
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:20,768
I can't believe I lost him
in the second I looked away.

318
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,118
A reversible.

319
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,388
The culprit flipped his jacket inside out.

320
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,648
Damn! That means...

321
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:33,148
Did he have any other distinctive qualities?

322
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,148
Other distinctive qualities?

323
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,658
Remember. Did he have any
other distinctive qualities?

324
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:54,478
Those are nice sneakers.
Are they limited edition?

325
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:08,428
Could I ask you a few questions about
the kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan?

326
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:20,198
You're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Shibata Mika-chan.

327
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:33,458
Later, after questioning the kidnapper,

328
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:37,868
they learned that both the drowning man and
the man who attempted to steal the money were,

329
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:42,468
as I had deduced, hired by the kidnapper.

330
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:49,158
Kidnapping victim Shibata Mika-chan was
discovered safe in the kidnapper's home.

331
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:19,048
Another case closed.

332
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:21,988
And the communications fraud
case was resolved, too.

333
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,488
That's great.

334
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:27,488
But we barely did anything.

335
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:30,738
Why not learn from the
experience for next time?

336
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:34,748
You're right. After all,
that's why we're training.

337
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,498
That person's acting weird.

338
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:39,698
What?

339
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:43,578
That person is a photographer.

340
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:44,968
He might be an amateur photographer.

341
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:45,188

342
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:47,398
Maybe he's investigating a detective.
