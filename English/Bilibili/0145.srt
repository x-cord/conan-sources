1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.366
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.166
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.866
What a surprise. Those two will appear.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.766
They reach the platform where danger awaits them.

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.366
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.666
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.579
The North Star number three, an overnight express train

9
00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.779
heads on for Hokkaido with all of us on board.

10
00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:02.679
While the train was passing through the Seikan Tunnel,

11
00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.179
Keitaro Izumo, the owner of a jewelry shop

12
00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.079
is shot in the head and dies.

13
00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.379
The killer cracks the window of his room

14
00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.479
and flees out the train.

15
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.279
A while later, the corpse of the man thought to be the killer,

16
00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.079
Yasuji Asama is found in the tunnel.

17
00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.379
This incident

18
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.879
is progressing exactly as it is written in the unpublished novel

19
00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.779
that was written by Dad!

20
00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.079
Why don't you reveal your true identity?

21
00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.679
You've been busted already.

22
00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.579
Lady.

23
00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.979
"Murder on the North Star Number Three (Part 2)"

24
00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.179
So, you've figured out who I am after all.

25
00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.079
"Yukiko Kudo" -Just as expected of you, Shinichi.

26
00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.679
What made you think you could fool your own son

27
00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.979
by just changing the color of your lipstick and hairdo?

28
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:11.579
Oh, my. But I went through everything to set my hair like this.

29
00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.179
So, why did go as far as to disguise yourself

30
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.079
and get on board this train?

31
00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.679
Gosh, I have to disguise myself!

32
00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.579
After all, I am famous here in Japan, you know.

33
00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.779
That was years ago.

34
00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.979
Oh, quiet!

35
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.579
I got on board this train

36
00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.579
because I read an article in the Japanese paper in Los Angeles.

37
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.279
That weird article said,

38
00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.879
"Robber robs jewelry shop and flees without taking a thing,

39
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.879
leaving strange remark behind."

40
00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.579
So, it's just a I thought.

41
00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.179
Yes, Yusaku was saying so, too.

42
00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.079
The sloppy job of a professional robber.

43
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.879
And the mysterious phrase,

44
00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.679
"Nobody told me," that the robber said before fleeing.

45
00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.079
That it's just like the opening of the suspense novel

46
00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.179
that he wrote 10 years ago.

47
00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:04.079
But the place that was robbed in the novel was an antique shop,

48
00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.079
not a jewelry shop.

49
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.179
And then what?

50
00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.279
Of course, we called the jewelry shop.

51
00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.779
And asked if the owner of the shop had any plans

52
00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.279
of riding an overnight train

53
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.079
that'll be going through a long tunnel.

54
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.379
Because according to the story,

55
00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.079
the owner of the antique shop

56
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.279
was supposed to be killed on board the train.

57
00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.579
That's when we found out

58
00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:28.279
that he was going to be boarding the North Star in six days.

59
00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.679
Why didn't you stop him?

60
00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:32.679
I didn't think that a murder was going to be committed

61
00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:36.079
while I was using the restroom.

62
00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.679
Then, why didn't you at least let me know?

63
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:43.079
But you're always with Ran.

64
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.079
Nevertheless, you could've thought of something, couldn't you?

65
00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:50.879
Then, are you saying that I'm to blame for him being killed?

66
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.379
No, that's not what I'm saying, but...

67
00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:00.279
And just where is that source of all this nuisance causing novel?

68
00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.279
He's already probably reached Sapporo

69
00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.679
on the North Star before this!

70
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.379
When we called the jewelry shop,

71
00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.279
they only told us that the owner was scheduled

72
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.879
to board one of the three North Stars that depart daily,

73
00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.879
so Yusaku boarded number one and I got on number three.

74
00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.779
Since the remaining North Star number two

75
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.379
goes through the tunnel in the morning,

76
00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.779
we ruled it out.

77
00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.079
I see.

78
00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:29.279
So, it's more convenient to set the trick up at night.

79
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.879
And? Just what kind of trick is it supposed to be?

80
00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.179
You asked Dad about it, didn't you?

81
00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:36.579
Well...

82
00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.179
What? He forgot the trick?

83
00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:49.879
Well, it was 10 years ago.

84
00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.979
And besides, only first part of the novel was finished

85
00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.279
when the novel was stolen.

86
00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.079
Stolen?

87
00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.179
Yes.

88
00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:59.679
The person of the editing office who had the manuscript

89
00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:04.379
got involved in a bank robbery, and his bag was robbed.

90
00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.779
Hey, don't tell me that the robber was...

91
00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:09.779
Yes, that's right!

92
00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.479
The robbers were a group of three men,

93
00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.379
and the name of their boss was...

94
00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.379
Yasuji Asama.

95
00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.979
The man that was found dead in the tunnel a while ago.

96
00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.179
But isn't it strange?

97
00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:23.779
Why would the boss of the group of robbers

98
00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.379
who stole the novel be killed just like in the novel?

99
00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:28.779
That's true...

100
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.679
Hey, Conan!

101
00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:32.679
Ran!

102
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:35.779
Just what are you doing here?

103
00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.279
I was just talking to this lady...

104
00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.579
You were talking to this young lady, right?

105
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:46.879
Yes.

106
00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.979
Let's go to the lobby compartment!

107
00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.979
Dad is going to put on a deduction show.

108
00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:58.379
Oh, my. He's raced us to it.

109
00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:59.979
Hopefully.

110
00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:05.079
A deduction show?

111
00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.379
Are you saying that the killer isn't Yasuji Asama,

112
00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.379
the one who was found dead in the tunnel?

113
00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.779
Yes, the killer is Yasuji Asama.

114
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.479
So then, just what are you going to deduce?

115
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.479
The motive.

116
00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:20.579
Motive?

117
00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:21.779
Yes.

118
00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.579
The key to solve this case is Asama's remark,

119
00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:28.279
"Nobody told me," right after he tried to rob Mr. Izumo's shop

120
00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.179
and fled.

121
00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:33.879
At this point, this case is incomprehensible.

122
00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:36.379
But if this incident were to have been set up

123
00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.479
by Mr. Izumo and Asama,

124
00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.279
everything falls into place.

125
00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.479
What?

126
00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.579
Mr. Izumo probably conned Asama into robbing his shop,

127
00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:50.079
then returning all the items that was robbed.

128
00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.579
And that in return,

129
00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:55.679
the exhorbiant insurance money covering the jewellery

130
00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:58.579
would be shared between them.

131
00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:01.079
But when he was robbed,

132
00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.079
Mr. Izumo pushed the burglar alarm

133
00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:05.279
and got rid of the robber, didn't he?

134
00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.979
Mr. Izumo had no intention

135
00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:09.779
of letting the robber rob his shop in the first place.

136
00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.179
-Huh? -It was a trap he set up...

137
00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:14.279
to attract attention and take advantage of

138
00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:19.279
for the upcoming mayoral election.

139
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.079
However, unfortunately, Asama got away.

140
00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.679
Then, Mr. Izumo receives a call from Asama

141
00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:27.879
who he was fearing would take revenge.

142
00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:30.579
Asama tells him to get on board North Star number three

143
00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:32.179
to talk over the deal again

144
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.979
without the presence of the police.

145
00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:40.479
Mr. Izumi who was summoned, was shot by Asama.

146
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.279
And Asama who tried to flee from the window

147
00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:46.579
fell to his death.

148
00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:50.579
Come to think of it, wasn't it after the robbery

149
00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:53.579
that the owner said he wanted to board the North Star, Mrs. Izumo?

150
00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:55.579
Yes, he was planning to go by plane,

151
00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:57.279
but suddenly changed plans.

152
00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:01.779
How did Mr. Izumo get to know Asama in the first place?

153
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.779
Maybe it's "that", don't you think?

154
00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:07.079
Remember the scandal that was in the newspapers

155
00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.279
about Mr. Izumo being a drug pusher some time ago?

156
00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.879
He's been cleared of that suspicion ages ago!

157
00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:15.679
But according to the Mr. Detective,

158
00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:20.079
it seems to be true that he's into something that isn't all clean.

159
00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:23.179
Well, I guess we should be thankful

160
00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:24.879
that such a man was kept from becoming the next mayor.

161
00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.979
You've got the nerve to say something like that

162
00:09:26.979 --> 00:09:28.779
-right before my very eyes, -Now, now.

163
00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:31.979
If this were an ordinary crime,

164
00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:34.079
it would probably be just as Pops says.

165
00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:36.779
But this case is obviously

166
00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:39.179
progressing the way Dad wrote in his novel.

167
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.479
Officer.

168
00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:46.679
They used to be in a group of three robbers in the past, right?

169
00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:47.779
Yes.

170
00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:50.979
-Did you get all their names? -No.

171
00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:55.079
We got the names of the boss, Asama, and the woman.

172
00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:57.579
But as to the name of the other one, nothing yet.

173
00:09:57.579 --> 00:10:01.679
But Asama robbed the jewelry shop alone the other day,

174
00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:07.479
so the other one probably decided to quit doing bad things.

175
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:08.679
Which means that

176
00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:12.979
one of the members of the group may be here among us.

177
00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:16.879
Which means it's the guy who read Dad's novel.

178
00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:20.679
This is the diagram of the rooms.

179
00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.679
If there is a way to move from room to room

180
00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.979
without anybody noticing, then...

181
00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:28.079
Wait a second.

182
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.979
What if some kind of tool were to be used?

183
00:10:30.979 --> 00:10:34.379
Mrs. Azusa has a shot gun that she uses for clay shooting.

184
00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:38.379
Mr. Kaetsu had a fishing kit for lure fishing.

185
00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:41.779
Mr. Aoba had kendo wear and a bamboo sword.

186
00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:44.479
Mr. Ishizuchi had a golf set.

187
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:46.879
I get it.

188
00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:49.179
If Asama's corpse was thrown out of the window

189
00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:52.779
before Mr. Izumo was shot to death,

190
00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:56.679
we could've been deceived if that were used.

191
00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:59.079
Inspector Nishimura!

192
00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:01.579
We got a report from the site saying that

193
00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.179
they've figured out the time Asama fell into the tunnel

194
00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:06.079
from the train.

195
00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:07.179
From the speed at which the train was moving

196
00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:08.479
and the position at which the corpse was found,

197
00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:11.979
it is estimated to be around 4:10 am.

198
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:13.679
It's just about the same time

199
00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.679
that the witnesses say

200
00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:18.179
they saw the killer flee into his room.

201
00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.479
It can't be!

202
00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.279
So, does that mean that the killer

203
00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.779
threw the corpse out of the window in such a short time

204
00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:26.479
and disappeared?

205
00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:27.879
That 's impossible!

206
00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:31.079
No human could perform such a feat!

207
00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:35.079
What kind of trick did you think up of, Dad?

208
00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:37.679
They still haven't been able to find the pieces of glass

209
00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:40.179
that have been shattered.

210
00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.879
Tell them to look harder!

211
00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:45.279
They seem to also have found something strange on the belt hole

212
00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.979
on the back of the slacks that the victim was wearing.

213
00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:49.379
Something strange?

214
00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:50.479
Yes.

215
00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:53.479
A crumpled piece of masking tape.

216
00:11:55.979 --> 00:11:57.179
Wait a second.

217
00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:00.679
If an object that shape were to be there...

218
00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:04.979
If it were to be there...

219
00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.179
I found it. There it is!

220
00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:11.179
The killer used this!

221
00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:14.579
I am sure that person is the killer.

222
00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:16.879
That person killed Mr. Izumo

223
00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:20.179
and framed Asama up to make him look like the killer.

224
00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:22.479
The structure of this North Star

225
00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:25.279
and the Seikan Tunnel was used to the utmost advantage.

226
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.779
What's up, Shinichi?

227
00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:32.979
I've figured everything out from A to Z.

228
00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:37.279
The stupid trick that Dad wrote in his novel.

229
00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:40.279
The young man wearing black rimmed glasses

230
00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:43.479
smiled a smile of victory.

231
00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:47.379
You're fantastic!

232
00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:51.379
Now you can take the conceit out of Yusaku!

233
00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:58.779
Did a young man wearing glasses come out in that novel?

234
00:12:58.779 --> 00:12:59.779
Oh, yes!

235
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.279
An obnoxious guy boasting to be a detective!

236
00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.879
If I'm not mistaken, he carries himself too far and...

237
00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:07.479
Not even knowing that he would be taking his own life

238
00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:10.879
because of his power of deduction.

239
00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:12.279
Hey, hey.

240
00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:14.679
Don't tell me that's...

241
00:13:20.668 --> 00:13:24.468
Don't be silly, Shinichi.

242
00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:28.068
No matter how much the incidents are progressing like the novel,

243
00:13:28.068 --> 00:13:30.668
you won't be killed, Shinichi.

244
00:13:30.668 --> 00:13:33.268
The idiot was killed by the killer

245
00:13:33.268 --> 00:13:35.568
because he was so engrossed over him

246
00:13:35.568 --> 00:13:37.868
despite having no proof.

247
00:13:37.868 --> 00:13:40.668
That character is totally different from you, Shinichi!

248
00:13:40.668 --> 00:13:43.768
I don't think that I'd be killed,

249
00:13:43.768 --> 00:13:45.868
although the circumstances do look similar.

250
00:13:47.668 --> 00:13:50.468
I don't have the proof.

251
00:13:50.468 --> 00:13:52.868
I've figured out how the guy disappeared from the room,

252
00:13:52.868 --> 00:13:56.068
and how he committed the crime.

253
00:13:56.068 --> 00:14:00.068
But I don't have decisive proof that he is the killer yet.

254
00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:03.268
You can't nab him then!

255
00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:04.568
I'm sure that the proof

256
00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:08.568
is still inside that person's luggage.

257
00:14:08.568 --> 00:14:12.068
But since Yasuji Asama is thought to be the killer,

258
00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:15.168
I can't ask them to show me their bags at this point.

259
00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:18.668
There's one way you can carry that out!

260
00:14:18.668 --> 00:14:22.368
Just let things progress just like in the novel.

261
00:14:23.568 --> 00:14:27.768
What? You saw something strange in front of Asama's room?

262
00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.268
Are you serious?

263
00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.668
Yes.

264
00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:34.168
It was a little before the incident occurred.

265
00:14:34.168 --> 00:14:38.068
I think it was just before the train entered the Seikan Tunnel.

266
00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:40.168
I saw this strange looking long thing

267
00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:42.968
in front of the room of the person called Asama.

268
00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:44.668
A long what?

269
00:14:46.368 --> 00:14:48.768
I forgot.

270
00:14:48.768 --> 00:14:50.668
Now, come on, lady

271
00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:52.568
But please don't worry.

272
00:14:52.568 --> 00:14:56.468
I'm sure I'll remember in time.

273
00:14:56.468 --> 00:14:59.268
Isn't that right? You know who...

274
00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.168
Sapporo, Sapporo.

275
00:15:06.368 --> 00:15:08.368
Listen, Shinichi.

276
00:15:08.368 --> 00:15:10.368
I'll be hanging around,

277
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.268
so don't lose sight of me, okay?

278
00:15:12.268 --> 00:15:14.268
Okay. If he comes close,

279
00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:16.768
I'll put him to sleep with my anesthetic gun.

280
00:15:16.768 --> 00:15:18.968
This is very exciting, isn't it?

281
00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:20.268
Hey, lady.

282
00:15:20.268 --> 00:15:22.868
Conan?

283
00:15:22.868 --> 00:15:25.268
I am counting on you.

284
00:15:27.368 --> 00:15:30.468
Gosh. What are you doing, Conan?

285
00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:31.668
Come, let's go!

286
00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:34.468
I'm sure Natsue and the others are already here to see us.

287
00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:35.968
Huh?

288
00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:39.368
I think I forgot something on the train.

289
00:15:40.268 --> 00:15:42.368
I'll ask the conductor to look for it for me,

290
00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:44.768
so wait for me!

291
00:15:44.768 --> 00:15:45.968
Hey, wait!

292
00:15:48.568 --> 00:15:53.168
Mom...

293
00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:54.768
Oh, there she is!

294
00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:57.868
Gosh. Why are you on the other side?

295
00:15:57.868 --> 00:15:59.968
Why can't she just hang around close by?

296
00:16:02.068 --> 00:16:03.168
Oh, no!

297
00:16:03.168 --> 00:16:04.568
Mom, behind you!

298
00:16:05.668 --> 00:16:06.868
Darn it!

299
00:16:06.868 --> 00:16:10.368
Shinichi, why are you over there?

300
00:16:10.368 --> 00:16:13.568
Weren't you going to protect me?

301
00:16:13.568 --> 00:16:17.168
The train will soon arrive at platform number seven.

302
00:16:17.168 --> 00:16:19.368
Please step behind the white line.

303
00:16:20.868 --> 00:16:25.868
The killer sneaks silently up behind the young detective

304
00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:27.768
and with his blood-stained hands

305
00:16:27.768 --> 00:16:31.068
and lightly pushes the vulnerable back of the detective

306
00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:34.368
and covers the entire platform with blood.

307
00:16:39.168 --> 00:16:41.268
Although the story hasn't end yet,

308
00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:43.768
but I would like to place my pen down here.

309
00:16:43.768 --> 00:16:46.868
It is much too meaningless to continue any further.

310
00:16:47.968 --> 00:16:49.668
Honey, how did you...

311
00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:53.068
I got the details from Inspector Nishimura who arrived a while ago,

312
00:16:53.068 --> 00:16:57.368
confirmed everything and came here.

313
00:16:57.368 --> 00:16:58.868
The one who killed Mr. Izumo,

314
00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:01.568
the owner of the jewelry shop in the train,

315
00:17:01.568 --> 00:17:02.968
and also killed Asama,

316
00:17:02.968 --> 00:17:06.368
framing him up as the one who killed Izumo...

317
00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:08.968
Mr. Kaetsu.

318
00:17:08.968 --> 00:17:10.868
It could only be you.

319
00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:16.368
What a ridiculous thing to say.

320
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:19.768
The man called Asama is the killer!

321
00:17:19.768 --> 00:17:21.468
Witnesses have seen him shoot the owner

322
00:17:21.468 --> 00:17:24.568
and flee from the window, too.

323
00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:26.968
The Asama that the witnesses saw

324
00:17:26.968 --> 00:17:29.468
was most likely you in disguise.

325
00:17:29.468 --> 00:17:33.168
He was a robber on the run to begin with.

326
00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:36.268
There is nothing easier for him

327
00:17:36.268 --> 00:17:38.868
than to hide face and go around.

328
00:17:38.868 --> 00:17:42.768
Then, how are you going to explain him fleeing out of the train?

329
00:17:42.768 --> 00:17:45.468
I was in the train right through!

330
00:17:45.468 --> 00:17:49.068
You just made it look that way.

331
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:54.368
By using that fishing set behind you!

332
00:17:54.368 --> 00:17:58.668
After you hit Asama and killed him in your room beforehand,

333
00:17:58.668 --> 00:18:00.968
you pulled a fishing line through the hole of the belt

334
00:18:00.968 --> 00:18:02.368
behind the corpse's slacks,

335
00:18:02.368 --> 00:18:05.168
and suspended outside from the cracked window.

336
00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:08.768
You pulled both ends of the line to your room

337
00:18:08.768 --> 00:18:11.068
and tied one end of it somewhere

338
00:18:11.068 --> 00:18:13.868
and fastened the other end to the reel and secured it.

339
00:18:13.868 --> 00:18:15.668
With that, everything is prepared.

340
00:18:15.668 --> 00:18:19.068
After killing the owner in the lobby compartment,

341
00:18:19.068 --> 00:18:20.768
you went to Asama's room,

342
00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:22.968
and fired your gun at the window.

343
00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:26.068
You also fired a threatening shot to Mr. Mouri who were watching you.

344
00:18:26.068 --> 00:18:27.568
And while they flinched from your attack,

345
00:18:27.568 --> 00:18:30.168
you hid by the stairs

346
00:18:30.168 --> 00:18:31.368
and cut the end of the fishing line

347
00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:32.668
that wasn't connected to the reel

348
00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:34.468
and rewound it quickly.

349
00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:37.568
Then, Asama's corpse slides down outside the train.

350
00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:40.168
This way, the time when the killer runs into the room

351
00:18:40.168 --> 00:18:43.568
and the time when Asama falls inside the tunnel matches.

352
00:18:43.568 --> 00:18:48.768
Therefore, you get to set Asama up as the killer.

353
00:18:48.768 --> 00:18:52.068
But Detective Mouri saw the door of the room close

354
00:18:52.068 --> 00:18:54.368
at the same time he got to the room!

355
00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:57.468
I am sorry, I forgot to mention that.

356
00:18:57.468 --> 00:19:01.268
There was a key-shaped metal object by the door, wasn't there?

357
00:19:01.268 --> 00:19:04.268
You stuck a vinyl tape with another fishing line tied to it

358
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.868
to the inside of the door,

359
00:19:05.868 --> 00:19:08.268
and hooked that onto the metal object

360
00:19:08.268 --> 00:19:10.068
tying it onto the fishing line that you would be cutting.

361
00:19:10.068 --> 00:19:11.768
So, when you cut the line,

362
00:19:11.768 --> 00:19:14.068
the line that is attached to the door is pulled

363
00:19:14.068 --> 00:19:15.168
from the weight of the corpse.

364
00:19:15.168 --> 00:19:17.268
Although the vinyl tape will peel off,

365
00:19:17.268 --> 00:19:21.068
the door will spring back automatically and close on its own.

366
00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:24.568
As proof of that, there seems to have been vinyl tape

367
00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:27.168
stuck onto the belt hole that was holding the corpse.

368
00:19:27.168 --> 00:19:30.568
But I am not the only one who could've used that trick.

369
00:19:30.568 --> 00:19:32.668
Huh?

370
00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:36.968
That bad man's clothes is in your bag!

371
00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.668
Oh, there are sunglasses and a hat in here, too.

372
00:19:39.668 --> 00:19:40.868
I wonder why?

373
00:19:40.868 --> 00:19:42.868
Sonny.

374
00:19:42.868 --> 00:19:45.168
I am sorry, Mr. Kaetsu.

375
00:19:45.168 --> 00:19:47.768
But the greatest weak point of this trick

376
00:19:47.768 --> 00:19:49.368
is that you cannot get rid of the clothes

377
00:19:49.368 --> 00:19:50.968
that was used to disguise yourself.

378
00:19:50.968 --> 00:19:52.868
If your bags are checked,

379
00:19:52.868 --> 00:19:55.868
there is no way you can get away.

380
00:19:58.268 --> 00:20:01.168
I guess I was trying to get the frosting and the cake

381
00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:03.368
making everything turn out like in the novel.

382
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.068
I thought it would go well

383
00:20:05.068 --> 00:20:09.368
because it was unpublished work of my favorite novelist.

384
00:20:09.368 --> 00:20:12.868
This is just what I think,

385
00:20:12.868 --> 00:20:15.168
but your motive is probably to avenge

386
00:20:15.168 --> 00:20:16.568
the death of your comrade woman robber,

387
00:20:16.568 --> 00:20:20.768
who died of drugs, isn't it?

388
00:20:20.768 --> 00:20:22.468
Your targets were Mr. Izumo,

389
00:20:22.468 --> 00:20:24.468
who was pushing drugs behind the scene,

390
00:20:24.468 --> 00:20:26.668
and Yasuji Asama, the boss of the group of robbers

391
00:20:26.668 --> 00:20:30.568
who got the woman hooked on drugs.

392
00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:32.768
And you happened to realize

393
00:20:32.768 --> 00:20:34.068
that the novel you got a hold of in the past

394
00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:36.868
was so much like the predicament that you were in

395
00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:41.868
that you decided to carry out your murder plan.

396
00:20:41.868 --> 00:20:44.068
Who on earth are you?

397
00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:46.068
Excuse me for not introducing myself.

398
00:20:46.068 --> 00:20:48.068
I am Yusaku Kudo,

399
00:20:48.068 --> 00:20:51.068
the author of that novel.

400
00:20:52.568 --> 00:20:53.868
No way...

401
00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:55.768
If...

402
00:20:55.768 --> 00:21:01.168
If you felt in any way moved by my novel,

403
00:21:01.168 --> 00:21:03.868
l'll recommend you to turn yourself in.

404
00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:06.268
Because the killer in that novel in the end

405
00:21:06.268 --> 00:21:07.968
was scheduled to turn himself into the police

406
00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:11.168
after regretting all that he did.

407
00:21:12.168 --> 00:21:13.568
Yes.

408
00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:49.768
"New Chitose Airport" -Oh, my. Shinichi!

409
00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:52.068
You've come out of your way to see us off?

410
00:22:52.068 --> 00:22:55.368
No. I came to give Dad a piece of my mind!

411
00:22:55.368 --> 00:22:59.368
I just wanted to let you know that I solved all your tricks!

412
00:23:00.568 --> 00:23:01.568
That's right!

413
00:23:01.568 --> 00:23:03.368
What a predicament to have your own son see through your tricks!

414
00:23:03.368 --> 00:23:05.068
Maybe you should give up your name

415
00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:07.268
as the world's greatest novelist already?

416
00:23:07.268 --> 00:23:08.968
Oh, I am sorry.

417
00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:10.568
I made all that up!

418
00:23:10.568 --> 00:23:12.068
I set a trap up to deceived the readers!

419
00:23:12.068 --> 00:23:14.468
-What? -The manuscript was only halfway through,

420
00:23:14.468 --> 00:23:17.068
so he must've mistakenly used it.

421
00:23:17.068 --> 00:23:18.668
I am sure I worked the trick out

422
00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:22.168
so that the outfit used for disguise also disappears.

423
00:23:22.168 --> 00:23:24.668
I sure hope you're not lying to me.

424
00:23:24.668 --> 00:23:26.668
But I sure sense fate,

425
00:23:26.668 --> 00:23:30.768
for you to come and save me just in the nick of time.

426
00:23:30.768 --> 00:23:32.868
In the nick of time?

427
00:23:32.868 --> 00:23:33.968
I was there near you from about two minutes

428
00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:36.068
before everything happened.

429
00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:37.968
Huh? Then what?

430
00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:39.968
You mean you waited doing something

431
00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:41.768
until I was almost pushed?

432
00:23:41.768 --> 00:23:46.168
Yes. I wanted to be sure that he was the killer.

433
00:23:46.168 --> 00:23:50.768
Besides, the stage of the novel was the Seikan Tunnel.

434
00:23:50.768 --> 00:23:53.868
So, I silently watch over you.

435
00:23:57.568 --> 00:23:59.268
He gives me the shivers.

436
00:23:59.268 --> 00:24:02.168
It is Hokkaido, after all.

437
00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:20.168
"Next Episode"

438
00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:22.068
I wonder if it is natural to attack somebody

439
00:24:22.068 --> 00:24:24.068
who is on the phone?

440
00:24:24.068 --> 00:24:27.468
Could it be that the one who set this crime up is...

441
00:24:27.468 --> 00:24:33.389
Next Conan, "Detective Love Story (Part 1)"

442
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.570
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.570
"Aero-bike"

444
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.470
-The next episode... -Starts in police headquarters.

445
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.970
Who?
