00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.570
"Sho Amamiya & Masaki"

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.770
Now way. What should we do now?

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.770
I'm thinking.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.270
Will you shut up?

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.870
Hello!

6
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.570
Is anybody home?

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.570
Please hurry! I'm going to leak!

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.270
Hang in there, Genta.

9
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.770
Just a little longer.

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.970
Somebody!

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.270
What? It's open.

12
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.570
All right!

13
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.570
I'm coming in!

14
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.370
-Genta! -Restroom...

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.370
Fantastic!

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670
There are so many toys!

17
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
This is indeed a museum of toys.

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.370
Where is it?

19
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.370
Hey, there's someone here!

20
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.870
Please let me use your restroom.

21
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.870
Sure. We'd be more than glad to.

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.570
A canvas stained black with crime.

23
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color.

24
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.070
A toy mansion that everyone dreamed of.

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.270
But something is wrong here.

26
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.970
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.470
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:13.727
"The Detective Squad Takes Shelter From The Rain"

30
00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:18.827
Look! Isn't that Gomera?

31
00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.827
It's really huge!

32
00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.527
Bro, why'd you let them in?

33
00:03:25.527 --> 00:03:27.027
I couldn't help it!

34
00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:28.827
Let's hurry and let him use the restroom

35
00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:30.627
and get them out of here.

36
00:03:33.227 --> 00:03:34.727
Hey.

37
00:03:34.727 --> 00:03:36.227
Isn't that the restroom?

38
00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:37.527
Really?

39
00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:47.627
This is not the restroom.

40
00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.227
Sir, your name is Mr. Masaki Amamiya, isn't it?

41
00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:51.327
What?

42
00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:53.627
It was written on the name plate.

43
00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:56.927
And he's your big brother Sho, right?

44
00:03:56.927 --> 00:03:58.827
After all, you call him Bro.

45
00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:01.627
Right, that's right!

46
00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:03.927
I'm his big brother, Sho Amamiya.

47
00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:07.127
And I'm his little brother, Masaki Amamiya.

48
00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:09.327
Only the two of you live here together?

49
00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:11.227
Yeah! We're brothers that love toys

50
00:04:11.227 --> 00:04:13.927
and we get along really well together.

51
00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:16.927
Toys are great!

52
00:04:16.927 --> 00:04:19.627
Forget that. I'm looking for the restroom.

53
00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:20.927
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:24.127
Over here.

55
00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:26.627
Idiot! That's the bathroom!

56
00:04:28.027 --> 00:04:29.527
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:31.527
We just moved here, you see.

58
00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:34.127
Where is the restroom?

59
00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:37.327
That's why you're both wearing gloves.

60
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:39.427
Sorry to intrude on you while you're moving.

61
00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:40.527
Yeah.

62
00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:42.627
Well...

63
00:04:43.527 --> 00:04:45.927
I found it! The restroom is over here!

64
00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.027
Thanks!

65
00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:57.227
What a relief!

66
00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:58.927
Hey, since we're already here,

67
00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:01.327
why don't we ask them if we can stay here until the rain stop?

68
00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:04.027
Sounds good. Maybe we can help them move...

69
00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:05.927
No!

70
00:05:05.927 --> 00:05:07.227
Let's go already.

71
00:05:07.227 --> 00:05:08.827
What?

72
00:05:08.827 --> 00:05:11.927
Doc will worry if we don't get back soon, right?

73
00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:14.427
-Now, let's go. -Okay...

74
00:05:15.727 --> 00:05:17.427
We're sorry to have intruded on you!

75
00:05:18.627 --> 00:05:20.027
Be careful on your way home.

76
00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:25.027
Someone help!

77
00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:30.627
Darn it. That woman got up!

78
00:05:30.627 --> 00:05:33.127
This isn't good. Guys, hurry!

79
00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:34.427
Stay there!

80
00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:38.827
What is going on?

81
00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:42.927
You're not getting away.

82
00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:46.527
Run! They're robbers!

83
00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:48.127
What?

84
00:05:52.127 --> 00:05:55.427
Shoots. My shoes and tranquilizer gun are all being repaired.

85
00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:00.927
Darn it.

86
00:06:03.327 --> 00:06:05.027
Forget it already, bro.

87
00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:07.127
Let's just leave the brats and split.

88
00:06:07.127 --> 00:06:11.227
Idiot! The gold plates are somewhere in this house for sure!

89
00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:14.527
We haven't seen the treasure yet, so how can we leave?

90
00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:15.527
Let's go!

91
00:06:16.427 --> 00:06:18.527
Okay.

92
00:06:18.527 --> 00:06:21.427
The initials on the matching sweatshirts were K and M?

93
00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:23.327
Yeah. Also...

94
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:25.327
there was a woman's one-piece dress.

95
00:06:25.327 --> 00:06:27.927
The names of the real residents of this house

96
00:06:27.927 --> 00:06:31.527
is most likely a man named Kakeru and a woman named Maki.

97
00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:33.627
Then the scream we just heard was...

98
00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:37.127
Let me go!

99
00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:38.327
-Genta! -Genta!

100
00:06:38.327 --> 00:06:40.527
Gosh! Isn't there something we can use?

101
00:06:41.827 --> 00:06:43.627
I said, let me go!

102
00:06:43.627 --> 00:06:44.927
Get down, Genta!

103
00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:54.127
-We did it! -We did it!

104
00:06:54.127 --> 00:06:56.727
-Genta, hurry! -Okay!

105
00:06:56.727 --> 00:06:58.327
Please, help me!

106
00:06:59.427 --> 00:07:01.027
Over here!

107
00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:05.127
There she is!

108
00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:06.327
Are you all right?

109
00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:07.727
Yes.

110
00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:09.927
I was just passed out.

111
00:07:09.927 --> 00:07:12.027
You're Mrs. Maki Amamiya, right?

112
00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:13.627
Who are you?

113
00:07:15.427 --> 00:07:16.927
Don't tell me only you children are here?

114
00:07:16.927 --> 00:07:18.827
We're not ordinary children.

115
00:07:18.827 --> 00:07:20.727
We're members of the Detective Squad!

116
00:07:20.727 --> 00:07:22.727
-What? -Oh, no! Here they come!

117
00:07:26.327 --> 00:07:27.527
Gosh!

118
00:07:27.527 --> 00:07:29.027
They got away because you're a slow poke!

119
00:07:29.027 --> 00:07:30.727
What are you doing, idiot?

120
00:07:34.427 --> 00:07:37.527
Hurry and look for them!

121
00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:39.827
I know.

122
00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:49.427
Gosh, where are they hiding?

123
00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:53.627
This sure is some house, though.

124
00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:56.027
I know, it's full of toys.

125
00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:59.927
My husband is a grown up child, you see.

126
00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:01.927
He's a toy collector.

127
00:08:01.927 --> 00:08:04.227
Where's your husband now?

128
00:08:04.227 --> 00:08:06.927
I don't know. He was supposed to be at home, though.

129
00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:09.027
I was taking a shower, you see.

130
00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:11.227
Wait a minute. Is there a phone here?

131
00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:15.427
Those two said they cut the phone line.

132
00:08:15.427 --> 00:08:17.827
They took my cell phone, too.

133
00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:21.827
We left our cell phones at the camping site, too.

134
00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:24.927
Which means we can't contact outside.

135
00:08:24.927 --> 00:08:26.527
But it's strange.

136
00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:30.727
Around this time, the police usually come to patrol the area.

137
00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:32.927
Well, the downpour today is really heavy.

138
00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:35.327
So maybe they're running late,

139
00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:38.627
or working on a landslide somewhere else.

140
00:08:38.627 --> 00:08:39.627
No way!

141
00:08:40.427 --> 00:08:41.827
I heard a voice coming from that side!

142
00:08:51.527 --> 00:08:53.427
Isn't there something that could serve as a weapon?

143
00:09:03.827 --> 00:09:05.727
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:08.327
I got you and the others involved.

145
00:09:08.327 --> 00:09:10.227
It's not your fault, Maki.

146
00:09:12.327 --> 00:09:13.827
What should we do with them, Bro?

147
00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:15.727
What else?

148
00:09:17.727 --> 00:09:19.627
We'll tie them up and...

149
00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:20.827
Hold it!

150
00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:26.027
No way.

151
00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:27.927
Idiot! It's only a toy!

152
00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:30.127
Originally yes.

153
00:09:30.127 --> 00:09:34.127
But it's my husband's hobby to remodel things like these.

154
00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:37.927
Would you like me to try it?

155
00:09:40.727 --> 00:09:41.827
Now!

156
00:09:44.227 --> 00:09:45.927
She's shooting me!

157
00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:48.427
-Are you guys okay? -Yes!

158
00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:51.527
She shot me in the chest! I'm going to die!

159
00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:54.027
Idiot! Don't die on me!

160
00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.427
You're not even bleeding!

161
00:09:57.427 --> 00:09:58.427
What?

162
00:10:01.127 --> 00:10:02.327
Darn it!

163
00:10:02.327 --> 00:10:04.227
Sorry, Bro.

164
00:10:05.327 --> 00:10:07.527
How dare those guys deceive us?

165
00:10:07.527 --> 00:10:09.127
Stop!

166
00:10:10.227 --> 00:10:11.527
Hurry!

167
00:10:33.627 --> 00:10:35.627
I'm going to kill those guys!

168
00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:44.627
This way! This way!

169
00:10:54.727 --> 00:10:55.727
You're not getting away!

170
00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:11.527
How dare you?

171
00:11:21.927 --> 00:11:23.827
Gosh! What's this?

172
00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:27.527
It's super adhesive glue that's used to make plastic models.

173
00:11:27.527 --> 00:11:29.127
Now, Genta!

174
00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:37.027
Help!

175
00:11:43.527 --> 00:11:47.427
All right. The stairs are scattered with the balls that they threw.

176
00:11:52.627 --> 00:11:55.027
Those brats!

177
00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:56.927
It's too dangerous, Bro!

178
00:11:56.927 --> 00:11:59.327
Shut up! You must come, too!

179
00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:04.727
Bro! Behind you!

180
00:12:06.527 --> 00:12:07.927
No way!

181
00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:13.827
Bro!

182
00:12:27.727 --> 00:12:29.227
Now is our chance! Hurry!

183
00:12:29.227 --> 00:12:30.527
Okay!

184
00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:37.227
That is...

185
00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:38.227
That can't be...

186
00:12:39.227 --> 00:12:40.327
Conan?

187
00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:41.827
You guys leave without me!

188
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:50.927
This is...

189
00:12:52.627 --> 00:12:54.027
Kakeru?

190
00:12:55.227 --> 00:12:57.427
Don't tell me those guys did this?

191
00:13:12.694 --> 00:13:14.494
Maybe...

192
00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.994
we're going to end up like him.

193
00:13:17.994 --> 00:13:19.994
It all depends on you guys.

194
00:13:19.994 --> 00:13:21.194
Right?

195
00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:31.294
Someone called "God" online said

196
00:13:31.294 --> 00:13:34.694
that there are a lot of gold plates in this house.

197
00:13:34.694 --> 00:13:35.694
"God?"

198
00:13:35.694 --> 00:13:38.494
Don't tell me you robbed this house because God told you to?

199
00:13:38.494 --> 00:13:40.894
Are you guys out of your minds?

200
00:13:40.894 --> 00:13:42.494
Watch your mouth!

201
00:13:44.694 --> 00:13:46.494
Where are the gold bars?

202
00:13:46.494 --> 00:13:48.394
Hurry and spit it out or I'll kill you!

203
00:13:52.794 --> 00:13:54.994
All right. Found it.

204
00:13:54.994 --> 00:13:57.494
Now we can pay off all our debts, right?

205
00:13:57.494 --> 00:13:59.394
Of course.

206
00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:04.094
We can say goodbye to the debt collectors.

207
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:07.694
But won't the police be coming after us?

208
00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:10.094
Compared to the collectors, the police are way better.

209
00:14:10.094 --> 00:14:14.194
Besides, if we shut that lady and those kids up,

210
00:14:14.194 --> 00:14:16.894
the police won't ever get to us.

211
00:14:16.894 --> 00:14:18.894
There are quite a lot in here.

212
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:20.394
This is nice.

213
00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:22.594
Yeah, it'll probably work.

214
00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:26.094
How about this, Conan?

215
00:14:26.094 --> 00:14:27.794
Yeah, not bad.

216
00:14:27.794 --> 00:14:29.794
You look more handsome than you usually do.

217
00:14:29.794 --> 00:14:31.394
What?

218
00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:33.294
I'm only joking.

219
00:14:34.694 --> 00:14:35.994
Why?

220
00:14:35.994 --> 00:14:38.394
How can everyone be so carefree at times like this?

221
00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:41.194
That's because Conan is with us.

222
00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:42.294
He always overcomes every desperate situation,

223
00:14:42.294 --> 00:14:44.294
no matter how bad it is.

224
00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:51.394
Hey, Bro.

225
00:14:51.394 --> 00:14:53.694
Are you serious about killing off the kids, too?

226
00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:55.694
Maybe we should ask "God" first.

227
00:14:56.794 --> 00:14:58.994
It's already too late.

228
00:14:58.994 --> 00:15:00.494
They've seen our faces.

229
00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:02.194
So we have no choice but to kill them.

230
00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:16.294
Monster!

231
00:15:16.294 --> 00:15:18.994
Don't run! Hurry and get them, idiot!

232
00:15:19.894 --> 00:15:20.994
Shut up!

233
00:15:20.994 --> 00:15:23.094
You've done nothing but order me around!

234
00:15:23.094 --> 00:15:25.394
I'm tired of it!

235
00:15:26.494 --> 00:15:29.594
What did you say, you idiot?

236
00:15:35.094 --> 00:15:36.394
We did it!

237
00:15:39.194 --> 00:15:40.594
Guys, let's get out of here!

238
00:15:48.194 --> 00:15:50.394
What the...

239
00:15:50.394 --> 00:15:52.494
You tricked me.

240
00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.094
You brats!

241
00:15:58.794 --> 00:15:59.994
Ayumi!

242
00:16:02.994 --> 00:16:03.994
Ayumi!

243
00:16:12.194 --> 00:16:13.494
Ayumi!

244
00:16:13.494 --> 00:16:15.894
Genta!

245
00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:16.994
Conan!

246
00:16:22.394 --> 00:16:25.594
I won't let you get away anymore, you brats.

247
00:16:36.694 --> 00:16:39.294
These guys stink.

248
00:16:39.294 --> 00:16:42.094
We couldn't take a bath for a long time.

249
00:16:42.094 --> 00:16:43.594
Poor thing.

250
00:16:43.594 --> 00:16:45.394
You must've had it tough.

251
00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:47.194
You're right.

252
00:16:49.994 --> 00:16:53.294
Everybody! The police will be arriving soon, too!

253
00:16:54.694 --> 00:16:56.594
Hey, wait a minute!

254
00:16:56.594 --> 00:16:58.994
We didn't kill anybody, you know.

255
00:16:58.994 --> 00:17:01.194
It's too late for excuses!

256
00:17:01.194 --> 00:17:02.694
We're not lying!

257
00:17:02.694 --> 00:17:06.594
We pretended to kill him, just to scare you guys.

258
00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:08.394
You can't fool us anymore!

259
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.494
What? Where's that boy?

260
00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:12.594
-What? -Conan?

261
00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:14.894
He was just here until a minute ago.

262
00:17:14.894 --> 00:17:16.594
I wonder where he went?

263
00:17:22.294 --> 00:17:23.794
What are you doing?

264
00:17:29.194 --> 00:17:31.794
What are you doing, Conan?

265
00:17:37.494 --> 00:17:39.294
So...

266
00:17:39.294 --> 00:17:43.594
you're the one who killed your husband after all, Maki.

267
00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:48.994
Rather, the one who planned this crime,

268
00:17:48.994 --> 00:17:51.194
and the mastermind of the robbery,

269
00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:52.594
"God".

270
00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:55.594
Where's all this coming from?

271
00:17:55.594 --> 00:17:57.894
Those words rang a bell in me.

272
00:17:57.894 --> 00:18:01.394
Those two guys... They don't look religious at all,

273
00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:03.094
and yet they're using the word "God."

274
00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:05.794
Someone called "God" online said

275
00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:08.994
that there are a lot of gold plates in this house.

276
00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:11.394
Hey, Bro.

277
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:13.594
Are you serious about killing off the kids, too?

278
00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.794
Maybe we should ask "God" first.

279
00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.294
But if the God that they're referring to

280
00:18:18.294 --> 00:18:21.894
is the handle name of the one who planned this crime,

281
00:18:21.894 --> 00:18:25.894
an alias used online, then everything falls into place.

282
00:18:25.894 --> 00:18:29.694
There is a mastermind called "God" manipulating those two.

283
00:18:29.694 --> 00:18:33.594
And if you rearrange the romanized spelling of the letters "KAMI",

284
00:18:33.594 --> 00:18:35.594
that's right, you'll get "MAKI".

285
00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:39.094
Which is your name, Maki.

286
00:18:39.094 --> 00:18:40.494
Anagram.

287
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:43.594
Rearranging your name letters, when creating a handle name,

288
00:18:43.594 --> 00:18:45.994
is a method that is often used.

289
00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:48.494
That's just a far-fetched argument.

290
00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:49.594
Yes.

291
00:18:50.394 --> 00:18:56.394
But you're the only one who could've killed your husband, Maki.

292
00:18:57.494 --> 00:18:58.894
What do you mean by that?

293
00:18:59.594 --> 00:19:04.094
Your husband seems to have lost a lot of blood, right?

294
00:19:04.094 --> 00:19:05.394
From what I saw,

295
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:08.594
the killer must've gotten a lot of blood splattered on them, too.

296
00:19:08.594 --> 00:19:14.194
Enough blood that they had to take a shower to get it all off.

297
00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:18.194
However, no blood were seen on those two guys.

298
00:19:18.194 --> 00:19:20.894
Then those two probably took a shower and...

299
00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:26.294
That's right. Those guys haven't taken a bath recently.

300
00:19:26.294 --> 00:19:30.294
Of course, they didn't take a shower in the bathroom here, either.

301
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.194
They even mistook the shower room for the restroom.

302
00:19:33.194 --> 00:19:37.094
They probably didn't even know where the restroom was.

303
00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:41.094
In other words, there's only one person who took a shower here.

304
00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:44.294
That... That won't serve as evidence.

305
00:19:44.294 --> 00:19:46.494
Splattered blood not only goes on your body,

306
00:19:46.494 --> 00:19:49.794
but a lot of residue is found on your clothes, too.

307
00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:51.694
I thought something was strange

308
00:19:51.694 --> 00:19:54.594
because this one-piece dress was quite damp.

309
00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:58.794
You hurriedly washed the blood off it, right?

310
00:19:58.794 --> 00:20:00.294
I think you already know,

311
00:20:00.294 --> 00:20:02.894
but no matter how much you wash something, a blood test will...

312
00:20:02.894 --> 00:20:04.194
Enough already.

313
00:20:05.294 --> 00:20:08.994
You're right. I killed my husband.

314
00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:10.994
I killed that freak who kept turning the wealth

315
00:20:10.994 --> 00:20:14.394
that was supposed to be inherited by me to those stupid toys!

316
00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:23.294
All there is left to do was for those two to come at the instructed time,

317
00:20:23.294 --> 00:20:26.494
unaware of anything and rob this house.

318
00:20:26.494 --> 00:20:29.194
I planned on framing them for the crime

319
00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:32.194
after telling them where the fake golden bars were.

320
00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.294
While they were taking their time getting the job done,

321
00:20:34.294 --> 00:20:37.394
I was going to get them arrested by the police who comes patrolling.

322
00:20:37.394 --> 00:20:38.794
This way, I would be a pitiful victim

323
00:20:38.794 --> 00:20:41.094
whose husband was killed by robbers.

324
00:20:41.094 --> 00:20:43.594
Anybody would think so, right?

325
00:20:45.594 --> 00:20:47.794
Though thanks to the rain,

326
00:20:47.794 --> 00:20:51.294
the circumstances have change.

327
00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:52.894
But it doesn't matter.

328
00:20:55.894 --> 00:20:59.094
You're going to be gotten rid off, too,

329
00:20:59.094 --> 00:21:00.894
by those robbers!

330
00:21:03.994 --> 00:21:05.494
Hey, Conan.

331
00:21:05.494 --> 00:21:06.694
Conan?

332
00:21:06.694 --> 00:21:09.094
-Run, you guys! -What?

333
00:21:10.794 --> 00:21:12.994
-Maki? -What's going on?

334
00:21:12.994 --> 00:21:15.194
Either way, Conan is in trouble!

335
00:21:26.294 --> 00:21:28.394
Idiots! Run away!

336
00:21:32.394 --> 00:21:34.694
I'll start by getting rid of you guys first!

337
00:21:36.794 --> 00:21:38.394
Darn it! Bummers!

338
00:21:43.994 --> 00:21:45.194
All right.

339
00:21:47.094 --> 00:21:48.894
Go!

340
00:21:51.494 --> 00:21:52.894
Get out of the way!

341
00:23:32.794 --> 00:23:35.694
I don't want to look at toys for awhile.

342
00:23:35.694 --> 00:23:38.594
-Me neither. -True.

343
00:23:38.594 --> 00:23:41.694
Kids! You guys did a good job this time, too.

344
00:23:41.694 --> 00:23:42.694
What do you say?

345
00:23:42.694 --> 00:23:45.194
It's not so often, but I'll get you some toys as a reward.

346
00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:48.594
What?

347
00:23:49.994 --> 00:23:51.794
I don't think they want any.

348
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:57.594
"Next Episode" -Ryuji Kimijima, age 48.

349
00:23:57.594 --> 00:23:59.094
He is the 2nd generation president

350
00:23:59.094 --> 00:24:00.694
of a food manufacturing company.

351
00:24:01.494 --> 00:24:04.694
Why did you have to die and leave me behind?

352
00:24:05.294 --> 00:24:07.194
What do you mean?

353
00:24:07.194 --> 00:24:10.094
Ryuji can't swim at all.

354
00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:11.694
This is unmistakably a mur...

355
00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:15.294
Mr. Mouri?

356
00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:17.694
There's another person, isn't there?

357
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:24.294
Next Conan, "The Turn Over Case of Shioiri Park"

358
00:24:24.437 --> 00:24:27.037
Next Conan's Hint:

359
00:24:27.037 --> 00:24:29.237
"The rise and fall of the tides"

360
00:24:29.237 --> 00:24:30.937
Officer Takagi, give us a reward!

361
00:24:30.937 --> 00:24:32.537
-No more toys! -We want eel over rice!

362
00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.237
They're toying with him.
