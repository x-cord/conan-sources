1
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.366
A mysterious case begins with what seemingly looks

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:09.466
to be a simple request through the website of the Detective Agency.

3
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.066
Don't tell me that...

4
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.166
What?

5
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.066
The man who confined Ms. Kei Kashizuka,

6
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.666
who had come to the detective agency to talk about her request,

7
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:31.466
committed suicide right before her eyes.

8
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:36.566
We give Kei a lift home after she finishes going through interrogation,

9
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.966
and find many wiretaps set up there.

10
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:43.866
While everyone continues looking for wiretaps,

11
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.566
I left the condo together with Kei

12
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.766
who said that she was going out shopping,

13
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.966
was given juice laced with a sleeping drug,

14
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.066
and put to sleep!

15
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.166
Ran, who finds out about this, contacts Doc

16
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.266
and decides to have him come after me using the pursuit glasses.

17
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.666
However, since Doc's Beetle was out for repair,

18
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.166
they decide to pursue me together with Subaru Okiya,

19
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.966
who just happened to be there on his car.

20
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.666
Masumi, who also hears of this,

21
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.666
decides to join Ran and the others but...

22
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:27.766
Welcome.

23
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.266
Fill it up, regular.

24
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.266
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:50.366
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to use the restroom.

26
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:51.966
Sure.

27
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.966
Go into the station and it's to the right beyond.

28
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.466
Thank you.

29
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.066
The vivid colored memories of summer

30
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.066
solve mysteries all season round.

31
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.866
Conan Edogawa is kidnapped.

32
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.166
The culprit is surprised at his detailed deduction.

33
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.766
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.866
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:24.366
His name is Detective Conan.

36
00:04:11.224 --> 00:04:16.824
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Deduction)"

37
00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.624
They've started moving again.

38
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:21.924
This time they're going south along Ooishi Highway

39
00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.924
and headed in the direction of Toriyacho.

40
00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:25.324
Roger.

41
00:04:25.324 --> 00:04:27.724
I don't think we'll be able to catch up with them for a while yet.

42
00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:32.024
But, I wonder where the culprit is headed for?

43
00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:35.124
It kind of looks like she's driving around lost.

44
00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:38.624
Maybe she's actually lost.

45
00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:40.824
Not being able to find

46
00:04:40.824 --> 00:04:44.524
the blood smeared destination that she's searching for.

47
00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:50.124
Darn!

48
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:52.824
The computer is locked.

49
00:04:52.824 --> 00:04:55.424
You can't open it unless you have the password.

50
00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:57.324
Seriously.

51
00:04:57.324 --> 00:05:00.024
Why would anyone do something so humbug like this?

52
00:05:00.024 --> 00:05:02.324
Then, maybe we should try something

53
00:05:02.324 --> 00:05:04.324
that would rhyme with Kei Kashizuka.

54
00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.724
Well...

55
00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:10.624
How do you two handle your passwords?

56
00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:12.324
My birthday...

57
00:05:12.324 --> 00:05:15.824
As for me... (it's Kogoro-san in figures-5563)

58
00:05:15.824 --> 00:05:18.624
No... I mean when it's a very long password

59
00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:21.624
that is hard to remember.

60
00:05:22.724 --> 00:05:25.024
I key it in to the memo pad of my cell phone.

61
00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.624
I would write it on a piece of paper

62
00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:30.824
and put it in a place like this, that no one would see.

63
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:35.724
I found it! I got the password!

64
00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:37.524
Fantastic, Dad.

65
00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:39.624
Just as would be expected of you!

66
00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:43.224
The number you have called is switched off

67
00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:46.724
or out of service range.

68
00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:48.424
What's going on?

69
00:05:48.424 --> 00:05:50.324
Why aren't any of the three answering?

70
00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:53.524
Would you like me to find her?

71
00:05:53.524 --> 00:05:55.924
The woman that you're looking for.

72
00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:59.224
Kid? How come?

73
00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:03.324
Oh, I didn't drink the juice with a sleeping drug in it

74
00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:04.724
that you bought for me

75
00:06:04.724 --> 00:06:08.524
because I spilled half of it under the seat.

76
00:06:08.524 --> 00:06:10.424
I did that because when I opened the cap,

77
00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:12.624
it didn't have the sound that cap's have when the bottle is newly opened.

78
00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:15.224
That's because you opened it once,

79
00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:18.024
and put something inside the bottle, right?

80
00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:21.824
At any rate, if you want to look for the people you're after,

81
00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:25.324
we should go meet them in person!

82
00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:27.824
The three people you were calling on the phone just now,

83
00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:30.624
are registered on the internet,

84
00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.824
so we can find their address right away.

85
00:06:32.824 --> 00:06:35.624
You want to kill the woman, don't you?

86
00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:37.824
Serina Urakawa.

87
00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:39.924
Why do you know my name?

88
00:06:39.924 --> 00:06:42.124
I found out through the scratched up cell phone

89
00:06:42.124 --> 00:06:45.324
that you're holding right now!

90
00:06:45.324 --> 00:06:47.424
There wouldn't be so many scratches on it

91
00:06:47.424 --> 00:06:50.224
unless you handle it roughly on a daily basis

92
00:06:50.224 --> 00:06:53.724
or carry it around in your pocket with other hard things.

93
00:06:53.724 --> 00:06:57.424
In the pocket of the coat that you covered me with just a while ago,

94
00:06:57.424 --> 00:06:59.624
there were only that cell phone, a wallet,

95
00:06:59.624 --> 00:07:02.524
and the case for sleeping pills.

96
00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:05.924
There were no scratches on the wallet or the case.

97
00:07:05.924 --> 00:07:08.124
Which means that's actually the cell phone

98
00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:11.124
that belonged to the man who was found dead

99
00:07:11.124 --> 00:07:13.124
in the restroom of the detective agency,

100
00:07:13.124 --> 00:07:14.224
and you switched it with the cell phone

101
00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:16.824
that you brought along with you, right?

102
00:07:16.824 --> 00:07:20.524
That man had a lot of loose change in his pocket,

103
00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:22.424
and though the lighter and the wallet he had inside together

104
00:07:22.424 --> 00:07:24.024
were all scratched up,

105
00:07:24.024 --> 00:07:26.324
there were no scratches on the cell phone.

106
00:07:26.324 --> 00:07:28.124
The stun gun was inside too,

107
00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:30.624
but there were no scratches on it either.

108
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:33.224
You brought that along with you too, didn't you?

109
00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:36.824
Don't be silly. You saw too, didn't you, kid?

110
00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:39.924
That I was tied up with masking tape.

111
00:07:39.924 --> 00:07:42.524
How could I ever switch my own cell phone

112
00:07:42.524 --> 00:07:46.324
for the one of the man who was threatening me with his gun?

113
00:07:46.324 --> 00:07:50.224
It's easy to tie yourself up with masking tape!

114
00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:52.724
After pulling out the tape,

115
00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:55.524
you hook the hole in the middle of the roll of masking tape

116
00:07:55.524 --> 00:07:57.524
onto the doorknob of the restroom.

117
00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:02.824
And after pulling it taut you wrap yourself around with the tape.

118
00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:05.624
The masking tape was wrapped onto you from your elbow up.

119
00:08:05.624 --> 00:08:07.524
So you could use both hands.

120
00:08:07.524 --> 00:08:09.024
After cutting the tape,

121
00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:11.224
you could remove the tape from the doorknob.

122
00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.524
If you use your mouth,

123
00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:14.724
you could wrap the tape around your wrists too.

124
00:08:14.724 --> 00:08:16.324
Then are you saying

125
00:08:16.324 --> 00:08:21.024
that I shot that man to death?

126
00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:23.224
The light turned green.

127
00:08:28.724 --> 00:08:31.924
I think it's too difficult for you to understand, kid.

128
00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:34.724
But on the hands and sleeves of the person who fires a gun.

129
00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:37.024
There is gun residue.

130
00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:42.124
When a gun is fired, lead, tin, antimony, barium,

131
00:08:42.124 --> 00:08:46.124
and nitrite scatter in all directions and they stick on to the clothes

132
00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:49.224
and body of the one who fired the gun.

133
00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:51.424
You probably made the man that you attacked with the stun gun

134
00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:54.224
hold the gun in his hand, put the gun barrel in his mouth

135
00:08:54.224 --> 00:08:56.624
and made him sit on the toilet seat.

136
00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:59.924
Then you unlaced the shoelace of your boot,

137
00:08:59.924 --> 00:09:03.824
and pulled in through the trigger from the backside of the man's hand,

138
00:09:03.824 --> 00:09:07.524
then you pulled the shoelace through the inside

139
00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:10.624
of the toilet seat to the outside and let it hang down.

140
00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:13.424
After that you covered your head with a towel

141
00:09:13.424 --> 00:09:16.224
to avoid getting gun residue on you.

142
00:09:16.224 --> 00:09:18.624
Then, you wet one end of the other towel

143
00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.024
and placed it below the grip

144
00:09:20.024 --> 00:09:22.424
so that the gun wouldn't slip.

145
00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:24.624
Next all you had to do was,

146
00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:26.124
cover the shoelace that is hanging out of the toilet seat,

147
00:09:26.124 --> 00:09:28.524
and you're all set.

148
00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:31.724
After sending mail to Detective Mouri

149
00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:34.524
telling him to virtually keep out of the restroom,

150
00:09:34.524 --> 00:09:37.324
you held your boots down with your knees while pulling the shoelace.

151
00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:38.924
The gun would be fired,

152
00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:42.324
and by the impact, the man would lurch backwards towards the wall.

153
00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:45.824
If you remove the shoelace and towel before we ran into the restroom

154
00:09:45.824 --> 00:09:48.624
after hearing the gun shot,

155
00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:51.024
it would look like the man who brought you into the restroom,

156
00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:55.124
was cornered and shot himself to death.

157
00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:57.124
As proof of this,

158
00:09:57.124 --> 00:10:00.324
when Amuro asked you about the cause of your older brother's death,

159
00:10:00.324 --> 00:10:03.224
you didn't answer right away, right?

160
00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:07.024
By the way, how did your older brother pass away?

161
00:10:08.224 --> 00:10:10.524
What was the cause of your brother's death?

162
00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:12.424
Yes.

163
00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:15.724
That's because your right eardrum is damaged,

164
00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:17.624
and you can't hear clearly

165
00:10:17.624 --> 00:10:19.624
when talked at from the right side.

166
00:10:20.924 --> 00:10:22.624
When firing a gun,

167
00:10:22.624 --> 00:10:25.424
if you bring your left ear close to the man's lap,

168
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:29.824
you can guard it, but you can't protect your right ear.

169
00:10:29.824 --> 00:10:32.324
In other words, Kei Kashizuka who called to ask Pops

170
00:10:32.324 --> 00:10:35.724
to look for the locker that the key belonged to

171
00:10:35.724 --> 00:10:38.024
was that man.

172
00:10:38.024 --> 00:10:40.924
And the one who came to the Mouri Detective Agency

173
00:10:40.924 --> 00:10:43.724
after luring Detective Mouri out of his office

174
00:10:43.724 --> 00:10:45.524
and acted as an employee of the agency

175
00:10:45.524 --> 00:10:48.924
to welcome the man was you.

176
00:10:48.924 --> 00:10:50.924
I guess you were planning to lure the man out

177
00:10:50.924 --> 00:10:54.924
to another place in order to interrogate him,

178
00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:58.224
but since he was about to figure out you weren't an employee of the agency,

179
00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:01.424
you had no choice but to pass him out using the stun gun.

180
00:11:01.424 --> 00:11:03.824
But, it was impossible for you

181
00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:06.424
to carry that man out to another place alone.

182
00:11:06.424 --> 00:11:08.324
Although you could've taken the man's cell phone

183
00:11:08.324 --> 00:11:10.924
on the spot and kill him,

184
00:11:10.924 --> 00:11:13.224
you figured if the people of the neighborhood

185
00:11:13.224 --> 00:11:14.324
heard the gun shot and came rushing over

186
00:11:14.324 --> 00:11:16.424
you wouldn't be able to flee even if you wanted to.

187
00:11:16.424 --> 00:11:18.824
So you dragged the man to the restroom

188
00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:21.424
and set up the trick you carried out a while ago, right?

189
00:11:21.424 --> 00:11:24.924
By doing so, you figured the police would let you go for the time being,

190
00:11:24.924 --> 00:11:27.324
and you could use the cell phone you took from the man

191
00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:30.424
to search that for the person you were after.

192
00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:32.024
What's with you?

193
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.724
Who are you anyway?

194
00:11:34.724 --> 00:11:37.724
Conan Edogawa.

195
00:11:37.724 --> 00:11:39.524
A detective.

196
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.375
What's with you?

197
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.075
Who are you anyway?

198
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:55.075
Conan Edogawa.

199
00:11:55.075 --> 00:11:57.675
A detective.

200
00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.275
Detective?

201
00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:02.175
Look, look ahead, it's a red light!

202
00:12:08.475 --> 00:12:11.075
Then, you figured out what my name was,

203
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:12.875
because you saw the cash card in my wallet?

204
00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:17.475
Nope. I didn't know it was your card.

205
00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:20.375
But, I found out a lot after checking the internet.

206
00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:22.775
In order to make everybody believe

207
00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:25.275
that the cell phone you stole from the man was your own,

208
00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:26.775
you forwarded just one picture to use as the standby display

209
00:12:26.775 --> 00:12:27.775
for the man's cell phone.

210
00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:31.475
The man in the standby display was Kenya Shono,

211
00:12:31.475 --> 00:12:35.875
the bank clerk who was killed by the bank robber the other day.

212
00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:39.075
I also figured that you're probably

213
00:12:39.075 --> 00:12:41.975
looking for the three robbers.

214
00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:46.575
Hidden under the bed of the bedroom of Mr. Kashizuka's condo

215
00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:51.275
that you took us unwillingly to...

216
00:12:52.475 --> 00:12:53.875
the small framed man that was found there

217
00:12:53.875 --> 00:12:55.775
was also one of the robbers.

218
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.075
The second one was the man of hefty physique

219
00:12:58.075 --> 00:13:02.275
that died at the detective agency, called Kei Kashizuka.

220
00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:04.575
And, it seemed that you,

221
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.475
by using the contact list in his cell phone that you took,

222
00:13:06.475 --> 00:13:10.275
were trying to look for the third skinny robber.

223
00:13:10.275 --> 00:13:13.675
The three people you kept trying to call

224
00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:16.275
all had women's names.

225
00:13:16.275 --> 00:13:19.675
The fact that you knew there was a woman among the robbers back then

226
00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:22.675
means that you were at the crime scene that day.

227
00:13:23.675 --> 00:13:25.375
You probably figured it out

228
00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:28.875
by watching their gestures and physiques at close range.

229
00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:31.875
It hasn't been disclosed to the mass media yet

230
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:35.175
that there was a woman among the bank robbers, you see.

231
00:13:35.175 --> 00:13:38.775
Since you were at the site, I'm sure you realized too.

232
00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:43.275
That when Kenya said, "Okay, don't!"

233
00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:49.075
He was actually saying, "Oh, Kei, don't!"

234
00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:51.375
Yes.

235
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:55.075
Kenya realized that his friend Mr. Kei Kashizuka

236
00:13:55.075 --> 00:13:57.775
was among the robbers, and tried to stop him.

237
00:13:57.775 --> 00:14:00.375
But was silenced by Kei instead.

238
00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.475
When I checked that cell phone a while ago,

239
00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:05.875
I found Kenya's home phone number listed too,

240
00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:08.475
so it's no mistake that the two were friends.

241
00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:10.375
Since Kenya was a teller,

242
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:12.475
he may have leaked information to Kei

243
00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:16.975
that 200 million yen was going to be brought in on that day at that time

244
00:14:16.975 --> 00:14:20.075
when he was under the influence of alcohol or something.

245
00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:24.275
And I guess that was used to carry out the bank robbery.

246
00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:28.775
I called Kenya's parental home and asked them,

247
00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:33.075
"Does Kenya's girlfriend still happen to be there?"

248
00:14:33.075 --> 00:14:34.375
Then I was told that.

249
00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:36.975
If the person I'm talking about it Serina Urakawa,

250
00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:41.775
she hasn't even attended the funeral last night.

251
00:14:41.775 --> 00:14:45.275
Hold it! How do you know I'm his girlfriend?

252
00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:46.975
I told you I was his younger sister.

253
00:14:46.975 --> 00:14:49.475
The fact that you were at the site of the robbery,

254
00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:52.675
it's highly probable that you're also a bank clerk.

255
00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:54.275
In order to prevent unlawful acts,

256
00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:58.675
it's impossible for relatives to work at the same bank.

257
00:14:58.675 --> 00:15:00.675
That's how I found out the truth

258
00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:04.075
that you are Mr. Kenya Urakawa's girlfriend,

259
00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:08.375
who's trying to find the three in order to avenge his death.

260
00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:21.075
Hey...

261
00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.375
Isn't this the scheme plan of the bank robbery

262
00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:25.675
that occurred the other day?

263
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:30.175
They even audaciously have a picture of the three holding guns too.

264
00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:32.675
No. Isn't the man in the middle the one

265
00:15:32.675 --> 00:15:35.175
who committed suicide at the detective agency?

266
00:15:35.175 --> 00:15:38.675
The man at the extreme right is the one who was found in the suitcase!

267
00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:41.275
Then, could the woman on the extreme left

268
00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:43.975
be the other bank robber?

269
00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:48.475
It seems that the men were exchanging mails with that woman.

270
00:15:48.475 --> 00:15:49.475
Yeah.

271
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:54.075
Using an outrageous title like, "Is the gun ready?"

272
00:15:55.675 --> 00:15:58.475
The woman sent mail saying she's moving.

273
00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:00.075
The address is written.

274
00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:01.575
Let's go over.

275
00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:03.175
Yeah.

276
00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:05.375
Well, I found out right away that the Serina Urakawa

277
00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:10.175
was a bank clerk when I checked the wallet.

278
00:16:10.175 --> 00:16:13.875
Each time a bank clerk is transferred to another branch,

279
00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:15.575
they are told to open a new bank account

280
00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:17.375
which requires no service charge at the new branch

281
00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:20.775
that they are transferred to.

282
00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:23.675
From here, it's just my imagination.

283
00:16:23.675 --> 00:16:26.575
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

284
00:16:26.575 --> 00:16:28.875
you checked the address of Kei

285
00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:34.675
using Kenya's address book and went to visit him, right?

286
00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:37.975
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

287
00:16:37.975 --> 00:16:41.675
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in, and you were greeted at the door

288
00:16:41.675 --> 00:16:44.275
by a small framed man who was living with him.

289
00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:46.675
Unluckily, you found his gun,

290
00:16:46.675 --> 00:16:50.175
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

291
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.975
he attacked you in order to silence you,

292
00:16:52.975 --> 00:16:56.975
but was beaten to death by you instead.

293
00:16:56.975 --> 00:17:01.675
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return,

294
00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.275
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

295
00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:04.875
being made in the living room,

296
00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:07.575
so afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

297
00:17:07.575 --> 00:17:09.975
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

298
00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:12.875
and set up wiretaps.

299
00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:15.075
Doing so, you figured that the smell from the corpse

300
00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:19.175
would be discovered and the other accomplice would be called over too.

301
00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:22.775
You didn't go to Kenya's funeral

302
00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:24.475
because after setting up the wiretaps,

303
00:17:24.475 --> 00:17:26.875
you were listening to them right through

304
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:30.275
from your car that was in the parking lot, right?

305
00:17:30.275 --> 00:17:33.375
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

306
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:35.075
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

307
00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:39.375
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

308
00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:41.575
So he called the other robber and suggested

309
00:17:41.575 --> 00:17:45.175
that they take the rest of the money and split.

310
00:17:45.175 --> 00:17:48.375
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

311
00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:51.175
he didn't know where the locker was.

312
00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:54.775
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

313
00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:56.575
So, Kei Kashizuka

314
00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:00.875
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

315
00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:02.875
look for the locker.

316
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:06.975
Of course he said nothing of the contents of the locker.

317
00:18:06.975 --> 00:18:09.075
You, who were listening to the telephone conversation

318
00:18:09.075 --> 00:18:12.475
between the robbers over the wiretap panicked.

319
00:18:12.475 --> 00:18:14.575
If Detective Kogoro Mouri finds out

320
00:18:14.575 --> 00:18:18.575
that Kei Kashizuka is the bank robber and is arrested,

321
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:21.075
you would lose the chance to take revenge.

322
00:18:21.075 --> 00:18:24.875
That's why you ambushed Kei Kashizuka at the detective agency

323
00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:28.575
and tried to ask about the other accomplice.

324
00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:30.675
Am I more or less correct?

325
00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:35.275
Yes, that's right.

326
00:18:35.275 --> 00:18:37.775
I thought if I checked the call history on this cell phone,

327
00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:41.775
I could find out who that man talked to last night,

328
00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:46.075
but he was cautious and had erased all the call history.

329
00:18:46.075 --> 00:18:48.675
If so, then we've got no choice

330
00:18:48.675 --> 00:18:51.575
but to visit the three women that you were making calls to.

331
00:18:51.575 --> 00:18:53.675
First, I guess we start from the nearest place.

332
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.075
Ms. Rinko Toyokita's apartment.

333
00:18:57.075 --> 00:19:00.375
Maybe the woman who kidnapped Conan,

334
00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.675
in order to avenge Mr. Shono's death

335
00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:05.575
headed over to that woman's place?

336
00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:07.175
Yeah.

337
00:19:16.775 --> 00:19:20.675
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

338
00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:22.675
Yeah.

339
00:19:22.675 --> 00:19:25.475
What is it? What a nuisance.

340
00:19:25.475 --> 00:19:29.075
We moved to this apartment today.

341
00:19:29.075 --> 00:19:30.875
Right, Mom?

342
00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:34.175
This isn't much.

343
00:19:34.175 --> 00:19:35.475
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

344
00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:38.175
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

345
00:19:38.175 --> 00:19:41.175
and is normally asleep at this time,

346
00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:43.675
so please be careful next time.

347
00:19:43.675 --> 00:19:44.675
Oh, wait.

348
00:19:44.675 --> 00:19:46.675
Something smells good.

349
00:19:46.675 --> 00:19:48.275
-It's omlette! -Hey.

350
00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:50.475
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

351
00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:52.475
Don't you ever come here again!

352
00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:58.375
They've started moving.

353
00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:01.675
Judging from the speed, it seems like they're in the car again.

354
00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:04.275
They're headed in the direction of Haido-cho now.

355
00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:08.375
But, I wonder why they got off the car?

356
00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.875
I wonder if the culprit took Conan out of the car

357
00:20:10.875 --> 00:20:13.475
and took him around somewhere?

358
00:20:13.475 --> 00:20:18.975
No. Maybe Conan is the one taking the culprit around.

359
00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:24.675
I wonder if no one's home?

360
00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:25.675
Oh, my.

361
00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:30.375
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

362
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:32.875
Look at all the brand name packages.

363
00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:35.875
Uh. We've come to say hello since we moved here.

364
00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:37.375
Oh, is that right?

365
00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:39.575
But, you don't have to do that

366
00:20:39.575 --> 00:20:42.675
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

367
00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.075
Why?

368
00:20:44.075 --> 00:20:46.475
I won the lottery.

369
00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:49.075
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

370
00:20:50.475 --> 00:20:52.975
Oh, that's right.

371
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:56.275
I hate to trouble you, but will you go throw this away for me?

372
00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:57.675
But, it seems that in this area,

373
00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:00.075
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

374
00:21:00.075 --> 00:21:02.575
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

375
00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:04.275
Thanks for your help.

376
00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:09.375
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

377
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:14.175
Oh, no. I got mail from Conan.

378
00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:18.475
"I'm fine, so don't worry", he says.

379
00:21:18.475 --> 00:21:22.175
It seems that he went along on his own initiative.

380
00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:24.175
That brat.

381
00:21:24.175 --> 00:21:26.275
Acting like a detective again.

382
00:21:26.275 --> 00:21:28.675
Well, the curiosity of a child

383
00:21:28.675 --> 00:21:33.175
and the inquisitive mind of a detective are quite common.

384
00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:43.075
Yes, who is it?

385
00:21:43.075 --> 00:21:45.375
We just moved here today,

386
00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:46.975
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

387
00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:48.775
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:51.675
I don't accept things like that.

389
00:21:51.675 --> 00:21:54.875
Hey, what do you do?

390
00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:56.275
I'm a writer.

391
00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:59.375
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

392
00:22:00.375 --> 00:22:03.575
All she eats are beef bowls.

393
00:22:03.575 --> 00:22:04.975
Oh, right.

394
00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:08.275
Will you do me a favor?

395
00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:12.075
Could it be that... You want us to take the trash out for you?

396
00:22:14.575 --> 00:22:17.375
This is all of it.

397
00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:19.475
Did you figure anything out?

398
00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:21.975
Hey...

399
00:23:45.275 --> 00:23:47.475
So, how about it?

400
00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:49.575
Did you figure out who the robber is?

401
00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:51.375
Yep, of course.

402
00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:54.075
But, I can't tell you who it is.

403
00:23:54.075 --> 00:23:55.775
What do you mean?

404
00:23:55.775 --> 00:23:58.175
Why not?

405
00:23:58.175 --> 00:24:02.075
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

406
00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:07.475
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

407
00:24:09.475 --> 00:24:11.475
"Next Episode"

408
00:24:11.475 --> 00:24:14.575
It's very unlikely that Conan will be hurt

409
00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:17.475
in anyway just yet.

410
00:24:17.475 --> 00:24:20.075
But, if her purpose

411
00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:23.575
is to kill the rest of the robbers...

412
00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:29.775
Didin't you hear what sounded like a gun shot just now?

413
00:24:29.775 --> 00:24:33.875
It's that car! Conan is in that car.

414
00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:35.475
Next Conan,

415
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:39.575
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Bourbon)"

416
00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:57.575
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:57.575 --> 00:24:59.675
"Left-handed"

418
00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:01.275
A long deduction requires a bit of effort.

419
00:25:01.275 --> 00:25:02.675
I'm ready to take anything on anytime.

420
00:25:02.675 --> 00:25:04.175
We're counting on you.
