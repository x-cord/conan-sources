1
00:00:00,782 --> 00:00:03,582
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:05,582
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:07,282
Today's stage is a theatre.

4
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:09,582
A crime show from projector!

5
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:11,282
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,182
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,782
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,795 --> 00:02:00,095
"Last Show for Murder (Part 1)"

9
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:03,595
What? A discount movie ticket?

10
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,595
Yes, Ai got it from Dr. Agasa

11
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:09,295
and told her to go watch the movies with us.

12
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,795
You can go to any movie playing at theatre arcade.

13
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,795
It's great, isn't it? Let's go together!

14
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:17,895
Okay! Next Wednesday, on School Foundation Day,

15
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:21,095
it's going to be the Movies Day for the Youth Detective Squad!

16
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:25,295
I think what you want to say is Movie Viewing Day.

17
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,995
You're coming too, aren't you, Conan?

18
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,495
Well, I have other plans...

19
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:32,195
Are you saying you're not coming, Conan?

20
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:37,295
Ai went out of her way to give the ticket to us.

21
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:40,295
He got it as a prize from a raffle ticket.

22
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:42,095
Is that so?

23
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:46,195
Anyway, let's go together to deepen the bond

24
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:48,095
among the members of the Youth Detective Squad!

25
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:51,195
That's right, we've got to deepen the "band"!

26
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:54,195
Just how do you deepen a "band"?

27
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:56,395
All right... I'll go.

28
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,395
I will come along...

29
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:03,295
Even the renown detective doesn't stand a chance.

30
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,695
Leave me alone!

31
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,295
"Gomera"...

32
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:12,295
We'll watch "Gomera"...

33
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:15,395
Hey... we're members of the Youth Detective Squad, right?

34
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:21,395
Wouldn't something like "The Onimaru Legend Murder Case" be better?

35
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:24,095
That's the one that you have to use your head a lot, isn't it?

36
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:28,595
Let's see a movie that we can watch more for entertainment today!

37
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,395
Ai, what do you want to watch?

38
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:37,195
Well, how about something like what's playing at the Geibunza,

39
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:38,995
"Einstein's Days of Glory and Pain"?

40
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,695
Einstein?

41
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,495
What is that? Can you eat it?

42
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:46,095
Sounds like it's going to give me a stiff shoulder?

43
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,995
All right, then we go for our own choice.

44
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,695
It should be no problem.

45
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,795
What? No!

46
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:57,295
Ai said that Dr. Agasa told us to watch the movie together.

47
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,295
What should we do, Mitsuhiko?

48
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:03,195
We only have one choice at times like this!

49
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:06,195
Yes, that's the only way!

50
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:09,295
Rock, paper, scissors...

51
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:13,195
What a thing to have happened?

52
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:17,495
Just because I publicized that research lab...

53
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:18,695
If we leave things as they are,

54
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:22,495
innocent people will be killed one after the other by him.

55
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,495
Do we have no other choice

56
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:28,995
than to rely 011, that legend to save mankind?

57
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,495
The legend of...

58
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:34,295
the great monster, Gomera!

59
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:38,295
Okay, go for it, Gomera!

60
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,295
Don't let man-eating spider beat you!

61
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,595
Hang in there, Gomera.

62
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,695
His head! His head is his weak point!

63
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:59,295
Gosh. Well, the chances of us watching "Gomera" was 3 out of 5,

64
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:01,695
I can only admit my fate.

65
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:04,595
I think this movie is pretty well made.

66
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,995
The futile end of mankind who has become infatuated in science.

67
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,295
It just sends shivers up your spine, doesn't it?

68
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,895
Hey, be quiet, you guys.

69
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,795
I wish you wouldn't raise your hands

70
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,295
or stand up during the movie.

71
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:21,995
"Toshiyuki Ide, college student" -I can't concentrate on the movie

72
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,995
and besides, you're being a nuisance to the other viewers.

73
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,395
I'm sorry. -We are sorry.

74
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,895
Who does he think he is, anyway?

75
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:34,895
You idiot, it's your fault for not watching the movie quietly.

76
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:38,195
By the way, there's only a few people here.

77
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:43,495
There are only four other people besides us.

78
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:46,795
We don't have school today because it's Foundation Day,

79
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,695
and it's a weekday today.

80
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,195
Besides, they only play revivals here.

81
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:55,595
My dad was saying don't come here

82
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:56,895
because there are a lot of fights here.

83
00:05:56,895 --> 00:06:00,795
Oh, my mom was saying so too!

84
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:04,195
Is this theatre messy?

85
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,195
There are ladders placed here and there too.

86
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:11,095
There are ropes and wires on the floor.

87
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,895
I wonder if they're going to renovate this place.

88
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:19,695
"The End"

89
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,395
The movie was funny!

90
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:24,895
You're right!

91
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:27,095
Gomera sure was gallant.

92
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,495
Yes! It had a scary face and was a bit small,

93
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:31,995
but was super fantastic!

94
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:36,795
This Gomera was created way before we were born,

95
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,895
it will be growing too!

96
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,195
How did you like it, Conan?

97
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,195
What? Well, it was so-so, I guess.

98
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:49,195
I saw this movie until I got sick of it when I was a kid.

99
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:51,995
Let's hurry home and play soccer or something!

100
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,395
What're you talking about, Conan?

101
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,495
There are still two more shows left.

102
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,195
What?

103
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:59,395
"The great monster, Gomera" -Three movies playing?

104
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,895
"Gomera's counterattack" -And they're all movies

105
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:02,395
"Gomera versus Mechanical Gomera" -that I've already seen.

106
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:05,695
It's a fantastic line up of three movies, totaling five hours.

107
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:06,695
That's a lot, isn't it?

108
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:09,995
Hey... is this for real?

109
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,795
Aren't you guys hungry?

110
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:14,695
They were selling popcorn at the stand!

111
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:16,695
Let's go and see. -Okay!

112
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:18,695
I'm sure glad we came, aren't you? -Yes.

113
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,095
Come along too, Ai.

114
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:21,195
Okay.

115
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:23,095
Come on, Conan. -Okay.

116
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,395
Wait up!

117
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:27,295
Two more to go.

118
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,395
Well, it's good too.

119
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,695
We should rest our brain cells at times

120
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:34,595
and enjoy a short break.

121
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:38,095
I came today hoping to do so too.

122
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:39,895
A break?

123
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,795
Besides, if you use your head too much,

124
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,395
you're going to go bald like Dr. Agasa.

125
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,295
What?

126
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:49,195
Here you go! 3 cups of cokes and 2 cups of coffee.

127
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,295
And 5 boxes of popcorn.

128
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,895
What? We only want 3 boxes of popcorn.

129
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:57,995
It's okay... The 2 boxes are on me!

130
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,395
"Yuriko Yuri (23), shop assistant" -You come here quite often

131
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,895
and besides, you're our last customers.

132
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:05,395
Last? -That's right.

133
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:08,095
We're closing down the theatre today.

134
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,395
This theatre that...

135
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:13,695
"Akio Muramatsu (62), the theatre's owner" -we kept going for 30 years.

136
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:17,695
I see, that's why there were ropes and other stuff on the floor.

137
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,395
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:22,595
The construction workers were working here till a while ago.

139
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:25,395
Gosh, they could have started tomorrow.

140
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,895
Well, don't say that.

141
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:29,895
I am kind to keep you open until today

142
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:32,895
despite wanting to bust this place up right away.

143
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:35,895
It's because the owner of this theatre

144
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,595
asking me to wait until the Opening Commemoration Day.

145
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:40,595
Mr. Hatta.

146
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,995
"Seiji Hatta (43)" -Well, I have been waiting

147
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:45,395
"president of real estate company" -to the last day of this theatre,

148
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:48,495
but there are only few customers.

149
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,195
If only Gomera would stomp this place to pieces,

150
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:54,695
I could save myself some pennies dismantling fees.

151
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,195
Hey, you!

152
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:58,095
"Minoru Furuhashi (39)" -It's no smoking in the theatre!

153
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:01,095
"Projectionist" -Don't make me keep repeating myself, you idiot!

154
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:03,095
I'm sorry...

155
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,995
I'll be careful from tomorrow.

156
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:12,695
Oh, no! This place will be destroyed tomorrow.

157
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:17,095
That guy...

158
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:19,595
Excuse me.

159
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:22,995
"Keep repeating yourself"? You mean he comes here often?

160
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,595
Yes, he has been here every day lately.

161
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:28,095
And every time he shows up,

162
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:31,895
those punks start fighting in here while the movie is showing.

163
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:34,295
The punks were probably hired by him anyway!

164
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:36,695
He made them make a fuss in here so that a bad reputation would go around

165
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,595
and led us into bankruptcy!

166
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:41,595
Hey... you shouldn't say such things!

167
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,695
But...

168
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,295
What? He is the man.

169
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,395
Oh, Mr. Ide is here again today?

170
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,795
Yes, he says since today is the final day,

171
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:57,095
he would like to take a picture of the inside of the theatre.

172
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,295
It's all right, isn't it?

173
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,295
Yes, no problem.

174
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,295
He likes special effects movies

175
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:05,595
and he has been coming here since his childhood days.

176
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,995
He is just like a son to me.

177
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:11,895
Well, shall we start eating lunch soon?

178
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:16,395
Oh, I forgot to buy box lunch!

179
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,395
Then I will go and get the lunches.

180
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:21,195
No! You'll have to stay here all day today

181
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,995
until the last show today.

182
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:27,395
Then why don't you go when the next show begins playing, Yuri?

183
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:30,795
I don't think we'll have many customers anyway today.

184
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:34,195
And even if we do, we can somehow handle it

185
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:35,695
with the help of the lady at the ticket booth!

186
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,395
I guess I'll do that.

187
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,895
Oh, no! It's almost time to start.

188
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:42,995
We ran out of tea leaves. Can you get some too?

189
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:44,995
Okay, but you'll have to pay for it!

190
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,995
Sure.

191
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,695
So they're closing this place down.

192
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:54,695
Yes, they used to play so many good movies.

193
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,395
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

194
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:08,395
"Gomera's counterattack"

195
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:11,695
The enemy monster is going to lay an egg inside Gomera

196
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:12,895
towards the middle of the movie!

197
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:14,695
How gross!

198
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:18,395
What's with you?

199
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,995
Me?

200
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,195
I'm Gomera!

201
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,395
Let's get out of here already.

202
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:35,695
It seems to be true that he was hiring those punks.

203
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,595
I feel sorry for the owner.

204
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:43,595
Well, I guess I'll resign myself to watching my fill of "Gomera".

205
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,195
Hey, Mitsuhiko, don't tell me you're scared?

206
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:25,695
No! Don't you think it becomes cold from a while ago?

207
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:28,895
Come to think of it...

208
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:34,495
Well, kids just can't take watching movies for such long hours.

209
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:35,695
Hey, Ai.

210
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:37,895
Ayumi fell asleep, but I want to go to the restroom,

211
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:39,695
so will you change seats with me...

212
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:44,395
Hey... Don't tell me I'm going to stay this way

213
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,295
until the movie ends?

214
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:48,295
I want to go to the restroom.

215
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,995
Gomera.

216
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:54,695
Please, Gomera.

217
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:58,195
Calm down. -Emera is cute after all, isn't she?

218
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,695
Gomera!

219
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,695
Mr. Furuhashi, your tea is ready!

220
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,395
Oh, thanks!

221
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:08,695
I'll leave it here, then.

222
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:14,495
Please, Gomera. -What is that?

223
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,695
Please stay still. -What's wrong?

224
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,895
A black shadow is swaying.

225
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,895
Something is hanging in front of the projection window!

226
00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:25,695
Will you go check things out, Yuri?

227
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:26,895
Okay.

228
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:27,995
What's wrong?

229
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,995
What on earth happened?

230
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:33,895
That is...

231
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:38,095
It seems you have no time to taking a break.

232
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:51,584
The deceased is Seiji Hatta,

233
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,284
43 years old,

234
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:55,884
he is the president of a real estate company nearby.

235
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:59,884
He bought this theatre that is to be closed down today.

236
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:02,784
Did Mr. Hatta come here often?

237
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:05,784
Yes, he came almost every day recently.

238
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:08,084
But it didn't look like he was coming here for the movies.

239
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:12,684
I think he was more concerned about the progress of dismantling.

240
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,784
He just came to give us a bad time!

241
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:18,184
Although I'm not sure of his reason.

242
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:20,584
He was getting in the way of business!

243
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:23,884
Although we cautioned him many times not to smoke in the theatre,

244
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:25,784
but he would ignore it, as well as tease the customers.

245
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:29,184
To top it off, he always sits in last seat

246
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,884
right in front of the projection window!

247
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:34,484
Thanks to him, a shadow was made on the picture by his cigarette smoke.

248
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:36,784
What a nuisance!

249
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,684
He must have been smoking today too

250
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:42,684
because shadows were seen in the picture.

251
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:46,984
Is it true that he hung himself while the movie was playing?

252
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,184
Yes, I'm sure.

253
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:53,084
He hung himself right in front of the projection window.

254
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:57,484
The shadow of his head and the rope showed up on the screen!

255
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:59,784
Do you remember what time it was?

256
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,584
It was...

257
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,184
It was during the scene when Emera came on!

258
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,884
The scene when Emera was trying to calm Gomera down!

259
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:12,884
A big shadow came swaying in on the close up of Emera!

260
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:14,984
Oh, it's you kids again.

261
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:18,284
That scene is just before the middle

262
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,284
so the time was about...

263
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:22,984
12:44 pm.

264
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:26,384
If the movie started on time,

265
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,584
I believe there's no mistake as to the time.

266
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:32,284
What makes you so sure?

267
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:36,284
Mr. Ide is a special effects mania.

268
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:37,284
Inspector Megure!

269
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:40,584
Officer Chiba, have you got something?

270
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:42,984
According to the lady at the ticket booth,

271
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,784
aside from the children, there were only those four here

272
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:48,584
at the estimated time of his death.

273
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,484
Is her testimony reliable?

274
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:51,584
Yes.

275
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,484
That lady have been talking to someone at the entrance

276
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,484
since the movie started.

277
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,884
I see.

278
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,784
In other words, if this is murder,

279
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:05,284
the ones capable of committing the murder

280
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:07,484
are the four of you here!

281
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:08,784
What...

282
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:12,284
Hey... Inspector. This is suicide, isn't it?

283
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:15,084
Suspending an adult man from a rope

284
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:19,184
is something impossible for an elderly, a girl, or a skinny man to do.

285
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:21,584
Well, if anybody, I would be the one capable of doing it,

286
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,484
but I was in the projection room at that time.

287
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,484
Right, Yuri?

288
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,684
Yes.

289
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,784
Just about that time,

290
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:32,384
I took Mr. Furuhashi who was in the projection room, his lunch and tea,

291
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:33,984
so there's no mistake.

292
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:36,984
Where were you two at that time?

293
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:39,984
I was watching the movie in the theatre.

294
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:42,584
If you cooperated with each other,

295
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,984
you could've hung him, couldn't you?

296
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,884
What?

297
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,284
That is impossible.

298
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:51,884
Because I have an alibi.

299
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:55,284
A digital camera?

300
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:57,084
Don't tell me...

301
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,084
these are pictures you took when the incident happened?

302
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,384
Yes, I just happened to be taking pictures

303
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:03,984
of the memorable scenes that I saw here when I was a child.

304
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,384
Other viewers are also included in it.

305
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:09,584
But you can take the pictures right after he was hung.

306
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:12,284
Then, please look at the picture before that one.

307
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:15,184
I've taken consecutive pictures from the same angle,

308
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:20,684
so that proves that I was taking pictures all time, doesn't it?

309
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:22,984
This is a digital camera!

310
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:26,484
You could easily add a shadow onto a picture that you took beforehand.

311
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,584
I don't think so!

312
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,484
May I have it for a minute?

313
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,184
Well, see over here!

314
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,584
The owner of the theatre and Mitsuhiko are here in this picture!

315
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:39,084
This is when Mitsuhiko came back from the restroom.

316
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:44,484
Moreover, the 5 or 6 pictures after the shadow is taken...

317
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:45,584
See?

318
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:48,584
I'm sitting in the seat, right?

319
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:51,684
He had no way of knowing that we were going to be here,

320
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,884
so he couldn't have faked these pictures, right?

321
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,284
That's true.

322
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:04,984
Why did you leave in the middle of the show?

323
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,984
You seem to be heading for the door opposite the restroom.

324
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:14,084
I went to check on the air conditioner.

325
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,884
Air conditioner? -Yes.

326
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:19,884
Because it seemed to be colder than usual.

327
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:21,684
I thought it was cold too.

328
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,184
That's why I had to go to the restroom.

329
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:26,984
Where is the device to adjust the air conditioner?

330
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:28,884
Over that side.

331
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:33,284
Facing the screen, it's on the other side of the door to the right.

332
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:37,884
See? It's that room at the end of the corridor.

333
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:41,484
It's my job to adjust the air conditioner.

334
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:44,184
It was set stronger than usual.

335
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:46,984
This is no time to be talking about air conditioners, isn't it?

336
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:51,284
Isn't the problem whether this is a suicide or homicide?

337
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:54,184
Could you take me to the projector room

338
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,884
that you say you were in at the time of the incident?

339
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:57,884
Yes, sure.

340
00:18:57,884 --> 00:18:58,884
"Do Not Enter"

341
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,284
This is the stairs that leads to the projection room.

342
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:04,284
Only authorized personnel is let up here.

343
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:09,084
What? Where is the projector?

344
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:13,084
This is the waiting room. The projector is over on this side.

345
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,284
I see, there are two projectors here.

346
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:18,484
Yes, when one of the projectors is showing the movie,

347
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:22,184
the other one winds the films that have finished rolling.

348
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,684
Can't you do it with one machine?

349
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:26,984
It takes time to wind the film,

350
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:30,184
and we won't be able to make it in time for the next show.

351
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:31,984
And the window on the right here

352
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:34,884
is used to check whether the film is rolling right.

353
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:35,884
The one on the left

354
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,084
is where the projector projects the movie from.

355
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,684
The man hung himself in front of this window

356
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,884
and his shadow showed up on the screen.

357
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:46,284
This window doesn't open, does it?

358
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:49,984
Yes, it is tightly sealed with glass.

359
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:52,584
I was here when the shadow showed up

360
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:55,984
and Yuri was in the next room serving tea.

361
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:58,584
There couldn't be a better alibi, right?

362
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,784
I see, so maybe this is suicide after all...

363
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,184
I've come across a good idea!

364
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:06,184
A good idea?

365
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:07,284
Yes.

366
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:09,284
At the scene where Emera comes out

367
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:11,584
divide the film into the first and second part,

368
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,184
play the first part with the other projector,

369
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,684
then switch over to this projector at the second part.

370
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,184
I see. The first part will be played

371
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:21,884
without being obstructed by the corpse,

372
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,584
and the shadow will appear the moment the film

373
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,884
is switched to the second part!

374
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:29,184
Which means it is possible to hang the corpse beforehand!

375
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:31,284
Interesting, isn't it?

376
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:34,984
It sure is an interesting idea, kid.

377
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,584
Some theatres actually do that,

378
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,384
but the mark of the part where the film was connected later

379
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:42,584
will remains on the film.

380
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:46,184
Inspector, check this film out if you like!

381
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:49,984
But there is nothing like that by that scene.

382
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:53,184
Besides, when I went to buy the lunches,

383
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,884
I looked inside this room,

384
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:59,184
but all I saw moving was this projector.

385
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:01,284
Is that so?

386
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:03,284
What time did you come back with the lunches?

387
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:06,384
Well, just about 5 minutes

388
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:08,884
before everybody started making a fuss because of the shadow.

389
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:11,584
It's about 12:40 pm.

390
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,984
I went to buy the lunches

391
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:16,284
thinking of eating with everyone during the next break time.

392
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:17,684
But the convenience store was crowded,

393
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,984
so I asked the lady at the ticket booth

394
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:22,684
what time it was when I was back.

395
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:24,184
You can go ask her.

396
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,584
I'm pretty sure.

397
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:29,284
Which means after you went to bought the lunches,

398
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:32,184
you were in this room until everybody started making a fuss?

399
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:35,984
She was boiling the water because I asked her to make me tea.

400
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:36,984
I see.

401
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:40,284
Yes, at that portable cooking table.

402
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,784
This room sure is messy.

403
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,184
You could at least replace the broken mirror.

404
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:48,984
That's true. It's so dusty and the ashtray is full of cigarette butts.

405
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,984
Did you clean this place at all?

406
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:54,184
Shut up. How can you feel like cleaning up

407
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:56,184
when you know you've got to close down today?

408
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,784
Please let me take the film to the police station for a while.

409
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,784
Yes, do as you wish.

410
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:12,184
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

411
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,284
I... I saw it.

412
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:15,584
What...

413
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,884
What did you see, Mitsuhiko?

414
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,384
Well...

415
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:24,084
she was in front of the mirror of the ladies room,

416
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,284
holding her eyes down as if she was crying!

417
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:04,584
"Next Episode"

418
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,984
You, who are pursuing the truth

419
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:10,484
is deceiving everyone.

420
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:14,184
Even this mirror that reflects everything just like it is,

421
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:18,184
will not reflect you in your true form.

422
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:21,484
Thanks, Ai!

423
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:22,684
I see!

424
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:24,784
I see! That's what it was!

425
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:27,384
That's why that scene...

426
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,484
Next Conan,

427
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:33,284
"Last Show for Murder (Part 2)"

428
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:36,486
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,286
"Mirror"

430
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:40,286
This year's film is "The Last Wizard of the Century"

431
