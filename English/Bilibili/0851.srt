1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,270
Pops invites Ran and I to go Beppu Hot Springs in Oita,

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,870
so we all go there.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,670
Blood Lake Hell and Ogre Mountain Hell.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,370
Going to Beppu Hot Springs means visiting the hells, right?

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,770
Visiting the hells, sounds like fun!

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,670
But one thing bothers me.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,670
The very person, Pops who asked to come along with him on the trip,

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,770
for some reason, isn't saying a word.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,970
I'm sorry. Please go ahead.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,670
Huh? That voice...

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,970
Thank you.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,370
Not at all.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,570
Officer Ta...

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,970
I'm not here.

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,670
You can't see me.

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,470
What?

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,270
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,770
Officer Takagi and Pops are behaving strangely.

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,970
Fraught with foreboding they head to Kyushu.

21
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,170
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:02,811
"The Descent into the Hell Tour of Love (Beppu Edition)"

25
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:10,111
"Beppu Station"

26
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:13,311
Long ago,

27
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:16,211
the places where hot springs gushed out were called hell

28
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,411
because people feared them and stayed away from them.

29
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,711
"Kamado Jigoku (Stove Hell)" -The Stove Hell

30
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,411
is where a red ogre greets you from on top the stove.

31
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,011
The Stove Hell is where a red ogre greets you from on top the stove.

32
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:30,911
Fantastic!

33
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,711
It's so vast and beautiful.

34
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,411
I can't see a thing!

35
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,211
Ocean Hell is said to have been formed

36
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,311
by the eruption of Mt. Tsurumidake.

37
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:00,611
The Stone Monk Hell where boiling bubbles of mud come

38
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,611
bubbling up.

39
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,611
Mountain Hell where hippos and flamingos

40
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,211
are being taken care of.

41
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,111
How scary!

42
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:20,311
How cute!

43
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,211
The Ogre Mountain Hell,

44
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,511
which is also known as crocodile/alligator hell.

45
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,311
White Lake Hell, where Piranhas from the Amazon can be seen.

46
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,311
Watersprout Hell where steam comes gushing out from the ground.

47
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:47,711
The Blood Lake Hell, which emits red steam.

48
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:51,711
Walking through and visiting these eight hells

49
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:54,311
is the centerpiece to touring Beppu.

50
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,911
-Here goes! -Okay!

51
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,011
Did it come out good?

52
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,811
Yep. Do want to look at it?

53
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,711
What's wrong, Conan?

54
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,211
What is it?

55
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:17,411
He's sure carrying a large bag.

56
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,811
That man...

57
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:23,411
Huh? Come to think of it, where's Dad?

58
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:31,611
I guess it's hard to find clues based on this photo alone after all.

59
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:34,111
-Dad! -What?

60
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:36,511
Just what are you doing, all by yourself?

61
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:40,011
Well... I'm not doing anything in particular.

62
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:42,911
Hot!

63
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,911
-Hot, hot! -What's this?

64
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:53,211
Hey, idiot! Give it back to me!

65
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:00,911
Dad, who is she?

66
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:03,311
Well, she's...

67
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:05,711
The thing is...

68
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:09,011
Pops, I think you should tell her the truth.

69
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,811
Huh?

70
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:12,111
Well, the thing is...

71
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,911
Yesterday, the president of the famous Nakadai Electrics

72
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:18,211
came to the office, you see.

73
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,511
"Mouri Detective Agency"

74
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,411
Your daughter is missing?

75
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:24,611
"Hidetora Nakadai (58)" -Yes, my daughter's name is Manami.

76
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:26,911
Early this morning, she left a note saying

77
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:30,311
she was going to take a trip alone and disappeared.

78
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:32,211
You must be worried.

79
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,211
Do you have any idea where she may have gone?

80
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:37,911
Well, I found this picture in her room.

81
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,111
Welcome to hell?

82
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,011
"Yozo Hosogai (40)" -It's a ticket for visiting

83
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,211
the hells in Beppu in Oita Prefecture.

84
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,911
Beppu?

85
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:49,711
The fact is, my daughter just got engaged.

86
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,311
"Kenichiro Ehara (35)" -Her marriage partner is

87
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:59,311
the president of an IT company called Mr. Kenichiro Ehara.

88
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,111
It seems that the moment the engagement was announced,

89
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:05,511
that picture was sent to her by a man called Hiroyuki.

90
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,711
Hiroyuki?

91
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,211
It's the man that she had been going with.

92
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,211
I didn't know about it,

93
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,911
but according to my secretary Hosogai,

94
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:17,111
she got to know him in Beppu where she went on her graduation trip.

95
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:20,511
It seems that he's a local Japanese paper craft artisan,

96
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:22,511
and seems to have been sending her letters several times

97
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,111
even after they broke up.

98
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:29,211
I think that maybe he has more intimate private pictures of her

99
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:32,611
and is blackmailing her for them.

100
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:34,811
If that's a fact,

101
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:37,611
he's a slimeball!

102
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:42,911
My daughter probably didn't want me or her fiance to find out about it

103
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:46,011
so maybe she went to meet Hiroyuki on her own.

104
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,611
That could be dangerous!

105
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:50,011
She could get messed up in a case!

106
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,211
What?

107
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:54,711
But if we report this to the police, it would be a scandal

108
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,811
and hurt the reputation of the company.

109
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,111
Who cares about the reputation of the company!

110
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:05,211
Not only that, I think it'll hurt Manami as well.

111
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:06,611
All right!

112
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,611
Please let me, Kogoro Mouri handle your daughter's case!

113
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,711
That's the story.

114
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:17,911
That's why I planned a casual family trip out here.

115
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,911
He calls this casual.

116
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,611
If you told us to begin with,

117
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,211
we would've helped you, too.

118
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:28,411
These Paradise Buns sure are good.

119
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:29,911
When on earth did you get those?

120
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,711
When we went to Ocean Hell.

121
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:35,811
My goodness.

122
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:38,011
-It's really good! -Right?

123
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:45,511
"Yufuin Station"

124
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:55,611
"Yunotsubo Road"

125
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,811
I can't believe we're openly dating each other like this!

126
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:10,311
It's like a dream.

127
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,011
Officer Takagi.

128
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,711
It's surprising that you got time off.

129
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,011
What?

130
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:18,111
You're handling that armed robbery case, aren't you?

131
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,811
It still hasn't been solved, has it?

132
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:37,111
Well, I've been staking out all this time,

133
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,411
so Inspector Megure told me to take time off.

134
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,711
Really?

135
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:44,411
Come this way. There's something I want to show you.

136
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,411
What?

137
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,511
How beautiful!

138
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,011
Isn't it?

139
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,311
At the church next door, weddings are held, too.

140
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,811
What?

141
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:03,011
"Yufuin Stained Glass Museum" -Weddings, too?

142
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,211
Yes.

143
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:06,711
All right, she getting interested.

144
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,411
If things work out well...

145
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,511
If I can keep this up,

146
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:22,111
we can start making memories, just the two of us!

147
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,011
How beautiful!

148
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:41,711
Conan! The view on this side is even better!

149
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,511
Since there's nobody else around,

150
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,211
why don't you come over to this side?

151
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:50,111
Idiot, you're there.

152
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,711
Of all things, kid...

153
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:55,111
Why'd you want to stay over at this inn?

154
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:59,711
Because the shuttle bus of this inn was in Manami's photo.

155
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,511
You're really something, Conan,

156
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,511
when even Dad didn't notice it.

157
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,611
Don't be ridiculous!

158
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:10,011
Famed Detective Kogoro Mouri had noticed!

159
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,611
What? Really?

160
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,311
Of course.

161
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:18,611
It seems Dad hired a detective.

162
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,011
He's searching for me.

163
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:24,511
I don't know what you're up to,

164
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,011
but it's all over. Please forget it.

165
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,011
Well, that sure was a good bath.

166
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:31,011
It was a really big outdoor bath, wasn't it?

167
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,411
What?

168
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:34,011
What's the matter?

169
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:37,111
Didn't that girl that just went by... look a lot like Manami?

170
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:38,511
What?

171
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,111
Are you all right?

172
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:46,411
A red ogre...

173
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,011
Red ogre?

174
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:16,878
Hold it!

175
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:31,378
What? You found my daughter?

176
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:32,478
Yes.

177
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:35,178
When we told her you were worried about her,

178
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:38,778
she promised to return home together with us.

179
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:39,978
Is that right?

180
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:42,178
I'm worried, so I'll head over to your place instead.

181
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,878
President, you've got meetings scheduled

182
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,378
for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

183
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:47,478
Who cares about the meetings!

184
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:50,878
I'll take the first train tomorrow and head over there

185
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,678
so please take care of her till then!

186
00:12:52,678 --> 00:12:54,078
All right!

187
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:05,878
I wonder why.

188
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:07,878
There are no footprints anywhere.

189
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:12,878
That scratch?

190
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,278
Hiroyuki Hayami?

191
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,778
He's my ex-boyfriend.

192
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,578
I used to go with him until 6 months ago.

193
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:25,778
So that ex-boyfriend of yours sent you this photo?

194
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:29,278
Yes. I just got engaged

195
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,878
so I got scared and called Hiroyuki right away.

196
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,178
Then, he told me to come to Beppu immediately.

197
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:38,878
In other words, he tried to blackmail you with the pictures.

198
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:42,478
That he has photos that are even more intimate

199
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,478
and want you to buy them from him.

200
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:46,778
More intimate photos?

201
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:48,678
For instance, photos where...

202
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:49,778
you're both kissing and stuff.

203
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:52,678
Dad! How rude to ask something like that!

204
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:57,278
Couldn't the ogre that we saw last night have been Hiroyuki?

205
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,678
I don't know.

206
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,778
I just wanted to hide what I had with Hiroyuki

207
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,778
from my father and fiance as well.

208
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,778
Your fiance, Mr. Kenichiro Ehara is the president of a company

209
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,878
that makes two billion a year, right?

210
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:13,378
On top of that, he's a fashion icon, too.

211
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:15,278
Amazing.

212
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,178
Don't you have any pictures of Hiroyuki?

213
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:21,578
Yes, I do. Although it's from six months ago.

214
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:22,778
Here.

215
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,178
He's not the man who was wearing the sunglasses.

216
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:37,678
The fog is romantic.

217
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:38,678
Chance!

218
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,878
We'll have our wedding at that church.

219
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:44,178
Ms. Sato!

220
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:45,878
You see...

221
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:47,178
What?

222
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,678
Yes, this is Sato!

223
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:53,378
Who can it be at a time like this?

224
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:54,978
Inspector Megure.

225
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,578
What? The car of the armed robber was found?

226
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,378
The Umi Tamago Parking lot at the Oita Marine Aquarium, correct?

227
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:04,578
Oita?

228
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:08,478
What? Officer Takagi isn't at work because of a cold?

229
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:11,778
I got it! I'll be fine alone!

230
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,778
I'll head over to Oita right away!

231
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:16,178
I'm sorry!

232
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,578
I wanted to match my day off with yours, you see.

233
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:19,978
No making excuses!

234
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,678
I'm sorry!

235
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:23,978
Since you're an officer,

236
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:26,678
you've got to make compensations by doing your job!

237
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:27,978
Let's go.

238
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,178
Okay.

239
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,778
"Oita Station"

240
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:54,178
I've been waiting for you, president.

241
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:56,578
Thank you, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,578
This is Mr. Ehara, Manami's fiance.

243
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:00,878
I'm Ehara.

244
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:05,278
I've come because I'm also worried about Manami.

245
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,678
Have you told Mr. Ehara about Hiroyuki?

246
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,078
I've told him everything,

247
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:11,978
but he says he'll take her as is, her past inclusive.

248
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:14,578
I see.

249
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,778
And where's Manami?

250
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:18,378
She's in her room changing clothes

251
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,778
and should be coming soon.

252
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:31,478
Welcome to hell.

253
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:34,778
But she sure is late.

254
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:37,078
I'll go check.

255
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:40,978
Manami!

256
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:42,578
I'm opening the door.

257
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:47,678
Dad, come here, quick! Manami's...

258
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:58,778
Why's the room so messed up like this?

259
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:01,078
Dad, the emergency door is open!

260
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,078
The traces of the tires are new, aren't they?

261
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,578
Like they were put here just now.

262
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:09,578
Mr. Mouri, where's Manami?

263
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,578
She could've been kidnapped by someone!

264
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,478
Kidnapped?

265
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,778
Hello?

266
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:19,178
You're President Nakadai, correct?

267
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:20,578
Who's asking?

268
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,578
I have your daughter, Manami.

269
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:23,678
What?

270
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,878
If you want her back safely,

271
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,478
get 100 million yen ready.

272
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,378
100 million?

273
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:33,678
If you contact the police, your daughter is gone.

274
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:38,078
Okay, I'll do as you say so give her safely back to me!

275
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:40,378
I'll call you again an hour later.

276
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,078
Is the perp Hiroyuki?

277
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:47,178
It's very likely.

278
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:50,678
Something's not right.

279
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,978
There must be something behind this kidnapping.

280
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:07,278
We're Sato and Takagi from MPD.

281
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:09,178
Thank you for your cooperation.

282
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,478
Glad to be of help...

283
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:16,778
It doesn't look like it was abandoned.

284
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,778
The perp may be somewhere nearby.

285
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,278
Nearby.

286
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:28,278
There's a possibility the perp may attack partway.

287
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:31,978
Please leave transporting the ransom to me.

288
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,378
Ran.

289
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,378
You had a fluorescent ink marker on you, right?

290
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,678
Yes. But why?

291
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,878
Hey brat, what're you snooping around for?

292
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,278
This is Nakadai.

293
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:51,878
Is the money ready?

294
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:52,978
Yeah.

295
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,678
Put the cash in Manami's yellow bag

296
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,178
and come to Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo.

297
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,778
Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo?

298
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:04,178
Make Kenichiro Ehara bring the ransom.

299
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,878
You want Ehara to bring it?

300
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,478
Come within 30 minutes.

301
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,978
How does he know my name?

302
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:14,078
If the perp is Hiroyuki,

303
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:15,978
it's not surprising that he would know your name

304
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:18,778
being that you're Manami's fiance.

305
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:21,978
Don't tell me he's planning to hurt me or something.

306
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,778
Don't worry. I'm with you!

307
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:28,378
Mr. Ehara, Manami's life is at stake.

308
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:31,578
Do as the perp says.

309
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:32,578
Yes, sir.

310
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:36,078
"The Oita Marine Palace Aquarium Umitamago"

311
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:41,078
Welcome to Oita Marine Palace Aquarium Umitamago.

312
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:46,278
Officer Takagi, there's no one who looks like the perp on this side.

313
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:48,078
Clear here, too.

314
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:51,478
Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo is on the other side of the road,

315
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,378
so I'll try going over there!

316
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:55,878
"Mt. Takasaki Natural Zoo"

317
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,878
It seems there are 1,500 while monkeys here.

318
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:16,378
Really?

319
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:21,478
It seems to be good luck for monkey's to run under your legs.

320
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,278
Look at the number of monkeys here.

321
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:28,478
It may be hard to find them here.

322
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,078
Hey!

323
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:34,578
Hold it!

324
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,178
Over here.

325
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,578
What is it?

326
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,278
Hey! Give it back to me!

327
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:00,378
Hey, Takagi!

328
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:01,678
Mr. Mouri?

329
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,878
We're investigating an abduction.

330
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:07,378
-Don't get in our way. -What?

331
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:10,978
We're here investigating an armed robbery, too.

332
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,978
An armed robbery?

333
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,878
Mr. Mouri!

334
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:18,178
Just as I thought, this is too much of a job for me to take on.

335
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,878
What're you talking about?

336
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,678
Manami's life is at stake.

337
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:26,278
What shall I do?

338
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,478
Hello?

339
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:33,478
Put the bag on top of the monkey rock.

340
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,978
The monkey rock?

341
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:37,978
The monkey rock

342
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:40,478
is a rock that looks like the profile of a monkey.

343
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:43,578
It's said that if a couple finds it they'll attain happiness.

344
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,478
That way!

345
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,078
Over there!

346
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,778
Is it okay for us to climb up there?

347
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,578
Shut up! It's no time to be thinking that way!

348
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:58,478
The perp... Where is he coming from?

349
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:04,078
All we have left to do is to wait for the perp to show up.

350
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,478
Wait!

351
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:20,978

Hey, where's the perp's car?

358
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:16,078
No good, I can't see a thing!
