1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,640
Ya, watermelon, right?

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,940
I didn't forget.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,940
Buy one that looks delicious!

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,640
I know. Geez.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,740
Ran, I'm going over to Dr. Agasa's...

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,340
In other word, you, Kaori Kitasaka,

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,340
you're former member of the Johnan University Deduction Research Club

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,040
and another former member

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,040
"Kaori Kitasaka (27)" -is having a wedding party

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,940
at 4pm today,

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,740
but you don't know where it's being held.

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,440
That is because the host of the party

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,940
in keeping with the name "Deduction Research Club"

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,740
sent you an invitation written in picture puzzle.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,140
Am I right?

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,740
Yes, I couldn't solve that picture puzzle no matter how hard I try.

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,640
And I just happened to pass by here and thought

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,740
if it's you, the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

20
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,140
it may be an easy task.

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,640
Okay, I understand now! You can count on me!

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
I, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri,

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
shall solve the picture puzzle for you in no time at all!

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,040
Hey... are you sure about that?

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,440
So where is that puzzle picture?

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,540
Yes...

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,540
Here it is.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,340
This is...

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,940
I see. This isn't easy to solve.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,940
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,740
are slashed by the light of deduction.

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,440
The stage is set around the vicinity of the Bell Tree Tower.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Solve the mystery of the hall with issues.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,940
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:27,144
"A Coded Invitation"

38
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:31,144
I was never good at deductions or codes.

39
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,544
The only puzzle I could solve was Tanuki Code.

40
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:37,444
Tanuki Code?

41
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,744
It is a beginner's code where a specified letter

42
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:41,344
is omitted from words to make a sentence.

43
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:47,144
-I see. -But why did you join the deduction research club?

44
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,644
That is because...

45
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,444
I got it!

46
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:55,144
The little finger to the index finger stand for trains!

47
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:57,944
What? Did you say trains?

48
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,444
What?

49
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:03,444
Trains have their line colour on them, you see?

50
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,244
This yellow little finger stands for the Sobu Line.

51
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:09,444
The yellow-green ring finger stands for the Yamanote Line.

52
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:12,944
The light blue middle finger stands for the Keihin Tohoku Line.

53
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:16,644
And the red index finger stands for the Chuo Line!

54
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,844
Which means the four train lines run parallel

55
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,744
and the place where the nail of the thumb is,

56
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,744
is where the party is going to be held.

57
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:29,344
I see! It didn't even cross my mind!

58
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,444
But I wonder if there is such a place?

59
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:33,744
Unfortunately, no.

60
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:36,744
But if you rack your brains a bit...

61
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,444
the numbers written on this invitation

62
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:44,444
tell you to look at a 1/25,000-scale map,

63
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:48,744
and place the little finger of the Sobu Line on Akihabara,

64
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:50,644
then place the ring finger of the Yamanote Line

65
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:53,044
and the middle finger of the Keihin Tohoku Line

66
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,444
on this line between Akihabara and Kanda,

67
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:58,644
and place the Chuo Line of this index finger

68
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:02,044
on the line between Ochanomizu and Kanda.

69
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:07,544
By doing so, the place that the nail of the thumb indicates is...

70
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,044
Kanda Ogawamachi!

71
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,744
Kanda Ogawamachi?

72
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:16,644
Then, the picture of the river refers to Ogawa?

73
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:20,844
But the finger on the guide map is pointing straight

74
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:23,644
and your hand is curved.

75
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:26,444
Stop getting hung up on small details!

76
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:28,644
Hey...

77
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:34,844
How about it? Does this location mean anything to you?

78
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,444
It does!

79
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:40,444
The Johnan University Hall is in second district of Kanda Ogawamachi!

80
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:41,744
Really?

81
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:42,744
I knew it!

82
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:46,144
The party must be being held at that hall!

83
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,144
You're amazing, dad!

84
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,444
You gotta be kidding me.

85
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:53,144
Thank you very much!

86
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,344
Now I can attend the party!

87
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:56,944
How much do I need to pay you?

88
00:05:56,944 --> 00:06:01,044
No... I can't possibly take money from you for such an easy task.

89
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,444
What? But...

90
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,944
You don't have to pay me.

91
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:09,944
I'm sorry. Thank you for your kindness.

92
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:13,944
Thank you very much.

93
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,544
Please stop by anytime again if something comes up!

94
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,944
Yes, I will. Goodbye!

95
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:31,144
Since we're making it together, let's make something big!

96
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,744
How about creating an insect forest

97
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:36,244
by making a lot of paper insects?

98
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:39,144
How about an aquarium where a lot of fish are swimming?

99
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:42,144
An airport could be fun too!

100
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:48,444
So, you're not convinced of Kogoro's deduction after all, right?

101
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,444
Well, to put it accurately,

102
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:54,444
the train line color of the Chuo Line isn't red but vermillion.

103
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:58,444
And as for the other colors, red, blue, yellow and green,

104
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:01,444
I tried replacing all of them with corresponding colors

105
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:04,344
but nothing fits in.

106
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:06,344
What about the subways?

107
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,444
I thought about that too,

108
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:12,044
but there are no yellow train lines to begin with.

109
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,344
Bridge?

110
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:18,644
I see!

111
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:21,744
That is what that left hand meant.

112
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:24,744
Oh, no! I've got to let her know right away!

113
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,944
Sorry, I'm leaving the rest up to you!

114
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,944
-Conan? -Conan!

115
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,144
It seems that he has solved the problem.

116
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:33,444
I guess so.

117
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:36,044
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What?

118
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,044
It's not Kanda Ogawamachi?

119
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:40,744
Yes! Look at this map.

120
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:44,344
The river that was drawn on that picture puzzle is Sumida River.

121
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,344
The colors of the bridges over that river

122
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:49,144
"Kuramai Bridge" -are yellow for Kuramai Bridge,

123
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:52,444
"Umaya Bridge" -yellowish green for Umaya Bridge,

124
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,744
"Komagata Bridge" -blue for Komagata Bridge

125
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:58,744
"Azuma Bridge" -and red for Azuma Bridge.

126
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,844
In other words, the color of the nails

127
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:03,644
indicated the four bridges.

128
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:06,344
That's amazing, Conan.

129
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:08,744
You have a copy of the picture puzzle, don't you?

130
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:10,744
What? Yes.

131
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:13,044
If you place the nails of the hand of the guide map

132
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:16,044
onto the corresponding bridges,

133
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:19,044
the location of the thumb points to...

134
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,744
The Bell Tree Tower?

135
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:22,944
Then, is this where the party is going to be held?

136
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:27,044
But, the hall of the university is in Kanda Ogawamachi.

137
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,244
No mistake about it!

138
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:31,544
I confirmed by calling the Bell Tree Tower a while ago.

139
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,344
-What? -I was told that the Johnan University Deduction Research Club

140
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:38,144
is reserving a restaurant that hasn't opened yet

141
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,644
and is holding a wedding party there at 4pm today.

142
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:44,344
Dad, you've got to call Kaori right away and let her know!

143
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:45,744
I know.

144
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:49,944
The number you have called is not in service at this time.

145
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:53,444
-The number... -This is strange, the number is wrong.

146
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,744
-What? -You've got to call her cell phone,

147
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,344
not her home phone.

148
00:08:57,344 --> 00:09:00,144
I'm sure Kaori is still out somewhere.

149
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,444
Oh, I guess so.

150
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,944
Wait a second.

151
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,444
I wonder why

152
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,644
Kaori give you a wrong number for her home phone.

153
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,744
She probably just made a mistake.

154
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,444
But it's her home phone.

155
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:14,044
Would anyone make such a mistake?

156
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:17,144
Then she wrote down a wrong number on purpose.

157
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,944
There are people like that at times.

158
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:22,744
They leave false information because they don't want their family

159
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,944
to find out they visited a detective agency.

160
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,444
But Kaori just wanted to know

161
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,444
where the wedding party was going to be held, right?

162
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,444
That is not something that she wouldn't want her family to know, is it?

163
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:36,144
How would I know? Cut out your nonsense!

164
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,844
Yes?

165
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,144
Hello, is this Kaori?

166
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:44,244
Mouri here. The fact is...

167
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:48,644
I see! I'm at the university hall in Ogawamachi right now.

168
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:51,744
And I was getting worried because the party wasn't taking place here.

169
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,644
So it's the Bell Tree Tower?

170
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,244
Thank you very much.

171
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:58,644
No problem. Take care.

172
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:02,144
I'm glad that she'll probably make it in time for the party.

173
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:06,944
I wonder why Kaori give us her real cell phone number,

174
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:10,644
but lied about her home phone.

175
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:15,744
Although she said she just happened to pass by,

176
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:19,144
I wonder if anyone would visit a detective agency just like that.

177
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:23,444
Did you ask anything about Kaori's family?

178
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:26,644
Yes, it seems that Kaori is single

179
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:28,844
and living with her parents.

180
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,444
Was there anything strange about her

181
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:33,744
when she was writing down her home phone number?

182
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,044
What? No!

183
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:38,844
What a nuisance!

184
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:43,844
Come to think of it, after she wrote down her cell phone...

185
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:47,844
Should I write down my home phone number too?

186
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,844
Yes, if it's okay with you.

187
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:03,444
Maybe she only lied about the last digit.

188
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,044
Yes, this is the Kitasaka residence.

189
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:16,044
Oh, no! I was so desperate looking for her phone number

190
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:18,444
that I haven't think of anything to say!

191
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,444
Hello?

192
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:22,944
Well... I'm Conan Edogawa.

193
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,744
Conan Edogawa?

194
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,744
What? Conan?

195
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:28,644
-Excuse me, may I... -Oh, sure.

196
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,444
Hello, Conan? This is Officer Sato from the Metropolitan Police Department.

197
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,444
Officer Sato?

198
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:47,895
I'm at Mr. Kitasaka's house with Officer Takagi now.

199
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,695
Why are you calling this house, Conan?

200
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,595
Why are you there, Officer Sato?

201
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,295
Did an incident come up?

202
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,595
What? Well...

203
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:01,295
I'll put Pops on the line now.

204
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,295
This is Mouri, did something come up at the Kitasaka residence?

205
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,595
Mr. Mouri?

206
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:08,995
What happened? Maybe I can help.

207
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,995
The fact is a pistol was lost.

208
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,995
What? A pistol?

209
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:19,995
Yes. The lost pistol was an Imperial Japanese Army-issue Type

210
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:22,395
14 Nambu semi-automatic pistol.

211
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:26,295
The pistol seems to have been found

212
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,995
when Mr. Michio Kitasawa sorting through the belongings

213
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:32,995
of his late father, Nobuyoshi, who passed away last year.

214
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:35,295
Of course, military pistols

215
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,995
are supposed to be reported to the police as soon as it has found

216
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:43,695
but it seems that Mr. Michio kept it along with 5 bullets

217
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,895
as a precious keepsake of his father.

218
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,395
I see.

219
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:49,795
So, that pistol was lost.

220
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:50,895
Yes.

221
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,895
It doesn't look like anyone broke in to steal it.

222
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:55,595
If it is taken out of the house,

223
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:59,495
the only one who can think of doing this is their daughter, Kaori.

224
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:05,295
Kaori left this morning after saying that she was going to attend

225
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,895
a wedding party of her senior,

226
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:10,195
but she didn't look quite herself then.

227
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,295
They say that she looked depressed.

228
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:15,595
-What? -From what we've heard from her parents,

229
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:20,295
it seems that the senior was two-timing Kaori

230
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:22,895
and the other girl, who is his fiance,

231
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,895
and eventually dumped Kaori.

232
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,895
Hey, then...

233
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:31,495
Yes. Mr. Michio realised that the pistol was gone,

234
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:34,995
and tried several times to call Kaori but couldn't establish a connection.

235
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:38,295
That is why they contacted the police.

236
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:41,495
We were thinking of checking

237
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:43,295
where the wedding party was going to be held.

238
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,495
I know where the party is going to be held!

239
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,495
-It's at the Bell Tree Tower! -What?

240
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:54,695
But is Kaori really the one who took the pistol?

241
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,295
When she came to the agency,

242
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,195
Kaori was holding a large clutch bag, wasn't she?

243
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,695
What? Yes.

244
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:05,395
When she was getting ready to leave,

245
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:09,295
she probably had the pistol in that bag.

246
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:10,995
-What? -Besides,

247
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:15,195
did you notice that Kaori was wearing low-heeled shoes?

248
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:21,195
Yes. I was thinking that it would be better

249
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,995
if she wear higher heels since she was going to a party.

250
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,695
She was probably wearing low-heeled shoes...

251
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:29,995
To stabilise herself

252
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,295
so that she wouldn't miss the target when she fires the pistol.

253
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,995
What? Then she really did...

254
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:39,695
Kaori was bad at deductions or codes,

255
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,695
she joined the Deduction Research Club

256
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:46,195
might be because she loves the senior.

257
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:49,995
This is bad! We won't make it in time.

258
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:53,695
How? What can I do?

259
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,995
Conan?

260
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:06,195
I hope this can somehow make her have second thoughts!

261
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:23,395
"Reserved"

262
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:39,595
Thank you all for coming here today

263
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,295
to celebrate this happy occasion!

264
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:44,695
Did you all figure out this party hall right away?

265
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:46,495
Well, how could we?

266
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,595
Yonekura is not even here yet!

267
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:51,495
Yes... we'll hear you all out later.

268
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,995
Let's call the bride and groom over now!

269
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:04,195
Congrats...

270
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:07,195
First, we'd like to start with a speech

271
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,695
from our groom who is filled with happiness.

272
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,695
I wonder if Kaori is still not here.

273
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,295
No, if she came here from Kanda Ogawamachi,

274
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:16,295
she should've been here long before.

275
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,295
Kaori...

276
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,995
Dad!

277
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:36,995
Kaori!

278
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:51,695
Don't do it!

279
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,595
Don't do it, Kaori!

280
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,495
What did you say when you proposed?

281
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:09,295
Well, you really want me to say that?

282
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,995
Kaori?

283
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,595
Kaori.

284
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:32,395
Kaori!

285
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:38,695
Congratulations, Mr. Nagai.

286
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,495
Thank you, Kaori.

287
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:03,295
I'm glad you didn't go through with it.

288
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,895
Little boy.

289
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:09,295
Pops went down stairs together with the other officers.

290
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:12,995
It seems like he mistook someone else for you.

291
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,495
A while ago,

292
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,595
when I was trying to head to the party hall...

293
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:31,895
"You have a message"

294
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,895
"To Kaori"

295
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:47,695
At first, I didn't know what was written,

296
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:52,595
but when I read the mail ignoring the characters "ke" and "i",

297
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:56,995
it was interpreted as, "I'm glad that you got to split with him."

298
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:01,795
At that time,

299
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:06,695
all the feelings I had vanished like an ebb tide.

300
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:13,695
I was sure that you'd be able to decode the Tanuki Code.

301
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,695
What? Then, this message didn't come from Mr. Mouri?

302
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,395
Conan!

303
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,395
Kaori!

304
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:30,195
Kaori, you said that you just happened to pass by the agency

305
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:34,895
but I'll bet you came to the agency on purpose

306
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:38,995
because you wanted Pops to solve the problem, right?

307
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:43,595
Yes, I used the great Detective Mouri.

308
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,195
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:51,295
No... don't worry about it.

310
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:52,995
Ms. Kaori Kitasaka.

311
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,695
Yes.

312
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:56,295
I'm Officer Sato from the First Investigation Division

313
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:57,495
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

314
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:59,695
I'm Officer Takagi from the same division.

315
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:15,095
Ms. Kitasaka, please come with us.

316
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,195
Yes.

317
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,295
Little boy, your name is Conan, right?

318
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:27,895
Yes, Conan Edogawa. A detective.

319
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:33,495
Thank you, little detective.

320
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:08,495
In the end, papers were filed against Kaori and her father, Mr. Michio,

321
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:11,295
for breach of the Swords and Firearms Control Law.

322
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:13,295
But, all charges against them were dropped.

323
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:14,995
Thus, the tragic pistol incident that never came to be

324
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,695
was safely solved.

325
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,695
Come to think of it,

326
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:22,295
Sonoko invited us to visit the Tohto Bell Tree Tower tomorrow.

327
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:23,895
This is something to looking forward to it, isn't it?

328
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:25,295
I'm looking forward to it!

329
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:26,895
I hope the weather is good.

330
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:30,595
I'll make a "keep away the rain" charm.

331
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:33,195
I have to accompany them again.

332
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,295
There are a lot of tasty restaurants

333
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:41,695
-near the Bell Tree Tower, aren't there? -We had no idea at that time,

334
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:47,495
-Let's have eels over rice for lunch. -there is another sniper case

335
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:51,195
was waiting for us at the Bell Tree Tower.

336
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:54,495
"Next Episode"

337
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:56,595
Just as expected of a great detective,

338
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:59,995
figuring out the hide-out of Thief K!

339
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:03,595
So, you've finally appeared, Thief K!

340
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:15,595
Gosh. Where on earth is he?

341
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:16,995
Next Conan,

342
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:19,695
"The Secret of the Kogoro Mouri Statue"

343
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:39,295
Next Conan's Hint:

344
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,395
"Basketball"

345
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,695
The movie will be released from today.

346
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:43,995
The theme song is great!

347
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:45,695
I love the singer too!
