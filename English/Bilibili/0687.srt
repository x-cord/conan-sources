1
00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:05.724
Conan!

2
00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:07.024
Ai!

3
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:08.324
Dr. Agasa!

4
00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:12.124
Fantastic!

5
00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:14.324
It's monster Gomera.

6
00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:15.424
Beautiful.

7
00:00:15.424 --> 00:00:17.324
It's sure made superbly.

8
00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:20.724
It seems like their putting a lot of work into it this year.

9
00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:22.124
Of course.

10
00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:25.524
"Mika Itakura (27)" -It's been a long time, Dr. Agasa.

11
00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.424
Mika.

12
00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:30.924
All of you, she's Ms. Mika Itakura

13
00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:32.624
who invited us here.

14
00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:35.724
She's the executive chairperson of this festival.

15
00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:38.224
Welcome to the Ice Festival.

16
00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:39.724
Are you all enjoying yourselves?

17
00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.024
Yes!

18
00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:46.124
The two over there don't look too happy though.

19
00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:47.124
Not true.

20
00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:48.624
We are.

21
00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:51.424
Ai is sort of a little snobbish at times, right?

22
00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.724
Conan is sassy.

23
00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:58.324
They both lack child like characteristics.

24
00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.024
Oh, really?

25
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:04.724
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

26
00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:06.924
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

27
00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:08.624
The Ice Hotel where even the beds are made of ice.

28
00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:10.524
What is the trick of the locked door murder?

29
00:01:10.524 --> 00:01:12.124
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:14.224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.724
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.621
"Unsolvable Ice Trap"

33
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:12.021
I've been friends with Mika's father from long before.

34
00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:15.221
My father used to be the village head for this village before.

35
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.521
I'm sorry about your father, though.

36
00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:21.821
Yes, well...

37
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.121
You mean your father...

38
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.821
e died of a traffice accident last year.

39
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:29.921
The brakes of the car he was driving malfunctioned.

40
00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:36.221
What the... What's with that man?

41
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:39.221
Mr. Shiota.

42
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:50.621
Super cool!

43
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:52.321
Mr. Shiota is a great ice sculptor

44
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.521
who has credits of winning first prize at world tournaments.

45
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.921
-Awesome! -Awesome...

46
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:06.021
"Tetsuya Shiota (43)" -Thank you.

47
00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:09.521
Comments straightforward like yours make me happiest.

48
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:11.821
Almost all the sculptures here

49
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:14.221
are made by Mr. Shiota.

50
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.821
I was able to become a sculptor

51
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:21.121
only thanks to the support I received from Mika's father.

52
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.221
This is just a little token of my appreciation.

53
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.021
Mr. Shiota.

54
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:28.021
Besides, I didn't make it all by myself.

55
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:31.521
I made it along with all the people of the village.

56
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.921
It sure looks as if the whole village cooperated.

57
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.121
Yes, everybody loves this festival.

58
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:42.021
Well, it'll all end this year though.

59
00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:43.121
Village head, Mr. Yamaguchi.

60
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:47.021
"It'll end this year", just what does that mean?

61
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:48.821
"Taro Yamaguchi(61)" -I'm saying that this year is the last

62
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.121
we'll see of a worthless festival like this.

63
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.121
What?

64
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.621
That's something only you alone have decided, isn't it?

65
00:04:54.621 --> 00:04:57.921
Now that's not pleasant to the ears.

66
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:01.221
"Kazuyuki Ogi (34)" -It was decided at the village assembly.

67
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:03.021
After all...

68
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:05.521
Just because we continued this festival,

69
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:08.021
God knows how much burden it put on the finances of this village

70
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:10.321
and threw us into the red?

71
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.321
In order for this village to make it through,

72
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:16.621
there's no other choice than bring the Tohto Resort Hotel here.

73
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:20.321
And, thanks to the Ice Hotels that you built,

74
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.421
everything went well.

75
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.421
Yes.

76
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:27.521
The people of Tohto Resort really loved it.

77
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.021
Well, really go for it this time,

78
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:33.821
so as to decorate the end of all this.

79
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:37.621
Tomorrow, I'll be signing a contract with Tohto Resort.

80
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.521
So now, the financial rut of this village will be saved.

81
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:42.121
It's something that the previous village head, Mr. Itakura

82
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:43.521
never could've done.

83
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:44.721
To be honest,

84
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:47.821
it was good that he crossed over.

85
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:49.121
What a thing to say!

86
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.821
You're the one who killed him!

87
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:52.221
How dare you say that!

88
00:05:52.221 --> 00:05:54.121
Not that again.

89
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:57.121
The police even said that it was an accident, didn't they?

90
00:05:57.121 --> 00:06:00.721
But, father left saying that he was going to see you.

91
00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:02.121
He couldn't have possibly gotten into an accident

92
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.421
in a remote rural place like that.

93
00:06:03.421 --> 00:06:06.121
Who I didn't see, I didn't see!

94
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:13.221
The main gate?

95
00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:18.621
Cancel! Cancel the festival!

96
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.621
With the main gate the way it is,

97
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:22.321
we couldn't possibly continue.

98
00:06:22.321 --> 00:06:24.521
I'll bet you did this?

99
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.421
In order to cancel the festival.

100
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:28.821
Enough! I don't have to do something like this,

101
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.921
because it's not going to be after this year anyway.

102
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.121
Hurry up and clean it up!

103
00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:34.221
The festival is cancelled!

104
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:36.621
No, it won't be cancelled.

105
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:39.621
I'll fix it up by morning!

106
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.721
You don't have anything against that, do you?

107
00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:47.021
Mika, you'll help me, won't you?

108
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.021
Yes!

109
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.221
Mr. Agasa, we'll take things from here,

110
00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:57.921
so please go ahead and rest.

111
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:59.421
No, but...

112
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.021
Yes, please do so.

113
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:04.721
Besides, I'd like children to stay over at the Ice Hotel too.

114
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.921
-Ice Hotel? -Ice Hotel?

115
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:09.321
It's the hotel, right?

116
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:10.621
That's right.

117
00:07:10.621 --> 00:07:13.921
The Ice Hotel is something that Mr. Shiota proposed

118
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:15.921
to heighten excitement for the festival.

119
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:19.221
But, that actually worked against me.

120
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:21.121
What do you mean?

121
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:24.421
It's true that the village is in grave financial trouble.

122
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:26.321
Therefore, the village head is planning

123
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.721
to call the Tohto Resort Hotel people over.

124
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.721
But, since there's nothing really attractive about this village,

125
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:34.621
they didn't really give a good answer.

126
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:39.921
However, the Ice Hotel that we made caught the village head's eyes.

127
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:42.221
So he used it to continue negotiations of them coming over

128
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:44.621
and captured their interest.

129
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.521
The Ice Hotel that I made for the festival,

130
00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:51.921
ironically helped in driving the festival to end.

131
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:55.121
I shouldn't have made something like that.

132
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:56.521
Please don't say that.

133
00:07:56.521 --> 00:08:00.421
That Ice Hotel is our pride and joy.

134
00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:03.121
See, please take a look at it to all or you.

135
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.221
It's fantastic.

136
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:11.221
It's splendid.

137
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:13.721
Is that all made of ice?

138
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:14.821
That's right!

139
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:18.421
Won't we freeze sleeping in a place like this?

140
00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:20.621
There's animal fur on the bed

141
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:23.021
and if you sleep in the sleeping bag, you'll be fine.

142
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:28.221
Can't you even estimate something of this level?

143
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:32.121
When on earth are you going to become a full-fledged worker,

144
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:34.521
you good-for-nothing!

145
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:36.021
I... I'm sorry.

146
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.421
Go and fix it by morning.

147
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.021
Darn old fart.

148
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.521
Who the heck does he think he is?

149
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.321
Is the village head going to stay over here too?

150
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:57.521
Yeah, before the contract with Tohto Resort

151
00:08:57.521 --> 00:09:01.521
he says he's going to confirm how it feels to sleep here.

152
00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:04.721
So, the dome that you're sleeping in is this way.

153
00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:08.521
This is fantastic!

154
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.921
It's super fluffy!

155
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.621
This sort of looks like a coffin.

156
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:22.021
What good taste, no?

157
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:26.621
Then, rest well, okay?

158
00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:28.021
Yes!

159
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:47.621
It's cold.

160
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:11.421
I wonder if the gate's fixed already?

161
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:14.121
I'm sure it'll be okay, because everybody was helping.

162
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:17.721
I'm sure a fantastic one is being made.

163
00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:21.221
-I'm excited. -What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

164
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:24.821
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko? Are you hungry?

165
00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:27.221
-The thing is... -Village head!

166
00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:29.321
Please get a hold of yourself! Village head!

167
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:34.721
What's the matter?

168
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:36.921
The village head...

169
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:42.821
This is...

170
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:45.321
It's burnt?

171
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:50.921
A strangulation mark.

172
00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:52.821
But, this bed...

173
00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:54.321
Something about it is...

174
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.221
Conan?

175
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.021
Call the police!

176
00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:01.021
The village head's dead.

177
00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:16.488
The cause of death is strangulation.

178
00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:19.588
The estimated time of death...

179
00:11:19.588 --> 00:11:21.388
"Inspector Haraguchi (31)" -is around 2:00 am?

180
00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:22.388
Judging from the fact

181
00:11:22.388 --> 00:11:24.288
that there are no traces of strangulation on the back of his neck,

182
00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:26.688
it is thought that the culprit attacked the victim while asleep

183
00:11:26.688 --> 00:11:29.488
using a narrow string as a weapon

184
00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:32.288
and pushed it against his neck from on top the sleeping bag.

185
00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:35.188
It bothers me that the neck part of the sleeping bag

186
00:11:35.188 --> 00:11:36.488
has a string-like burn mark on it.

187
00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:40.088
Are you saying that I killed him?

188
00:11:40.088 --> 00:11:41.188
It's a fact that I suspected the village head

189
00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:42.388
to be responsible for my father's death but,

190
00:11:42.388 --> 00:11:44.488
that doesn't mean that I'd...

191
00:11:44.488 --> 00:11:46.188
But...

192
00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:47.988
it seems that you had a pretty violent argument with him

193
00:11:47.988 --> 00:11:50.688
about the festival too, didn't you?

194
00:11:50.688 --> 00:11:52.088
That's...

195
00:11:52.088 --> 00:11:55.588
What happened to your hand?

196
00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:58.088
I burned myself last night when I was working

197
00:11:58.088 --> 00:12:01.588
and mistakenly touched the barrel with fire.

198
00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:03.788
You burned yourself.

199
00:12:03.788 --> 00:12:05.388
To tell you the truth,

200
00:12:05.388 --> 00:12:08.088
there was a burn mark on the village head's sleeping bag.

201
00:12:08.088 --> 00:12:09.688
Just what're you trying to get at?

202
00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:14.488
She was working with us all last night fixing the gate.

203
00:12:14.488 --> 00:12:19.188
She would've had no time to kill the village head.

204
00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:20.888
All night through?

205
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:24.988
I left to go get some tools twice,

206
00:12:24.988 --> 00:12:28.188
but there are many other witnesses.

207
00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:30.188
I see.

208
00:12:30.188 --> 00:12:31.588
By the way, Mr. Shiota,

209
00:12:31.588 --> 00:12:34.588
what time did you leave the workshop?

210
00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:36.688
About 12 midnight and 4:00 a.m.

211
00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:38.488
I left only for about 10 minutes both times.

212
00:12:38.488 --> 00:12:40.588
Officer.

213
00:12:40.588 --> 00:12:43.888
It seems that the entrance was locked,

214
00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.688
but how did the culprit get inside?

215
00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:48.388
I'm sure there's a spare key.

216
00:12:48.388 --> 00:12:51.388
Mr. Ogi, the village head's secretary has one.

217
00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:52.988
It's a specially made key,

218
00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:56.588
so only two could be mad, including the master key.

219
00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:58.788
Why do you have the spare key?

220
00:12:58.788 --> 00:13:02.788
I was in charge of waking him up in the morning.

221
00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:03.988
That's why...

222
00:13:03.988 --> 00:13:07.188
In other words, after the village head locked the entrance,

223
00:13:07.188 --> 00:13:11.188
the only one who could go in and out of the dome was you?

224
00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:12.688
Hey...

225
00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:16.188
Where you last night at around 2:00 am?

226
00:13:16.188 --> 00:13:18.588
I was at the village office making documents.

227
00:13:18.588 --> 00:13:21.388
Is there anyone who can verify that for you?

228
00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:22.988
I was alone.

229
00:13:22.988 --> 00:13:25.088
But, I didn't do it.

230
00:13:25.088 --> 00:13:26.288
It's true.

231
00:13:27.788 --> 00:13:31.088
Mr. Ogi was the only one who had the spare key.

232
00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:32.588
Nor, does he have an alibi.

233
00:13:32.588 --> 00:13:35.288
But, I wonder if he'd commit the crime

234
00:13:35.288 --> 00:13:37.388
knowing that he'd be the most suspected?

235
00:13:39.088 --> 00:13:41.288
What's that hole?

236
00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:42.988
Come to think of it, that bed...

237
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.788
there's something strange about it.

238
00:13:45.788 --> 00:13:47.788
Did you find something?

239
00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:49.588
Yeah, there's a strange hole here...

240
00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:51.788
Trying to get all the credit again!

241
00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:53.788
We've got to cooperate in the investigation too...

242
00:13:54.788 --> 00:13:56.388
Hey, are you all right?

243
00:13:56.388 --> 00:13:59.488
Really, it's dangerous to run.

244
00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:02.688
But, I wonder why ice is so slippery?

245
00:14:02.688 --> 00:14:05.688
It's not the ice that's slippery, it's the water!

246
00:14:05.688 --> 00:14:06.988
Water?

247
00:14:06.988 --> 00:14:08.788
Because ice has the characteristic of melting

248
00:14:08.788 --> 00:14:10.888
when pressure is applied to it.

249
00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:14.488
See! The weight of your body is on your feet, right?

250
00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:17.288
So, that's why ice melts?

251
00:14:17.288 --> 00:14:18.588
Exactly.

252
00:14:18.588 --> 00:14:21.688
And because of that water, friction weakens,

253
00:14:21.688 --> 00:14:23.888
making it slippery.

254
00:14:23.888 --> 00:14:27.588
But, there's no water anywhere.

255
00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:29.288
That's because when the pressure disappears,

256
00:14:29.288 --> 00:14:31.488
it naturally goes back to ice...

257
00:14:31.488 --> 00:14:32.688
Wait a second.

258
00:14:32.688 --> 00:14:34.388
Maybe this hole...

259
00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:38.288
Mitsuhiko, what is it?

260
00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:40.088
You don't look too well.

261
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.188
To tell the truth, I saw it...

262
00:14:42.188 --> 00:14:44.088
What did you see?

263
00:14:44.088 --> 00:14:46.288
The village head's ghost.

264
00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:50.588
It was around 4:00 this morning.

265
00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:52.488
On my way back from the restroom.

266
00:14:53.488 --> 00:14:54.888
It's cold.

267
00:15:01.588 --> 00:15:05.688
A willo-the-wisp was flying around the village head's dome!

268
00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:07.488
-No joke! -No!

269
00:15:08.488 --> 00:15:09.788
So that's it.

270
00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:12.288
That's the story.

271
00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:14.088
That's why I'm telling you, it's not me!

272
00:15:14.088 --> 00:15:17.088
-Please believe me! -Well, you can tell us the details at the station.

273
00:15:17.088 --> 00:15:18.488
Hold it there.

274
00:15:20.488 --> 00:15:23.988
I've finally figured it out, the truth of the case.

275
00:15:23.988 --> 00:15:25.788
Truth or no truth,

276
00:15:25.788 --> 00:15:28.888
the only one who was able to go in the dome was Mr. Ogi.

277
00:15:28.888 --> 00:15:30.988
He didn't have to go in!

278
00:15:32.088 --> 00:15:36.188
The weapon choked the village head's neck on its own.

279
00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:39.088
Hey!

280
00:15:39.088 --> 00:15:40.288
Conan!

281
00:15:40.288 --> 00:15:42.088
We found it.

282
00:15:44.988 --> 00:15:47.788
What are you planning to start with something like that?

283
00:15:47.788 --> 00:15:48.988
Oh, well...

284
00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:53.088
You're going to explain the trick, right?

285
00:15:53.088 --> 00:15:56.088
That's right, I'm explaining the trick.

286
00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.888
That pillar of ice in the dome

287
00:15:58.888 --> 00:16:00.188
where the village head was found dead.

288
00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:04.188
The PET bottle and string are the weapons that killed him.

289
00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:08.988
Watch closely, okay?

290
00:16:19.588 --> 00:16:21.188
The string.

291
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:23.188
The string's going inside?

292
00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:26.888
When pressure is applied to ice, it melts.

293
00:16:26.888 --> 00:16:29.288
It's true that the string is going in on its own.

294
00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:32.588
But, I wonder if things would work out all that well?

295
00:16:32.588 --> 00:16:34.988
Won't there be traces of the ice having melted?

296
00:16:34.988 --> 00:16:37.888
There's no need to worry about that.

297
00:16:37.888 --> 00:16:40.588
Watch closely the part that has melted.

298
00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:44.788
True.

299
00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:46.188
It's frozen again!

300
00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:47.588
This is?

301
00:16:47.588 --> 00:16:49.988
I see, regelation.

302
00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:51.188
Oh, well...

303
00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:53.488
Melted ice immediately freezes back to its normal state

304
00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:56.688
when pressure is removed.

305
00:16:56.688 --> 00:17:00.188
The culprit, waited until the village head fell asleep

306
00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:03.988
and set that trick up outside the dome.

307
00:17:03.988 --> 00:17:07.288
This way, he could kill the village head

308
00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:09.988
no matter where he was.

309
00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:12.988
If so, the most suspicious person would be...

310
00:17:12.988 --> 00:17:14.188
Please wait.

311
00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:16.888
She didn't have time to get rid of the weapon.

312
00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:20.288
Did she need time to do that?

313
00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:21.988
Just what are you talking about?

314
00:17:21.988 --> 00:17:23.988
Mika is a woman.

315
00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:26.788
In order for her to carry away a weight as heavy as to kill a person,

316
00:17:26.788 --> 00:17:27.988
she would need a lot of time.

317
00:17:27.988 --> 00:17:30.788
What if she didn't carry anything?

318
00:17:30.788 --> 00:17:34.188
Hey, Conan! Is... is this okay?

319
00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:35.188
Yeah.

320
00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:40.988
That's the weight that the culprit used!

321
00:17:42.988 --> 00:17:45.388
This is... Glass!

322
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:50.288
On first glance, you wouldn't be able to tell whether it's ice or not.

323
00:17:50.288 --> 00:17:52.588
And, you can leave it behind at the site.

324
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:55.688
All that needs to be done later is to pull the string out of the dome...

325
00:17:58.288 --> 00:18:00.188
It won't come off!

326
00:18:00.188 --> 00:18:03.188
Of course it won't, because it's frozen.

327
00:18:03.188 --> 00:18:06.788
Then, this trick won't do.

328
00:18:06.788 --> 00:18:10.388
That's why the culprit used this.

329
00:18:10.388 --> 00:18:13.988
I see. All he needed to do was burn the string.

330
00:18:13.988 --> 00:18:18.088
That's why the village head's sleeping bag was burnt.

331
00:18:18.088 --> 00:18:22.688
But, will a string that is in ice burn so easily?

332
00:18:22.688 --> 00:18:25.088
It will!

333
00:18:25.088 --> 00:18:28.088
Sonny, will this do?

334
00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:29.988
Yes, thank you.

335
00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:32.888
This magnesium ribbon was used, right?

336
00:18:32.888 --> 00:18:34.488
Oh, I see.

337
00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:39.388
If so, even if it's inside ice it'll burn violently.

338
00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:46.688
So, this is the identity of the willow-the-wisp I saw.

339
00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:49.988
So, this was why the sleeping bag was burnt.

340
00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:54.088
This is

341
00:18:54.088 --> 00:18:56.388
It's a chemical compound that is created

342
00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:59.888
when magnesium is burned, magnesium oxide.

343
00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:01.688
If you check, there should be the same thing

344
00:19:01.688 --> 00:19:03.688
inside the dome too.

345
00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:06.188
-Get the forensics! -Yes, sir!

346
00:19:06.188 --> 00:19:09.488
If so, it wouldn't take five minutes to put everything away, would it?

347
00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:10.988
But, I didn't...

348
00:19:10.988 --> 00:19:14.888
Right. You're not the culprit, Mika.

349
00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.188
But...

350
00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:18.688
In order to carry out this trick successfully,

351
00:19:18.688 --> 00:19:21.888
you'd have to determine the position the village head would sleep in,

352
00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:25.988
because you can't tell in what position the bed is, from outside.

353
00:19:25.988 --> 00:19:28.388
True. But, then...

354
00:19:28.388 --> 00:19:31.888
The only person that has means to know this is...

355
00:19:31.888 --> 00:19:37.488
the person who design this Ice Hotel, you, Mr. Shiota!

356
00:19:38.788 --> 00:19:40.288
No.

357
00:19:41.688 --> 00:19:42.788
Please wait.

358
00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:44.288
Although I'm the one who designed this hotel,

359
00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:46.688
I had no way of knowing where the village head would be sleeping.

360
00:19:46.688 --> 00:19:48.488
The size of the bed in the VIP room

361
00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:51.188
was the exact fit for the village head.

362
00:19:51.188 --> 00:19:53.088
I thought it was strange,

363
00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:54.488
that the dome being as large as it was,

364
00:19:54.488 --> 00:19:56.788
the bed was a bit too small.

365
00:19:56.788 --> 00:20:02.188
That bed was made to fit the small framed body of the village head.

366
00:20:02.188 --> 00:20:05.288
Proof, do you have proof?

367
00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:08.088
The proof is the white powder

368
00:20:08.088 --> 00:20:10.088
that is on Mr. Shiota's sleeve.

369
00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:13.088
That got on when he burned the weapon.

370
00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.588
That's probably magnesium oxide.

371
00:20:16.588 --> 00:20:19.288
Mr. Shiota, please say something.

372
00:20:19.288 --> 00:20:20.688
It's okay already, Mika.

373
00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:23.988
I thought that it'd work out okay.

374
00:20:23.988 --> 00:20:25.888
Mr. Shiota.

375
00:20:25.888 --> 00:20:29.588
Mr. Shiota why did you kill the village head?

376
00:20:29.588 --> 00:20:33.588
I heard the conversation of the two.

377
00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:37.688
It was the other day,

378
00:20:37.688 --> 00:20:40.788
when I went to the village office to do something...

379
00:20:41.788 --> 00:20:44.288
Get the contract, no matter what it takes.

380
00:20:44.288 --> 00:20:45.388
Yes, sir!

381
00:20:45.388 --> 00:20:49.388
I can't go on covering up using village money anymore.

382
00:20:49.388 --> 00:20:50.988
There's no guarantee that somebody like Itakura,

383
00:20:50.988 --> 00:20:52.688
who found out would appear again.

384
00:20:52.688 --> 00:20:54.188
Rest assured.

385
00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:55.388
If something like that should happen,

386
00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:57.288
I'll rig the car again.

387
00:20:58.288 --> 00:20:59.788
Oh no!

388
00:20:59.788 --> 00:21:01.488
Yamaguchi had been using up the expenses

389
00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:03.888
for the festival from before.

390
00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.088
And, they had the nerve to do what they did to Mr. Itakura

391
00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:07.188
who found out about it.

392
00:21:07.188 --> 00:21:09.388
No, that's...

393
00:21:09.388 --> 00:21:12.188
It's best that you be honest about it.

394
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.588
It can easily be checked.

395
00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:17.288
Father...

396
00:21:17.288 --> 00:21:19.988
Father's life was taken by scums like them.

397
00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.788
Moreover, Mr. Shiota ended up using his Ice Hotel

398
00:21:22.788 --> 00:21:25.488
as a tool to commit murder.

399
00:21:25.488 --> 00:21:31.188
He did it to get a hold of an iron wall alibi for you, Mika.

400
00:21:31.188 --> 00:21:33.488
-For me? -Right.

401
00:21:33.488 --> 00:21:35.588
If the village head is killed,

402
00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:38.388
the one that would be suspected most is you, Mika.

403
00:21:38.388 --> 00:21:40.788
He made you an alibi

404
00:21:40.788 --> 00:21:42.888
so that you wouldn't wrongfully be suspected.

405
00:21:42.888 --> 00:21:44.288
Mr. Shiota.

406
00:21:44.288 --> 00:21:47.688
Mr. Shiota's probably also the one who schemed it

407
00:21:47.688 --> 00:21:49.388
so that the gate would collapse.

408
00:21:51.988 --> 00:21:54.888
I wanted to protect you.

409
00:21:54.888 --> 00:21:57.788
The one that Mr. Itakura loved the most...

410
00:21:57.788 --> 00:22:00.788
Mika, you.

411
00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:30.788
So, that festival ended up being cancelled after all.

412
00:23:30.788 --> 00:23:32.388
It can't be helped,

413
00:23:32.388 --> 00:23:34.988
because of what happened...

414
00:23:34.988 --> 00:23:39.088
But, I'll do everything in my power to make it happen again.

415
00:23:39.088 --> 00:23:41.188
For the sake of this village.

416
00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:47.088
When that time comes, let us make ice sculptures too.

417
00:23:47.088 --> 00:23:48.588
Hey, can you make any?

418
00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:50.388
I've already made one!

419
00:23:51.588 --> 00:23:53.688
What 's this?

420
00:23:53.688 --> 00:23:56.288
Something Genta likes the most, right?

421
00:23:56.288 --> 00:23:57.888
-Yes! -Don't tell me...

422
00:23:57.888 --> 00:24:00.188
Yeah! It's eels over rice!

423
00:24:03.788 --> 00:24:06.088
Are there eels inside?

424
00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:13.588
Takagi, let's me and you join hands.

425
00:24:13.588 --> 00:24:16.588
If we tell them that I, a civilian picked it up...

426
00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:18.088
Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma.

427
00:24:18.088 --> 00:24:20.388
He's the one who dropped the bag, correct?

428
00:24:21.788 --> 00:24:24.288
It wasn't there?

429
00:24:24.288 --> 00:24:26.188
The trace of this paint...

430
00:24:26.188 --> 00:24:28.988
But it doesn't work out that easily, does it?

431
00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:31.488
If that culprit were to appear...

432
00:24:31.488 --> 00:24:33.088
Next Conan:

433
00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:36.888
"Officer Takagi Picks Up 30,000,000 Yen".

434
00:24:52.688 --> 00:24:54.788
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:54.788 --> 00:24:56.988
"Braces".

436
00:24:56.988 --> 00:24:59.588
What's with this ice eels over rice?

437
00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:01.888
Of course, it's an important souvenir.
