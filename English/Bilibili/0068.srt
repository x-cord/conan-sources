1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,560
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,720
Conan's logic can heal the
dried hearts of modern society!

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,980
The stage this time is a resort hotel!

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,510
This case is a huge three-parter!

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,560
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,020
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,169
The Night Baron Murder Case (The Murder).

8
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,179
I hate this...

9
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,139
Izu Princess Hotel - Private Beach
Why am I in such a hot place

10
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:47,649
at such a hot time of the year?
Izu Princess Hotel - Private Beach

11
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,349
at such a hot time of the year?

12
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:55,529
This is all because of
the professor's phone call...

13
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:57,759
Eh? Izu?

14
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,179
Yes! Three days and
two nights at a hotel in Izu!

15
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,249
And for free, too!

16
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,059
Let's go!

17
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,709
Free sounds good to me.

18
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:12,429
What am I doing here?

19
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:18,179
I should be out looking for
those men in black who shrunk me.

20
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,849
But the occasional break is nice...

21
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,099
What's wrong?
You should come swim, too!

22
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,269
Come on.

23
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,019
Oh well, whatever.

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,659
Only half has been paid?!

25
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,059
Yes. Agasa-sama, party of three,
correct? There's no mistake.

26
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:49,259
That's impossible! Check some more!

27
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:51,129
What's the matter, Dad?

28
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:56,089
Okay, you! Only half
of the cost has been paid!

29
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,049
What's wrong with paying half then?

30
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,009
I didn't bring that
much money with me!

31
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,099
Come to think of it,
he did mention something...

32
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,179
Is it really free?!

33
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:09,929
Yeah, it's as good
as free in your case.

34
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,019
In my case? What's that mean?

35
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:12,979
Just listen.

36
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:17,949
My scientist friends and I like
to communicate via PC lately.

37
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:24,429
One of them found an interesting
tour on an online forum

38
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:27,349
and invited me to apply for it.

39
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,869
It's called the 'Izu Mystery Tour.'

40
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,599
Mystery tour?

41
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,429
Luckily, my friend, his granddaughter,
and I all were chosen!

42
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:42,309
But his granddaughter caught a cold,

43
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,809
so now I'm offering you our spots.

44
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:49,009
Six parties will attend--
ten people in all, including you.

45
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,479
Everyone gets a
50% hotel discount.

46
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,969
But the tour organizer is
one of the other seven people,

47
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,309
and whoever figures out
who that is gets to stay for free

48
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:02,949
and wins floppy disks
containing a certain program.

49
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:06,199
Though it's not a program you need...

50
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,999
So how do I look for
this mysterious organizer?

51
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,349
Don't worry.

52
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,959
We received the names and
room numbers of all the attendees.

53
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,259
And the organizer's supposed
to play a certain character

54
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,969
and cause an incident during the tour.

55
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,799
A certain character?

56
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:28,559
Yes, a character you
know very well from novels.

57
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,769
His name is--

58
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,729
--Night Baron-sama.

59
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,189
You're him, aren't you?

60
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,599
3.04 seconds.

61
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,369
That's how long you took
to respond to my question.

62
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:49,469
This was most informative.

63
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:50,239
I'm Konno Shiro, Room 2002.

64
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,429
Konno Shiro (28) - Bank Employee
I'm Konno Shiro, Room 2002.

65
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:53,829
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Konno Shiro (28) - Bank Employee

66
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:58,299
You'll never find the Baron that way.

67
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,639
You're the one who
answered in 2.86 seconds--

68
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,389
Ebara Tokio (32)
Ebara-san, Room 2101.

69
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,179
Do you ever shut up?!
Ebara Tokio (32)

70
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:13,389
Kaneshiro Gen'ichiro (74)
Exposing oneself when caught

71
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,599
off guard is the way of man.
Kaneshiro Gen'ichiro (74)

72
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,659
Isn't that right, Shizue-san?

73
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:18,179
Hayashi Shizue (56) - Kaneshiro's Butler
Isn't that right, Shizue-san?

74
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,589
Yes, sir.
Hayashi Shizue (56) - Kaneshiro's Butler

75
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,479
Hayashi Shizue (56) - Kaneshiro's Butler

76
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,939
Kaneshiro-san, Room 2001...

77
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:27,599
It took you 6.29 seconds to respond.

78
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,389
My eyes are bad, as you can see.

79
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,409
I never expected
you would question me...

80
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,749
That's all right. I'll know the
truth once I process this data.

81
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:41,209
But that data's incomplete.

82
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,099
You're still missing
someone's information.

83
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,139
lsn't that right, Night Baron-san?
Kamijo Hideko (29)

84
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,349
W-What was that,
Kamijo-san of Room 2102?!

85
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,309
0.97 seconds.

86
00:05:55,309 --> 00:06:00,319
Add it in after my
1.48 seconds, Konno-san.

87
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,349
Um...

88
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:01,969
Yes?

89
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,809
What is this Baron thingy?

90
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,109
You mean you don't know?!

91
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:10,079
Yeah, right.
He's just playin' innocent.

92
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:14,039
He shows up in lots
of Shinichi's dad's novels!

93
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:15,849
Yes.

94
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,969
The Night Baron is an elusive
villain created by my father, Yusaku!

95
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,299
He's a thief of the darkness
and sometimes a crazed murderer!

96
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,809
My father hasn't revealed
the Night Baron's identity yet,

97
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:41,979
but whoever's using
his name is one of them...

98
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,939
This makes no sense.
I'm going to our room.

99
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,369
Dad! What about the money?!

100
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,509
Hold on. There were
supposed to be ten people.

101
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,849
There's only eight here,
us three and these five.

102
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,509
We're missing two.

103
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,049
What are you doing?!

104
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,559
Come on, it's just your butt...

105
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,219
Not like it's a big deal.

106
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,009
Come with me and fill my drinks...

107
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,179
Bastard!

108
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,469
Knock it off!

109
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:14,429
Ow!

110
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:15,969
What're you doing?!

111
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:16,529
That's my line!

112
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,679
Maeda Satoru (30)
That's my line!

113
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,389
What?!
Maeda Satoru (30)

114
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,359
Are you Maeda Satoru-san?!

115
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,899
Yes.

116
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,389
Ran-neechan. Do you know him?

117
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,319
I certainly hope so! He was
Japan's karate champ six years ago!

118
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,969
He's the reason
I started practicing karate!

119
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,999
My name is Mori Ran!
I won the recent city championship!

120
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:43,919
A karate champ
and a city champion!

121
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,679
I never expected to
meet you here! I'm so lucky!

122
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,429
Yeah, sure.

123
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:51,219
Who's she?

124
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:51,929
Akiko!

125
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,889
Let me introduce you. This is
my fiancé, Sayama Akiko-san.

126
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,229
You're getting married?!

127
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,259
Hey, now!

128
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,859
Don't take it personally.
She gets jealous easily...

129
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:08,359
You're the Night Baron, aren't you?

130
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,389
Room 1901, Maeda-san...
0.75 seconds.

131
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,279
Sayama-san...

132
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,239
He's still at it.

133
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,709
It's strange. You're supposed to
be two professors and a little girl.

134
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,259
They couldn't come,
so we came in their place.

135
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,629
That was my father,
and he's a detective, not a professor.

136
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,799
A detective?!

137
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,429
Yes. His name is Mori Kogoro.

138
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,179
Mori Kogoro?

139
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,749
I've seen him in the paper.

140
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:45,149
Yeah, they call him a great detective...

141
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,469
How dirty of him to
send a detective instead.

142
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:52,569
Oh, come now. We have
fewer possible Barons now.

143
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:58,949
But with Mori Kogoro here,
we cannot afford to show our faults.

144
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,789
Sounds like Dad's famous!

145
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,099
All thanks to me, of course.

146
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,099
Who was that?!

147
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:13,619
Conan-kun.

148
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,969
Conan-kun!

149
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,329
Let's go back to our room.

150
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:18,469
Okay...

151
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,889
Oh, that's the deal?

152
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,849
So that's why they were shocked
when I said Dad was a detective...

153
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:26,849
Yeah...

154
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,319
So it's basically like this...

155
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,559
If I find which of those
seven is the Night Baron,

156
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,779
we get to enjoy
Izu Beach for free.

157
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:42,559
Ah! So that's why Professor
Agasa told him it was free!

158
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,789
Could be...

159
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:50,059
But of course! Because
there's no mystery I can't solve!

160
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,099
Gimme a break.

161
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:56,179
You were just ranting about going
home 'cuz you have no money.

162
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,389
Okay, then! I better go do
my preliminary questioning!

163
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,349
He's in such high spirits!

164
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,969
What do you say we look around the hotel?

165
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:07,849
Okay!

166
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,819
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
Let's move on!

167
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,279
I'm going to stay
here a little longer.

168
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,349
Oh? Well, I'll be in
the gift shop downstairs.

169
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,819
Okay! I'll be there in a bit!

170
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,739
Why?

171
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:26,749
Why were they all so shocked
at the mention of a detective?

172
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,059
It's just a game.

173
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,209
All you get is to
stay for free, so why?

174
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:35,339
And that murderous glare!

175
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,679
And then there's
what the professor said...

176
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:43,519
...and wins floppy disks
containing a certain program.

177
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,689
Though it's not a program you need...

178
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:48,769
I have--

179
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:51,939
--a bad feeling about this...

180
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,859
Guess I can just call him after
dinner and get all the details...

181
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,409
The Night Baron!

182
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,512
What the...

183
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:33,262
A pool!

184
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:36,532
Are you alright?!

185
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,672
Darn him!

186
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:51,952
He's gone!

187
00:11:57,002 --> 00:12:01,002
He must've changed in the
restroom and then taken the stairs.

188
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:04,342
But who dressed
up as the Night Baron?!

189
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:09,462
Excluding us, there are
seven people on this tour.

190
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:15,222
The purpose of the tour is to find
its organizer among the attendees.

191
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:20,592
The organizer who would cause
an incident as the Night Baron!

192
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:25,672
But it's just a simple
game to stay for free.

193
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:30,172
Who'd push someone
off just for that?!

194
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:31,082
Oh, that program?

195
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,622
Agasa Residence
Oh, that program?

196
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,922
What exactly is it?!

197
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:42,502
No idea. All the ad said was
that it was the 'ultimate program.'

198
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:47,752
Oh, that reminds me.
My professor friend mentioned

199
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:50,722
something or other about a virus...

200
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,682
A virus?!

201
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:57,722
It's odd, though. He shouldn't
know any more about it than I do.

202
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:00,242
Hey! Don't tell me that virus is--

203
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:01,522
Conan-kun?
Hey! Don't tell me that virus is--

204
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:04,212
Ran-neechan...

205
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:09,592
What're you doing?! I've been
waiting at the gift shop this whole time!

206
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:10,282
What?

207
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,172
What happened?! You're dripping wet!

208
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:18,702
I, uh, slipped and fell into the pool!

209
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:24,672
That's nothing to laugh
about! What's wrong with you?!

210
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:29,422
But you don't seem hurt.
Go change and then we'll have dinner.

211
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:30,342
Okay!

212
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:34,922
It's crowded.

213
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,332
What should we do?

214
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,342
Hey! Ran!

215
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:42,982
Ran! Over here!

216
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:46,752
Dad! And Maeda-san
and Sayama-san!

217
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:48,712
What are you doing together?

218
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:52,362
Your father just
finished interrogating us...

219
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,842
"You're the Night Baron,
aren't you?!" and such.

220
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:59,592
Dad's so silly.

221
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,632
Akiko-san!
That's a lovely dress!

222
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,252
T-Thank you.

223
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:10,092
But be careful. Some dirty-minded
wolf might be on the prowl.

224
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:15,512
That old pervert just doesn't learn...

225
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:20,472
Akiko-san signed you
up for this mystery tour?

226
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:24,962
Yeah, she's a huge
fan of Kudo Yusaku's novels.

227
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,772
She's especially
fond of Night Baron ones.

228
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:32,212
Nobody knows more
about the Night Baron than I!

229
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:35,202
Even my hairstyle
is the same as his!

230
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:40,782
You're not the only
expert on the Night Baron...

231
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:43,752
...Miss.

232
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:48,582
I hope that's food for thought.
Now if you'll excuse me...

233
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:54,422
What an outfit...

234
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:57,472
That's why Mom ran out on you!

235
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:59,932
Quit ogling her, Satoru!

236
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:02,672
That is one great outfit...

237
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:05,482
Please stop, sir!

238
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:09,442
Huh? That pervert
didn't even glance at her!

239
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,402
Maybe she's not his type?

240
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:18,422
That's Kaneshiro-san, Room 2001...

241
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:21,162
Looks like Hayashi
Shizue-san isn't with him.

242
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:24,342
Okay! Time to
do some investigating!

243
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,422
Where are you going, Conan-kun?

244
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,132
Um, the bathroom...

245
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:31,462
Dad! You've had too much!

246
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:35,422
Say, are you after
the computer virus too?

247
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:40,712
I'm Conan Edogawa from Room 1902.
Do you remember me?

248
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:45,392
From whom did you hear about that?

249
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:50,062
The people on the tour
keep talking about a virus.

250
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:53,462
But I don't know
why they're talking about it.

251
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:56,922
All they should know is
that it's the 'ultimate program'...

252
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,782
It's the name.

253
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,672
There was once a mysterious
computer virus that infected

254
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:07,752
computers at large corporations
and ravaged all the data.

255
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:13,212
Naturally, it is an unstoppable
and undetectable 'perfect program.'

256
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:19,502
In fact, it was so elusive
that the people named it--

257
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,012
--the Night Baron!

258
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,092
The Night Baron?!

259
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:28,022
Everyone who knows
computers knows its name.

260
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:32,092
I see. And the tour organizer
is also named the Night Baron!

261
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,902
So that gives some idea as to
the contents of the program!

262
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:38,362
Hearing that name
brings back memories.

263
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:42,572
Memories of my son
who died four years ago...

264
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:44,252
Son?

265
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,592
What's the matter, little boy?

266
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:51,962
Nothing! Bye, Mister!

267
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:57,422
Be careful, Shizue-san.
That lad is one sharp rascal.

268
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:58,922
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:04,382
That's Konno-san from Room 2002.

270
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:05,892
Looks like he's on the phone.

271
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:07,852
Wonder what he's talking about?

272
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:13,022
So it was Ebara Tokio...

273
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:16,192
Ebara Tokio? That old pervert?

274
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:19,652
So he was the hacker?

275
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:24,802
A hacker?! A person
who steals computer data?!

276
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,962
Yes. Yes. And then?

277
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,542
I want one of these someday!

278
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,002
Don't touch Satomi!

279
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:40,962
Satomi?

280
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:44,172
It's the name of my
mother who died last year!

281
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:46,422
Are you alright, Satomi?!

282
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:49,842
Whew, you're okay!

283
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:53,552
This guy's named his
PC after his dead mother!

284
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,802
Oh? That pervert's gone!

285
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:01,172
Do you know where the
person who was sitting here went?

286
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,492
He went back to his
room to do something.

287
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:09,202
Say, if you know him,
could you return this to him?

288
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:14,502
Come to think of it,
he had this around his head...

289
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:14,922
Huh?

290
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:16,712
Conan-kun!

291
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:17,922
Oh, Ran-neechan...

292
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:22,092
Don't give me that!
You're always sneaking around!

293
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:23,882
Oh? Where are the others?

294
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:27,842
The three of them
went to their rooms long ago.

295
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,562
Oh? Looks like Dad isn't back yet...

296
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:33,982
Come on, Akiko!

297
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,442
Let me in already!

298
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:38,342
Yeah right, you flirt!

299
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,882
Come on, you've
had too much to drink!

300
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:42,652
Did something happen?

301
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:47,042
She says I was eyeing the waitress...

302
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,112
You were!

303
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:49,882
Sheesh...

304
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:54,882
Guess I'll go up to the
top lounge until she cools off...

305
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,582
Why don't you come too, Ran-san?

306
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,462
Just forget about her!

307
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:04,772
Well, let's go!

308
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:05,762
Okay...

309
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:07,722
Seriously?!

310
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:10,682
Observation Lounge

311
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,252
The stars are so pretty!

312
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,052
Yes, but not nearly as pretty as you.

313
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,422
Just teasing!

314
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:23,272
Upsy-daisy.

315
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,752
Wow, the ocean's pitch black.

316
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:28,552
Oceans sure are creepy at night!

317
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:29,742
Conan-kun...

318
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,702
When did you first meet Akiko-san?

319
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:39,672
When I was a kid. I was
best friends with her brother.

320
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,922
He died three years ago, though...

321
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:45,672
Akiko-san's brother passed away?

322
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:47,882
Sounds like everyone else here...

323
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:52,552
Ran-neechan. Where
did your dad go anyway?

324
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:55,552
I saw him earlier with a woman.

325
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:58,812
Kamijo-san from Room 2102, I believe.

326
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,002
I see...

327
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,772
Forgot about that other old pervert...

328
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:06,382
Princess Hotel 2F Pub Emerald
Sorry...

329
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:08,742
I see, so you were married...
Princess Hotel 2F Pub Emerald

330
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,702
Yes. I divorced three years ago, though.

331
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:15,342
Why would anyone
divorce such a beautiful woman?!

332
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:19,092
Anyway, could you tell me now?

333
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,382
You know who the
Night Baron is by now, right?

334
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:26,962
I can't tell you!
The hotel fee is at stake here!

335
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:32,392
Oh, come on! At least a hint!
Please, Mr. Great Detective!

336
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:35,852
Her breasts!

337
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:42,052
You're so stubborn!

338
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:45,612
This could be one fun night!

339
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:53,132
Well, guess I should
get back to my room.

340
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,462
Yeah, get lost!

341
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,842
Akiko should be cooled off by now.

342
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:02,252
Plus I'd get bitten if
I stay with you any longer...

343
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:05,462
...By your little bodyguard.

344
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,332
Later.

345
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:10,712
Um, do you know what the virus is?

346
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:14,092
Virus? Like a cold?

347
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:17,062
Nevermind...

348
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:19,272
What kind of weird question was that?

349
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:27,672
The perfect computer virus,
'Night Baron.'

350
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:30,922
With it, one could
threaten banks or corporations

351
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,202
out of large sums of money.

352
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,162
I'm sure lots of people
would like to get it.

353
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:42,922
But what is the tour organizer
trying to do by gathering such people?!

354
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,552
Is it just a game?! Or maybe--

355
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:17,882
What's that?

356
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:21,672
Hey, look!

357
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:22,312
What is it?

358
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:48,502
It's disturbing that the immortal
Night Baron would perish...

359
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:51,462
But why did the Night Baron fall?

360
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:54,422
It was just an accident.

361
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:55,882
An accident?

362
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,842
Hey, this knot is strange...

363
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,812
The Night Baron!

364
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,502
On the next Conan--

365
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:12,722
The Night Baron Murder Case (The Suspicion).

366
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,737
Next Conan's Hint:

367
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:18,407
Karate.
