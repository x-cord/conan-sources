1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,770
This way, this way!

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,770
If it's no big deal, you're treating!

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,970
Well, it's no big thing taking the long way at times.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,370
I guess so.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,570
Over here!

6
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,470
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,570
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

8
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,570
What I wanted to see taking the long way around

9
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,070
were beautiful cherry blossom and the memories of Ran.

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,070
His name is Detective Conan!

13
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:35,928
"Memories from Sakura Class (Ran Girl)"

14
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,628
How beautiful!

15
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:42,028
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom!

16
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,428
Yes!

17
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,028
Just as Conan said,

18
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:47,428
we were right to take this road!

19
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,628
You did it, brat!

20
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,528
I passed by here with Genta and the others after school yesterday

21
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:54,028
and it was beautiful, you see.

22
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:59,528
Just as I thought. Seeing cherry blossoms brings back memories...

23
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,428
of the time I first ran into Shinichi.

24
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,028
I guess Shinichi doesn't know about it.

25
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:11,228
But back then...

26
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,328
I didn't like him at all.

27
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:30,328
"13 years ago"

28
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,828
Hey, dear.

29
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:35,228
Have you seen Ran's name tag that was over here?

30
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:39,028
I saw it on the kitchen table.

31
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:42,028
That's the one for the Tulip Class she was in last year.

32
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:44,628
I'm going to be in the Sakura Class from today.

33
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:46,828
Oh, is that right?

34
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:50,228
I was going to pin it on her when we went to preschool today,

35
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,328
and put in on the shoe cabinet,

36
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,628
but haven't you seen it?

37
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:54,628
Come to think of it,

38
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:57,828
I thought something dropped when I took the shoe horn.

39
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,028
"Sakura Class, Ran Mouri"

40
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,028
Oh, no. I stepped on it.

41
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,328
No joke! It's shattered to pieces.

42
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,528
Sorry.

43
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,128
I think it'll do if you paste it back on with glue or something.

44
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,628
I don't think it can be fixed with something like that.

45
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:18,228
I'll be going because I start work at MPD headquarters from today.

46
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,228
Oh, wait.

47
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,228
Gosh.

48
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,828
I guess we'll just have to ask the nursery school teacher

49
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:28,028
to get you a new one.

50
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:30,028
Then, what should I do till then?

51
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,428
Don't worry.

52
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:35,728
I'll make you a substitute name tag!

53
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,728
Will you please bring colored heavy duty construction paper?

54
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:39,728
Yes!

55
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,028
Forget it.

56
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:46,428
She's not coming back anymore.

57
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,228
No, that's not true.

58
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,528
That's not true!

59
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,028
Then, what do you want to do about it?

60
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,028
I want reset things.

61
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:00,528
Then, I'm sure everything will work out this time.

62
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:08,028
There's no time constraint to start over.

63
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,828
I was touched, Kudo Sensei!

64
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:20,528
Well, thank you.

65
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,528
Especially the last dialogue of the wandering woman detective.

66
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:29,028
"There's no time constraint to start over."

67
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,028
I felt like it was being said to me

68
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,628
and it gave me goose bumps!

69
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:34,428
If I remember correctly,

70
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:38,928
you're from Hokkaido who came to the last signing event, aren't you?

71
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:41,128
You remembered me!

72
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,828
Thank you so much!

73
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:46,528
Then, the snow that was falling until just a while ago,

74
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,828
did it change to rain already?

75
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,628
Oh, no.

76
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:52,528
This is a habit of mine from before.

77
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,628
I see.

78
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,128
Excuse me for a moment.

79
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:01,328
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

80
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,128
Thank you very much.

81
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:06,228
Hello?

82
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,128
Oh, Yukiko.

83
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:11,728
What? Shinichi's nursery school name tag?

84
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,428
Right! The one that was shaped like a cherry blossom petal.

85
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:16,728
The one made of plastic.

86
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:19,628
Shinichi is going to be starting his new nursery school from today.

87
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:23,628
So, I wrote his name and put it on the desk of the study last night.

88
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,628
Have you seen it?

89
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,428
Nope.

90
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,328
If it were the pen and glasses case that were on the desk,

91
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:32,628
I rushed to put them in my pocket when I left.

92
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,428
Oh, here it is.

93
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,728
I thought so!

94
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,028
You took it with you, right?

95
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,528
It's because you left it on the desk of the study.

96
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,928
But the perfect pen was right here, you see!

97
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:50,928
Then, I'll stop over there on my way to take Shinichi to the nursery

98
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,528
so wait there for us, okay?

99
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:55,428
Don't forget to wear your hat and sunglasses when you come, okay?

100
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,228
You'll cause a commotion if people know it's you.

101
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:58,728
Okay.

102
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,028
Let's go then, Shinichi.

103
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,528
Shinichi?

104
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:06,928
Hey, where are you?

105
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:12,528
What?

106
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:15,428
Ran, what's wrong your badge?

107
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:17,528
Mother made it for me!

108
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,328
Because mine broke.

109
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,228
Fantastic! It look so real!

110
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:23,628
There's a safety pin in the back.

111
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:26,128
I can put it on and take it off, too.

112
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,128
See!

113
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:29,928
You're right.

114
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:31,828
Your mother's a genius.

115
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:35,028
Here.

116
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,428
What's this?

117
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,628
It's made of paper?

118
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,728
Lame.

119
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:42,228
You're not one of us because yours is different from ours!

120
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,628
Right, right.

121
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,328
You're not one of us.

122
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:47,228
Hey, give it back!

123
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:48,528
No way!

124
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:49,828
No way.

125
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:51,628
Give it back!

126
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,228
Sonoko?

127
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,528
-Give it back! -Sonoko!

128
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,028
Come on! Shake hands.

129
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:08,528
There. Now you've made up.

130
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:14,128
"Ronsuke Efune (39)" -And as for your new name tag,

131
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,728
I think it'll be ready by next week.

132
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,928
So can you wait till then?

133
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:19,928
Yes.

134
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,728
I'm sorry, Ran.

135
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:29,028
I tried to get it back for you,

136
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,828
but it got all wrinkled.

137
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:35,628
Don't worry.

138
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,928
Because I was watching mother make it.

139
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:14,728
First, I fold it in half,

140
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:17,328
and fold it in half once more.

141
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:18,828
Then I open it once more,

142
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,928
and match the edge at the top to the crease in the middle

143
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,328
and fold it then back again.

144
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:27,528
Next, I match this edge to the crease in the middle,

145
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,428
fold it and back again, next...

146
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:31,428
Next...

147
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:35,328
Hang in there.

148
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:36,728
Just a little bit more.

149
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:39,428
Just a little bit more to go.

150
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:43,228
You put a line in here like this.

151
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:46,228
Then, all that's left to do is to cut along the line.

152
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,828
I finished making it!

153
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,928
Make one for me, too.

154
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:56,728
That's a cherry blossom, right?

155
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,228
Am I wrong?

156
00:09:58,228 --> 00:09:59,828
It is, but...

157
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,128
How did you know?

158
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,728
What do you mean how?

159
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,528
Are you making fun of me, or what?

160
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:11,128
Look at the badges on top of the folded clothes by everyone's head.

161
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:13,228
This row is all cherry blossom, right?

162
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:18,828
Besides, the tags of the row below you are all tulips.

163
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,728
But seeing only that,

164
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,828
how did you know I was making a cherry blossom?

165
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:26,328
Because only your clothes didn't have a tag on it.

166
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,228
Besides,

167
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:33,428
you're folding 10 square colored papers to be the same size.

168
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,928
And if that's being cut up like this,

169
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,428
when you open it up, it'll definitely be the shape of a cherry blossom.

170
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:44,628
That's how I know

171
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,728
that you lost your cherry blossom name tag

172
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:50,628
and was making your tag while crying your eyes out like a cry-baby!

173
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:54,828
You're really something!

174
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,628
Like some psychic!

175
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:59,428
Stupid. I'm no psychic.

176
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:01,728
I'm not a cry-baby either!

177
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,228
But you were crying.

178
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,328
I wasn't crying.

179
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:06,628
You were crying.

180
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:07,728
No, I wasn't!

181
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,828
Shinichi, there you are!

182
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:17,828
Don't go running off when I'm filing out your admission papers.

183
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,228
Mom.

184
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,528
What happened to your name tag?

185
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:26,128
You had it on your chest till just a while ago!

186
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:27,728
I lost it somewhere.

187
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,428
You gotta be kidding?

188
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:32,228
And we went all the way to the autograph event to get it!

189
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,128
Is she a woman spy?

190
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,928
That's why I asked her to make me a cherry blossom name tag.

191
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:41,828
Oh, you're...

192
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,828
Eri's daughter, Ran.

193
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,428
Yes.

194
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:48,028
You're both in the same nursery school.

195
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:49,728
Mrs. Kudo?

196
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,528
If you can't find the name tag,

197
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:56,628
we'll get one ready for you together with Ran's by next week.

198
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,928
Oh, really?

199
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,728
Hey, if you want a cherry blossom,

200
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,828
I'll give you this that I made a while ago.

201
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:04,328
Oh, okay.

202
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:06,028
I'll write your name for you, too.

203
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,428
What's your name?

204
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,028
Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class!

205
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,028
Shinichi...

206
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,728
Kudo.

207
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,328
Thanks.

208
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,128
Here, all done!

209
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:27,628
"Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class"

210
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:32,928
I'll give you that so promise, okay?

211
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,928
I'm not a cry-baby!

212
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:39,428
Don't ever call me a cry-baby again!

213
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,595
"Don't call me a cry-baby again!"

214
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,995
Isn't that what you shouted?

215
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:55,795
You were glaring at him too at that time!

216
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,195
Really?

217
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,695
Because we were both in nursery school

218
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,495
and yet he acted so adult and arrogant.

219
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:05,095
And when I got the notion

220
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:09,395
that maybe he thought that all the kids other than him were stupid,

221
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:11,895
I just couldn't help wanting to tell him off.

222
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:16,595
I was so angry that the tag that mom made for me was broken

223
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,095
so I was crying.

224
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:21,195
She was crying after all.

225
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:24,695
And besides, I didn't know the real reason

226
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,395
why Shinichi made me make that cherry blossom, you see.

227
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,495
So, I was so mad.

228
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,095
The real reason?

229
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,195
Right.

230
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,895
That cherry blossom was really actually...

231
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:45,195
"Shut them, open them..."

232
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:50,095
"Clap your hands and shut them..."

233
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,095
-"Open them and clap your hands..." -What're you looking at?

234
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,795
What?

235
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:59,195
You've been staring for quite some time at her.

236
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,195
What?

237
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,095
No, I haven't.

238
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,395
Okay, everyone!

239
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:06,295
Shall we finish singing

240
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:08,495
and get ready to go for a walk?

241
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,095
Yes...

242
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:13,495
You must be stupid.

243
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:17,095
He's looking at everybody because he's a teacher.

244
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,095
Really?

245
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,495
She's right!

246
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,695
Besides, everybody's looking at Mr. Efune, too!

247
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,495
Mr. Efune's really popular

248
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:28,895
so there are many girls saying that they want to be his bride

249
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,995
when they grow up.

250
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,295
Really?

251
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:35,695
Then, do you like him, too?

252
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:38,795
Why do I have to tell you something like that, Shinichi?

253
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,395
Stupid!

254
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:41,795
Really?

255
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:43,895
Sorry.

256
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,095
Maybe he doesn't like me anymore.

257
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,095
Let's forget about him!

258
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,095
Besides, all he does is say strange things.

259
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,495
Wait.

260
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:59,795
Everybody understands, right?

261
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:02,695
Raise your hands in the air when crossing the crosswalk.

262
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,095
Yes...

263
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:13,095
Come on. Shinichi, raise your hand, too!

264
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,895
"Beika Children's Park"

265
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:33,195
You finished your turn already.

266
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,095
You did, too!

267
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,895
Hey, stop it.

268
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,695
Hey, now.

269
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,495
Don't fight!

270
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:43,795
You're friends so you've got to be nice to each other.

271
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:44,795
Okay?

272
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:45,795
-Yes! -Yes!

273
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:50,595
Ran, would you like to slide?

274
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,495
Yes.

275
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:53,695
Excuse me.

276
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,395
Will you let Ran in?

277
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,095
Hey, Shinichi. Come slide, too!

278
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,295
It's fun.

279
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:08,495
Hey, Shinichi.

280
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,695
Mr. Efune, come slide, too!

281
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,795
What? I don't think so.

282
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:22,995
Okay, everybody!

283
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:25,595
It's afternoon nap time.

284
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:29,895
Lay your futons out like always in a straight row sideways.

285
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:33,195
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

286
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,795
This is Ran's place.

287
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,495
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

288
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:41,095
Isn't that sort of strange?

289
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:47,895
Why is Ran the only one who lays her futon out in the same place?

290
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:49,995
Well, that's...

291
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:53,595
Other than the futon,

292
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,795
there are three more strange things.

293
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,195
When we go for a walk to the park,

294
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:01,095
how come you always just hold hands with her?

295
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,095
Even at the sliding board at the park,

296
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,095
some kids were waiting in line

297
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,795
but you let her slide first, too.

298
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,995
Besides, that park is farther than the one that we used to go to!

299
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,795
There are two crosswalks and it's more dangerous.

300
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,595
Why did you change the park we go to?

301
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,695
Mr. Efune?

302
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,595
I'll bet you're trying to win her over

303
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:25,695
so that she'll listen to whatever you tell her to do?

304
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,095
Spit it out!

305
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,195
What's so funny?

306
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,395
Sorry, sorry.

307
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:40,995
I hold hands with Ran during the walks

308
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,895
because she got lost one time

309
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:48,595
and went in a completely opposite direction towards Haido City.

310
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:51,295
I let Ran get on the sliding board

311
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:55,195
because she is a kind girl that let's everyone go before her

312
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:58,595
and end up not being able to slide.

313
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:01,795
And Ran sleeps here

314
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,795
because it is closest to the bathroom.

315
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:07,695
When she was sleeping some distance from the bathroom,

316
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:10,395
there was a time she couldn't make it in time.

317
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,995
What's with you?

318
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:14,295
You mean you peed in your pants because you couldn't hold it in?

319
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:17,195
Don't say that in such a loud voice!

320
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,795
I hate you, Shinichi!

321
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,695
Idiot.

322
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:24,295
Also, I'll tell you why we switched parks

323
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:26,895
when we go on a walk tomorrow,

324
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:28,195
Mr. Detective.

325
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:32,995
"The next day" -Okay, everyone.

326
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,195
Raise your hands when crossing the crosswalk.

327
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,995
Yes...

328
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:39,795
What's the matter, Ran?

329
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,395
You seem depressed.

330
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:44,995
Is it because he said something cruel to you yesterday?

331
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:46,495
No.

332
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,095
Mother scolded me last night.

333
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:52,395
She told me that I shouldn't bully my friends.

334
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:55,095
I'm not bullying anybody, right?

335
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:56,195
No.

336
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:59,595
Rather, you may be the one that's being bullied.

337
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,795
Okay, everyone. Be careful.

338
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,495
Come on, hurry and say it.

339
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:14,195
Why did you decide to come for a walk to this park?

340
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:19,095
Because walking farther will help build your strength,

341
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:23,795
and crossing a lot of crosswalks will help to learn traffic rules.

342
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:30,195
Besides, the main reason I chose this park is her.

343
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:31,195
Her?

344
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:38,195
You see it, don't you?

345
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:40,495
On the other side of the cherry blossom tree.

346
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:43,695
The hospital standing next to the park.

347
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:47,495
The woman that is looking this way from the hospital.

348
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,395
She is actually...

349
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,595
my wife.

350
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,095
What? Your wife?

351
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,495
You mean she's your bride?

352
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,495
Yes.

353
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,995
She's not very healthy.

354
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:03,395
So she's been hospitalized for some time now.

355
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:05,895
Next month, she's moving to a hospital

356
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:08,695
in the mountains where the air is better.

357
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:14,195
But all the people who are there are elderlies.

358
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:17,595
And there are no children like you.

359
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,395
That's why I wanted to show her energetic children like you

360
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:24,895
until it's time for her transferral.

361
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:28,295
She really loves children, you see.

362
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,395
That's why as a result,

363
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,595
I guess it was out of my own selfishness!

364
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,895
It's okay if you're selfish!

365
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:37,995
Why don't we all wave to her?

366
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,095
Right!

367
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:41,195
Let's wave.

368
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,495
No way!

369
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:45,395
I don't want to listen to somebody who's wearing a weird name tag!

370
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:47,495
-Right, right! -Right, right!

371
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,295
Because you're not one of us!

372
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,395
-Right, right! -Right, right!

373
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,195
That's wrong.

374
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:58,095
Can't you see?

375
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:01,795
My cherry blossom name tag.

376
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,295
Mine is made of paper just like hers!

377
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,895
Then, you're not one of us, too.

378
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:11,195
If there are two of us, we're friends, right?

379
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:12,995
If we're friends,

380
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,995
then we're not outsiders!

381
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:21,195
I see.

382
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:23,895
He was watching.

383
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,495
Since you're wearing that, you're not one of us!

384
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,695
Right, right.

385
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,795
You're not one of us.

386
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,795
He saw me back then.

387
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:34,995
That's why he...

388
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,295
The actual truth was...

389
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,495
Make one for me, too.

390
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:41,895
That's a cherry blossom, right?

391
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:43,995
What happened to your name tag?

392
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:46,195
I lost it somewhere.

393
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,495
Mine is paper just like hers.

394
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:50,895
If we're friends,

395
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:53,195
then we're not outsiders!

396
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:57,295
And...

397
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,295
I won't ever be beaten by you.

398
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:01,495
Remember that!

399
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:05,995
Come on. Shinichi, wave your hand

400
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:08,095
to Mr. Efune's bride.

401
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,995
Shinichi?

402
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,695
You're calling me by my first name?

403
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:15,195
You can call me by my first name, too.

404
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:22,995
Riding on the cherry blossom petal, I found another friend.

405
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,395
A childhood friend that I really like.

406
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:57,095
"Next Episode" -Something is really strange about him!

407
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:58,995
Strange? How?

408
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:02,395
I'm sure he's trying to win her over

409
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:04,595
so that she'll listen to whatever he tells her to do.

410
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:11,095
Shinichi, I'll bet you're jealous

411
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,595
because that teacher favors only Ran?

412
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:15,795
Are you stupid?

413
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:18,295
It's nothing like that!

414
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,295
Next Conan,

415
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:24,295
"Memories from Sakura Class (Shinichi Boy)"

416
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,038
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,238
"Colored Paper"

418
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:31,438
Shinichi was really cute back then.

419
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,138
He's still small and cute now.

420
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,338
Shut up!
