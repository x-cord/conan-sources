1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,040
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,240
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,640
The truck and ransom that disappeared.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,840
The mysterious veil is peeled off by deduction.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,567
We, the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:46,367
went to visit our classmate Jun Kataoka in the hospital.

10
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:52,467
But, I was mistaken as being Jun and kidnapped!

11
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,367
The police pursues the Honeybee courier truck

12
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,067
that appears to get the ransom!

13
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,767
However, that car suddenly disappeared

14
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:05,267
inside the tunnel of the expressway!

15
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:14,967
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 2)"

16
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,667
"Supermarket Moriwaki"

17
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,767
Well, I couldn't help it

18
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,667
because the battery went dead and I didn't know.

19
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,667
Everybody's probably worried.

20
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,767
Too bad. We almost made it.

21
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:30,067
Strange. Conan's not answering.

22
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,867
I wonder if something's happened.

23
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,667
What? What do you mean something?

24
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:59,767
Having a child's body is not bad at a time like this.

25
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,467
Inspector!

26
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:10,367
We did exactly as the kidnapper told us to, didn't we?

27
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:14,367
"Shigeru Kataoka (40), young entrepreneur" -Jun...

28
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,567
Jun's going to be returned to us, isn't he?

29
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,067
We're doing the best we can.

30
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:31,767
"Sachiko Ezaki (30), fashion designer" -Sachiko?

31
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,567
What about the rehearsal?

32
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,667
What's up with your rehearsal?

33
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,767
I explained to the staff that I will be canceling the show.

34
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:42,267
No way! Your future depends on it!

35
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,467
Never mind us and go back there!

36
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,067
I'm so worried that I can't just do nothing!

37
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:50,567
I couldn't possibly do my thing even if I went back there.

38
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,067
And... how's Jun?

39
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,167
Nothing... yet.

40
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,967
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,467
We the police are doing all we can

42
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,167
to locate the Honeybee courier truck,

43
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,067
the whereabouts of the truck that fled.

44
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,667
Inspector Megure!

45
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,667
Did you get any new report?

46
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,367
We contacted the Honeybee courier company

47
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:15,267
and found that all the vehicles are doing their usual rounds,

48
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:17,267
and all of them are accounted for.

49
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,767
Could the Honeybee courier truck have been stolen?

50
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,467
No.

51
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:27,767
Are you saying that you have no clue as to the kidnapper?

52
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,767
Well, Inspector?

53
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,067
Oh, excuse me for a moment.

54
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,167
This is Megure.

55
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,067
Oh! Officer Takagi!

56
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,567
What?

57
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,467
Jun came back to the hospital!

58
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,967
Jun!

59
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,767
I'm so glad! Jun, you're okay.

60
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,567
We were really worried about you.

61
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:09,767
How's your leg?

62
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,967
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son" -Nothing's wrong with my leg!

63
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,167
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son" -Oh, that's good.

64
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:17,467
Officer Takagi! Just what is the meaning of this?

65
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,767
Well, the thing is

66
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:23,267
they came back to the hospital on their own.

67
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,767
What?

68
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:28,467
Were you with Jun all this time?

69
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,467
Yeah, but...

70
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,267
-Isn't it? -Yes...

71
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,467
Where were you all this time?

72
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,467
Where...

73
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,667
Jun, you tell them...

74
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,767
I asked them the same question too

75
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,667
but they won't tell me.

76
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:50,967
It seems that Jun wasn't kidnapped.

77
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,967
Kidnapped?

78
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,267
Since he disappeared from the hospital,

79
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,267
we were all worried that he was kidnapped.

80
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,067
What?

81
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:05,467
Well, the bed was empty.

82
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:09,467
And soon after that we got a call demanding ransom.

83
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,267
The bed was empty?

84
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,567
Don't tell me that...

85
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,967
-Yeah. -Huh?

86
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,167
What's the matter?

87
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,467
Big trouble!

88
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,967
Conan is the one who was kidnapped!

89
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,867
What?

90
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:25,167
Since Jun said he wanted to go play games,

91
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:27,967
Conan stayed back at the hospital in his place!

92
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,167
I called him on the Youth Detective badge several times

93
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,767
but he hasn't answered!

94
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,267
Maybe...

95
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,367
Maybe... what?

96
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,767
Conan!

97
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,467
Okay, all done.

98
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:50,667
Thank you!

99
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,567
You're welcome.

100
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,267
Okay.

101
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,967
Will you explain, Conan?

102
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:04,867
Yep. The kidnapper mistook me for Jun and kidnapped me.

103
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,667
Just as I thought.

104
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,867
And? Where were you after you were kidnapped?

105
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:12,367
There's this closed down factory in Okuho-cho,

106
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,067
and was in the basement.

107
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,167
Did you see the kidnapper's face?

108
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,267
Yep.

109
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,767
He had a mole on the side of his nose.

110
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,967
Officer Takagi. Call Tomokawa right away

111
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,767
and have him draw a composite sketch on the double!

112
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,567
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,767
I'm so glad everyone's okay.

114
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,167
Although the money was taken,

115
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,667
it's no big deal if the children are all right.

116
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,967
Jun, apologize to everyone.

117
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:34,967
Why?

118
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,767
What do you mean?

119
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,167
Because everyone worried about you.

120
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,667
You all worried of your own initiative!

121
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,467
What should I care?

122
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:45,367
Jun!

123
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,767
Jun. Wait!

124
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,267
What do you think you're doing? Let me go!

125
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,467
Ouch!

126
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,467
Darn! Let me go!

127
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,267
That's enough!

128
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,367
What a thing to say after you've done something selfish like this?

129
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:07,967
Ouch...

130
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,867
I'm sorry, Jun.

131
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,767
It hurt, didn't it? I'm sorry.

132
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:18,067
But, Conan got hurt because of you.

133
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:22,667
Still, that doesn't mean that it's okay for me to hit you, does it?

134
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:30,067
Inspector, I'm sorry.

135
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,267
I'm hungry.

136
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,767
-Conan. -I guess we'll get going then.

137
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,967
-See you. -Yeah.

138
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:50,567
I've got to stay back and help with the composite sketch.

139
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:55,367
Why?

140
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,367
The Honeybee courier truck that went into the tunnel.

141
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:59,967
Why didn't it come out of the exit?

142
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,867
It's the same compact truck after all!

143
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,667
I see, I get it.

144
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,267
Officer Takagi!

145
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,467
What's the matter?

146
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,867
I've figure out the mystery of the Honeybee courier truck

147
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,367
disappearing in the tunnel.

148
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,467
Huh? Really? Tell me about it, Officer Takagi!

149
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,567
Why did the kidnapper use such a flashy car

150
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,667
such as the Honeybee courier truck?

151
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,567
He probably did so to get our attention.

152
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,867
Yep, and then?

153
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,367
So, we the police were only concentrating on

154
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,767
looking out for this flashy Honeybee Courier.

155
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:51,167
However, the kidnapper paints the truck inside the tunnel

156
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,767
and changed the design of the truck.

157
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,267
That's this compact truck!

158
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:00,967
It didn't disappear, but rather, deceived us.

159
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:06,067
How long did that compact truck stay inside the tunnel?

160
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,167
About 10 minutes.

161
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,567
Then, wouldn't it be impossible?

162
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,967
It's not possible to paint an entire car in just 10 minutes.

163
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,667
Oh.

164
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,967
I thought it was a pretty good deduction, though.

165
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,567
Officer Takagi!

166
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,367
The body of a man who was strangled to death

167
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,167
was found by the riverbed of Teimusu River.

168
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,867
What?

169
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,167
The victim is around his 40's

170
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,767
and has a mole on the side of his nose.

171
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,067
According to Conan, the kidnapper also had...

172
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,967
Yep, a mole on the side of his nose!

173
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,967
Then, it could be the same person!

174
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,267
It's possible. Let's go!

175
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,667
Yes, sir!

176
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,267
Inspector Megure.

177
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,767
Wouldn't it be better if I go along too?

178
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,467
Because I saw the kidnapper's face.

179
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,667
Oh, but...

180
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,367
There's nothing to worry about my wound,

181
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,067
I'm just fine.

182
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,167
From the driver's license that the victim had on him,

183
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,667
he is Tadashi Yoshizawa, age 42.

184
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,167
He has strangulation marks on his neck,

185
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,067
so he probably died of suffocation.

186
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,567
I see.

187
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,367
And, this is what we found on the floor of the passenger's seat.

188
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,567
Huh? Earrings.

189
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:23,467
This car has been reported stolen 2 days ago.

190
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,667
I see.

191
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,867
Inspector Megure.

192
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:30,467
The person who kidnapped me is this man.

193
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,367
Just as I thought.

194
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,567
And, when is the estimated time of death?

195
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,467
We think it is between 13:00 to 14:00.

196
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,667
So, he was strangled to death

197
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,267
right after he made away with the cash.

198
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,867
And? What about the cash and all?

199
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:46,267
There was nothing of that sort anywhere.

200
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,767
Judging from the fact that the cash is gone,

201
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,767
it's most likely that he had an accomplice.

202
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,667
They probably got into a brawl which ended up in him being killed.

203
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:57,667
We need to do a thorough check this guy Yoshizawa's associates!

204
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,367
Inspector!

205
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,167
Oh, Officer Sato!

206
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,267
Inspector, I'm sorry I'm late!

207
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,067
Did you find out anything more?

208
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,267
Yes.

209
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,267
While checking the people who are in close proximity to Mr. Kataoka,

210
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,167
I came across something that may be of concern.

211
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,067
Something of concern?

212
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,167
Right.

213
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,367
Well...

214
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:22,067
Although it doesn't have the honeybee mark on it,

215
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,267
this is the truck that was used to kidnap me.

216
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,867
Officer Takagi's deduction

217
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,267
was partially correct after all!

218
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:35,067
But, how in a matter of 10 minutes inside the tunnel...

219
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:47,747
Yes, this is my earring.

220
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:51,047
I dropped it somewhere and I was looking for it.

221
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:52,747
Where did you find this?

222
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,847
Before I answer your question, I'd like to ask you something.

223
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:59,047
Do you know a person by the name of Yoshizawa?

224
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,347
Yoshizawa?

225
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,647
He's man with a mole on the side of his nose,

226
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,147
who is around 40 years old.

227
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,547
No, I don't.

228
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,547
What about him?

229
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,847
He found dead in a compact truck

230
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,747
that was found abandoned by the riverbed of the Teimusu River.

231
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:16,147
Oh, my!

232
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:19,647
That earring was found near the corpse.

233
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:20,947
Huh?

234
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:22,847
According to Conan,

235
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,647
it seems that there's no mistake that

236
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:27,147
Yoshizawa is responsible for the kidnapping.

237
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,747
Judging from the fact that

238
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:31,647
the ransom was not found anywhere near him,

239
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:34,447
it is most likely that he had an accomplice,

240
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:38,547
who he had a fight with, and as result was killed.

241
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:39,847
I see.

242
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,147
And, who is this accomplice?

243
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,647
After checking Yoshizawa's residence,

244
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:47,147
they seem to have found the date of

245
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,447
Jun's discharge from the hospital tomorrow

246
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:50,847
marked on the calendar.

247
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:54,547
In other words, Yoshizawa and the accomplice carried out the crime

248
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,647
knowing that he would still be in the hospital.

249
00:13:56,647 --> 00:14:00,047
And Yoshizawa did not call Mr. Kataoka's residence but rather,

250
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,247
called him directly on his cell phone.

251
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,247
And finally,

252
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,247
the tracking device that we put inside the bag with the ransom.

253
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,947
The people who knew about this besides us were very limited.

254
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:13,847
What are you trying to get at?

255
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,547
So, Yoshizawa's accomplice

256
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:18,847
has to be somebody who is very close to you!

257
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:24,447
By the way, Ms. Ezaki,

258
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,747
we hear that you have debts?

259
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,147
Huh?

260
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,847
For the last two shows you had, you needed 20,000,000 yen,

261
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,247
and for preparation fees for this show, you needed 10,000,000 yen.

262
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,147
That makes a total of 30,000,000 yen,

263
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:39,047
the same amount as the ransom demanded this time.

264
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,647
That's...

265
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:44,747
How do you intend to pay back your debts?

266
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:48,247
So if this show that is to be held succeeds...

267
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,947
If it doesn't succeed,

268
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:52,647
all you'll be left with are the debts.

269
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,147
Please wait!

270
00:14:56,147 --> 00:15:01,047
Are you saying that she kidnapped Jun because of her debts?

271
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,847
I can't really say yet.

272
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:07,347
But it's true that the circumstances look pretty bad for Ms. Ezaki.

273
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:09,247
I haven't done anything!

274
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:11,647
I don't know a person by the name of Yoshizawa either.

275
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,747
Anyway, we'll get the details from you at the station.

276
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,347
Will you please come with us?

277
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:19,347
All right.

278
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:20,547
Just as I thought.

279
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:23,947
She was after the money after all.

280
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,047
Jun.

281
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,847
Huh? Ms. Ezaki?

282
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,547
Yeah, she came.

283
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,647
About what time? Do you remember?

284
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:35,347
I think it was before 13:00.

285
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:40,047
She came to say that the show today may be cancelled.

286
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,547
13.00.

287
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:45,947
Yoshizawa's estimated time of death is between 13:00 and 14:00.

288
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:48,847
So alibi barely makes it...

289
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,947
I really don't want her to cancel it

290
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:54,447
because her designs are fantastic this time.

291
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:57,247
I'm sure it'll be a success!

292
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,447
Separating trash and throwing them away appropriately

293
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,847
is manners, right?

294
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,647
Maybe...

295
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,747
You're right.

296
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:14,647
It's special so there aren't many companies that make it.

297
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,447
Do you know the name of the company?

298
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:19,347
Yeah, of course.

299
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:20,747
That's right.

300
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,747
Until I get my part from you guys,

301
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:25,547
I can't die even if I wanted to.

302
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:29,747
Bring the cash and come to the place where the kid was confined!

303
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:31,947
I'll be waiting.

304
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:34,947
Wait, Officer Sato, I don't think that's a good idea!

305
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,647
We can't afford to be going out at a busy time like this

306
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,547
just because Conan is telling us to come.

307
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,947
Don't worry, I'll take full responsibility!

308
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,347
Even so...

309
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:49,447
Besides, no matter how I think it out,

310
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,047
I can't believe that Ms. Ezaki is a culprit.

311
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:55,147
I feel the same too.

312
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,547
Well, Conan sure notices a lot of things other people don't,

313
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:01,047
so he could help us find a lead to something, right?

314
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:02,447
Oh.

315
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:07,447
You said you remembered something, what is it, Conan?

316
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:11,847
This is the factory where you were confined, right, Conan?

317
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:12,947
There he is!

318
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,247
Huh? What?

319
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,147
Hide!

320
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:24,047
Huh? That car.

321
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,947
Mr. Kitayama.

322
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:32,547
"Goro Kitayama (48), Kataoka's driver" -Yoshizawa?

323
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:34,847
Hey, Yoshizawa?

324
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,247
Hey, Yoshizawa, it's me!

325
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,347
Mr. Kitayama.

326
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:45,047
What an unusual place to run into you.

327
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,247
What brings you here?

328
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:49,047
What?

329
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,347
Nothing really...

330
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:55,247
You seem to know Tadashi Yoshizawa.

331
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:58,847
You came because Mr. Yoshizawa told you to come, right?

332
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,547
You were told to bring his share of the money

333
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,747
to the place the kid was confined, right?

334
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,047
But, Conan...

335
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:11,147
This place is known only to me and the kidnapper.

336
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:13,647
But he knows this place too, which means...

337
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:17,547
aren't you an accomplice of the kidnapper, mister?

338
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:19,947
What a thing to say?

339
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:21,247
I see.

340
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:24,547
You would know Mr. Kataoka's cell phone number

341
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:26,847
and about the tracking device too.

342
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,447
Hey, wait a minute!

343
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:33,747
You used to work for a printing company before, didn't you?

344
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,247
Conan, what are you trying to get at?

345
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:39,747
The advertisements that we see on the body of vehicles these days,

346
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:43,947
those are all printed adhesive seals, right?

347
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,047
Are you talking about the wrapping bus?

348
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,447
Wrapping bus?

349
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,747
I see! I got it!

350
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,947
Huh? What?

351
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:54,847
I've figured out the mystery of

352
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,447
how the compact Honeybee courier truck disappeared in the tunnel!

353
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:03,847
Yoshizawa wrapped the truck that he stole,

354
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,447
then he went to get the ransom.

355
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,747
While he fled on the truck, he peeled off the wrapping in the tunnel,

356
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:14,047
pretended to be a different truck and got away.

357
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,547
Mr. Kitayama, aren't you the one who printed that seal?

358
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,447
Well?

359
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:23,947
This is ridiculous!

360
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:27,047
Everything you're saying is based on assumption!

361
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:28,747
Huh?

362
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,247
What's this...

363
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:31,747
Bag...

364
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,947
Look, Officer Takagi.

365
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:38,747
There's so much money inside!

366
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:41,447
Mr. Kitayama, we'd like to talk to you,

367
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,647
so could you come with us to the station?

368
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:44,647
Darn!

369
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:47,947
Officer Sato!

370
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:49,247
No way!

371
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,247
Officer Takagi!

372
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:53,647
Move!

373
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:54,847
Hold it!

374
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,747
You're not getting away!

375
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,147
Goro Kitayama, you're under arrest

376
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:12,347
for obstructing official duty and inflicting injury!

377
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,047
Ouch...

378
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,047
You killed Tadashi Yoshizawa

379
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,547
and put Ms. Ezaki's earring near his corpse

380
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:22,047
to confuse investigation, didn't you?

381
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,447
Isn't Yoshizawa alive?

382
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,847
What are you talking about?

383
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,947
He was found dead!

384
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:31,347
Who called me on the phone then?

385
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:33,847
What the heck are you talking about?

386
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,847
Wow. How fantastic.

387
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:21,947
Ayumi, is this all there is to a fashion show?

388
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,747
They serving us food and stuff part way, aren't they?

389
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:28,647
Gee, I tell you, Genta, of course not!

390
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,347
Didn't I tell you that it'd be boring for kids?

391
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,747
Let me introduce you!

392
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:35,847
The designer of this collection,

393
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:37,447
Sachiko Ezaki!

394
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,747
Jun.

395
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,947
Thank you, Jun.

396
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:07,647
The tuxedo looks really nice on you.

397
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:11,347
Dad told me to give you this bouquet.

398
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,647
I see...

399
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,347
Congratulations...

400
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:19,647
Mom.

401
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,947
But, it seems Heiji was waiting in front of this door

402
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,447
for a long time.

403
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,947
Look on the side of the paper.

404
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:54,947
Isn't that the mark of the cap that Heiji's always wearing?

405
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:57,347
But this tape...

406
00:23:57,347 --> 00:24:00,947
A long time has passed since it peeled off.

407
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:04,347
In other words, Mr. Kusukawa intended to come back right away,

408
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:07,147
but something came up and he couldn't.

409
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,047
Next Conan,

410
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:13,447
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 1)"

411
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,315
Let's say it spiritedly. Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:18,315
"Number 9"

413
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,915
In the next episode, that guy from Osaka will make his appearance.

414
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:22,015
Detective from the west, Heiji Hattori.

415
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:23,461
-Who are you again? -I'm sorry.
