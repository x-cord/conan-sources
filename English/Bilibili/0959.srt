1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:06,310
Ran, the old man, and I were
invited to the birthday party

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,100
of dog food company president Hinomiya
Anna-san and arrived at a yacht harbor.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,020
Hinomiya Anna (24)
Happywow President
of dog food company president Hinomiya
Anna-san and arrived at a yacht harbor.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,020
But then...
Hinomiya Anna (24)
Happywow President

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,560
Hinomiya Anna (24)
Happywow President

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,530
Right in front of us, Anna-san was shot
by a masked man, who then fled the scene.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,040
Anna-san's ex-boyfriend Hyodo
Makoto emerged as a suspect.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,340
Hyodo Makoto (38)
Anna's Former Boyfriend
Anna-san's ex-boyfriend Hyodo
Makoto emerged as a suspect.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:32,790
Hyodo Makoto (38)
Anna's Former Boyfriend

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,990
But Hyodo had an alibi.
When the shooting took place,

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,920
he was robbing Anna-san's apartment,
which was ten kilometers away.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,800
However, that night...

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,820
Right now at this moment,
light pierces the darkness!

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,720
Overcome all limits with
your cool reasoning skills!

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,590
The suspect dies in a shocking development!

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,510
The truth is unclear in this shooting case!

17
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,140
Always determining the one truth

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,890
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

19
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,190
his name is Detective Conan!

20
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:26,547
"The Poodle and the Shotgun, Part Two!"

21
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:42,627
If Hyodo was killed, too,

22
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:45,957
does that mean he wasn't the murderer?

23
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,847
That's ridiculous!

24
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,427
Then who's the culprit?

25
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:52,457
Calm down, Mori-kun.

26
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:57,467
There's no guarantee the same
person killed Anna-san and Hyodo.

27
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,217
It was definitely Hyodo who killed Anna-san.

28
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,367
The question is who killed Hyodo?

29
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:07,727
Look, Detective Takagi.

30
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:10,097
What's that?

31
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,007
Excuse me, forensics!

32
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,157
Aren't those the clothes worn by
the culprit who shot Anna-san?

33
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:27,107
You're right. It was definitely those.

34
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,127
Maybe they used that black towel as a mask.

35
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,377
What's this stain?

36
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,627
Maybe it's from the cake
that was on the boat.

37
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:41,567
It probably stuck to them when they fled.

38
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:46,177
Which means the culprit, Hyodo,

39
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:49,297
hid his clothes and gun here
after shooting Anna-san.

40
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,687
But why did he come back?

41
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:57,197
Clothes and guns are evidence that tie
a culprit directly to their crime.

42
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,757
He probably intended to come
back for them from the start.

43
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:03,867
Which means someone who
learned of Hyodo's plan

44
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:08,337
waited here for him and killed him.

45
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,337
Inamura?

46
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,857
What is it?

47
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,837
The name Inamura is
embroidered onto the towel.

48
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,147
Inamura?

49
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:24,037
Does it belong to VP Inamura?

50
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:25,537
Most likely.

51
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:27,417
Inspector Megure.

52
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:33,097
Maybe you should have Inamura-san,
Enami-san, and Morishima-san come back.

53
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:37,477
I'm sure one of them knows the truth.

54
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,637
Thank you. We already asked the
three of them to come back here.

55
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,277
Takagi, make sure they've arrived.

56
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:44,897
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:45,487
Hey!

58
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:49,527
You idiot, the police
already know to do that!

59
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,047
Right...

60
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:58,447
You sure do eat a lot.

61
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:02,987
Anna-san must have made her dog
food taste like something you love.

62
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:08,507
MPD

63
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,027
Inamura Koshiro (45)
Happywow Vice President

64
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:12,137
Inspector, does this mean it wasn't
Hyodo who killed the president?
Inamura Koshiro (45)
Happywow Vice President

65
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,767
Inspector, does this mean it wasn't
Hyodo who killed the president?

00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:14,077
Enami Machiko (31)
Happywow Director

67
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:17,357
No, we still believe he's a suspect.
Enami Machiko (31)
Happywow Director

68
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,397
No, we still believe he's a suspect.

69
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:18,747
Morishima Sota (22)
Happywow Secretary

70
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:22,027
Hyodo probably came to collect
the gun and clothes he hid.
Morishima Sota (22)
Happywow Secretary

71
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:23,397
Hyodo probably came to collect
the gun and clothes he hid.

72
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:26,667
He was attacked by someone when he did.

73
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,837
Someone?

74
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,657
Who was it?

75
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:34,237
Inamura-san, you're certain
that this is your gun?

76
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,037
Please be careful!

77
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:39,087
That's an important piece of evidence.

78
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,747
That's definitely mine.

79
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:44,967
Was this the weapon used to kill Hyodo?

80
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,967
Yes. One blow to the head.

81
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:51,347
Look. The wood is cracked.

82
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,347
They must have hit him pretty hard.

83
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:58,477
Inamura-san, do you recognize this towel?

84
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,267
What?

85
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,377
It's embroidered with the name Inamura.

86
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:04,417
What?

87
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:09,797
Inamura-san asked me to order this for him.

88
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:11,567
Yes.

89
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:15,877
I had it made to commemorate a
hole in one I made while golfing.

90
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:20,417
Wasn't a similar towel used
to wrap the champagne?

91
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:27,927
Yes. I was also thinking about giving
the towel to the president as a present.

92
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:32,767
The culprit who shot Anna-san
used this as a mask.

93
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:35,247
What? That's impossible.

94
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,867
I haven't given out any towels yet.

95
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:39,897
You haven't?

96
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:43,467
Then how did the culprit get one?

97
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:47,747
I know. The towel was in
my car when it was stolen.

98
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,777
They must have taken it from there.

99
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:54,037
Which means Hyodo stole not
only your gun from your car,

100
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:57,697
but also your towel,
and used both in the crime.

101
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:59,867
It's the only explanation.

102
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:00,847
Inamura-san.

103
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:06,297
I can only imagine that you
must have helped Hyodo.

104
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:09,467
You can't be serious!
You think I'm his accomplice?

105
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:13,737
Once Anna-san was dead,
you'd become the president.

106
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:17,977
And by killing off Hyodo, no
one else would know the truth.

107
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:19,977
Am I wrong?

108
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,487
You're delusional!

109
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:27,187
And Hyodo was robbing the president's
apartment when she was killed!

110
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,097
He has an alibi!

111
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,127
You can't even prove Hyodo did it!

112
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:35,657
How can you accuse me
of being his accomplice?!

113
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:40,917
When you put it that way, you're right...

114
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:45,027
Keep it together, old man.

115
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,917
I've got it!

116
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:51,157
Inspector, I've broken down Hyodo's alibi.

117
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,927
Really, Mori-kun?

118
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:55,247
Morishima-san.

119
00:08:56,397 --> 00:09:02,627
You said you awoke inside the locker and
saw the culprit hiding in the cabin.

120
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:03,937
Y-Yes.

121
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,347
But what if you were lying?

122
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,187
What?

123
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:13,867
What if the culprit wasn't in the cabin in
the whole time, but left to rob the apartment?

124
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,047
I'm not lying!

125
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:20,767
But if your testimony is false,
then Hyodo's alibi is undone.

126
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:26,247
And by killing off Hyodo, you've
committed the perfect crime.

127
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:33,397
Are you saying I'm Hyodo's accomplice?

128
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:39,347
Hyodo conned Anna-san out
of a large sum of money.

129
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:43,397
Perhaps he promised to give you a share.

130
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,857
I owe the president everything!

131
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:52,407
I could never betray her!

132
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:55,807
Morishima-kun used to be a host.

133
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,157
Anna's favorite.

134
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,747
A host?

135
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:06,787
Anna dragged him out of there and
offered him an especially high salary.

136
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,207
Perhaps you intended to get engaged someday.

137
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:11,697
Please don't!

138
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,627
I've never even considered that!

139
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:20,497
But maybe you were unsettled when you
heard Anna was secretly seeing Hyodo.

140
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:24,397
I thought Hyodo and Anna-san broke up.

141
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:27,037
They were forced to.

142
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:30,647
But they secretly began meeting again.

143
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:36,407
Recently I saw Anna walking around
town in a leopard-print dress.

144
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:38,787
A leopard-print dress?

145
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:44,917
I remember seeing a leopard-print
dress in Anna-san's apartment.

146
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:47,937
Hyodo liked those kinds of clothes.

147
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:51,417
So when I saw that dress, I knew immediately.

148
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,517
Sally-chan, wait!

149
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,427
Sally-chan!

150
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:59,927
Sally-chan.

151
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,107
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:07,687
I was taking her for a walk,
and she picked up some garbage.

153
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:09,067
Garbage?

154
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:11,817
It's a towel,

155
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,067
embroidered with the name Inamura.

156
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:15,567
What?

157
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,077
It's all clear now.

158
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,887
Two towels.

159
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,827
What's the meaning of this?

160
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,957
I don't know either.

161
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,727
Mori-kun, what does this mean?

162
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,717
What? Well...

163
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:36,877
Dad!

164
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,747
Th-The Sleeping Kogoro!

165
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,647
Inspector, first we must prove

166
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:54,197
that it was Hyodo who killed Anna-san.

167
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,837
Detective Takagi.

168
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,087
Yes?

169
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,327
Could you bring those shoes over here?

170
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:00,397
Yes.

171
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:06,407
These are the shoes Hyodo was wearing.

172
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:11,477
Yesterday night, Sally-chan
jumped on Hyodo's legs.

173
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,517
That proves the culprit was Hyodo.

174
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:22,387
There was dog food scattered all over
the cabin in which the culprit hid.

175
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:28,637
And the culprit, in other words, Hyodo,
stepped on the dog food with those shoes.

176
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:32,147
Sally-chan reacted to that smell.

177
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:39,857
That's it. Because I fell
in dog food on the boat

178
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:43,827
Sally-chan bit my butt.

179
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:49,537
Inamura-san, that dog food is
an original product, isn't it?

180
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:50,717
Yes.

181
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:54,297
It's a new product that uses a special
fragrance not used by any other company.

182
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:58,637
If you analyze the fragments stuck
to the bottom of these shoes,

183
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:02,297
you'll find Hyodo was in the
cabin before shooting Anna-san.

184
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:07,307
In other words, it proves he shot Anna-san.

185
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:14,087
Mori-kun, then who was robbing
Anna-san's apartment at the same time?

186
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:17,007
Hyodo's accomplice, of course.

187
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:18,317
His accomplice?

188
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:22,817
Unfortunately, they're already dead.

189
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,197
Dead?

190
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,224
C-Could it be?

191
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,864
Anna-san herself?

192
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:51,604
That's right. Hyodo's accomplice
was the murdered Anna-san.

193
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:58,114
Morishima-san, before coming to the
party, did Anna-san go to a nail salon?

194
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,234
Yes. She always does.

195
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:04,364
She loved wearing differently
colored nails every day.

196
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:12,044
But there were thin scratches
on the nails of Anna-san's body.

197
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:17,794
I found it strange that she showed
up to a party with scratched nails,

198
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:22,054
but the truth was revealed
by the pet camera footage.

199
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,484
Her nails were scratched when
Sally-chan jumped on her.

200
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:34,324
If you examine Sally-chan's nails, you'll
find nail polish matching Anna-san's nails.

201
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:41,694
But why would the victim
Anna-san be his accomplice?

202
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:48,664
Naturally, Anna-san didn't believe
she would be killed either.

203
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:56,834
What Anna-san wanted was to kill
her vice president Inamura-san.

204
00:14:57,894 --> 00:14:59,424
What?

205
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,514
Why Inamura-san?

206
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:07,404
Anna-san feared that Inamura-san
would take over her company.

207
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,714
Take over?

208
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:13,354
It's true that Anna feared Inamura-san.

209
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:16,114
Since she was new to management,

210
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:20,694
when the veteran Inamura-san
interjected, she couldn't protest.

211
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:24,624
Honestly, I heard her complain
about it more than once.

212
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:30,324
She thought Inamura-san only thought
of her as an advertisement.

213
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:32,204
She's wrong!

214
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:35,634
I intended to support her
for as long as I could!

215
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,334
I've never even thought of
taking over the company!

216
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:42,684
Inamura-san, I believe you.

217
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:45,594
But Hyodo was a dyed-in-the-wool conman.

218
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:52,104
It was easy for him to talk
her into a murder plot.

219
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:57,604
But isn't that just your
deduction—your imagination?

220
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,214
No.

221
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:04,574
Didn't you know that Hyodo
used his silver tongue

222
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:08,614
to talk Anna-san into being
his accomplice, Enami-san?

223
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:11,494
Why me?

224
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:16,504
Detective Takagi, show Enami-san
the pet camera footage.

225
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:18,004
Got it.

226
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:22,254
You lied about Anna-san wearing
the leopard-print dress

227
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:26,884
after seeing the pet camera footage.

228
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,474
I wasn't lying!

229
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:32,394
I really did see her walking
around town in this dress!

230
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:34,604
That's odd.

231
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,144
Hey, Conan!

232
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,644
Here.

233
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:42,654
She just bought that dress and
hadn't worn it outside yet.

234
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:45,934
After all, when I looked
under the hem yesterday,

235
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:48,114
the price tag was still on it.

236
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:51,164
You were probably lying about
her walking around in it.

237
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,704
So, what?

238
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:57,414
You're accusing me of being an accomplice
just because I made a mistake?

239
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,134
Hold on.

240
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:03,714
The president and Hyodo were
planning to kill me, weren't they?

241
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,164
That's right.

242
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:10,474
But that was a fake plot intended to
have Anna-san fabricate Hyodo's alibi.

243
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:14,854
Hyodo's real aim was to kill
Anna-san from the start.

244
00:17:15,324 --> 00:17:18,234
And Enami-san knew about it.

245
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,904
You're still saying that?

246
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,284
It's the only explanation.

247
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:25,064
Before I explain why,

248
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:30,634
you must know about another major trick.

249
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,114
A major trick?

250
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:39,244
Enami-san, you were working
with Hyodo from the start.

251
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:42,004
You're lying!

252
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:47,624
Then how do you explain
the watch on your wrist?

253
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:53,344
Morishima-san, isn't that the watch

254
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:59,974
you bought for Anna-san
at Enami-san's request?

255
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:03,164
Yes. I noticed when I saw it.

256
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:05,234
I thought she bought herself the same thing.

257
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,634
That's right. I already owned this one.

258
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,904
I gave Anna her present.

259
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:15,164
But since she was shot immediately,
I don't know what happened to it.

260
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:16,504
No.

261
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:19,584
You knew Anna-san would be shot.

262
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:25,374
That's why you brought an empty box.

263
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:34,134
You must've thought it would be a waste
to break such an expensive watch.

264
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,394
That doesn't prove I was working with Hyodo!

265
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,644
Then why did you kill Hyodo?

266
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:49,134
When Detective Takagi showed Inamura-san
the shotgun, you said something.

267
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,804
Look. The wood is cracked.

268
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,264
They must have hit him pretty hard.

269
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:58,914
None of us said he was bludgeoned to death.

270
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:00,924
That...

271
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:06,164
That detective said he
took one shot to the head.

272
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:11,174
Normally a person would assume one blow to
the head with a gun meant the victim was shot.

273
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:13,364
They wouldn't think he was bludgeoned.

274
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:17,684
Not only that, but you accurately identified
the section used to strike him.

275
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:22,684
When Hyodo came to the boat where
the gun and clothes were hidden,

276
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:37,204
you swung the shotgun
down on Hyodo, killing him.

277
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:44,594
You saw Hyodo remove his
mask as he was fleeing.

278
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:48,904
He probably removed it unconsciously
because he had trouble breathing.

279
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:54,104
But you needed that towel to convince us

280
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:56,624
that Inamura-san killed Hyodo.

281
00:19:56,624 --> 00:20:02,864
That's why you picked up the fallen towel from
the deck and hid it with the culprit's clothes.

282
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:05,974
You're the only one who could've done it.

283
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:11,484
The towel you picked up
should smell like champagne.

284
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:15,274
But because Hyodo used his cake-coated hand

285
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:21,254
to remove the real towel from his
face, it had to have cake on it.

286
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:25,304
And that's the towel Sally-chan brought us.

287
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:33,714
With Anna-san and Hyodo killed,
if Inamura-san was arrested,

288
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:36,924
the company would be yours and yours alone.

289
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,634
Enami-san, you're the culprit!

290
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,774
Stop, Enami-san!

291
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,404
You're lying! You're making it up!

292
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:55,574
Stop!

293
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:56,904
Don't!

294
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:04,624
Sally-chan!

295
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,754
We emptied it. This is the end.

296
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:19,434
It's okay, Sally-chan.

297
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:28,774
I can't believe my plans
were ruined by a poodle.

298
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:32,034
Why did you choose to work with Hyodo?

299
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:35,404
You didn't have to kill Anna-san.

300
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:37,974
That company is mine.

301
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:41,034
I should've been president!

302
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:45,414
Even if I hadn't worked with Hyodo,
I still would've killed Anna!

303
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:25,974
Mori Detective Agency

304
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:29,434
They found a new owner for Sally-chan.

305
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:30,684
That's great news.

306
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:35,124
Yeah. We were this close to
having to look after her.

307
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,354
I would've been okay with that.

308
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:43,184
You idiot, dogs are too much
trouble to take care of.

309
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:44,874
Besides—

310
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:48,904
What? Isn't this dog food?!

311
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:56,114
Yoshida-san.

312
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,754
What's the matter?

313
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:59,024
That woman...

314
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,324
She seems sort of sad.

315
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:03,134
Yeah.

316
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:07,634
Kajiki Kohei-san... you're
a company president.

317
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:11,264
I manufacture and sell men's cosmetics.

318
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:14,894
What?

319
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:19,014
"Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys"

320
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:22,984
The next episode of Conan is "Miss
Lonely and the Detective Boys!"
"Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys"

321
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,378
"Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys"

322
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,967
Next Conan's hint.

323
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:28,827
Wine!

324
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:30,827
Don't miss the next episode.
There's a widow in the next episode?

325
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:32,427
You won't be in it, mister.
Don't miss the next episode.

326
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:33,697
Impossible...
Don't miss the next episode.

327
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:34,287
Don't miss the next episode.
