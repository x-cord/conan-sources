1
00:00:01,124 --> 00:00:04,224
So, a case, don't you have a case?

2
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:05,224
Don't you have something?

3
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:08,724
A bloodcurdling kind of interesting case!

4
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:11,624
Well...

5
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:15,024
There is, sort of...

6
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:17,524
But I don't have anything on it yet,

7
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:19,924
about Rum, a member of the Black Organization,

8
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:23,324
and I really don't want to get Hattori involved in it.

9
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,824
Hey!

10
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:27,024
Are you listening to me, Kudo?

11
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:28,224
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:31,024
After you confessed your feelings to that girl at the detective agency,

13
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:34,224
are you sure you haven't lost your edge?

14
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:38,024
Your instinct for sniffing out cases.

15
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:39,924
Or your antenna for such things, you know.

16
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:42,524
What about you? Don't you have anything?

17
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:46,924
If I had anything, I wouldn't be calling you!

18
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:49,124
No, I know you've got something.

19
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:53,024
And you're going to bring that over to me.

20
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,524
What're you talking about?

21
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,724
Hey, what's with you?

22
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:02,224
How dare you... just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,724
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

24
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,924
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

25
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:11,524
In front of our eyes, that is, Hattori and I.

26
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:13,724
There is a series of people being slashed.

27
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,224
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:17,124
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:19,424
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:10,003
"Kamaitachi Inn (Part 1)"

31
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:13,003
True!

32
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:16,503
This kudzu drink really has a lot of ginger in it and tastes good.

33
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,003
It really warms the body up!

34
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:19,003
Just like I told you, right?

35
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,303
I saw in a magazine that

36
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:24,203
the kudzu drink they serve at this inn is super delicious!

37
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,203
And? What is it?

38
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,103
It's a kudzu drink.

39
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:31,203
I hear it's good for hangovers too!

40
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:33,203
I mean you know,

41
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,103
you didn't call me, the great detective all the way out here

42
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,803
to the boondocks of the mountains in Nagano

43
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:40,903
just to make me drink this gooey stuff, did you?

44
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,103
Of course, not.

45
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,403
You've got a case, right?

46
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:48,603
Yeah.

47
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,803
First of all. Take a look at this picture!

48
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:53,503
What's this?

49
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:56,003
Human. No, an animal?

50
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,003
It looks kind of eerie.

51
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,603
Take a good look!

52
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,403
At the stuff, it's carrying on its back!

53
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:06,003
It's a sickle, sickle! An animal that has sickles.

54
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,203
A demon that appears riding on whirlwinds

55
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,003
and slashes people

56
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,403
is nothing other than a Kamaitachi, right?

57
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,503
Ka...

58
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,203
Kamaitachi?

59
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:21,503
But, I thought that the claws of Kamaitachis were sickles?

60
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:24,803
Isn't this a person carrying a sickle?

61
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:27,503
Look at its feet.

62
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:29,903
There's water splashing, right?

63
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:34,003
In the background the outdoor bath of this inn is in view,

64
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:36,803
but the picture that the writer took from the same angle

65
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:39,803
and put in the magazine is this!

66
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:42,003
Compare them. No matter how you look at it,

67
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:44,903
he looks to be running on water, right?

68
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,903
True.

69
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:53,603
He could've lined out several transparent boards in the tub.

70
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:58,903
The water here is clouded like that of Shirahone Hot Spring,

71
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:01,403
which makes all kinds of tricks possible.

72
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:04,603
That picture wasn't tampered with.

73
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,703
That picture was taken with an analog film

74
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:08,603
that's difficult to tamper with.

75
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:10,603
And, we had a specialist look at it too,

76
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,803
so there's no mistake about it!

77
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:16,103
Are you the writer of this picture?

78
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:19,003
Yes! I'm a writer for the monthly magazine IZUNA,

79
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:20,803
Daigo Nakama!

80
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:25,203
I'm here today to take a picture of the Kamaitachi myself.

81
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,303
Oh.

82
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,803
It's gotten very cold.

83
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:31,503
Is there any connection between Kamaitachi and how cold it is?

84
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:35,003
Well, there are many Kamaitachi legends

85
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,003
in snowy regions, you see.

86
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,703
Therefore, if it should snow tonight,

87
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:44,603
it may just appear riding the snow and wind.

88
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,403
I'm going home!

89
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,503
Don't worry.

90
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:49,803
Even if such a thing were to appear,

91
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:54,003
we can beat it up with my Akido and your Karate, Ran!

92
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,403
It has a knife and flies through the sky, you know?

93
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,903
We'll be beaten!

94
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:01,303
Don't worry!

95
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:04,803
Kamaitachis are fake to begin with.

96
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:07,203
I'm sure he just came here without a choice

97
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,003
because he got a lot of complaints saying,

98
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,903
"Quit putting on fake pictures", correct?

99
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,803
Besides, that photo

100
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:18,503
was mixed in with a bunch of voyeuristic photos of the outdoor bath

101
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,503
printed in another one of your publisher's magazines.

102
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:25,003
It's so phony, what a laugh!

103
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,603
Then, what brings you here?

104
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,803
Well, I work for a rival magazine company,

105
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:34,403
so I thought I'd come and report on your phony, stupid interview.

106
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:37,103
Of course, I won't let you put on a scenario

107
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:40,403
to make this non-existent Kamaitachis seem like it exists.

108
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:41,503
They do exist.

109
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,603
I saw a Kamaitachi!

110
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:47,303
I saw it running on the water of the hot spring.

111
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,603
Is that true?

112
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:51,603
Yes! I went after it

113
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:54,003
but I can't run on water so...

114
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:57,003
But, more than that it seemed like I was put under a magic spell

115
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:59,703
or something and couldn't move, so I drowned.

116
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:03,403
When I woke up, I was drenched and sleeping in the corridor.

117
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:04,603
Oh.

118
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,803
My, Kohei!

119
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,103
What are you doing?

120
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,803
Oh, Mom!

121
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:12,403
Did you finish decorating your room already?

122
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,403
You're inviting your friends over tomorrow

123
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,403
and holding a birthday party, right?

124
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,603
I was just going to start from now.

125
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,103
Then, hurry up and get with it.

126
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,403
Okay!

127
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,503
Wow! What terribly chapped skin.

128
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,103
Are you all right, Takami?

129
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:30,203
Yes. Last year, after my husband passed away of an illness,

130
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,503
I've had so many things to do, you see.

131
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,203
What? You know...

132
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,003
Each other?

133
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,903
Yeah! We were classmates in Jr. high school.

134
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:42,103
I'm sorry, I posted a strange picture on the magazine.

135
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:43,703
I hope it's not causing you trouble.

136
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:47,303
Nope, in fact we've been getting more guests thanks to it.

137
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:49,303
Well, because of the Kamaitachi,

138
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,703
the number of people using the outdoor bath decreased though.

139
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,603
What's this about Kamaitachi?

140
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:57,903
It's extremely unpleasant!

141
00:07:57,903 --> 00:07:59,203
Grand Master.

142
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:01,503
Even if we've been getting an increased number of guests

143
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:04,303
thanks to this weird phenomenon, it's only temporary.

144
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:07,703
It'll do nothing for us being in the red!

145
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:13,103
I guess the only way to increase guests would be to use that.

146
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,103
Don't you think so too?

147
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,603
I already refused the other day, didn't I?

148
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,403
Well, once the demon fuss subsides

149
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,403
and you go through tough management again,

150
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,503
I guess you'll change your mind.

151
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:31,103
If someone were to be killed by that thing called Kamaitachi,

152
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,303
it would be a different story, though.

153
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:37,603
Nyo... Nyotaimori?

154
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:40,103
Is he telling you to do that stuff where you place sashimi

155
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:44,803
on the body of a woman and entertain the guests?

156
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:47,603
Yes, he says that the guests would double.

157
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:50,103
I've never seen something like that

158
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:51,803
except in erotic samurai movies.

159
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:54,703
If the word gets out, you'd get nabbed for public indecency.

160
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:57,103
Well, I think he's just joking though.

161
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,503
When I got married and came here,

162
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:04,203
this inn and my parents' inn merged and was doing well.

163
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:05,703
But since my husband passed away,

164
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:07,803
the number of regular guests decreased

165
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:10,303
and it's true that we are in the red.

166
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:14,203
But, Takami, don't ever do Nyotaimori.

167
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,203
Then, why don't you sell something?

168
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:18,903
Like antique vases.

169
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,903
Come to think of it, there's a large sickle in the storeroom

170
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:24,803
that a famous bladesmith made modeled after

171
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:27,803
a foreign grass sickle.

172
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:31,003
Maybe it'll bring in a lot of cash?

173
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,903
How large is that sickle?

174
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:36,503
The blade is about 60cm,

175
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:41,003
and the length of the handle part is almost as tall as I am.

176
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:44,703
You mean it's the one that was in the picture?

177
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,803
The one the Kamaitachi was carrying?

178
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:50,203
Where is this storeroom?

179
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,003
Near the outdoor bath.

180
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,203
Please take us there then!

181
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:54,603
Okay!

182
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:01,403
See? It's starting to get interesting, no?

183
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,303
Give me that audio data file then.

184
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,603
No, not just yet.

185
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:10,103
Let's go, Conan!

186
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:11,803
Heiji! Hurry up!

187
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,703
-Oh, yes. -Got it.

188
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:19,703
I think it was someplace around here.

189
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,703
I don't see it.

190
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,303
Boy, this storeroom sure is dusty.

191
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:32,303
Hey, smoking in a place like this, you'll cause a fire.

192
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:34,203
Don't worry.

193
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,503
Shall we all help you find it then?

194
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,303
Yes.

195
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:42,803
I guess we should.

196
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,703
Crap!

197
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,103
Huh?

198
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:49,503
It's snowing!

199
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:51,503
Wow, really!

200
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,703
But if it snows...

201
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:58,703
It's supposed to come, right? Kamaitachi.

202
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,803
What's with you guys?

203
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,503
I thought you said you'd be waiting outside.

204
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:10,603
Isn't this it, Takami?

205
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,203
Yes, that's it! It's this sickle!

206
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,603
It sure is antique alright.

207
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,103
It looks expensive.

208
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:20,803
My late husband used to say it's probably worth 10 million yen.

209
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,603
What?

210
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,003
The light bulb cracked?

211
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:27,603
Ouch!

212
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:29,703
Dad?

213
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:30,803
Heiji?

214
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,403
I don't know what happened but it got my arm.

215
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,403
I got slashed on the back of my hand.

216
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:38,503
You're right.

217
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,403
You're both bleeding.

218
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,103
It's the voice of that woman writer.

219
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,603
Where?

220
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,503
Hey, are you all right?

221
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:49,603
What happened?

222
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,403
Hey, that wound.

223
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:58,403
It can't be.

224
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,303
Kamaitachi?

225
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,970
Hey, Kazuha!

226
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,870
Did you call the police?

227
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,570
Yes. They said they'd be right over!

228
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,670
But, I wonder if they'd believe our story

229
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,370
about a Kamaitachi attacking us.

230
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,970
Believe us or not,

231
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,470
three people have already been slashed like this.

232
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,970
Well, I guess it'll be all right because this is Nagano

233
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,870
and the Nagano Prefectural Police will be here!

234
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,070
I see! Inspector Kansuke Yamato!

235
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,270
That's right!

236
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,970
I'm sure that super smart one-eyed Inspector

237
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,470
will solve this Kamaitachi case in no time at all!

238
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,870
Right!

239
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,670
One-eyed.

240
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,270
Come to think of it, Haibara was saying that.

241
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,670
The number two of the Black Organization,

242
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,870
Rum's characteristic was...

243
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,170
While I was at the Organization, I heard various descriptions of Rum.

244
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,370
A large brawny man,

245
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,670
an effeminate man,

246
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,470
an old man.

247
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,970
He injured his eye in some accident,

248
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,070
and either his left or right eye is an artificial eye.

249
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,970
Inspector Yamato one-eyed and a big guy.

250
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,470
If he lets his hair down loose, he's long-haired.

251
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,470
And since he uses a cane, from a distance,

252
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,470
he could look to be an old man.

253
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,470
Hey. Don't tell me Inspector Yamato is...

254
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,570
The police are here.

255
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,470
I'm Inspector Yamamura from the Gunma Prefectural Police!

256
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,770
I have just arrived here, you see.

257
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,070
This is the Nagano Prefecture, isn't it?

258
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,170
This place is just on the border of Gunma, you see!

259
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,670
So, this is our jurisdiction!

260
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,670
So, Inspector Yamato's not going to come?

261
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,570
I thought we be able to meet Yui too.

262
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,070
Hey.

263
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,070
What's with that disappointed attitude of yours?

264
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,070
The flaming dog case,

265
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,970
the river-child case

266
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,970
and even the vampire case,

267
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,570
I helped solve all these cases from behind the scene. You know?

268
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,670
If the perp is a Kamaitachi...

269
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,170
It's show time for demon-hunter Yamamura, isn't it?

270
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,270
Well, but in this scientific day and age

271
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,970
when people are talking about going outer space on orbit elevators,

272
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,170
Kamaitachis could never be in existence!

273
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,170
That remark sounds familiar.

274
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,370
Then, please take me to the storeroom

275
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,570
that you say the Kamaitachi attacked you, will you?

276
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm sure it's some kind of mistake, though.

277
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,870
He pisses me off! This guy.

278
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,270
I see.

279
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,970
You came to this storeroom to look for the antique sickle.

280
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,370
Then this light bulb suddenly cracked,

281
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,470
and someone in the dark

282
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,770
slashed the back of Mr. Mouri's right hand,

283
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,070
as well as the left arm of you, who speaks in the Osaka dialect.

284
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,070
And lastly, writer Ms. Midori Koyanagi,

285
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,570
you were slashed on your left cheek?

286
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,570
Yes.

287
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,670
Was there anyone back then that was holding some kind of blade?

288
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,370
I was the one holding the sickle back then.

289
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,170
The light bulb cracked just when we found it and I was holding it.

290
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,970
Then, aren't you the one who did it, didn't you?

291
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,170
Didn't you spin that sickle around in the dark?

292
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,770
Idiot! If he flung something like that around,

293
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,970
we wouldn't have gotten away with a wound like this, right?

294
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,370
Then, why don't you check if there was blood on the sickle?

295
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,770
We'll of course check on that.

296
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,370
But maybe there was somebody

297
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,570
who was near the light bulb that could've cracked it?

298
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,570
There could've been, but we weren't watching.

299
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,370
There was nobody near.

300
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,470
Back then, we were by the doorway of the entrance but...

301
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,070
Everybody was looking in on the sickle until

302
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,270
just before the sound of the light bulb cracking was heard.

303
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,870
Is this the only light bulb here?

304
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,970
No.

305
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,570
There's another one near the entrance,

306
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,770
but when we got to the storeroom today, it wouldn't turn on.

307
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,270
Come to think of it, this storeroom wasn't locked, was it?

308
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,370
Oh, no. The door itself is old and worn out,

309
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,970
and only old rice grains that were to be disposed of

310
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,270
were stored in here so...

311
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,570
But, you mentioned that the sickle may be worth 10 million yen.

312
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,870
My late husband only happened to say so,

313
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,970
whereas, the Grand Master said it's just a piece of junk.

314
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,370
Just a few days ago, a burglar broke into the storeroom again,

315
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,070
so I was thinking of getting a new door and locking it,

316
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,470
but Grand Master said there's no need for that

317
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,070
because we're in the red.

318
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,270
What did the burglar steal?

319
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,070
It wasn't important enough to even be bothered with.

320
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,770
Ah!

321
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,870
So, this is the sickle in question!

322
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,670
This indeed looks like a sickle

323
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,370
that would be favored and used by an ancient demon,

324
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,670
but all is fine!

325
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,370
I, the demon-hunter Yamamura will arrest it "immedemonly",

326
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,370
so rest assured!

327
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,270
A pun...

328
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,470
What? A Kamaitachi appeared?

329
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,370
How lucky! I wanted to see it too.

330
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,670
Don't say that.

331
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,270
Because some people have gotten hurt, you see.

332
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,070
But, when I almost drowned in the bath,

333
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,370
the one who saved me was probably Kamaitachi.

334
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,570
I wanted to thank it!

335
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,970
By the way, did you finish decorating your room?

336
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,370
Nope, not yet.

337
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,570
I can't do it alone, like Daddy used to do it.

338
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,670
But, I've got a lot of things to do and I can't help you.

339
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,470
Then, would you like us to help you?

340
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,870
Decorating is my cup of tea!

341
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,270
Really?

342
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,870
Thank you.

343
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,070
No problem at all.

344
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,470
-Come on, let's go! -Yes!

345
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,970
How old are you going to be when your birthday comes?

346
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,970
8 years old!

347
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,970
Oh, 8 years old!

348
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,070
Come to think of it, you seem to have been

349
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,070
celebrating your son's birthday quite grandly every year.

350
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,970
I saw it on the website of the inn with photos and all,

351
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,170
Yes, because my husband used to love events.

352
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,870
During a party for my husband's survival game friends,

353
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,270
they got water everywhere

354
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,570
while shooting each other with water guns.

355
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,470
It was really something.

356
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,170
Hey, Kudo, what do you think about this case?

357
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,470
Well, I'm sure that somebody did it in the dark but...

358
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,870
After that everybody's belongings were checked

359
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,970
and yet nobody had anything close to a blade, so...

360
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,170
The weapon was probably...

361
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,370
The debris of cracked glass of the light bulb!

362
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,670
I still can't figure out how the light bulb was cracked,

363
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,470
but there's no doubt that the perp flung around

364
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,470
the cracked pieces of glass of another light bulb

365
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,170
that he had on him to begin with, right?

366
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,170
Yeah. After slashing his targets,

367
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,470
if the cracked pieces were thrown on the floor,

368
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,270
they could make it look like one of the pieces

369
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,170
that was broken off then.

370
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,370
After examining the sickle for blood,

371
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,070
the results determined...

372
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,370
what shall I say...

373
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,670
Nothing was detected!

374
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,570
I guess so.

375
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,970
And? Did you also check the pieces of cracked glass

376
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,070
that were scattered on the floor?

377
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,170
Yeah, there was nothing strange about them, though.

378
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,770
You found no blood on them?

379
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,570
Are you sure you really checked?

380
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,670
Of course!

381
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,370
We picked up all the cracked pieces

382
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,770
and put them back together in their originally form,

383
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,870
but there was no blood anywhere.

384
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,170
It can't be.

385
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,970
Then, how?

386
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,070
If there was anything strange...

387
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,670
We found a cigarette butt and chewed gum on the floor.

388
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,770
I think that what happened here is,

389
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,570
an old light bulb cracked on its own

390
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,470
and happened to slash you accidentally when it shattered.

391
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,270
Then we should've felt pain the instant it broke.

392
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,370
But there was a delay between them.

393
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,070
It's... it's the girls' voices!

394
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,870
There was a sound before the scream, wasn't there?

395
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,770
The sound of something cracking and bursting!

396
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,670
Are you all right?

397
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,870
What's wrong?

398
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,770
The lamp suddenly cracked.

399
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,470
Then, the balloons we decorated

400
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,170
started bursting one after the other!

401
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,170
The... there's something...

402
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,770
At this inn after all!

403
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,570
Wasn't that voice the Grand Master's voice?

404
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,370
I think it was.

405
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,870
Don't tell me the Kamaitachi got him?

406
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,970
Where is the Grand Master?

407
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,970
I think at this time, he's at the annex.

408
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,070
Hey! Isn't there a short cut?

409
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,570
It would be fastest to go through the outdoor bath if possible.

410
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,170
No good! Water's still in the tub!

411
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,170
It's not time to clean yet, so...

412
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,070
Is that place on the other side of the fence

413
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,970
where the Grand Master is?

414
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,770
-Yes. -But that fence...

415
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,370
isn't it sort of slightly open?

416
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,470
Kamaitachi!

417
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,570
Just like it rides the wind, it ran over the water!

418
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,770
That's impossible!

419
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,670
There doesn't seem to be

420
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,770
things like transparent plates in the water either.

421
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,470
Isn't there any other way?

422
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,970
Actually the main building and annex are connected by a corridor,

423
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,370
it just happens to be under renovation right now.

424
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,970
It's the long way

425
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,670
but if we go out once and go from the backdoor...

426
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,670
Let's hurry that way then!

427
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,570
That's the annex!

428
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,470
Only our footprints are here, which means...

429
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,270
Nobody passed through here.

430
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,570
Grand Master!

431
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,370
Are you all right?

432
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,570
Please get a light!

433
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,470
Yes!

434
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,170
It won't turn on.

435
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,270
What's with this paper door?

436
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,970
It's torn...

437
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,870
it looks to have been slashed by something.

438
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,870
Hey! Don't tell me!

439
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,770
Then why is there blood on the upper part of the cut?

440
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,570
To make it look like Kamaitachi did it.

441
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,270
The suspect is Kamaitachi.

442
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,570
Don't be silly!

443
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,170
What makes you think that a demon or whatever

444
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,070
will go cracking the glass to by lock

445
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,470
or shut the breaker down?

446
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,570
I see, so that's the story!

447
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,570
That's why back then, that person...

448
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,470
Next Conan,

449
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,570
"Kamaitachi Inn (Part 2)"

450
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:24,313
Next Conan's Hint:

451
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:26,413
"Kudzu drink"

452
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:28,013
Kazuha, how are things going with Hattori?

453
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:29,113
Well, the thing is...

454
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,413
Oh, we're out of time. See you next week!
