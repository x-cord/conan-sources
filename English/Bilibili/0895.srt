1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,740
While Pops was watching the horse races on TV

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,740
and checking his payout tickets,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,840
we found a dark horse payout ticket he didn't recall buying.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,640
Maybe when he dropped his wallet,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,440
he picked up someone else's ticket and put it in his wallet?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,140
I could've accidentally added another digit.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,640
All right, tonight we're having sushi for dinner, sushi!

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,340
We're heading to Beika Iroha Sushi next door!

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,740
So the elated Pops dragged us to Beika Iroha Sushi,

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,140
the restaurant next to the detective agency,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,440
where we met an unfamiliar employee.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Anyway, I don't recognize you.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,740
Are you new?

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,040
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm Kanenori Wakita, a cook.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,040
I'm not the type of guy to settle down in one place.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
I eventually ended up here.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm what you'd call a drifter.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,840
I see.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,340
As we finished eating and were settling our bill,

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,440
a woman ran into the restaurant, claiming her pouch

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,540
had been stolen from her on a full train.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,440
Using the GPS on the phone in her pouch,

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,740
she tracked it down to Iroha Sushi.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,940
Based on the timing, apparently someone in the restaurant

26
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,640
was the thief.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,740
Furthermore...

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,440
"Suzuyo Hijirisawa (47), Victim of Theft" -Just how much was stolen?

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,240
None of the money in my wallet was stolen.

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,140
Then who cares?

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,840
But the ticket I had with my cash is missing!

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,440
My dark horse payout ticket worth a million yen!

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,040
What?

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Hey, Dad.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
Huh?

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,140
Maybe the ticket you picked up belongs to that woman.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,040
You idiot. There's no way.

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,440
It was stolen about an hour ago.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,040
I was watching the races in my office around then.

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,040
But the TV broadcast of the races ended about 50 minutes ago.

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,940
Since you were out buying tickets, you only saw the last race.

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,040
An little over an hour ago, you would've been near the ticket booth.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,140
I guess you could say that.

44
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,640
Maybe the thief was in a rush to redeem the ticket,

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,140
ran into you, and dropped it.

46
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,540
I guess you could say that.

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,240
And you picked it up and put it in your wallet.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,340
Maybe you...

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
You can't be serious, idiots!

50
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,540
Come to think of it, Kogoro,

51
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,540
didn't you have a winning dark horse ticket?

52
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,740
Yikes!

53
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,840
Why don't we make this a contest?

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,140
A contest?

55
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,540
Let's see which of us can find the thief first.

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,640
But there wasn't any blood on anyone's sleeve.

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,840
Doesn't that make this an unsolvable case?

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Dad!

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,940
What's your problem? I was joking.

60
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,440
That's odd, though.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,240
It's strange that the woman's blood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.

62
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,040
But why did the thief leave the stolen pouch in the bathroom?

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,640
A professional thief would've taken the money

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,840
and left the incriminating wallet in a nearby trash can.

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,340
So why did they bring it into Iroha Sushi?

66
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,840
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,940
A chef and Pops have a detective showdown!

69
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,240
Who hid the dark horse payout ticket?

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,740
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:34,798
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 2)"

74
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:38,298
"Beika Iroha Sushi"

75
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:42,698
Since the stolen pouch was left in this bathroom,

76
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:46,398
is there some significance specific to Iroha Sushi?

77
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:50,698
Or would any sushi restaurant have worked?

78
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:54,698
It's that young man's first time at this restaurant.

79
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,398
"Tsunetaka Harashima (25), Customer" -I'll have

80
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,798
the nigiri special, some chawanmushi

81
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,298
and a cola.

82
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,398
Hey.

83
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:03,898
What is it?

84
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,098
Where's your bathroom?

85
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,998
The bathroom's back there.

86
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,198
Thank you.

87
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:16,598
The man sitting next to him seems to have been here before.

88
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,698
The regular nigiri and an oolong tea.

89
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:21,898
"Tameshige Munechika (42), Customer" -Also,

90
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:25,998
do you have the limited availability seasonal grilled fish today?

91
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:32,498
And that woman seems to be a regular.

92
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:35,598
What'll it be, miss?

93
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:37,498
The usual.

94
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:40,898
And what would that be?

95
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:43,398
You know, the usual.

96
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:46,098
Huh? Where's the regular guy?

97
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,298
He got hurt in a traffic accident.

98
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,698
"Natsume Ashino (33), Customer" -Oh, really?

99
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:53,498
In that case, I'd like a highball and seafood chirashi.

100
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,898
Extra sea urchin, salmon roe, and wasabi.

101
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,098
You got it.

102
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:00,898
Hey.

103
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:04,898
Waiter, I've been wondering...

104
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,698
What is it?

105
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:11,698
Why won't this guy show me his sleeves?

106
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,998
Who, me?

107
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:16,198
Yeah, you. Aren't you a suspect, too?

108
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,998
I can't listen to this!

109
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,598
That's enough nonsense out of you!

110
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,798
The great Kogoro Mouri would never stoop to stealing!

111
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:31,098
Come on, sir. Show her.

112
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:33,398
Prove you're innocent.

113
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:36,998
Stains on your sleeve?

114
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:39,098
Wait...

115
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:43,098
I just happened to spill some soy sauce on myself earlier.

116
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,298
Take a closer look.

117
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,898
It's more soy sauce colored than blood colored, right? And see?

118
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:51,198
He's telling the truth.

119
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:53,198
But it sounds like he's making excuses.

120
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,698
No, seriously. It's true.

121
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:58,898
-Because he's not totally innocent. -Because he's not totally innocent.

122
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:04,098
Enough! Just confess already!

123
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:05,698
Who did it?

124
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:09,598
Who stole my pouch on the train?

125
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:13,898
I didn't even take the train today.

126
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,898
I walked here.

127
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,898
I took the bus.

128
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,598
I don't like full trains.

129
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,798
I took a taxi.

130
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,898
It's just the base fare from my office to here.

131
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,398
Then I don't have a choice.

132
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:33,198
It was careless of me to celebrate

133
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:36,298
my dark horse payout ticket on the train.

134
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:39,798
I was willing to forgive you if you came clean.

135
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:44,398
But now I'll have to go through the police.

136
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,898
And I'm sure you'd prefer to get the police involved

137
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:51,498
so you can erase all doubt, right?

138
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,798
Involved... and erase?

139
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:57,298
That's it! I forgot!

140
00:08:57,298 --> 00:09:03,198
The police will only have to search your belongings.

141
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:09,998
After all, the person who has either a million yen in cash

142
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:14,898
or the stolen dark horse ticket on them is the thief.

143
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:23,998
Actually, there's no need to call the police.

144
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:27,998
The thief's already a carp on a cutting board.

145
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:33,898
All that's left is for me to name them and for them to confess.

146
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,298
Name the thief?

147
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:41,798
You mean you know who did it?

148
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:45,798
I sure do. I know who stole your pouch on the train,

149
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:49,298
brazenly came to eat sushi at this restaurant,

150
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:55,898
and hid that pouch in the bathroom.

151
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:03,198
Then you must have figured that out, too.

152
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:04,798
Figured what out?

153
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:09,998
When my pouch was stolen, I grabbed the thief's sleeve

154
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,798
with my finger wrapped in a bloodstained band-aid.

155
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:18,898
But for some reason that blood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.

156
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,698
Of course.

157
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:24,798
The thief passed through this restaurant's shop curtains

158
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,698
to erase that blood.

159
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:32,598
But I'm sure Kogoro has already figured that out.

160
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,598
Huh?

161
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:37,898
Let's leave the mystery solving to the professionals.

162
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:42,298
Let's see one of your detective shows.

163
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:46,198
I have no idea what you're talking about.

164
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:53,198
Seriously? So the Sleeping Kogoro's nothing special.

165
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,398
What?

166
00:10:54,398 --> 00:11:01,198
I learned a lot about food while working as a chef.

167
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:03,698
-Miss. -Yes?

168
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:07,798
Do you know why they put ginger in ginger fried pork?

169
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:09,398
Um...

170
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:13,498
It's not because it's called ginger fried pork.

171
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,098
Because it tastes better?

172
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:17,998
That's not the only reason.

173
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:21,698
Ginger breaks down proteins.

174
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:26,398
They put it in to soften the meat.

175
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:29,698
And protein is found in blood, too.

176
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:32,698
It's difficult to wash bloodstains out of clothes

177
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:36,898
because the proteins in them stick to the fibers.

178
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:40,998
If you wash bloodstained clothes with ginger juice,

179
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,698
the stains will come right out.

180
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:46,398
Really? I'll try it next time.

181
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:48,598
Wait. Doesn't that mean...

182
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:54,698
That's right. We serve thinly sliced ginger pickled in sweet vinegar.

183
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:58,198
So the man who ordered a mountain of pickled ginger...

184
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:02,998
That makes you the thief.

185
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,598
When you went to the bathroom

186
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,298
to hide the pouch hidden in your jacket,

187
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:11,598
didn't you pour the juice from the pickled ginger on your sleeve

188
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,098
to wash out the stain?

189
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:18,398
Hold on! I seriously didn't steal anything!

190
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,398
Don't play dumb!

191
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,798
Didn't you say

192
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:26,498
you wanted to leave because there's a show you want to watch?

193
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:27,698
Yeah.

194
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:30,198
Kogoro and his family came

195
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:33,498
after the horse races ended just after 4pm.

196
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:40,098
This woman barged in here about an hour later at 5pm.

197
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:46,198
You said you wanted to leave after the argument about the theft,

198
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,398
so that would've been around 5.30pm.

199
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,898
If you walked here, it probably takes you

200
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,498
less than 30 minutes to get home.

201
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:59,098
The only shows on around that time are cartoons and kids shows.

202
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:03,298
I wanted...

203
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,698
to see a kid's show.

204
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,098
Masked Yaiba!

205
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:12,298
The enemy boss's adviser is supposed to be on today's episode!

206
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:13,698
"Masked Yaiba"

207
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,498
Huh? Masked...

208
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:17,498
Yaiba?

209
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,598
And you're so into it, you don't want to miss it?

210
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:23,198
This Masked whatever show?

211
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,298
Yeah, you got a problem with that?

212
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:28,298
Besides, I don't know exactly how it works,

213
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:30,098
but wouldn't my sleeve be the color of pickled ginger

214
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:32,298
if I poured its juice on my sleeve?

215
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:34,198
Though I'm sure the color would come out

216
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,398
if I washed it right after this.

217
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,198
You're right.

218
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:40,998
Then go ahead and search my belongings.

219
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:44,298
I don't have a million yen or a dark horse payout ticket.

220
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:46,798
Come on! You guys show them, too!

221
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,298
Then we'll know who the thief is.

222
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:50,498
Right, mister?

223
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:52,298
Oh, but...

224
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,898
You, too, old lady!

225
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:56,698
How rude! I'm not that old!

226
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:59,698
Who cares? Just show them what you've got!

227
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:03,098
If you don't have the ticket, you're innocent!

228
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,298
Excuse me!

229
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,598
I know who has the dark horse payout ticket!

230
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:25,065
"Beika Iroha Sushi"

231
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,565
Hey, you.

232
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,165
Is that true?

233
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,165
Well, actually...

234
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,065
Dad, let me see your wallet.

235
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,265
Wait, Ran!

236
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:38,565
My dad ran into someone at the ticket booth.

237
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:42,765
He accidentally put a ticket that was on the ground in his wallet.

238
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,165
Sheesh.

239
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:46,365
So...

240
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:48,765
I'm sorry!

241
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,965
You're hopeless.

242
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:53,765
"Yamanaka 9 Race" -What is this?

243
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,265
"Win, 8 Pirate's Spirit" -This is a win ticket.

244
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:56,865
-Huh? -What?

245
00:14:56,865 --> 00:15:01,665
I bet five thousand on a quinella ticket for first and second place.

246
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:04,465
Its payout is two-hundredfold, so it's worth a million yen.

247
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,665
You shouldn't mislead people like that.

248
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:08,465
Sorry.

249
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:10,665
This is stupid.

250
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:13,265
I'm leaving.

251
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:14,365
Hey, you.

252
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,765
-We're not finished... -Let me through.

253
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,165
Then I'm leaving, too.

254
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,365
-Huh? -Me, too.

255
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,165
-Hey! -Move.

256
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:25,165
Wait! You're running away?

257
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,565
-Calm down, everyone. -I guess I don't have a choice.

258
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:33,865
The dark horse payout ticket was a quinella ticket?

259
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,465
Hold it right there!

260
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,065
Dad?

261
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,265
Since you said you like mysteries,

262
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:50,865
I thought I'd see what you could do.

263
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:54,465
But you still have a lot of learn, detective drifter.

264
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:55,465
Huh?

265
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,965
Ginger does contain protease,

266
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:02,265
an enzyme that breaks down proteins.

267
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:05,765
But ginger isn't the only thing they're found in.

268
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,065
It's also found in radishes.

269
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:12,465
If you wrap grated radish in a handkerchief,

270
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:15,565
gently pat the front and back of a bloodstain,

271
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,965
and then place a tissue over it,

272
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:19,865
the blood will transfer to the tissue.

273
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:22,265
Repeat the process three or four times,

274
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:25,465
and the bloodstain disappears completely.

275
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:28,665
And unlike pickled ginger, it doesn't leave any color.

276
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:32,465
Isn't that what you did inside the bathroom?

277
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:33,665
Hey!

278
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:36,065
The man who ordered the grilled fish,

279
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,265
which always comes with grated radish...

280
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,765
I'm talking to you!

281
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:45,465
But maybe he happened to see it on the menu

282
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,865
and wanted some grilled fish.

283
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,465
It's a dish sushi restaurants rarely serve.

284
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:54,065
No, when he ordered...

285
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,865
Also, do you have

286
00:16:56,865 --> 00:17:00,165
the limited availability seasonal grilled fish today, too?

287
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:01,965
He asked about the food.

288
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:06,565
It proves he's been here before and knows you serve grilled fish.

289
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:10,165
And only an amateur

290
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:13,965
would bring a stolen pouch all the way here.

291
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,465
One who never imagined the victim

292
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:20,465
would use their phone's GPS to track him all the way here.

293
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:25,065
Who stole my pouch?

294
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,965
I know the thief is in here.

295
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:31,565
So why did you come here

296
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:34,465
to remove the bloodstain on your sleeve?

297
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:38,465
You could've returned home and taken off your shirt or thrown it away.

298
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:41,065
Why?

299
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:42,965
Because he had something to do after this

300
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:46,665
that didn't allow him to have a bloodstain on his sleeve.

301
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,965
That young man with the TV show he doesn't want to miss

302
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:54,465
and the woman who wants to go home to participate in online auctions

303
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:58,165
would have no problem with a bloodstain on their sleeve.

304
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:00,565
But not so for that bespectacled man on his way

305
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:04,865
to meet someone for drinks at an expensive restaurant.

306
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:08,265
On top of that, he's meeting his in-laws,

307
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:12,965
who are so strict he's too nervous to eat around them.

308
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:15,265
Who knows what they'd say

309
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:18,265
if he showed up with blood on his sleeve?

310
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:23,865
But that doesn't prove I'm the thief.

311
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:28,565
No, you've already confessed that you are.

312
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,865
I haven't admitted to anything!

313
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:33,465
You said you came by bus.

314
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:35,265
Why didn't you take the train?

315
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:37,465
I said I don't like full trains.

316
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,765
Surely there are empty trains.

317
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:44,865
But she was riding in... a full train.

318
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:50,965
How do you know the train she was in was full?

319
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,365
Because...

320
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:58,165
Because you were on that train, too. Right?

321
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:07,165
I don't get it.

322
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:10,365
Why would a rich guy like you on his way to drinks

323
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:14,265
at an expensive restaurant steal?

324
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:17,865
It's my wife's parents who are rich.

325
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,565
My wife wanted for nothing growing up with them.

326
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:24,865
Her spending habits haven't changed,

327
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,065
and I can't afford it on my salary.

328
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,965
My savings have been drained, and I'm in debt.

329
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:34,865
While I was wondering if I should borrow money

330
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,765
from her parents that I'm about to see,

331
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,765
I heard her.

332
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,965
No way. I won.

333
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,665
Won what?

334
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,365
My dark horse payout ticket.

335
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:46,965
It's a million yen.

336
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:48,965
-What? -All right!

337
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:53,265
So I acted without thinking out of desperation.

338
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:06,565
I gave in to temptation.

339
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:09,565
I'm sorry!

340
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:16,965
Excuse me.

341
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,465
Is it all right if I answer?

342
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,965
It's probably my wife.

343
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,565
Sure, go ahead.

344
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,665
Thank you.

345
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:29,065
Hello, honey?

346
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:33,665
The restaurant we're at has a vintage Romanee-Conti.

347
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,665
Can I treat my parents?

348
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,565
No.

349
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:40,665
What?

350
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:42,365
We can't afford it!

351
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,665
Have a beer and come home!

352
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:49,565
Oh, also, I need to go see the police now.

353
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,165
I won't be going to the restaurant.

354
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,565
The police?

355
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,365
Wait! What do you mean, the police...

356
00:20:55,865 --> 00:21:00,065
Maybe I should've said that from the start.

357
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:04,565
I know I just stole from someone else,

358
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,465
but I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.

359
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,865
I've actually never bought a payout ticket before.

360
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:16,565
I had no idea where or how to exchange it for cash.

361
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:21,865
30 minutes later, the police arrived at the restaurant.

362
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,865
Munechika was taken away

363
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:28,065
with the slightly cheerful expression

364
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:30,865
of a man who's just finished a meal.

365
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,065
"Beika Iroha Sushi"

366
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:59,665
I underestimated you, Sleeping Kogoro!

367
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:02,965
Dad?

368
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,365
Huh?

369
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:08,565
Please make me your apprentice.

370
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:09,665
Apprentice?

371
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:13,865
I'll give you a discount on your sushi.

372
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,865
In that case, okay!

373
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,665
He's got another apprentice.

374
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:22,165
Later...

375
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:25,765
"Beika-cho Fifth Street Police Box" -Do I really have to turn it in?

376
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:28,965
No one's going to claim it.

377
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:30,465
Yes!

378
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:36,865
But no one's going to claim it.

379
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:38,265
Yes!

380
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:42,165
-But... -Yes!

381
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:47,565
Pops turned over his dark horse payout ticket to a police box.

382
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:52,265
You've gotta turn in lost items.

383
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:56,165
"Next Episode"

384
00:23:56,165 --> 00:24:00,565
General, the tiger is afraid of me and won't come out!

385
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,865
Huh?

386
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:06,165
The folding screen!

387
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,965
Let's tie him up and put him on display!

388
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:15,965
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

389
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,565
Next Conan,

390
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:24,265
"The Woman with White Hands (Part 1)"

391
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:27,308
Next Conan's Hint:

392
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:29,608
"Ms. Wakasa's house"

393
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:30,608
My dark horse payout ticket!

394
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,308
Instead of betting on horses, make some money doing your job.

395
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,808
Nice one, Ran.
