1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:04,768
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:06,638
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:10,138
Today is a serious code!
If adding doesn't work, try subtracting!

4
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:11,898
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:14,138
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:16,268
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,121 --> 00:02:00,921
Kaori, the daughter of
the novelist Shinmei Nintaro,

8
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,301
asked the old guy to find
her parents who went missing.

9
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,251
They've been missing for two months,

10
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:13,711
but the publisher still receives
his manuscripts for his new series.

11
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,371
We went straight to
the publishing company.

12
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:24,251
We found several incomprehensible
things about his manuscripts,

13
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:28,191
and they turned out to
be a code calling for help!

14
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,651
Th-This is--!

15
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:32,961
Just as I thought!

16
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:36,621
There's a message from
Shinmei-sensei hidden in these lines!

17
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:43,251
Which makes it all fit:
that provocative dedication,

18
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:46,831
the author's appearance in the story,
and the odd lines of dialogue!

19
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:55,011
But what is the goal of the person
holding him and his wife captive?!

20
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:04,371
"The Mystery Writer
Disappearance Case (Part 2)."

21
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,531
What is it? Did you
realize something else?!

22
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:13,611
It's nothing much, but...

23
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,541
Literature Era, Editing Department.

24
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,081
All the first letters
of dialogue are half--

25
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,671
Huh?! You figured out the code?!

26
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:27,881
Who are you?!

27
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,961
Is something the matter?

28
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:33,371
A boy speaking Kansai
dialect said he figured out the code

29
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,801
so I should call the police here.

30
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,261
Kansai dialect?

31
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,331
Hello?

32
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:45,351
C'mon! Don't make me repeat myself,
idiot! Just get the cops!

33
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,071
Oh, Hattori-kun. This is Megure.

34
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:53,031
Oh, you're already there!
It's been awhile!

35
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,991
So, what's with you?

36
00:03:55,291 --> 00:04:00,701
The code. I cracked the
code hidden in "Halves at the Top."

37
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:06,251
I pegged him as an angry old man
after I first read his dedication,

38
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,171
but I started to understand as I read

39
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:14,751
that Shinmei-han's dialogue
in the story was all a code.

40
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,371
It's a code?

41
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:22,601
Yeah... In other words, the dedication
wasn't meant to provoke us.

42
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:30,271
He was asking someone to find
the real message hidden in the novel!

43
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,421
I-I assume you've deciphered
the coded message then?!

44
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:39,241
Yeah... the first part deciphers perfectly.

45
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:44,541
The key was the novel's title:
"Halves of the Top."

46
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:50,211
This means the letter at the
top of each line is half of a full letter.

47
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,171
Half of a full letter?

48
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,841
Reading with that in mind...

49
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,331
...you get "suke"...

50
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,251
...then "ke"...

51
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,121
...then "te"...

52
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:05,561
...and at the very end you get a "re."

53
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,021
The "ku" and "hoka"
(other) before it are strange,

54
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:14,491
but if "hoka" is meant to be
a blank placeholder, you get "ku."

55
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,951
And if you read it all together...

56
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:17,831
"Ta su ke te ku re"...

57
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:25,371
Tasukete kure (Help us)
"Ta su ke te ku re"...

58
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:27,581
Tasukete kure (Help us)

59
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:30,541
"Help us!" It's an SOS?!

60
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:36,801
Yep... My guess is he's being held
somewhere and forced to write.

61
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,921
I see... and that's
why he used this method.

62
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:45,221
He could get a message to his
readers without his captor noticing.

63
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:50,121
My mom was excited because
it's the first new story in ten years,

64
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:56,191
so the perp is a crazed fan or
someone planning to swipe the story.

65
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:59,251
Have these manuscripts been paid for yet?

66
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,371
Not yet.

67
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:06,161
He said he'd tell where to send
the money when the story was done.

68
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,081
Alright! Check all suspicious fan letters!

69
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,621
Right!

70
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,081
Oh, but I haven't
cracked the entire code yet!

71
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,051
Hey! Inspector?! Inspector?!

72
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:22,301
Hey, Inspector! Hey! Where'd
you go?! Quit playing around!

73
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:29,061
Still, Hattori.
About Shinmei-sensei's other lines...

74
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,421
Oh! If it isn't Kudo!
What're you doing there?!

75
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,771
Nothing, I just happened to be here.

76
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,291
Yeah, I bet! You and me are a lot alike!

77
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,741
We cross paths before we even know it!

78
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,611
Let's just get back to the code.

79
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:48,211
Hey! You should come to Osaka!
I'll treat you to some great udon!

80
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:51,041
I can't stand the
heavy flavor in Tokyo!

81
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,541
Bye.

82
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,421
Sorry! Sorry! The code, right?!

83
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:57,751
I managed to decipher
the first lines of dialogue,

84
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:03,251
but "halves at the top"
doesn't fit with the next ones.

85
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:05,011
Put together, you get...

86
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:14,941
"Watashi hoka ka i he ima i
haku re no tokoro han hito wa."

87
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,941
Even if you remove the second
"hoka," only "watashi" makes sense.

88
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,861
"He" and "ima" are iffy, but they
don't combine into anything.

89
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:29,041
It seems we still don't have
all the pieces to this code.

90
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:34,831
Yeah... there has to be a big piece
to this code hidden somewhere.

91
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,251
Hattori? What's wrong?

92
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,501
How stupid.

93
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:46,511
If you're there, why should
I puzzle over it from so far away?

94
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,581
So the rest's all yours, Kudo!

95
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,921
Lemme know if you
figure anything out! Good luck!

96
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,151
H-Hey! Wait!

97
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:58,611
Oh! That's right! Hattori-kun
should know the rest of the code!

98
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,611
Damn!

99
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:07,031
It wasn't me! He was the one who--!

100
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,951
Inspector... this is Tokyo.

101
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:17,421
Let's forget about the Osaka
boy and solve this ourselves!

102
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,921
Oh! Good call!

103
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,131
So, are you feeling sleepy?

104
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,341
Huh? What do you mean?

105
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:30,001
You know! When you always go,
"Funya!" or "Hohe!"

106
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,971
Nope, nothing yet...

107
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,891
Oh, that's a shame.

108
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,081
Help us! Help us!

109
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:41,121
Help us!

110
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,861
Dad... Mom...

111
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:49,581
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll
find your mother and father.

112
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,781
Don't give up.

113
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,961
So let's use our heads, too.

114
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,751
Okay!

115
00:08:54,751 --> 00:09:00,841
Damn! Adding or removing
nearby letters doesn't do anything!

116
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,251
What is this code?!

117
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:07,261
I also don't know who abducted them!

118
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:11,721
It would be natural to pay close
attention to your captive's writings.

119
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:13,871
If the captor is a fan,

120
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:19,871
he'd clearly be suspicious of that
atypical dedication and character.

121
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,921
He would've at least deciphered
the first "help me" by now!

122
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:27,421
In which case, he'd be
after the manuscript payment.

123
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,001
No, that can't be it.

124
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,831
You wouldn't hold a person
captive two whole months for that.

125
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:39,171
I can't figure out the
captor's identity or this code!

126
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:40,871
Darn it!

127
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,631
Hey! This is wrong!

128
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:49,371
Using French to fancy things up
is fine, but don't spell stuff wrong!

129
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,091
Sorry...

130
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,971
French?

131
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:58,391
"Humour" is spelled "h-u-m-o-u-r."
You're missing the "h."

132
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:03,981
It's not pronounced, though,
so I can understand the mistake.

133
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:10,701
That's it! Now I see!

134
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,751
In which case, the code is...

135
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,961
I can read it! I can read it!

136
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,921
I can read every single letter!

137
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:27,841
That's it! That's definitely where
Shinmei-sensei is being held!

138
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,501
Inspector!

139
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:33,551
Shinmei-sensei also has dialogue
in the eighth chapter we just got!

140
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:34,851
What?!

141
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,711
This is the scene...

142
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,771
Oh no! There's no time!

143
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:50,701
If we don't hurry,
he and his wife will be--!

144
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,911
Alright! I'll just do like always...

145
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,951
...and use this Tranquilizer
Wristwatch to knock the old guy out!

146
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:02,671
Mori-san. Let me introduce you.
This is our chief editor...

147
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,171
I-I missed!

148
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,851
Whoops! I guess I have no choice!

149
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,771
Chief! Chief! What's wrong?!

150
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:26,651
I'll just have to have him play a detective!

151
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:30,831
Now to set the Voice-Changing
Bowtie to use his voice...

152
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,501
Let's see...

153
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:35,671
Wait a minute!
I don't know what he sounds like!

154
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:37,531
Hey, Conan-kun.

155
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,001
What are you doing down there?

156
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,961
O-Oh, just playing Hide-and-Seek!

157
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:49,961
This is bad!
There's only one tranquilizer dart!

158
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:54,191
I'll have to wait for them
to crack the code themselves.

159
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,091
But...

160
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,681
If we don't hurry,
Shinmei-sensei will...!

161
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:04,981
What happened!
Please wake up, Chief! Chief!

162
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:09,581
He's snoring. Almost reminds
me of "Sleeping Kogoro."

163
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:10,441
Yes...

164
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,501
What're you laughing about?

165
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,371
The chief editor is copying how you sleep!

166
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,331
He seems like he has lots of humor!

167
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:28,291
Humor? As always,
you know strange words for a kid.

168
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,261
Those men were talking about it just now!

169
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:36,001
They were saying
stuff about "humour"! Right?

170
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:36,721
Yes...

171
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:42,711
He misspelled the word,
so I fixed it for him.

172
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,891
I forgot to add the "h."

173
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,851
What rubbish.

174
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,251
But French people sure are strange!

175
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,821
They don't read "h" at the start of words!

176
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:57,781
If they don't say "h,"
they should remove it from the start!

177
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,241
Remove it...

178
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,701
...from the start?

179
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:07,371
That reminds me, Shinmei-sensei's
character lives in France, right?

180
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,421
Yeah.

181
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,871
M-Mori-kun... could this be--?

182
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:15,871
Yes... the other key to
this code might be the fact

183
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:20,351
that "h" isn't pronounced
at the start of words in French.

184
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,141
Silent "h" s!

185
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:25,601
Characters that start with "h"?!

186
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:32,361
Could it mean to remove the
h from ha, hi, hu, he, and ho?!

187
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,081
I see!

188
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:41,171
If it means you have to drop the
"h" letter when combining letters,

189
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:44,291
the "hoka" in the first part works.

190
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:53,251
Using all of this to decipher
Mr. Shinmei's second scene...

191
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,711
...you get "watashi"...

192
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,251
...then "ga"...

193
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,961
...then "ima"...

194
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,711
...then "i"...

195
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,331
...then "ru"...

196
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:04,371
...then "tokoro"...

197
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:06,221
...then "wa"...

198
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:14,541
All together, it's "watashi
ga ima i ru tokoro wa"...

199
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,151
"The place I'm at now"?!

200
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,491
Wow! It makes a sentence!

201
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:25,201
I see. He used that "wa" instead
of "ha" because of the "h" rule.

202
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:31,421
Alright! When you decipher
the third scene he's in, you get...

203
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:37,761
"Ki to shi te i ho te ru"...

204
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:42,711
Kido City Hotel? What hotel is that?
I've never heard of it.

205
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:46,221
It could be using
Hepburn romanization!

206
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:52,251
In which case, "hu" would be "fu."

207
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:56,151
And if you keep the first "fu,"
it would combine to make "hai."

208
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:59,611
H-Haido City Hotel?!

209
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:03,821
Meaning the fourth set of
lines is probably the room number.

210
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:05,921
Let's see...

211
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:12,791
"2407 go shitsu"...

212
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,251
"Room 2407"!

213
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:20,171
Okay! We go straight to
Haido City Hotel, Room 2407!

214
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:20,631
Yes, sir!

215
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:21,971
Inspector!

216
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,791
What is it, Takagi-kun?!

217
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,641
Look at this manuscript!
There's more dialogue!

218
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:32,601
Oh, this is the eighth chapter
that was just faxed here.

219
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,751
Let's see...

220
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,311
"Haya ku..." (hurry)

221
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:43,111
"Ji kan ga nai..." (there's no time)

222
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:46,871
"Hurry, there's no time!"

223
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,665
Hey! Hurry it up!

224
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:09,035
Haido City Hotel.
Follow those police cars.

225
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:09,625
Hurry!

226
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,635
R-Right!

227
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:17,535
Dad... Mom...

228
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:21,785
Dad! Mom! Please be okay!

229
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:23,565
They're alive.

230
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:27,075
"There's not much time" can also mean

231
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:29,905
that danger is looming but it's not too late.

232
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:35,915
It's been barely an hour
since that manuscript was sent,

233
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:38,205
and it's still the middle of the novel.

234
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,295
There's a good chance they're alive.

235
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:41,715
Right?

236
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:51,175
But I don't understand
what the captor wants.

237
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:57,825
Is a crazed fan anxious for the new
Det. Samonji series behind this?

238
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,055
No...

239
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,065
Was it an abduction to
get a popular writer's money?

240
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:07,705
No, Room 2407 is a suite.
That doesn't fit.

241
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:10,695
Then what is the captor after?!

242
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:17,035
What is the plan of the person
who's forcing Shinmei-sensei to write

243
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,285
even when he can't sign his own name?

244
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:23,245
Wait a minute!
If he can't sign his name...

245
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:27,675
...that means he's dictating
his story to someone!

246
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:30,675
Then he's having
someone else type it all out,

247
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:34,805
even when one misplaced
letter could ruin the code?!

248
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,825
That's crazy!

249
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:42,845
Adding and removing for no
reason would make anyone suspicious!

250
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:48,895
Even if his wife was typing,
the person watching would notice!

251
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:57,965
Wait! Hold on! Could
this incident actually be--?!

252
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:10,835
Room 2407... Alright! This is the room!

253
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:16,055
The captor may have
a weapon! Everyone stay sharp!

254
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,235
Umm, can I help you?

255
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,245
Mom!

256
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,195
Kaori! Why are you here?!

257
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:37,325
Get back, Madam!

258
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,035
Freeze! Police!

259
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,755
Dad! Dad!

260
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,675
Dad! Dad!

261
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:02,185
Your father passed
away just moments ago.

262
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:03,995
Kaori-san.

263
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:08,605
I called your home many times,
but I couldn't get a hold of you.

264
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:16,535
So you're the one
who abducted Mr. Shinmei?

265
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,155
No, I'm...

266
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,865
He's my husband's personal physician.

267
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,825
Then who's the kidnapper?

268
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:32,755
There is no kidnapper.
If there was, it'd be Shinmei himself.

269
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,205
Does that mean the code was--?!

270
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,095
You can't mean--!

271
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:40,055
A fabrication put together by my husband.

272
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,015
B-But why?

273
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:47,745
My husband was always saying this...

274
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:55,205
I, of course, feel happiness
when I receive praise for my works,

275
00:19:55,205 --> 00:20:00,745
but in my forty years of writing,
there's a happiness I've yet to have.

276
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:04,205
Just once, I'd like to
see with my own eyes

277
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:12,865
the face of a reader who solves
a mystery before I give the solution.

278
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:17,425
He said he wanted
to do so before he died,

279
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:23,825
so his physician and
I helped him write his story here.

280
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,395
Before dying?

281
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:30,955
He lost use of his arms two
weeks ago, due to terminal cancer.

282
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:34,315
So that's why his signatures were copies?

283
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,025
I'm sorry for worrying you, Kaori.

284
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:44,955
Your father told me not to tell you,
to give believability to his code.

285
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:52,025
Forgive your father, and consider
it his last selfish act, Kaori...

286
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:31,725
Talk about your false alarms...

287
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:37,915
Surely he knew a code like that
could've caused a big police panic!

288
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:42,955
But he always wrote at the end of his novels

289
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:46,695
that he wanted to see the proud
look of one of his readers.

290
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:50,955
He was probably waiting for a
reader who figured everything out

291
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:53,415
to show up and say, "I solved it!"

292
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:57,415
But no one ever came.

293
00:22:57,415 --> 00:23:02,335
And now that he's gone,
the novel will stay unfinished.

294
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,295
I won't let that happen.

295
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:07,635
I'll write the rest of it.

296
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:10,635
I won't shame the name Shinmei Nintaro!

297
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:19,275
Two months after this incident,

298
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:23,605
Kaori-san spectacularly
completed her father's novel

299
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:28,575
and "Halves at the Top"
managed to become a bestseller!

300
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:33,915
Naturally, a TV version was
soon made and earned great reviews,

301
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:37,955
which led her to enter the writing world!

302
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:43,125
Although this was because
she was as skilled as her father,

303
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:49,575
the dimwitted detective, tomboy girl,
and the cheeky boy in glasses

304
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:54,515
who assisted Samonji in the
last half of the story also helped.

305
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:58,365
I won't say who they were based on...

306
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,315
...but I could do
without the "cheeky" part.
