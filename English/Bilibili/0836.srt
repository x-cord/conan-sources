1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.870
"Poirot" -A band, a band!

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.570
Let's the three of us start a girls' high school band!

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.570
What?

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.770
Where's all this coming from?

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.870
The movie of a girls' high school band that I was watching last night

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.470
was super cute.

7
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.870
Really?

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.070
And?

9
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.770
What musical instrument are we going to play, Sonoko?

10
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.170
Of course drums!

11
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.670
The girl drummer in that band looked like me.

12
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.070
She was awesome.

13
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.270
I see.

14
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.470
Then, I'll...

15
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.370
Since you've got long black hair,

16
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.570
you're playing the bass, you're the bassist!

17
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
What?

18
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.570
The bassist in that band had hair like yours too.

19
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.170
But I never played bass before.

20
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.370
You're better at playing the piano, right, Ran?

21
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.170
Maybe I should play bass?

22
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.070
Big brother's friend taught me how to play bass before.

23
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.170
Okay, Sera, you play bass

24
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.470
and Ran, will you play the keyboard then?

25
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.170
Okay.

26
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.870
But, where are we going to be performing?

27
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.070
"Looking For Performers, Beika-cho Countdown Talent Show"

28
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.970
We'll perform at the end of the year countdown talent show in Beika-cho

29
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.370
and win the championship!

30
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.670
But don't we need a guitarist for the band too?

31
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.270
You're right,

32
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.570
but there's no one in class who looks to be able to play the guitar.

33
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.770
Azusa!

34
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.770
Will you wipe the table, please?

35
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.070
Oh, okay.

36
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.670
I found a guitarist!

37
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.770
What?

38
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.570
There was a girl named Azusa,

39
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.270
who played the guitar well in that high school girls band too!

40
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.970
But I never ever touched a guitar.

41
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.570
And, besides, I'm not even in high school to begin with.

42
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.470
If you wear a uniform, nobody would know!

43
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.170
Besides, you have pretty much of a baby face too, Azusa!

44
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.770
Baby face?

45
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.170
She's completely poisoned by that movie.

46
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.370
But, isn't a guitar difficult to play?

47
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.870
You'll be just fine, don't worry.

48
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.470
Just a little practice and you be able to play in no time!

49
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.070
Strum, strum.

50
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.370
Okay, play then!

51
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.970
Here, I'll lend you my guitar.

52
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.670
Oh, but...

53
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.270
We'll hook it up to our portable amp,

54
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.970
so you can play right away.

55
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.470
Go ahead!

56
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.670
No...

57
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.370
You said with a little practice, you could play in no time, right?

58
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.670
If so, show me what you can do, young lady.

59
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.370
A canvas stained black with crime.

60
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.770
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

61
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.970
What will happen to Sonoko?

62
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.570
I guess there are great expectations for the three member of the JK band!

63
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.170
He sees through the one and only truth.

64
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

65
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.670
His name is Detective Conan!

66
00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:37.828
"A Girls' Band on Bad Terms (Part 1)"

67
00:04:44.628 --> 00:04:49.428
In the movie, I think the fingers were place like this.

68
00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:55.828
Come on, you can't even play.

69
00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.228
You've got the nerve, when you can't even play!

70
00:04:58.228 --> 00:05:00.128
High school girl!

71
00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:01.428
Sonoko.

72
00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:05.928
Hand it over.

73
00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:25.528
Wow.

74
00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:45.328
He's good!

75
00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:48.428
Well, if they practice a little,

76
00:05:48.428 --> 00:05:50.528
they'll be able to play this in no time at all, right?

77
00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:51.628
Sure.

78
00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:52.728
Yes.

79
00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.028
You're right.

80
00:05:54.828 --> 00:05:57.828
Sonoko, you should watch your big mouth too.

81
00:05:57.828 --> 00:05:58.828
Okay.

82
00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:01.328
Thank you very much!

83
00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:05.828
Amuro, please join our band!

84
00:06:05.828 --> 00:06:06.828
What?

85
00:06:06.828 --> 00:06:10.428
Then, we can have a girls' high school plus handsome band, right?

86
00:06:10.428 --> 00:06:12.028
I don't think so.

87
00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:13.728
I don't like to stand out, you see.

88
00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:16.528
Well, after all, you're a security police agent

89
00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:18.728
that's infiltrated the Black Organization so...

90
00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:21.428
I can help you out when you practice, though.

91
00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:23.328
Would you like to go to a rental studio

92
00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:24.928
and practice a little from now?

93
00:06:24.928 --> 00:06:27.228
-That sounds good! -Yes, let's!

94
00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:28.428
Hey, you.

95
00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:33.328
Haven't we met somewhere before?

96
00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:34.528
No.

97
00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.128
I think today's the first time.

98
00:06:45.628 --> 00:06:48.028
Oh, no?

99
00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:50.628
All the rooms are full?

100
00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:54.428
It'll be a one hour wait.

101
00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:55.628
What shall we do?

102
00:06:55.628 --> 00:06:56.828
Maybe some other time then?

103
00:06:56.828 --> 00:06:59.028
But, we came all this way.

104
00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:02.428
Well, if it's just an hour, maybe we should wait?

105
00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:05.428
There seems to be a break room on the basement floor too.

106
00:07:05.428 --> 00:07:07.028
If we rent the instruments,

107
00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:08.428
I can at least teach you the feel of a song

108
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.728
by playing note for note and the chords.

109
00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:14.628
Oh, you can play the bass too?

110
00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:15.728
Yes.

111
00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:20.528
Although I can't guarantee that I'm better than your big brother's friend.

112
00:07:20.528 --> 00:07:23.428
By the way, can you play the drums, Sonoko?

113
00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:24.528
Of course!

114
00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:27.328
I'm great at Drum Master!

115
00:07:27.328 --> 00:07:28.928
A video game, huh?

116
00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:38.128
Sera, you're fantastic!

117
00:07:38.128 --> 00:07:39.228
You're good!

118
00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.328
I just played the scale.

119
00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.728
Well, but the only thing that my brother's friend taught me

120
00:07:44.728 --> 00:07:46.428
was till here though.

121
00:07:46.428 --> 00:07:48.128
Really?

122
00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:53.328
Do you remember the face of the guy who taught you how to play the bass?

123
00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:55.228
Well, sort of.

124
00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:59.828
But how did you know that his friend was a guy?

125
00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:03.428
Well, I just happened to think so.

126
00:08:05.728 --> 00:08:06.728
Come on!

127
00:08:07.728 --> 00:08:10.028
At this rate, we won't make it in time!

128
00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:13.228
We've only got a week to go before the live, you know!

129
00:08:13.228 --> 00:08:15.728
Tadako, your bass is off rhythm,

130
00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:18.128
and your voice isn't projecting either!

131
00:08:18.128 --> 00:08:21.828
Sorry, I over drank yesterday.

132
00:08:21.828 --> 00:08:25.128
And Rumi, your keyboard played the wrong sound at times!

133
00:08:25.128 --> 00:08:27.228
I'll bet your nails are long!

134
00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:32.428
Sorry. I haven't been playing the keyboard recently.

135
00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:37.828
And Hagie, your drumming was more sluggish than always.

136
00:08:37.828 --> 00:08:39.028
"Hagie Yamaji (25), Drums (Leader)" -Sorry.

137
00:08:39.028 --> 00:08:42.628
"Hagie Yamaji (25), Drums (Leader)" -I'm kind of sleepy, you see.

138
00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:46.028
Come on, shape up, everybody!

139
00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:48.428
Someka, your guitar was a bit too fast too.

140
00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.928
It was like you were annoyed or something.

141
00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:52.628
Like I said, we don't have much time left.

142
00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:56.328
You don't seem to notice that your button's about to fall off too.

143
00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:59.228
-What? -The chest pocket to the left.

144
00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:05.528
Well, let's cool our heads off a bit and resume practice.

145
00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:08.728
I'm going back to the studio to take a quick nap till then.

146
00:09:08.728 --> 00:09:12.028
I should be okay after a 10 minute nap.

147
00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:13.928
Gosh.

148
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.928
We only have two more hours in the studio.

149
00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:18.728
What should I do about my nails?

150
00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:20.628
Would you like to use my nail clipper?

151
00:09:20.628 --> 00:09:24.028
Thank you. I'll go cut my nails in the restroom later.

152
00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:26.828
Would you like me to sew your button on for you too, Someka?

153
00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:29.228
I have a sewing kit.

154
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:31.728
You're like a mother, Tadako.

155
00:09:31.728 --> 00:09:34.028
You're good at sewing too.

156
00:09:34.028 --> 00:09:36.628
I'm not as good at knitting as Akane, though.

157
00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:40.728
Akane knitted the cap that Hagie's wearing too.

158
00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:41.928
That's right.

159
00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:47.428
This is a tribute for Akane, so we have to make it a success!

160
00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:50.228
And yet, Hagie goes and takes a nap.

161
00:09:50.228 --> 00:09:51.628
I wonder if she really understands.

162
00:09:51.628 --> 00:09:53.328
Bummers!

163
00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:56.728
I forgot my sewing kit at the studio.

164
00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:58.228
Okay, I'll go wake Hagie up

165
00:09:58.228 --> 00:10:00.228
and while I'm at it, I'll sew your button on for you

166
00:10:00.228 --> 00:10:01.528
so can you take off your jacket?

167
00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:05.728
Okay. But, I'll go wake Hagie up

168
00:10:05.728 --> 00:10:08.728
because I've got to change the guitar string that broke too.

169
00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:13.328
Oh, there was a part in a song that I wanted to change too.

170
00:10:13.328 --> 00:10:16.528
But if Hagie's sleeping in the studio, I guess I can't.

171
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:19.628
I've got to play the keyboard to write out the notes too.

172
00:10:19.628 --> 00:10:21.728
I've got to turn the volume up to tune my guitar too.

173
00:10:21.728 --> 00:10:25.028
Well, since we've still got time, no need to rush.

174
00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:26.228
Okay!

175
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:33.828
We'll be playing Yoko Okino's "Dandelion".

176
00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:36.128
Who's going to be singing it?

177
00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:37.228
What?

178
00:10:38.328 --> 00:10:41.128
You are, aren't you, Sonoko?

179
00:10:41.128 --> 00:10:44.728
I can't do two things at one time.

180
00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.528
So, would you like to sing it, Sera?

181
00:10:46.528 --> 00:10:48.428
Nah, I pass.

182
00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:51.428
How about your boyfriend, Shinichi?

183
00:10:51.428 --> 00:10:52.528
What?

184
00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:55.428
I'm sure that he can play the guitar too, can't he?

185
00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:59.228
Shinichi can play the violin.

186
00:10:59.228 --> 00:11:01.528
But I wonder about the guitar?

187
00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:02.628
As to singing...

188
00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:04.128
As to singing?

189
00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:08.628
As to singing, he's on the same level as Conan, right?

190
00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:11.228
Sorry that I'm tone-deaf.

191
00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:17.228
Isn't the scream of the people of the band we saw earlier?

192
00:11:17.228 --> 00:11:19.028
It came from the studio upstairs, right?

193
00:11:23.428 --> 00:11:24.528
Where did that scream come from?

194
00:11:24.528 --> 00:11:27.228
From the studio back there.

195
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:30.028
Is she dead?

196
00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:33.228
Hey! Hagie!

197
00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:34.728
No joke?

198
00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:37.528
Hagie? Hagie?

199
00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:39.328
There's a Yoshikawa line on her neck.

200
00:11:40.928 --> 00:11:43.028
She was strangled to death.

201
00:11:43.028 --> 00:11:45.028
Strangled?

202
00:11:45.028 --> 00:11:46.828
Who did this to Hagie?

203
00:11:46.828 --> 00:11:49.028
I think we'll be able to figure it out right away.

204
00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:50.028
What?

205
00:11:50.228 --> 00:11:51.228
See.

206
00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:55.428
We can view the footage from the security camera on the ceiling.

207
00:11:57.328 --> 00:11:59.628
Hey? What the heck is this?

208
00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:02.628
Half of the image is black and not visible?

209
00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:04.928
More so, it's black just by the drums.

210
00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:07.528
I think that's behind the cell phone.

211
00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:10.428
We were filming ourselves practicing.

212
00:12:10.428 --> 00:12:13.528
We stuck a selfie stick to the tip of the mic.

213
00:12:13.528 --> 00:12:14.828
I see.

214
00:12:14.828 --> 00:12:16.728
Under these circumstances...

215
00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:20.128
Even if somebody was doing something near the victim...

216
00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:23.228
Nobody would know about it!

217
00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:37.195
I see.

218
00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:40.095
In order to record your practice,

219
00:12:40.095 --> 00:12:42.795
since you set the cell phone onto the tip of the mic stand,

220
00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:45.295
which was attached to the selfie stick, like this,

221
00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:49.095
one side of the image on the security camera was cut off,

222
00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:51.695
and the area around the drums was completely out of range

223
00:12:51.695 --> 00:12:55.495
that it's impossible to tell who strangled her.

224
00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:57.095
Is that right?

225
00:12:57.095 --> 00:12:58.795
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:02.295
By the way, who put this here?

227
00:13:02.295 --> 00:13:03.895
I did.

228
00:13:04.595 --> 00:13:08.895
But I wasn't trying to block the security camera or anything.

229
00:13:08.895 --> 00:13:11.995
I just set it up like everyone told me to.

230
00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:13.995
Right?

231
00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:14.995
Yes.

232
00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:17.495
We were watching the image on the cell phone

233
00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:19.095
and told her to move it more to the left.

234
00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:21.495
Or more to the rear and things like that.

235
00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:26.495
And in the end, I think we decided on the position after Hagie said

236
00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:29.895
to set the camera there and start practice.

237
00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:33.095
But, didn't the shop people scold you?

238
00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.095
After all, you've blocked half the security camera.

239
00:13:36.495 --> 00:13:39.195
At first they cautioned us, but...

240
00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:44.495
we're regulars here so they're lenient on us recently.

241
00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.995
But, why?

242
00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:52.595
Normally, one part of the wall of rental studios

243
00:13:52.595 --> 00:13:54.995
is made of mirrored walls like this,

244
00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:57.195
so that the crime being committed is reflected on the mirror

245
00:13:57.195 --> 00:14:00.595
and recorded on the security camera.

246
00:14:00.595 --> 00:14:02.995
Why were the curtains closed?

247
00:14:02.995 --> 00:14:04.795
Hagie told us to do so too.

248
00:14:04.795 --> 00:14:07.495
She said because she wanted to concentrate on playing.

249
00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:08.795
She said if we're recording it on the cell phone,

250
00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:11.595
watching it later would be good enough.

251
00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:16.895
Which means this situation was meant to occur.

252
00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:18.095
Yes.

253
00:14:18.095 --> 00:14:20.895
The perp who assumed it would turn out this way,

254
00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:23.195
used it to her advantage.

255
00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:27.995
Well, that is, if you will take the word of a detective.

256
00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:34.895
I think it's best to listen to what the three have to say

257
00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:38.295
while watching the security camera, no?

258
00:14:38.295 --> 00:14:39.895
It seems that all the girls

259
00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:44.895
went in to the studio one after the other to wake Hagie up.

260
00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:48.595
So, we have this coffee shop detective, a high school girl detective

261
00:14:48.595 --> 00:14:51.495
and a grade schooler who believes he's a detective once again.

262
00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:54.795
There sure are a lot of detectives in this town, aren't there?

263
00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:57.995
So, is this how it is?

264
00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:01.795
You four were taking a break in the basement break room,

265
00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:05.495
Hagie said she wanted to take a nap and went back to the studio.

266
00:15:05.495 --> 00:15:08.595
The three of you went at different times to wake her,

267
00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:10.095
but she didn't get up.

268
00:15:10.495 --> 00:15:13.395
And since she was sleeping for more than 30 minutes,

269
00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:15.795
all three of you decided to go and wake her up together,

270
00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:18.595
but you found Hagie dead.

271
00:15:19.395 --> 00:15:20.695
Yes.

272
00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:23.995
Who was the first one to go wake Hagie up?

273
00:15:23.995 --> 00:15:25.795
It was me.

274
00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:29.295
I called out to her several times but got no answer.

275
00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:32.195
She was sleeping even after I finished sewing on the button,

276
00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:35.595
so I went back to the break room where Someka and Rumi were waiting.

277
00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:37.795
-Button? -I was going to sew the button

278
00:15:37.795 --> 00:15:40.495
that was almost ready to come off from Someka's jacket,

279
00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:44.195
but found out that I had left the sewing kit at the studio.

280
00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:45.495
This must be it.

281
00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:47.695
When Tadako entered the room.

282
00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.095
Half of your body is hidden,

283
00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:52.895
but it's obvious that you're sewing.

284
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:57.295
But, it looks as if you've been here for more than 10 minutes.

285
00:15:57.295 --> 00:16:00.195
Does it take that much time just to sew on a button?

286
00:16:00.195 --> 00:16:01.795
Yeah, when I took a look,

287
00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.895
I saw that cuff of her sleeve was coming a bit apart.

288
00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:07.195
True! The cuff's been fixed.

289
00:16:07.195 --> 00:16:09.495
So, who's the next one that went to wake her up?

290
00:16:09.995 --> 00:16:11.295
Me.

291
00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:15.695
My guitar's getting a tune up so I rented one from this shop.

292
00:16:15.695 --> 00:16:19.295
While I was practicing, the string of the guitar broke.

293
00:16:19.295 --> 00:16:22.295
I thought I'd try waking her while I replaced the string.

294
00:16:22.295 --> 00:16:25.795
The reason why all four of us took a break from practice

295
00:16:25.795 --> 00:16:28.195
was because my guitar string broke too.

296
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:30.095
If you rented the guitar from here,

297
00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:33.895
couldn't you have had the shop clerk change the string for you?

298
00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:37.895
I wanted to replace the string and tune the guitar myself!

299
00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:40.295
Oh, this is you, isn't it, Someka?

300
00:16:41.095 --> 00:16:44.695
It's when you're replacing the string and tuning your guitar.

301
00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:46.495
Yes, that's right.

302
00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:49.095
But, you've got to turn up the volume to tune the guitar, don't you?

303
00:16:49.095 --> 00:16:52.395
You're pretty close to the drums, aren't you?

304
00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:55.795
I figured I'd deliberately make noise and wake her up!

305
00:16:55.795 --> 00:16:58.495
I wanted to hurry and get on with practice, so...

306
00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:01.295
How did Hagie look back then?

307
00:17:01.295 --> 00:17:06.295
She had her face on the high tom of the drums and was sleeping.

308
00:17:06.295 --> 00:17:08.495
She always slept like that.

309
00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:12.295
So if she was already dead by that point...

310
00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:15.295
You wouldn't have known.

311
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:16.795
Don't tell me that

312
00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:20.595
you're insinuating that I did it when I went there at the beginning?

313
00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:22.595
I was just stating an example.

314
00:17:22.595 --> 00:17:26.095
So, the last one to go wake her up was you, Rumi?

315
00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:27.195
Yes.

316
00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:31.995
The fact is, I found a part in a song that I wanted to change.

317
00:17:31.995 --> 00:17:35.395
So I went to make the change while at the same time to wake her up.

318
00:17:35.395 --> 00:17:37.695
If you take a look at the music sheet I left back at the studio,

319
00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:39.595
I think you'll understand what I mean.

320
00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:41.695
Let's see.

321
00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:45.595
It's true that there are parts that look to have been re-written.

322
00:17:45.595 --> 00:17:47.995
You changed this part to up tempo, right?

323
00:17:47.995 --> 00:17:48.995
Yep.

324
00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:51.395
I think this is better because it has more beat to it!

325
00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:53.495
It's all Greek to me.

326
00:17:53.495 --> 00:17:56.395
Well, but now that Hagie is dead,

327
00:17:56.395 --> 00:18:00.695
I don't know if we'll have the chance to play that song anymore though.

328
00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:03.295
There, there!

329
00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:07.195
But, Rumi, you're moving your keyboard.

330
00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:11.195
I moved away from the drums so I wouldn't wake Hagie.

331
00:18:11.195 --> 00:18:14.895
I wanted Hagie to listen to the song after I finished revising it and all,

332
00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:17.495
so I kept the volume down really low too.

333
00:18:17.495 --> 00:18:23.095
I finished revising and called out to her but got no answer.

334
00:18:23.095 --> 00:18:26.695
You seem to have been at the studio for about 10 minutes too?

335
00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:30.195
Okay, we're going to search for the rope like murder weapon

336
00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:31.895
that Hagie was killed with.

337
00:18:31.895 --> 00:18:34.995
After all three of you go through a body check,

338
00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:37.895
please wait at the break room in the basement.

339
00:18:42.795 --> 00:18:45.695
What? You can't find the murder weapon?

340
00:18:45.695 --> 00:18:47.995
Did you search every nook and cranny?

341
00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:49.995
Yes, we searched all over the studio

342
00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.595
including the bathroom and inside the drain as well.

343
00:18:53.895 --> 00:18:56.595
Her ETD is around just when the three girls

344
00:18:56.595 --> 00:18:59.995
went to the studio to wake her up.

345
00:18:59.995 --> 00:19:01.395
According to the security camera of this shop

346
00:19:01.395 --> 00:19:03.195
that's set up by the entrance,

347
00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:06.095
those three did not go outside.

348
00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:09.295
If no weapon was found on the bodies of the girls,

349
00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:11.595
the murder weapon has to be somewhere in this room.

350
00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:13.295
Search harder!

351
00:19:13.295 --> 00:19:14.295
Yes, sir.

352
00:19:16.595 --> 00:19:19.095
Did something happen?

353
00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:21.195
There were police cars parked outside,

354
00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:22.195
but is it a case or something?

355
00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:23.895
No, it's nothing really...

356
00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:26.695
What's the matter, Sera?

357
00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:29.195
Do you suspect them?

358
00:19:29.195 --> 00:19:30.395
Oh, no.

359
00:19:30.395 --> 00:19:32.695
It's just that seeing somebody carrying a guitar case

360
00:19:32.695 --> 00:19:34.495
brings back memories.

361
00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:35.895
It reminds me of 4 years ago

362
00:19:35.895 --> 00:19:38.995
when I watched Shu standing on the other side of the platform

363
00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:41.495
carrying a guitar case!

364
00:19:42.395 --> 00:19:44.295
Shu?

365
00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:47.795
So, is she Mr. Akai's younger sister after all?

366
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:49.495
I was surprised.

367
00:19:49.495 --> 00:19:52.095
Because I thought he was in the States.

368
00:19:52.095 --> 00:19:56.295
And I never saw Shu do music too.

369
00:19:56.295 --> 00:20:01.495
Back then, I was on my way back after watching a movie with a friend,

370
00:20:01.495 --> 00:20:04.395
but ran and got on the same train as Shu!

371
00:20:04.895 --> 00:20:08.095
I really wanted to listen to Shu playing the guitar.

372
00:20:08.095 --> 00:20:09.695
Really?

373
00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:10.895
What happened next?

374
00:20:11.595 --> 00:20:14.395
Shu found me on one of the station platforms

375
00:20:14.395 --> 00:20:16.595
where I transferred trains several times.

376
00:20:16.595 --> 00:20:18.695
He scolded me telling me to go home

377
00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:19.795
but when I told him

378
00:20:19.795 --> 00:20:22.595
I didn't have any money and didn't know how to get home,

379
00:20:22.595 --> 00:20:24.995
he left me on the platform after telling me to wait

380
00:20:24.995 --> 00:20:27.595
while he goes and buys me a ticket.

381
00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:29.095
To tell the truth, I was already in intermediate school

382
00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:32.395
so I had money and knew how to get home too,

383
00:20:32.395 --> 00:20:36.895
but to him, I guess I was still a child.

384
00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:40.595
And? Did you wait like he told to?

385
00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:43.295
Yeah. I felt like crying.

386
00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:48.295
But back then the man that Shu was with...

387
00:20:48.295 --> 00:20:50.095
You.

388
00:20:50.095 --> 00:20:53.395
Do you like music?

389
00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:56.895
After saying that, he took the bass out of the case

390
00:20:56.895 --> 00:21:01.195
and taught me how to play a scale.

391
00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:02.795
Oh.

392
00:21:02.795 --> 00:21:06.095
So the person you mentioned earlier that taught you the bass...

393
00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:07.795
It was him?

394
00:21:07.795 --> 00:21:11.795
Yeah. It was only for about 10 minutes though.

395
00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:16.095
Then maybe he was your big brother's music friend?

396
00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:18.095
I wonder about that.

397
00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:21.995
The bass that the person had was in a soft case.

398
00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:24.595
But it didn't change form and stayed upright

399
00:21:24.595 --> 00:21:27.495
even after he took the bass out.

400
00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:30.495
Maybe the bass was just camouflage

401
00:21:30.495 --> 00:21:34.695
and something harder was inside the case.

402
00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:35.895
A rifle.

403
00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:37.595
And? And?

404
00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:39.795
Did you get his name?

405
00:21:39.795 --> 00:21:41.595
No, I didn't.

406
00:21:41.595 --> 00:21:46.695
But another man who came to the platform called him.

407
00:21:46.695 --> 00:21:48.895
Scotch!

408
00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:53.195
Scotch?

409
00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:54.595
He was non-Japanese?

410
00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:57.095
He looked Japanese no matter how I looked at him

411
00:21:57.095 --> 00:21:59.395
so I think it was just a nickname.

412
00:21:59.395 --> 00:22:02.995
But, the man who called him that

413
00:22:02.995 --> 00:22:05.395
had his hat deep over his eyes

414
00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:08.095
so I didn't get a good view of what he looked like.

415
00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:14.295
He looked very similar to you, Amuro!

416
00:22:14.295 --> 00:22:15.995
It's someone else.

417
00:22:15.995 --> 00:22:17.795
Never mind such old time stories.

418
00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:21.495
Why don't we get to solving the case that just happened here?

419
00:22:21.495 --> 00:22:24.295
You're a detective too, aren't you?

420
00:22:24.295 --> 00:22:26.995
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:56.495
It's just as the girls say.

422
00:23:56.495 --> 00:24:00.395
I guess we need to investigate the members of other bands too.

423
00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:02.995
Come to think of it, I'd like to watch the video recording

424
00:24:02.995 --> 00:24:05.195
of your practice session at the studio!

425
00:24:05.195 --> 00:24:06.395
Sure!

426
00:24:06.395 --> 00:24:08.995
We switched the power off when we weren't practicing

427
00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:12.095
so I don't think the perp would be displayed.

428
00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:13.395
See!

429
00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:16.295
I see.

430
00:24:16.295 --> 00:24:18.395
So, that's the story.

431
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:20.495
Next Conan,

432
00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:24.379
"A Girls' Band on Bad Terms (Part 2)"

433
00:24:24.738 --> 00:24:27.038
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:29.238
"Knitted cap"

435
00:24:29.238 --> 00:24:31.038
You're still too young for Scotch.

436
00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:32.038
How about Bourbon then?

437
00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:34.238
-That's fine. -That won't do either, will it?
