00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.360
Thank you for gathering here today, everyone.

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.360
What'd you want to talk about, Mitsuhiko?

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:18.100
I've figured out who stole the pudding
that came with the pasta meal

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.750
that I ordered at Tamaki Book Café.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.370
What? You invited us here
just to tell us that?

6
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.500
What do you mean by that?!

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.050
I was really looking forward to that pudding!

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.630
Mitsuhiko-kun, are you saying
one of us is the culprit?

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.050
Mitsuhiko-kun, are you saying
one of us is the culprit?
Tamaki Yujiro (65)
Tamaki Book Café Owner

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.050
Mitsuhiko-kun, are you saying
one of us is the culprit?

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.010
That's right.

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.050
Who is it?

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.060
Recall the order in which we were
sitting when the crime took place.

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.600
I, the victim, was sitting
at the end of the table.

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.930
I, the victim, was sitting
at the end of the table.
Mitsuhiko

16
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.480
Mitsuhiko
Conan-kun sat next to me, and
Ayumi-chan sat next to him.

17
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.480
Mitsuhiko
Conan-kun sat next to me, and
Ayumi-chan sat next to him.
Conan

18
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.960
Mitsuhiko
Conan-kun sat next to me, and
Ayumi-chan sat next to him.
Conan
Ayumi

19
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.860
Mitsuhiko
Conan
Ayumi
Across from me was Genta-kun, and
sat next to him was Haibara-san.

20
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.610
Mitsuhiko
Conan
Ayumi
Across from me was Genta-kun, and
sat next to him was Haibara-san.
Genta

21
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.030
Mitsuhiko
Conan
Ayumi
Across from me was Genta-kun, and
sat next to him was Haibara-san.
Genta
Haibara

22
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.070
Mitsuhiko
Conan
Ayumi
Genta
Haibara
In other words, only Conan-kun
or Genta-kun could've done it.

23
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.410
Mitsuhiko
Conan
Genta
Haibara
In other words, only Conan-kun
or Genta-kun could've done it.

24
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.290
It wasn't me.

25
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.700
But, Mitsuhiko-kun, didn't you notice
when your pudding was stolen?

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.160
But, Mitsuhiko-kun, didn't you notice
when your pudding was stolen?
Tamaki Ichiro (35)
Yujiro's Son
Yoshikawa Michiko (27)
Ichiro's Fiancée

27
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.420
But, Mitsuhiko-kun, didn't you notice
when your pudding was stolen?

28
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.380
No, because the culprit cleverly
directed my gaze away from my pudding.

29
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.380
How?

30
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630
Well...

31
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.020
Using this!

32
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.390
The thief stole my pudding while I
was distracted by the train whistle.

33
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.270
Isn't that right, pudding
thief Kojima Genta-kun?

34
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.320
It wasn't me!

35
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630
Don't play dumb.

36
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.930
The meat sauce from my pasta
is on your right sleeve.

37
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.960
You probably accidentally got it on
you while reaching for my pudding.

38
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.710
You can't talk your way out
of this one, Genta-kun!

39
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880
I'm sorry, Mitsuhiko.

40
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.890
The eel bowl meal I ordered
didn't come with pudding.

41
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.230
But there was a tasty pudding
right in front of me.

42
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.100
I couldn't help myself.

43
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.390
Hate the sinner, not the sin.

44
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.230
You should reflect on your actions.

45
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.510
M-Mitsuhiko, I'm sorry!

46
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.540
I definitely couldn't have solved this case.

47
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.490
Way to go, Mitsuhiko.

48
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.120
This case was a piece of cake.

49
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.500
After all, I am...

50
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.120
the Great Detective Mitsuhiko!

51
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.350
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

52
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.480
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

53
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.860
A huge collection of books incites a case!

54
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.810
An unreadable trick becomes unraveled!

55
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.530
Always determining the one truth

56
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.310
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

57
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.810
his name is Detective Conan!

58
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.690
The Whistling Bookstore 3

59
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.830
The Whistling Bookstore 3
"The Whistling Bookstore 3!"

60
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.000
The Whistling Bookstore 3

61
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.630
This is pretty well written.

62
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.290
Really?

63
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.880
Yeah.

Omura Kosuke (38)

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.410
Omura Kosuke (38)
Author
The solution is solid.

66
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.510
Omura Kosuke (38)
Author
It's impressive that a first-year
grade schooler came up with this.

67
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.260
It's impressive that a first-year
grade schooler came up with this.

68
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.560
Why'd you have to make me the pudding thief?!

69
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.400
I never did that.

70
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.470
Who cares? It's my novel.

71
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.250
You're right. This isn't a test.

72
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.800
You can write whatever you want.

73
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.950
See?

74
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.420
Read mine next.

75
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.330
I wrote a story about eel
bowls raining from the sky.

76
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.650
Read mine, too.

77
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.720
My story's about shrinking and
making friends with dolls.

78
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.380
Eel bowls from the sky first!

79
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.610
Dolls!

80
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.010
Eel bowls!

81
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.340
Now, now. I'll read them
one at a time. Just relax.

82
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.120
What are you writing?

83
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.590
It's a secret. How about you?

84
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.140
Huh?

85
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.480
I can't come up with anything.

86
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.030
I'm impressed they could.

87
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.380
Sorry for getting in your way, Michiko-san.

88
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.990
What?

89
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.710
Oh, it's not like that. It's no trouble at all.

90
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.650
I'm the one who invited you here.

91
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.900
I'm just a little jealous.

92
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.880
Jealous?

93
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.590
It's been a few weeks since
I started writing novels,

94
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.590
but those kids get far more praise than I do.

95
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.850
Maybe children have an easier time
coming up with original stories

96
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.600
thanks to their flexible imaginations.

97
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.610
Flexible imaginations, huh?

98
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.300
By the way, Michiko-san, why did you decide
to begin attending a writing class?

99
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.580
You're asking me?

100
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.230
Yeah.

101
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.220
I've always liked books,

102
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.560
but I began reading even more after I
started working at Tamaki Book Café.

103
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.620
It made me want to write one of my own.

104
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.870
Huh, really?

105
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.570
My goal is to have my own novel on the shelf.

106
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.960
No, that's not all.

107
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.880
I want to write a best-seller that sells
a million copies and win an award, too.

108
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.010
How's it looking?

109
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.520
Ah, Nojima-san. Everyone's
written solid stories.

110
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.890
I'm glad to hear that.

111
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.580
I'm more interested in having you
write a hit novel, Omura-sensei.

112
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.400
Otherwise you'll never be able to
stop teaching this writing class.

113
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.650
Right...

114
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.600
Omura-sensei is a real author?

115
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.900
He is.

116
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.410
He's already published three books.

117
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.320
I see.

118
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.550
Who's that man?

119
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.920
That's Nojima Ryoji-san.

120
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.300
Nojima Ryoji (65)
Book Collector

121
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.910
Nojima Ryoji (65)
Book Collector
He owns this building.

122
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.550
Nojima Ryoji (65)
Book Collector
I heard he's something
like Omura-san's sponsor.

123
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.630
I heard he's something
like Omura-san's sponsor.

124
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.100
Huh.

125
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.260
Rubbish.

126
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.310
What was that for?! That's my novel!

127
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.800
You haven't got the fundamentals
of storytelling down!

128
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.440
I bet you haven't even read the classics!

129
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.200
Now, now, Nojima-san.

130
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.820
You're speaking to a child.

131
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.550
Once someone has taken up the pen,
it doesn't matter if they're a child.

132
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.360
There will be no half-assed
writing in this classroom!

133
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.410
Looks like you need a little educating.

134
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.250
I'll show you what a real story looks like.

135
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.250
Nagisa-san, we're going
down into the basement.

136
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.080
Nagisa-san, we're going
down into the basement.
Takeuchi Nagisa (45)
Housekeeper

137
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.670
Takeuchi Nagisa (45)
Housekeeper
Yes, sir.

138
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.410
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.890
Wow!

140
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.020
Temperature
Humidity

141
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.130
It's even air-conditioned.

142
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.820
He takes really good care of his books.

143
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.560
Hey, look...

144
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.880
Be careful.

145
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.580
That book is worth six million yen.

146
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.310
You should begin by reading
these for reference.

147
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.290
Are these rare books as well?

148
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.960
The cheapest one is worth
about a million yen.

149
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.060
I'm too scared to read
such an expensive book.

150
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.470
It doesn't matter if they get dirty.

151
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.590
Books have value when they're read.

152
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.010
And only first editions should ever be read.

153
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.720
But...

154
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.810
Quit complaining and read!

155
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.740
I'm not letting you out of this room until
you've read the books I've given you!

156
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.490
Okay!

157
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.750
Put them back on the shelf
when you're done reading.

158
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.740
I'll be upstairs.

159
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.260
Understood.

160
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.240
I finally finished.

161
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.530
Hey, that's not where that
book goes! It goes over here!

162
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.500
And how dare you place it upside down?

163
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.540
Who raised you?

164
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.700
Sorry!

165
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.990
Good.

166
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.880
Yes, sir!

167
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.260
What? Are you hungry?

168
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.460
Yeah.

169
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.090
I suppose that can't be helped.
Nagisa-san, prepare us some lunch.

170
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.470
Yes, sir.

171
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.470
This looks great!

172
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.340
You're right.

173
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.850
Let's dig in.

174
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.820
Thanks for the food!

175
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.380
What's wrong?

176
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.620
It's nothing.

177
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.490
I seem to have cut my finger on a book.

178
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.370
I've got band-aids.

179
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.520
Thank you, Ayumi-chan.

180
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.390
We'll keep reading once
you're finished eating.

181
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.830
Nojima-san, these children
are still in class.

182
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.630
Do you presume to order me around, thief?

183
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.890
H-Hey, don't bring that up here.

184
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.320
Silence! How dare a lowly
author talk back to me?!

185
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.560
Sir, it's not good for your
health to get so excited.

186
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.810
Don't tell me what to do. I'm—

187
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.290
Michiko-san?!

188
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.790
Toto University Hospital

189
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.730
Michiko!

190
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.450
Are you okay, Michiko?

191
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.300
Ichiro-san...

192
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.600
I'm sorry for making you worry.

193
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.570
I'm glad you're all right.

194
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.070
I'm fine now. I just wasn't feeling well.

195
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.480
Is something wrong?

196
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.030
Michiko-san, we just got done
speaking to the police and doctors.

197
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.780
The police?

198
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.290
Michiko-san, apparently it's
possible that you've been poisoned.

199
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.500
What?

200
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.510
Um, Detective Takagi?

201
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.390
Is it true that Michiko-san was poisoned?

202
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.640
Well, actually...

203
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.900
Detective Takagi.

204
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.780
Yes?

205
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.600
We didn't find poison in the food
or beverage the victim consumed.

206
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.940
Really?

207
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.650
Yes.

208
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.830
Then when and how was she poisoned?

209
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.220
Detective Takagi.

210
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.040
Maybe the poison was on a book.

211
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.540
A book?

212
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.420
Michiko-san said she cut her finger
on a book and sucked on the cut.

213
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.920
Maybe that's when it happened.

214
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.210
Well?

215
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.680
We didn't find any poison on these books.

216
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.270
But we did find a highly-concentrated
poison on this one.

217
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.450
Then it must've been because
she touched that book.

218
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.380
Nojima-san, how is this book stored?

219
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:29.280
It was simply left in here,
but the entrance was locked.

220
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.160
Who has access to this library?

221
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.860
Nagisa-san and I had keys.

222
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:42.170
But since we'd unlock it for anyone who
asked, Omura-sensei was often in here as well.

223
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.800
That's right.

224
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.800
Which means all three of you had
the opportunity to poison the book.

225
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.440
Come to think of it, wasn't it Nojima-san
who handed her the book to read?

226
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.060
Yeah.

227
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.710
Really? Is that true?

228
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.310
It's true.

229
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.430
Which means, Nojima-san, it's
likely that you poisoned her.

230
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:10.760
Wait, wait. I handed out
novels as writing references.

231
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.200
But that book is an encyclopedia.

232
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.160
I didn't hand that to anyone.

233
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.660
Omura-san, is that true?

234
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.050
Omura-san, is that true?
I feel like I've seen that book before.

235
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.580
I feel like I've seen that book before.
Yes. It's true that Nojima-san
handed out novels.

236
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.430
Yes. It's true that Nojima-san
handed out novels.

237
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.190
I see.

238
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.600
Paris green...

239
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.210
What?

240
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.490
Isn't the color of that book Paris green?

241
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.400
P-Paris green?

242
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.890
Yeah. We'd know for certain if
we asked an old book expert.

243
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.500
An old book expert?

244
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.900
Well, Tamaki-san?

245
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.930
There's no mistaking it.

246
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.280
Like Conan-kun said, this is Paris green.

247
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.280
I knew it. I felt like I'd seen
it in an online news story before.

248
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.910
So, what is Paris green exactly?

249
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.210
It's the artificial pigment
used in this book's binding.

250
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.030
Until the second half of the 19th Century,

251
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:10.430
a powerful poison was used to
produce this vivid green color.

252
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.730
What? Poison?

253
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.550
Yes.

254
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.220
According to one theory, Napoleon

255
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.690
was killed by a poison exuded
from Paris green wallpaper.

256
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.190
What? Napoleon?

257
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.900
It's just a theory.

258
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.120
In other words, the book
itself was a poisonous book.

259
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.580
Nojima-san, were you aware of this?

260
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.680
No, that's news to me.

261
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.200
I had no idea it was such a dangerous book.

262
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.220
Which means it seems likely that
this was an accident that occurred

263
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.460
when the victim unconsciously
touched this book.

264
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.720
Come to think of it, Michiko-san was
looking at lots of books in here.

265
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.470
Yeah.

266
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.970
The question is why did
Michiko-san touch that book?

267
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.190
What's this scratch?

268
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.600
This is blood.

269
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.440
Then Michiko-san must've cut
her finger on this book.

270
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.850
But what's it doing here?

271
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.910
What's this?

272
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.450
This indentation... Could it be?

273
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.600
I see.

274
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.760
So that's how it is!

275
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.720
Toto University Hospital

276
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.990
Toto University Hospital
Michiko-san, I'm sorry.

277
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.390
Toto University Hospital

278
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.400
I had no idea there was a
poisonous book in that library.

279
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.360
Don't worry about it.

280
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.780
I didn't know it was there either.

281
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.210
I'm really sorry.

282
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.010
I know this can't make up for it,

283
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.060
but I hope they'll at least make your
stay in the hospital less boring.

284
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.040
For you.

285
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.390
Are you sure I can have all of these?

286
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.040
Thank you.

287
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.430
We should get going.

288
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.930
Excuse us.

289
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.060
Michiko-san, let's keep working on
your novel once you're feeling better.

290
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.310
Sure. I'll come up with ideas while I'm here.

291
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.060
Bye.

292
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.440
Conan-kun, what is it?

293
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.450
Michiko-san, did you touch a
German book in that library?

294
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.950
What? Yeah, I did.

295
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.460
Why did you do that?

296
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.920
Something caught my attention.

297
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.210
I cut my finger when I did, though.

298
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.170
Was the thing that caught your attention...?

299
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.270
Ah, this is it.

300
00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.840
I've been looking for this book.

301
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.600
How considerate of you.

302
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.850
Damn it.

303
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.490
I cut myself on the paper.

304
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.950
Don't lick that!

305
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.610
You're the boy from this afternoon.

306
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.650
What do you mean, don't lick that?

307
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.350
Is this book...?

308
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.460
No, that book isn't poisonous or anything.

309
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.250
But if you lick your finger, what happened
to Michiko-san will happen to you.

310
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.890
What?

311
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.000
Right?

312
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.250
You rigged the book and poisoned Michiko-san.

313
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.290
Right, Omura Kosuke-san the author?

314
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.790
What are you talking about?

315
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.470
I simply found the book
Nojima-san was looking for.

316
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.830
Then what's this doing here?

317
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.100
What is that?

318
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.520
A box cutter blade.

319
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.030
Omura-san hid this poisoned
blade inside the book.

320
00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.780
He planned to poison you when you cut your
finger removing the book from the shelf.

321
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.950
Since there are poisonous
books in this library,

322
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.790
he could make it look
like an accidental death.

323
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:14.630
Omura! Michiko-san wasn't enough?
You had to poison me, too?

324
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:15.820
You're wrong.

325
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:16.550
What?

326
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.930
You were Omura-san's only target.

327
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.930
Michiko-san had the bad luck of
falling for Omura-san's trap.

328
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.060
How did he plan to make me
pick up the poisoned book?

329
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.720
Probably by doing this.

330
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.070
Nojima-san, you scolded Genta-kun
this afternoon, remember?

331
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.870
And how dare you place it upside down?

332
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.070
Who raised you?

333
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.580
By placing the poisoned book upside down...

334
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.810
He thought I'd notice and pick it up.

335
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.580
Yeah.

336
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.590
It caught Michiko-san's attention because
she works at the book café, so she picked it up

337
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.590
without realizing the book was poisoned.

338
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.490
The scratch on the shelf
from the blade that was made

339
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.380
when she flipped the book over proves it.

340
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.990
But Nagisa-san could've
fallen for that trap, too.

341
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.740
That's why he used a German book.

342
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.810
Even if Nagisa-san can't read German,

343
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.500
she'd at least notice if
a book were upside down.

344
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.250
There are books from all
over the world here, right?

345
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.710
Y-Yeah...

346
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.510
When placed right side up,

347
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.730
When placed right side up,
American

348
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.520
American
the titles on the spines of American
books are read from top to bottom,

349
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:44.600
American
the titles on the spines of American
books are read from top to bottom,
European

350
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.960
American
European
but European books are
read from the bottom up.

351
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.220
American
European

352
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.770
Because there are Western
books in this library

353
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.080
whose spines are read from the
top down and the bottom up,

354
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.480
at a glance, it's hard to know
which ones are upside down.

355
00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.950
I see.

356
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.030
But, Omura-sensei, why poison me?

357
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.400
I've always supported you.

358
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.280
Supported me?

359
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.000
Don't be absurd!

360
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.200
You've worked me like a dog!

361
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.960
I'm sorry for stealing your books
and selling them when I was broke.

362
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.880
But you worked me like
a slave because of that!

363
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.140
I had reached my limit.

364
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.810
Michiko-san, you're feeling better.

365
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.940
Yes, thankfully.

366
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.860
I'm so glad.

367
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.570
Oh, right. I have a present for all of you.

368
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.510
Is it snacks?

369
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.390
Judging by the shape, it's probably a book.

370
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.240
We've seen this before.

371
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.910
Open them.

372
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.420
Is it another first edition Sherlock Holmes?

373
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:29.930
Falling In Love With Love
Yoshikawa Michiko

374
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:34.470
Falling In Love With Love
Yoshikawa Michiko
I finished my novel since I didn't have
anything else to do at the hospital.

375
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.120
I took the plunge and self-published.

376
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.300
Of course. That would be
too good to be true...
