1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,340
You're lost after all, aren't you?

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,040
I've known that for ages already!

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,140
I told you to make a left back there.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,240
There's a house!

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,940
What? Saved!

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,840
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,240
Tears are start of all dramas.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,840
A gathering of fervent fans.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,240
The locked room mystery of and idol that disappeared.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,440
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:21,503
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (First Locked room)"

14
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:26,303
Excuse me! Is anybody home?

15
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,403
Excuse me!

16
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,203
Oh, sorry to bother you, but we got lost.

17
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,003
Ran...

18
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:51,203
Why it's you, Mr. Mouri?

19
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:54,403
Oh, you're...

20
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:57,303
Mr. Yatsukawa of Nichiuri TV?

21
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:05,003
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the prominent great detective?

22
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:08,603
I'm sorry that we surprised you a while ago.

23
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:12,103
He is comic writer, Mr. Reiki Hirasaka.

24
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:16,503
Oh, are you the one who wrote "The Blackmagic Girl"?

25
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:20,103
Many girls in my class are reading it.

26
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:23,503
That's an honor, my lady.

27
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,803
What's this Blackmagic Girl about?

28
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,203
It's Mr. Hirasaka's representative work

29
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:32,003
and a masterpiece of all occult comics!

30
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,303
It's a story about the main character resurrecting into the world

31
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,403
as a witch to avenge her death.

32
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:42,203
She's Shoko Utakura, a gravure model in the making!

33
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:45,803
I'll be debuting soon, how do you do?

34
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,903
What're you all gathered here for today?

35
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:52,903
Right, I mean you being dressed up like that too, Mr. Yatsukawa.

36
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:54,503
Oh, this is...

37
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:57,903
We're planning to hold a seance tonight.

38
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,803
A seance?

39
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:02,703
You mean the thing you do when you want to summon

40
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:03,703
the spirit of the dead?

41
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:05,703
That's it.

42
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,803
The spirit of who that died?

43
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:11,703
Our idol, Kira Miyahara!

44
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:13,803
Kira Miyahara?

45
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,903
Oh, if I remember correctly.

46
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:17,603
The one who was supposed to be the lead actress

47
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:19,603
in the movie "The Blackmagic Girl".

48
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,003
Supposed to be?

49
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:24,303
She died a year ago of an accident.

50
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:27,403
The production of the movie was eventually cancelled.

51
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:29,203
If only that accident didn't happen,

52
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,203
she would've been a top idol by now!

53
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:35,403
Kira... why'd you die?

54
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,903
What's with him?

55
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,703
He's the chairman of Kira's fan club,

56
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:43,503
and figurine creator, Mr. Yutaka Kani.

57
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:47,003
Are you Kira's fan too, Mr. Yatsukawa?

58
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,403
Of course!

59
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:51,803
My fan club membership number is 11!

60
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:53,903
All the others too?

61
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:57,503
My name is Kazuo Honogi, membership number 8.

62
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,003
While I'm at it, I'm a doctor.

63
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:04,903
I'm Maho Izumi, membership number 120.

64
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:07,203
My number is 53.

65
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:11,403
I'm cameraman Ryuichi Mifune, nice to meet you!

66
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,703
What's your membership number?

67
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:16,203
I'm not a member.

68
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:19,403
He's an exclusive cameraman for a cosplay shop!

69
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,203
Cosplay shop?

70
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:23,903
A store in Akihabara that sells costumes for cosplay,

71
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,903
accessories and such, as well as rent them out.

72
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,603
Inside the shop, there's a corner

73
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,903
where you can take pictures of yourself wearing different costumes,

74
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:33,003
and I'm the one who takes the pictures.

75
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,403
Kira was originally

76
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:37,203
an internet idol who was in charge of the cosplay section.

77
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,503
But, the pictures of her on the website of the shop

78
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:42,103
and cosplay sites became popular

79
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:45,003
so she ended up debuting as a gravure idol.

80
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:48,103
She caught Mr. Hirasaka's eye

81
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:51,603
and was chosen as the leading actress for "The Blackmagic Girl".

82
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,803
The name of the main character in "The Blackmagic Girl"

83
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:55,303
was also Kira.

84
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:58,703
There wasn't anyone more appropriate than her for the part.

85
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,603
I can't help regretting what happened.

86
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:02,203
Kira.

87
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:05,403
Why did you end up scheduling a sence?

88
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:09,503
The fact is, a strange rumor has been going around

89
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,703
among the members of the fan club recently.

90
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:12,803
Rumor?

91
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:16,403
That the fans who have gone from being Kira's fan to somebody else

92
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:19,803
have been getting hurt or falling ill.

93
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:22,003
That's what they get for betraying Kira!

94
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,803
It's legit punishment for what they did!

95
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:24,803
On the internet,

96
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,503
there's a big fuss about it being a curse cast by Kira.

97
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:29,303
A curse?

98
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:34,203
Kira resurrected as a witch!

99
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:35,803
A witch?

100
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:40,603
The Kira in "The Blackmagic Girl" also died of an accident once

101
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,603
and then resurrected, after getting hold of the powers of a witch.

102
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,003
And she takes revenge on those

103
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:47,603
that made her death look to be an accident.

104
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:52,403
Kira also fell into the lake, car and all.

105
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:56,403
But, her body hasn't been found yet.

106
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:59,603
Besides, even a murder was committed.

107
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,203
Murder?

108
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:05,703
The editor in charge of my works was killed

109
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,303
about half a month ago.

110
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:10,703
What did that case have to do with Kira?

111
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,203
Mr. Sawanami who died

112
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:16,603
wrote with his own blood "Kira" and left a dying message.

113
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,003
Really?

114
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:21,903
It's true! I saw it with my own eyes.

115
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:23,403
You saw it?

116
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:26,303
She's the one who first found the body.

117
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:27,903
Don't tell me that

118
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:30,703
Kira, like in the comics resurrected

119
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:32,603
and committed the murder?

120
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,803
We can't be sure about that but...

121
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:37,503
That's why we decided to hold a seance

122
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:41,703
to summon Kira's spirit here and ask her!

123
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:43,603
Ridiculous.

124
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:47,303
Mr. Hirasaka has strong clairvoyant powers

125
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:50,603
and also has vast knowledge about the occult.

126
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:55,403
My, look at the time. Shall we start, then?

127
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:59,403
Let's go over to the meditation room.

128
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:16,003
"Meditation Room"

129
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,403
Why does it turn out this way?

130
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:34,003
Spirit in the dark, please answer me.

131
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:42,003
(Chanting)

132
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:58,403
Please let me hear your voice that is frozen in the dark!

133
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:06,403
(Chanting)

134
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:16,203
Kira Miyahara, answer my call!

135
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:23,003
(Chanting)

136
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,403
What the...

137
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,503
No!

138
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:38,703
Please answer my call!

139
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,003
What on earth is going on?

140
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,103
I'm suffering.

141
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:51,903
How vexing.

142
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:55,703
How vexing. I'm suffering.

143
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:57,203
It's Kira's voice!

144
00:09:57,203 --> 00:10:00,503
I won't forgive...

145
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:02,403
The voice is coming from the panel!

146
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,803
I won't forgive...

147
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:09,703
The one who killed me is among you.

148
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:13,403
I will never ever... never forgive.

149
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:17,103
I shall resurrect tonight.

150
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:20,903
In order to avenge my death with my very hands!

151
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,303
No!

152
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:37,803
It's Kira's spirit! She's answered us!

153
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,803
No joke.

154
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:54,903
Dad, was that really the doings of a spirit just now?

155
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,303
It... it couldn't have been.

156
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:05,103
It smells like gunpowder.

157
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,303
What?

158
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,203
True.

159
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,403
I see, I got it!

160
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:18,903
Gunpowder was put inside the candles!

161
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:23,503
So that when the candles burned and became short, they would burst.

162
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:25,503
Are you serious?

163
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:28,703
There something that looks like a motor attached here.

164
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,203
What?

165
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:35,403
The parts for a radio controller or something have been used.

166
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,003
The stand was shaking from the motor running.

167
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:41,203
Which means that what happened a while ago was a hoax?

168
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,703
I guess so.

169
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,803
But, what about the things falling?

170
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,703
It's this.

171
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,403
Let's see it.

172
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,903
I see.

173
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:58,503
This line was hooked onto the bottom of the cups and plates to begin with.

174
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,203
Then, when the remote controller is operated, the motor rotates,

175
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,403
winding the line making the cups and dishes fall.

176
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:07,903
I'm sure the same kind of things are done here and there in the room!

177
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:10,203
You say operating a remote controller,

178
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:13,503
but we were all holding hands, you know?

179
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:15,303
Just how was it operated?

180
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,103
Pressing the button of the remote controller

181
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,203
can be done with the foot too.

182
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:23,303
Isn't that right, Mr. Hirasaka?

183
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:31,403
Mr. Honogi, he's figured it out.

184
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:34,803
Mr. Honogi is in this too?

185
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:37,903
We were just trying to entertain.

186
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,303
But, it's very much in bad taste.

187
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:42,003
Especially that voice a while ago.

188
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,603
That's...

189
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:46,503
How did you make that voice?

190
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:48,603
You used this, right?

191
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:52,903
If you attach this, everything serves as a speaker and emits sounds.

192
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:57,103
That's why it sounded like Kira on the panel was talking.

193
00:12:57,103 --> 00:13:01,403
But, the contents of the voice were nothing like that.

194
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:05,003
The recorded contents were switched to something else!

195
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:08,203
Switched? By who?

196
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,503
I don't know.

197
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,603
By Kira! Because you're playing around with her spirit.

198
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:17,803
And, because the one who made it look like

199
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,803
she died of an accident is here!

200
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:22,803
Kira will resurrect tonight!

201
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,003
And, she will avenge her death!

202
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,903
Oh, it just makes me shiver!

203
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:32,803
Kira will resurrect.

204
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:38,003
There's something weird about the air in here.

205
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,003
We can use some ventilation.

206
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:59,808
Who on earth could've switched it?

207
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,608
Calm down.

208
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,408
I'm sure it's that chick!

209
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,608
I'll choke her and make her spit it out!

210
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,208
Wait.

211
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,508
Mr. Mouri is here. Not tonight.

212
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:12,508
Kogoro Mouri!

213
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:16,808
If he finds out about that, I'm finished!

214
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:21,008
I should've told the police back then, after all!

215
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,908
But, you...

216
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:25,308
It's amazing how you can say that.

217
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:28,108
Do you understand where you stand?

218
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,608
Well...

219
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:40,308
Gosh!

220
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:43,208
What a bothersome incident!

221
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:49,908
I don't know much about Kira, so will you tell me about her?

222
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:56,008
She used to patronize the cosplay shop that Mr. Mifune worked for.

223
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,808
Huh? Yeah.

224
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:59,708
Girls who come to places like that

225
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:04,008
are good at expressing their cuteness and coquettishness

226
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,808
but Kira was able to express the dark side

227
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:10,508
and fate like things that the character possessed.

228
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:14,208
I especially thought that she was different

229
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,508
from the others girls who like to cosplay

230
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,508
when I saw her cosplay "The Blackmagic Girl".

231
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,608
Kira is a goddess.

232
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:24,108
I thought that she wasn't the type to end up just doing cosplay,

233
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:27,208
so I started selling her to websites here and there.

234
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,008
And, that's when she caught the eye of a show biz production,

235
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,608
which lead to her gravure debut!

236
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,708
What about the accident that led to her death?

237
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,208
Almost a year has gone by already.

238
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,108
There was a small party here

239
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,108
and Kira left before everybody

240
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,108
because she had other things to attend to

241
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:48,108
and along the way, she lost control of her wheels

242
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,408
and fell into the lake.

243
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,808
Who was at the party?

244
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:57,408
If I remember correctly, Mr. Hirasaka, Mr. Honogi

245
00:15:57,408 --> 00:16:01,208
and the editor Mr. Sawanami.

246
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,908
I think it was Mr. Swanami,

247
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,508
you mean the one who was killed a half a month ago?

248
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:06,608
Yes.

249
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:09,108
What kind of a case was it?

250
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:13,308
He was stabbed by someone at his condo.

251
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:17,508
And, Shoko who went to visit him found him dead.

252
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:20,808
Why did she go to the condo of that editor?

253
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:23,908
I told you that she was going to debut as a gravure model, didn't I?

254
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:26,708
She said it was to make arrangements for it.

255
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,208
But, those things are usually

256
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,208
done in the editor's division, don't you think?

257
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,508
In other words, were they going with each other?

258
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,808
Probably.

259
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:39,508
But, why did the victim write "Kira" as a dying message then?

260
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:40,808
I wonder.

261
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:45,608
Would you like me to call Shoko and ask her for the details?

262
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:48,008
Oh no, you don't have to do that.

263
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,108
Oh, Shoko? This is Yatsukawa.

264
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:56,208
Mr. Mouri says that he wants to ask you about Mr. Sawanami.

265
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,008
I've got a headache.

266
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:01,908
Could I talk to him some other time?

267
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:04,408
Yes. See you.

268
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,808
She doesn't seem to be feeling too well.

269
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:15,308
We should leave the case up to the police.

270
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:19,408
Is there no chance that Kira is alive?

271
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:22,508
Her body hasn't been found yet,

272
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,708
but the car that was pulled out of the lake was totally destroyed.

273
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,408
Come to think of it.

274
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:29,608
What is it?

275
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:33,008
I think it's just junk rumor going through the internet,

276
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,608
but the rumor is that Kira didn't die of the car accident,

277
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,608
but, rather, in an accident during the party.

278
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:41,208
It goes that Mr. Hirasaka is hiding the body.

279
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,108
Hiding it, where?

280
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:47,208
Under the floor of the meditation room.

281
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,408
No.

282
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:55,808
Do you know that Kani is the one who passed that rumor around?

283
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,008
What? Really?

284
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:01,608
He used to go around like a paparazzi chasing Kira everywhere,

285
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:05,808
and found that she was always a very careful driver.

286
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:09,608
So that she would never get herself into that kind of an accident.

287
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:15,108
Kira will resurrect soon.

288
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,408
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

289
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,108
Excuse me.

290
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,408
I'm sorry for intruding on you at this hour of the day.

291
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,108
What seems to be the matter?

292
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:44,308
Shoko is not in her room.

293
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:46,108
Shoko's not?

294
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,608
Since she said she wasn't feeling well,

295
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:51,508
I went to her room to check on her after that

296
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:52,908
but, she wasn't there.

297
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:55,508
And she hasn't been back since.

298
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:58,508
Her cell phone is also switched off.

299
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,408
From Shoko?

300
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,808
This is...

301
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,208
"I have returned to life, Kira"

302
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:12,108
I just got a strange mail.

303
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,608
"I have returned to life, Kira"

304
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:16,808
Ran, please wake Pops up!

305
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:18,208
Let's look for Shoko!

306
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,308
Okay!

307
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,008
Who is it?

308
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,908
Mr. Kani. What're you doing?

309
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,308
Kira resurrected!

310
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,908
I'm sure she's in here! It's locked and won't open!

311
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,608
Did you receive mail too, Mr. Kani?

312
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:47,208
Kira, open up!

313
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:53,108
The door is locked.

314
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,608
But that door was locked with a padlock from the outside

315
00:19:57,608 --> 00:20:00,008
by Mr. Hirasaka after the seance, wasn't it?

316
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:03,008
But, it's locked from the inside now!

317
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:06,908
Who's in there? Please answer!

318
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,008
Kira!

319
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,808
What on earth is the matter?

320
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,608
I got a strange mail from Shoko.

321
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,708
You got one too, Mr. Mifune?

322
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,208
Shoko wasn't in her room, so I came here looking for her,

323
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,908
then I found this door locked.

324
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:23,808
What? You mean Shoko is inside, then?

325
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,608
Maho, can you call Shoko on your cell?

326
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,608
Okay.

327
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,708
It's calling.

328
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,408
I don't hear the ringtone, though.

329
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:40,708
Let's crack the glass over there and unlock the door!

330
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,808
No, but...

331
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,208
Maybe she's not feeling well and collapsed!

332
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:53,008
We've got no choice, let's do it!

333
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:59,008
It's locked with a padlock!

334
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,908
What on earth...

335
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,108
Shoko!

336
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,908
No joke!

337
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:39,508
Kira has resurrected?

338
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:47,208
The entrance door was locked from the inside with a padlock.

339
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,108
The only window is over there.

340
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,508
It's possible to go through a window that size

341
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,908
but how would you climb up there?

342
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:57,008
Rather, if I remember correctly, that window...

343
00:21:57,008 --> 00:22:00,108
unless you keep on pushing the switch, it'll stop.

344
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:02,808
It cannot be closed from the outside.

345
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:05,108
A locked room murder.

346
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:10,408
How did the culprit who killed Shoko escape from this room?

347
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:18,908
She's resurrected! Kira's resurrected!

348
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:22,208
It's the birth of the The Blackmagic Girl!

"Next Episode"

350
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,608
Where's the key to this room?

351
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,608
Only Mr. Hirasaka has it.

352
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,608
This is the poster.

353
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:58,108
Probably Kira's poster that was in the meditation room.

354
00:23:58,108 --> 00:24:00,708
Don't tell me that it's Kira's ghost?

355
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:04,708
I guess it means that the blackmailer is among the people here.

356
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,208
The culprit is using Kira who died of an accident

357
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,008
to carry out serial killings.
