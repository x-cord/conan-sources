1
00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:09.524
Here! This is for you, Conan.

2
00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:14.424
Mystery Train pass ring?

3
00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:16.824
You know! The pass that we're going to be using

4
00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:19.224
to ride the Bell Tree Express next week.

5
00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:21.824
It arrived at Doc's place this morning!

6
00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.224
If you show that ring to the conductor,

7
00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:28.624
he'll read it and let us own board.

8
00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.924
Rumor has it that the train is a steam engine

9
00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:35.324
and looks just like the Orient Express.

10
00:00:35.324 --> 00:00:39.224
I hope that there are no murders like in Christie's novels, though.

11
00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:43.724
Of course there aren't going to be any.

12
00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:46.824
You're already wearing that ring, too?

13
00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:47.924
Yes.

14
00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:50.024
We all wore it at Doc's house before you got there

15
00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:52.224
and took pictures with it, you see.

16
00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:53.624
When we get to the campsite,

17
00:00:53.624 --> 00:00:56.324
let's take another picture with Conan inside it, too!

18
00:00:56.324 --> 00:00:59.724
Geez, take it off. What if you loose...

19
00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:03.124
Do you have a cold, Conan?

20
00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:04.524
I may have caught it from Pops

21
00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:06.924
because he was coughing up last night.

22
00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:10.824
Hey. At least wear a mask, won't you?

23
00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:11.924
I don't have one.

24
00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:13.524
Gosh.

25
00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:16.424
I'll give you medicine now, then.

26
00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:19.924
Drink this and keep quiet.

27
00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:23.224
Where's the cold medicine?

28
00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:25.124
Isn't this...

29
00:01:26.824 --> 00:01:29.624
Here, your cold medicine.

30
00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.124
Hey. Don't tell me that the drug that you just...

31
00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:36.324
Yes. It's the antidote for Apotoxin 4869.

32
00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:39.824
I keep in on me just in case.

33
00:01:39.824 --> 00:01:42.924
Okay then, let me have one just in case too, then.

34
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:44.124
No way!

35
00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:46.024
I can't give this to a love comedy detective

36
00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:48.924
who would use it to enlarge himself all over the place.

37
00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:50.324
Never mind, just give it to me!

38
00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:53.424
-Hey, wait! -What's the use of you holding it?

39
00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:55.624
You pervert!

40
00:01:55.624 --> 00:01:57.224
What on earth are you doing?

41
00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:00.424
How dare you pick on girls!

42
00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:03.924
No. I'm the one who's being picked on.

43
00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.624
Why you...

44
00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:10.124
It's about time we get there!

45
00:02:10.124 --> 00:02:11.924
Is everybody ready?

46
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:13.324
-Yes. -Yes.

47
00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.424
Aim for a 100% solution.

48
00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:22.524
Clear all mysteries and codes.

49
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.524
Bourbon finally makes his move?

50
00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:26.924
Three shadows that close in on Ai and me.

51
00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:28.424
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:30.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:32.424
His name is Detective Conan!

54
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.380
"Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 1)"

55
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.780
What? Conan went on camp?

56
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.480
How nice.

57
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.680
They said they were going to a campsite in Gunma today.

58
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.780
I can't see why they don't get bored going every month.

59
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.680
If they went to Gunma, I wonder if they went to Mt. Fuyuna?

60
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.780
I'm sure the hydrangeas are beautiful.

61
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.080
They told me that they'd be sending the pictures that took to my computer,

62
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.180
so I'll show them to you later.

63
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.180
Please do!

64
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.980
It's from Masumi.

65
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.180
Hello, Masumi?

66
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.880
Yep.

67
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.680
Huh? Conan told you yesterday that he was going camping, right?

68
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.180
Yep, that's right.

69
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.180
On Dr. Agasa's Beetle. The color is yellow.

70
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.480
But, why are you asking me this?

71
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.480
Geez, unbelievable!

72
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.480
How can he forget the canteen when coming camping?

73
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.980
Well, Doc and Conan is off

74
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.880
to buy it at a store near the campsite, so...

75
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.580
Come on, hurry help put up the tent.

76
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.080
We're going to gather firewood!

77
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.080
Hey, mister, mister!

78
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.680
From here to here is our territory!

79
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.580
Don't come in here without our permission!

80
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.180
Hey, Genta.

81
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.880
The campsite is for everybody, so let's be friendly.

82
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.780
From here, it's my area.

83
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.980
It's not for you to enter.

84
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.580
What was that?

85
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.480
Did that mean not to do anything and just stay quiet?

86
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.880
Or, to resign to being where I am and not fight it?

87
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.080
Here it it!

88
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.080
Just as would be expected of a shop at a campsite!

89
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.180
They've got all kinds of camping goods!

90
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.480
Maybe I'll get some rice too while we're at it.

91
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.580
Because Genta's always complaining that he's not eating enough.

92
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.780
Right!

93
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.380
Then, maybe I'd better buy some more canteens, too.

94
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.580
I guess so.

95
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.680
Either way, Ai's the one who's going to serve you.

96
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.680
I can hear her ranting over canteen.

97
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.180
Rice...

98
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.280
I prefer bread to rice any day.

99
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.480
Masumi?

100
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.280
It's you.

101
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.780
What bring you here?

102
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.080
Just a coincidence.

103
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.180
A passed by here by motorbike

104
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.980
and though that I'd view some hydrangea of Gunma.

105
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.580
I got hungry and came in here then.

106
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.080
I fateful ran into you!

107
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.780
But you're sure buying up, aren't you?

108
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.680
It's for lunch and dinner today,

109
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.780
and breakfast tomorrow morning.

110
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.880
Because you don't have anything ready for me, do you?

111
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.780
You mean you're coming camping with us, too?

112
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.380
"Danger, Snakes!" -Hey, Genta!

113
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.380
We've gathered enough firewood already,

114
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.380
-so let's go back to the tent, already! -Okay!

115
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.780
There's a sign that says "Danger Snakes" too.

116
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.580
Snakes?

117
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.180
Hey, everybody! Come over here!

118
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.580
It sounds like somebody's digging a hole!

119
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.980
A hole?

120
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.680
Is it buried treasure?

121
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.280
That's something we'll have to look forward, too!

122
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.380
A woman...

123
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.280
Is being buried!

124
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.480
Run!

125
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.380
They saw me...

126
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.980
Hello? Conan?

127
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.680
The cell phone you have called is...

128
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.980
What's this? At a time like this?

129
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.080
No one's here.

130
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.880
Maybe they went to pick firewood or something.

131
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.780
She followed us here, after all.

132
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.880
I guess I've got no choice. I'll try giving Ai a call.

133
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.680
Oh no. Battery's dead.

134
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.780
If your battery's dead, do you want to use my smart phone?

135
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.980
I bought one just like yours, too.

136
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.180
You're going to call the girl called Ai, right?

137
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.180
No, thanks. I can use Doc's cell phone.

138
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.280
Right, Doc?

139
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.080
I'm calling her on the cell phone I had in my knapsack,

140
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.280
but I can't seem to get through at all.

141
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.780
I wonder if the waves don't respond to well in this area?

142
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.580
Why don't we go look for them anyway?

143
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.080
You have an idea of where they may go to pick up firewood, don't you?

144
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.480
Yeah.

145
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.280
Are you all right, Ayumi?

146
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.880
I can't run anymore.

147
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.880
Hang in there, Ayumi.

148
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.980
Ai, there's a mountain hut over there!

149
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.780
Then, let's hide in that mountain hut for now.

150
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.780
-Yes. -Can you get up, Ayumi?

151
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.480
-Yep. -Here, grab me.

152
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.080
Yep.

153
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.180
-Let's go. -Yes!

154
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.180
If we get to that hut, we can rest ourselves.

155
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.780
Yep. Thank you, everybody.

156
00:09:52.713 --> 00:09:55.213
"Danger, Snakes" -Where are you, everybody?

157
00:09:55.213 --> 00:09:58.113
-Hey! -Answer me if you're there!

158
00:09:58.113 --> 00:10:00.413
Ai!

159
00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:03.113
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

160
00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:10.213
This is...

161
00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:12.813
The pass ring for the Mystery Train.

162
00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:15.113
Then, they were here.

163
00:10:15.113 --> 00:10:17.613
Hey. Something's strange.

164
00:10:17.613 --> 00:10:20.513
There are officers in a remote mountain area like this.

165
00:10:20.513 --> 00:10:22.513
Why on earth...

166
00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:25.913
A corpse?

167
00:10:27.513 --> 00:10:29.813
Hey, excuse me. What happened?

168
00:10:29.813 --> 00:10:32.213
We got a call just a while ago.

169
00:10:32.213 --> 00:10:34.613
When we got here, we found the corpse.

170
00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:36.413
What kind of call?

171
00:10:36.413 --> 00:10:38.713
"We're being pursued right now by a man

172
00:10:38.713 --> 00:10:40.913
who was burying a woman near the Danger Snakes sign..."

173
00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:42.313
was the contents.

174
00:10:42.313 --> 00:10:44.413
It was a girl's voice.

175
00:10:50.313 --> 00:10:53.313
We hid in the mountain hut for now,

176
00:10:53.313 --> 00:10:55.613
-but will we be okay? -Yeah!

177
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.813
Because the door and everything is locked tightly.

178
00:10:57.813 --> 00:11:00.813
Even if King Gomera were to come, we'll be fine!

179
00:11:00.813 --> 00:11:03.813
Then, I'll go check if there are any more entrances.

180
00:11:03.813 --> 00:11:08.213
Hey, Ai. Can't you get through to Conan yet?

181
00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:11.413
No. It seems we're completely out of service range, too.

182
00:11:11.413 --> 00:11:14.213
It seems that somebody's been here before us.

183
00:11:14.213 --> 00:11:15.313
Huh?

184
00:11:15.313 --> 00:11:17.713
From the looks of the bag,

185
00:11:17.713 --> 00:11:19.613
I wonder if it's a couple.

186
00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:21.413
How about it, Mitsuhiko?

187
00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:25.213
There seems to be no other entrance. That's the only one.

188
00:11:27.513 --> 00:11:30.113
Hey, what's the matter?

189
00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:31.313
I'm fine.

190
00:11:31.313 --> 00:11:33.013
The floor was just wet.

191
00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:41.613
It can't be...

192
00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:44.813
The woman a while ago was...

193
00:11:44.813 --> 00:11:48.813
If so, 9 out of 10 he'll come back here

194
00:11:48.813 --> 00:11:51.613
to this blood smeared site of the crime.

195
00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:53.913
The culprit...

196
00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.813
Then we'll have to hurry out of here.

197
00:11:56.813 --> 00:11:57.813
True!

198
00:11:57.813 --> 00:12:00.613
Let's go! Ayumi! Ai!

199
00:12:09.013 --> 00:12:12.113
The man came back after all?

200
00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:13.713
What?

201
00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:16.413
Shall we try talking to him?

202
00:12:16.413 --> 00:12:20.013
Maybe he's somebody who just came by to this mountain hut.

203
00:12:24.413 --> 00:12:25.713
No doubt about it.

204
00:12:25.713 --> 00:12:27.613
The person on the other side of the door

205
00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.813
is the murderer who was burying the corpse a while ago!

206
00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:41.813
He's probably the owner of the black bag.

207
00:12:41.813 --> 00:12:44.713
He brought the woman that he was burying a while ago here,

208
00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:46.413
and killed her.

209
00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:48.313
But don't worry!

210
00:12:48.313 --> 00:12:50.613
The only way in is this door.

211
00:12:50.613 --> 00:12:53.913
Let's wait here until help comes.

212
00:12:53.913 --> 00:12:55.313
-Yep. -Yes.

213
00:12:56.513 --> 00:12:59.413
Ai, are you shaking?

214
00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.213
I just have the chills.

215
00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:03.913
Maybe I caught Conan's cold.

216
00:13:04.413 --> 00:13:07.413
"Danger, Snakes" -I see. In other words...

217
00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:09.213
About two hours ago,

218
00:13:09.213 --> 00:13:11.613
there was a call saying that a man who was burying a woman

219
00:13:11.613 --> 00:13:13.113
near the "Danger Snakes" sign,

220
00:13:13.113 --> 00:13:16.013
and the people who witnessed this were being pursued by him.

221
00:13:16.013 --> 00:13:17.613
We got here

222
00:13:17.613 --> 00:13:20.113
and found the corpse of this woman!

223
00:13:20.113 --> 00:13:24.213
And this girl who called in,

224
00:13:24.213 --> 00:13:28.213
I think happens to be a friend of yours, no, Conan?

225
00:13:28.213 --> 00:13:30.613
Yep! I've been trying to cal her all this time,

226
00:13:30.613 --> 00:13:32.113
but can't seem to get through.

227
00:13:32.113 --> 00:13:35.313
So, please hurry and search this area.

228
00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:38.613
Well, the search team is already looking for them.

229
00:13:38.613 --> 00:13:40.813
This area is quite intricate,

230
00:13:40.813 --> 00:13:42.713
so I'm not sure if they'll be able to find them right away.

231
00:13:42.713 --> 00:13:44.113
Oh, no.

232
00:13:44.113 --> 00:13:46.013
But don't you worry.

233
00:13:46.013 --> 00:13:47.613
For we, the Gunma Prefectural Police,

234
00:13:47.613 --> 00:13:50.413
Mt. Fuyuna is like our backyard!

235
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:53.013
I'm sure that we'll be able to find the children

236
00:13:53.013 --> 00:13:55.613
as well as the killer soon!

237
00:13:55.613 --> 00:13:59.313
Are you really okay or not?

238
00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:01.213
That's that.

239
00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:04.613
I think we should check who this corpse is, no?

240
00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:06.813
Huh?

241
00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.613
From the looks of the death spots and rigor mortis,

242
00:14:09.613 --> 00:14:12.413
she was probably killed about 5 to 6 hours ago.

243
00:14:12.413 --> 00:14:14.213
She been slashed in the back

244
00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:16.213
with what looks to be an axe.

245
00:14:17.613 --> 00:14:19.213
But she didn't die on the spot.

246
00:14:19.213 --> 00:14:21.013
She seemed to still be breathing

247
00:14:21.013 --> 00:14:23.213
even after she was put inside the sleeping bag.

248
00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:24.613
There are traces of her

249
00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:27.713
having moved her bloody hands in the sleeping bag, too.

250
00:14:30.213 --> 00:14:33.713
Who are you?

251
00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:36.013
I'm Masumi Sera, a detective!

252
00:14:36.013 --> 00:14:37.813
Conan's friend!

253
00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:40.013
-Right? -Yep.

254
00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:42.013
I don't know if you're a detective or what,

255
00:14:42.013 --> 00:14:43.713
but you shouldn't be doing this.

256
00:14:43.713 --> 00:14:47.213
Like touching the corpse without permission!

257
00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:48.413
Sorry, sorry.

258
00:14:48.413 --> 00:14:49.413
If sorry is going to let you get away with everything,

259
00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:51.713
police aren't needed!

260
00:14:51.713 --> 00:14:53.813
And? What's the identity of the corpse?

261
00:14:53.813 --> 00:14:56.513
The thing is she has nothing on her.

262
00:14:56.513 --> 00:14:59.413
I think she's a nursery school teacher.

263
00:14:59.413 --> 00:15:00.513
Huh?

264
00:15:00.513 --> 00:15:04.913
See, look. She has a bruise on her knees, right?

265
00:15:04.913 --> 00:15:07.913
Nursery school teachers have to stand on their knees a lot

266
00:15:07.913 --> 00:15:09.713
to talk eye to eye with children.

267
00:15:09.713 --> 00:15:11.413
But I wonder if that's enough

268
00:15:11.413 --> 00:15:14.413
to conclude that she's a nursery school teacher.

269
00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:17.213
There are sports that require using the knees a lot, too.

270
00:15:17.213 --> 00:15:18.513
If she was doing sports,

271
00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:19.913
she would have marks on other parts of her body

272
00:15:19.913 --> 00:15:22.313
like her elbows and hands, too!

273
00:15:22.313 --> 00:15:24.013
If she sits Zen style a lot,

274
00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:27.213
she should also have marks on her shins and top side of her feet.

275
00:15:27.213 --> 00:15:29.113
Besides, her hair is straight

276
00:15:29.113 --> 00:15:32.813
and yet the sides are unnaturally fluffy.

277
00:15:34.213 --> 00:15:35.913
Her hair is long,

278
00:15:35.913 --> 00:15:39.213
but she's tanned all the way to the nape of her neck.

279
00:15:39.213 --> 00:15:42.013
This means that she normally has her hair in pigtails.

280
00:15:42.013 --> 00:15:44.313
It's evident that she always out in the sun!

281
00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:48.213
She looks to be around 30.

282
00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:51.713
But why is her hair so childish?

283
00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:52.913
So, I thought she was a nursery school teacher

284
00:15:52.913 --> 00:15:53.913
who plays with children outside,

285
00:15:53.913 --> 00:15:58.413
take them for walks or on excursions.

286
00:15:58.413 --> 00:16:00.013
True.

287
00:16:00.013 --> 00:16:01.213
I'll go back to the station,

288
00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:04.613
and see if there are any reports of missing nursery school teachers.

289
00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:07.913
If she's from another prefecture, it'll take some time.

290
00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:09.713
If you want a clue on the culprit,

291
00:16:09.713 --> 00:16:11.713
the shoeprints of the sneakers that he was wearing

292
00:16:11.713 --> 00:16:13.413
when he was digging the hole should be there!

293
00:16:13.413 --> 00:16:14.513
It's hard to tell

294
00:16:14.513 --> 00:16:16.613
what the prints of the sole of the sneakers looked like,

295
00:16:16.613 --> 00:16:19.013
but I think that the size of the shoes can at least be determined.

296
00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:20.813
Let's see.

297
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.713
It's about 26 centimeters.

298
00:16:23.713 --> 00:16:26.213
There was a shovel on the ground nearby,

299
00:16:26.213 --> 00:16:28.813
but I don't think we can expect detecting fingerprints on it.

300
00:16:28.813 --> 00:16:30.613
Because if he threw it down,

301
00:16:30.613 --> 00:16:33.513
it's highly likely that he was wearing work gloves or something.

302
00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:35.813
In other words, the only clue we have on the culprit

303
00:16:35.813 --> 00:16:39.113
is that his shoe size is 26 cm.

304
00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:41.913
We'll just wait for forensics to give us more information.

305
00:16:41.913 --> 00:16:44.313
What're you talking about? Take a good look!

306
00:16:44.313 --> 00:16:45.313
Huh?

307
00:16:45.313 --> 00:16:48.013
Look, her hands!

308
00:16:48.013 --> 00:16:50.413
It's unnatural, isn't it?

309
00:16:50.413 --> 00:16:53.113
I see. I wonder what it is.

310
00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:54.713
Sign language or something?

311
00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.213
I wonder.

312
00:16:56.213 --> 00:16:59.613
Judging from the blood stains, just before she died,

313
00:16:59.613 --> 00:17:03.913
she must've desperately made this shape with her fingers.

314
00:17:03.913 --> 00:17:06.113
O and K...

315
00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:08.413
No. 2 and 3.

316
00:17:08.413 --> 00:17:11.613
2 and 3... Let me see.

317
00:17:12.513 --> 00:17:16.913
I got it! He might be her brother, you see!

318
00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:18.913
-Wrong! -Wrong!

319
00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.413
Inspector Yamamura.

320
00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:23.213
We were contacted by the search team.

321
00:17:23.213 --> 00:17:27.113
They found 3 men walking around the mountains alone,

322
00:17:27.113 --> 00:17:30.313
and they're headed this way now.

323
00:17:31.813 --> 00:17:34.613
What about the children?

324
00:17:34.613 --> 00:17:39.313
Weren't the children anywhere near the place those men were found?

325
00:17:39.313 --> 00:17:41.713
I wonder. I got no such report.

326
00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:43.713
I see.

327
00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:49.613
It's been about two hours since then.

328
00:17:49.613 --> 00:17:52.513
There's no sound at all.

329
00:17:52.513 --> 00:17:55.413
Maybe he gave up and fled.

330
00:17:55.413 --> 00:17:58.413
Then, I'll go out and check things.

331
00:17:58.413 --> 00:18:01.113
No! He could be ambushing us outside,

332
00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:03.013
making us think that he left.

333
00:18:03.013 --> 00:18:05.813
But just a little won't harm, will it?

334
00:18:05.813 --> 00:18:08.013
Wait, Genta!

335
00:18:09.113 --> 00:18:11.613
Ai, are you all right?

336
00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:13.913
You're perspiring so much.

337
00:18:13.913 --> 00:18:17.713
I'm fine, so please stop Genta right away.

338
00:18:17.713 --> 00:18:19.813
But...

339
00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:22.513
He already opened the door.

340
00:18:22.513 --> 00:18:25.613
How is it, Genta?

341
00:18:25.613 --> 00:18:28.013
Nobody's here.

342
00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:31.513
Okay! It seems to be okay!

343
00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:34.113
Huh? What's this?

344
00:18:35.813 --> 00:18:37.113
Big trouble!

345
00:18:37.113 --> 00:18:41.013
The door's chained and we can't get out!

346
00:18:41.013 --> 00:18:44.513
Ai! We've been locked in!

347
00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:49.713
Ai. Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

348
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.813
Come to think of it, yes.

349
00:18:53.513 --> 00:18:54.913
It can't be...

350
00:18:54.913 --> 00:18:57.413
Isn't this mountain hut burning?

351
00:18:57.413 --> 00:19:00.113
The window! We should be able to escape from the window!

352
00:19:01.813 --> 00:19:03.113
No good.

353
00:19:03.113 --> 00:19:04.913
The window are nailed on.

354
00:19:04.913 --> 00:19:07.213
No! You can't open it?

355
00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:11.613
I see. First, he was going to confine her in here

356
00:19:11.613 --> 00:19:13.813
and set the place on fire to make it look like an accident.

357
00:19:18.613 --> 00:19:20.813
But she found out,

358
00:19:20.813 --> 00:19:23.213
so he killed her using the axe instead.

359
00:19:23.213 --> 00:19:24.813
But if her body is retrieved from the ashes

360
00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:25.813
and the slash wound is found,

361
00:19:25.813 --> 00:19:27.113
everything would go down the drain.

362
00:19:27.113 --> 00:19:29.313
That's why he probably attempted to bury her corpse

363
00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:31.913
where the Danger Snakes sign

364
00:19:31.913 --> 00:19:35.513
was where people stay away from.

365
00:19:35.513 --> 00:19:37.113
We've got to hurry and flee!

366
00:19:37.113 --> 00:19:40.313
Darn it! This door won't budge!

367
00:19:40.313 --> 00:19:44.113
What shall we do? We don't have the strength.

368
00:19:45.313 --> 00:19:47.913
We'll be fine, calm down!

369
00:19:47.913 --> 00:19:50.113
I'm sure someone will notice the smoke

370
00:19:50.113 --> 00:19:52.413
and come to rescue us.

371
00:19:52.413 --> 00:19:54.113
That's right.

372
00:19:54.113 --> 00:19:55.713
Conan.

373
00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:03.613
Smoke?

374
00:20:05.513 --> 00:20:09.313
Hey, it's some distance away but there's smoke rising!

375
00:20:10.913 --> 00:20:14.113
That's probably the smoke from a camp fire.

376
00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:16.213
See, there's another one over there, too.

377
00:20:16.213 --> 00:20:18.913
For some reason recently, a lot of young kids

378
00:20:18.913 --> 00:20:23.113
make large bonfires from noon and really live it up.

379
00:20:23.113 --> 00:20:27.713
They're reprimanded, but they keep on coming.

380
00:20:27.713 --> 00:20:30.313
Inspector Yamamura!

381
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.113
Regarding the report we got earlier,

382
00:20:32.113 --> 00:20:35.113
I brought the three men.

383
00:20:35.113 --> 00:20:37.613
Is that right? Good work!

384
00:20:41.813 --> 00:20:45.113
Then, will you all one by one give me your names, occupation

385
00:20:45.113 --> 00:20:48.713
and the reason you came here.

386
00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:52.413
I'm Hayamichi Yonezumi, a free-lancer.

387
00:20:52.413 --> 00:20:54.913
I don't know what happened,

388
00:20:54.913 --> 00:20:56.913
but I just came to check out the campsite

389
00:20:56.913 --> 00:20:59.313
because I'll be coming here again next week with my friends!

390
00:20:59.313 --> 00:21:02.213
My name is Chozo Usagi.

391
00:21:02.213 --> 00:21:03.913
I'm a photographer.

392
00:21:03.913 --> 00:21:07.913
I take pictures of campsites throughout Japan.

393
00:21:07.913 --> 00:21:10.813
I wanted to take pictures of Japanese azalea

394
00:21:10.813 --> 00:21:14.813
on my cell phone camera to upload on my blog

395
00:21:14.813 --> 00:21:18.213
because they bloom orange flowers during this season.

396
00:21:18.213 --> 00:21:20.613
My name's Takeya Iwakuma.

397
00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.813
I'm a senior at Beika University.

398
00:21:22.813 --> 00:21:26.613
But you're all dressed very lightly.

399
00:21:26.613 --> 00:21:29.013
I just came to check the place out, you know.

400
00:21:29.013 --> 00:21:31.213
Same with me.

401
00:21:31.213 --> 00:21:34.113
My camera and equipment are in my car.

402
00:21:34.113 --> 00:21:37.513
I just dropped by.

403
00:21:38.613 --> 00:21:40.013
How is it?

404
00:21:40.013 --> 00:21:42.213
I can't get though yet.

405
00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:44.413
I'm sure that Ai would move to a place

406
00:21:44.413 --> 00:21:47.213
where the cell phone will work.

407
00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:49.513
If they're still being pursued by the culprit

408
00:21:49.513 --> 00:21:51.513
and she can't make the call because of it,

409
00:21:51.513 --> 00:21:55.013
then maybe the culprit's not among the three?

410
00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:58.213
Or I don't want to think this,

411
00:21:58.213 --> 00:22:01.213
but maybe they've already been killed by someone,

412
00:22:01.213 --> 00:22:03.513
including those three.

413
00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:05.613
Or they may be in a situation

414
00:22:05.613 --> 00:22:08.313
where that can't move for some reason.

415
00:23:52.013 --> 00:23:55.113
"Next Episode"

416
00:23:56.313 --> 00:23:58.913
Don't tell me that the culprit came back.

417
00:24:01.213 --> 00:24:03.213
We've got trouble.

418
00:24:03.213 --> 00:24:07.413
All the detective badges of the children are in the tent.

419
00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:10.213
We've got to find them before it gets dark.

420
00:24:12.813 --> 00:24:14.513
I see.

421
00:24:14.513 --> 00:24:16.713
So, that's the story.

422
00:24:16.713 --> 00:24:22.013
Next Conan, "Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 2)"

423
00:24:37.713 --> 00:24:40.013
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:40.013 --> 00:24:42.113
"Pass Ring"

425
00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:43.713
We're in danger.

426
00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:44.813
Yes, we're in a grave fix.

427
00:24:44.813 --> 00:24:46.913
Don't worry, that person will come to save us.
