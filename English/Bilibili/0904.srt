1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,540
There.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,440
-Hey. -Genta, you're supposed to kick it into the goal.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
Sorry. I'll go get it.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,440
Are you okay?

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,740
I can't keep going...

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,740
Huh? Is no one home?

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,540
Doc, you're a mess.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,240
We're going to resume playing as soon as Genta comes back.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Don't you think he's taking a while to get the ball?

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,840
He's probably having trouble finding it.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,840
That voice...

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,340
Was that Genta?

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,440
Genta, are you okay?

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
What happened?

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
That...

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,240
This is...

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,040
Is he...

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,240
Hey!

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,940
You guys...

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,840
Good. You're all right.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,240
Hold on.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,340
Doc, call an ambulance.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,240
Someone inside has collapsed.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
What?

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
I don't think anyone's there.

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,540
I rang the doorbell earlier.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,840
Then we'll have to break a window.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,640
What's all this noise?

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,740
What?

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,940
Wait, son.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
Son.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,740
What?

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,240
Well?

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,540
Doc, call the police, not an ambulance.

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,240
You mean...

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,540
Yeah. They're both probably dead.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,840
Both?

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
When the countdown reaches zero,

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,340
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
The police are called to a wealthy man's study!

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,540
What happened to the two collapsed figures?

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,240
His name is Detective Conan.

45
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:12,798
"Result of the Draw"

46
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:18,098
There are two victims.

47
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:20,398
The large man

48
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:23,798
"Shinzo Kawai (55)" -is Shinzo Kawai, the resident of this home.

49
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,198
He was stabbed in the stomach,

50
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,898
but the cause of death

51
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:31,498
is blood loss from the ice pick in his chest.

52
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:34,898
The weapon was an object kept in this room.

53
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:39,598
The smaller man on the floor is Kensuke Shibata.

54
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:43,498
"Kensuke Shibata (38)" -His cause of death is a head injury.

55
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,398
There's not much blood,

56
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:51,798
but he most likely struck his head on the armrest of the sofa.

57
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:57,998
Also, the blood on Shibata's sweater matched Kawai's.

58
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,798
The blood must've gotten on him when he stabbed him.

59
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,798
When did they die?

60
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,198
About two hours ago.

61
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:11,198
The bodies were discovered about an hour ago.

62
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:12,598
I see.

63
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:16,298
And they're the ones who found the body.

64
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:17,498
Also,

65
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:22,398
they're the president and former employee of a real estate company.

66
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,598
Several months ago,

67
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:29,198
Shibata was fired for embezzling company funds.

68
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,298
Money troubles, huh?

69
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,098
Who is she?

70
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,598
Kawai's wife, Yuko.

71
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,698
She was sleeping in the second floor bedroom

72
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,698
"Yuko Kawai (48)" -when the incident occurred.

73
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,398
Sleeping?

74
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:45,898
This room shows signs of a struggle.

75
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:48,398
It must've made a lot of noise.

76
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,898
Yes. I asked her about that.

77
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:56,098
She said she'd been looking after her mother all morning,

78
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:58,798
and was too exhausted to notice.

79
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:01,398
The bedroom's far away from this room.

80
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:09,098
Ma'am, I'm sorry to question you when your husband's dead.

81
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:10,298
Yes?

82
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:15,698
Had your husband arranged to meet Shibata here?

83
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:19,198
Yes. Today was his repayment date.

84
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:21,298
Repayment date?

85
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,798
Shibata was using the money he embezzled

86
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:28,298
to pay for his sick family's hospital bills.

87
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:31,398
My husband agreed to rehire him

88
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:35,598
if he returned the money by today.

89
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:36,798
I see.

90
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:40,798
So that's why Shibata came.

91
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:44,598
By the way, do you know how much he owed?

92
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,998
I believe it was about a million yen.

93
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:55,098
Conan, you can't just enter the crime scene.

94
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,898
Sorry.

95
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,798
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,898
Huh? You have a foot injury.

97
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,998
Oh, this?

98
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:07,098
I sprained it the other day.

99
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:10,998
You went to care for your mother with an injury?

100
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,898
That must've been difficult.

101
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:17,798
My mother's in far worse shape than I am.

102
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,098
This is nothing.

103
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,298
She seems tired.

104
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,698
Maybe she's not getting much sleep.

105
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:29,398
Her foot's injured, and her husband's dead.

106
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:30,898
I feel bad for her.

107
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:34,198
Caring for her mother must be hard.

108
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,698
If I'd been awake...

109
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:39,098
If I'd noticed something was wrong,

110
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:41,498
this wouldn't have happened to my husband.

111
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:43,398
It's my fault.

112
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:49,698
By the way, you weren't answering the door even though we kept calling.

113
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,598
Did the sound of the intercom wake you?

114
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,698
No. That large boy's scream woke me.

115
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:01,398
Large boy?

116
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,798
The biggest boy.

117
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,598
Genta.

118
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,698
And the intercom's not working right now.

119
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:10,598
It doesn't always work.

120
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:11,898
Sorry.

121
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:14,898
Hey, Conan.

122
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:18,998
Let's step outside.

123
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,498
Let's go, Conan.

124
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:30,698
Shibata didn't embezzle the money to pay for hospital bills.

125
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:33,298
How do you know that?

126
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:37,298
The sweater he was wearing was from a pretty high-end brand.

127
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:41,698
If he was strapped for cash, he couldn't have bought that.

128
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:45,698
Really? It didn't look expensive to me.

129
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:50,398
You don't know much about fashion, Mr. Detective.

130
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,598
Sorry about that.

131
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,898
This bag was on the sofa.

132
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:56,798
There was money inside.

133
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:59,998
She said Shibata owed a million yen.

134
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,398
That looks like the right amount.

135
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:04,898
So he raised the money.

136
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:08,798
In that case, why did they get into a fight?

137
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,098
Hello?

138
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:13,798
I see.

139
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:16,198
Yeah, got it.

140
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:17,298
What is it?

141
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:20,198
According to the employees of Kawai Real Estate,

142
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:26,098
Kawai said he didn't intend to rehire Shibata.

143
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,098
It was just an excuse to make him return the money.

144
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:35,498
So he failed to fulfill his promise after the money was returned.

145
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:37,698
If that was the reason,

146
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:40,498
then Shibata became hostile,

147
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,898
grabbed a weapon from the desk...

148
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:47,198
And murdered Shinzo.

149
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:55,398
Looks like she wasn't lying about the intercom not working.

150
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:56,398
Yeah.

151
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,698
There you are.

152
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:03,698
Let's go back to the park and keep playing.

153
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:07,398
Genta, make sure you aim for the goal this time.

154
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,198
I know!

155
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:12,398
What do you think?

156
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:13,598
About what?

157
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:14,998
The case.

158
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,598
At first glance,

159
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:22,098
it seems like one man was stabbed and immediately pushed the other.

160
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:24,998
The other suffered fatal injuries...

161
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,898
and died.

162
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:31,498
Doesn't that explain it?

163
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,398
Well, yeah.

164
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,298
You don't sound like you believe it.

165
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,298
What is it then? Did you notice anything strange?

166
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:39,798
No, not really.

167
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:43,998
Like you said, I think that's probably what happened.

168
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:47,398
Then why not let the police handle the rest?

169
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,098
Conan!

170
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,798
Let's go!

171
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:56,498
Genta, do you have a cold?

172
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:00,498
No. I think I hurt my throat when I screamed earlier.

173
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:02,598
I was so surprised.

174
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:05,698
We suddenly heard a weird voice.

175
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,598
Was my scream that weird?

176
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:11,398
Based on the direction it came from,

177
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:15,398
we knew immediately that it was you.

178
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,198
The direction of the scream?

179
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:21,498
Based on the circumstances, it could only have been Genta.

180
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:23,898
Wait a minute.

181
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:27,398
Sorry. You guys go on without me.

182
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,698
What? Why?

183
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:33,998
Doc has something he hasn't told the police.

184
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:35,398
Right, Doc?

185
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:38,898
What? I don't remember saying that.

186
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,998
Well...

187
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:42,998
That's right.

188
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:46,798
I completely forgot to tell them that.

189
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:55,098
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,498
What is it, Shinichi?

191
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:06,098
Is there something bothering you?

192
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:11,098
Yeah. I don't think this case is as simple as we think.

193
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,598
Really?

194
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,198
You saved me though.

195
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,398
Now, I don't have to exercise in the park.

196
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:18,698
Seriously?

197
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:25,598
So we should assume Shibata was pushed forcefully and fell,

198
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:29,798
and not that he slipped and hit his head.

199
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:34,298
The room's windows and the front door were locked.

200
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:37,398
It seems unlikely that they were killed by an outsider.

201
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:41,598
Were you able to confirm what the wife said?

202
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:44,998
Yes. She's telling the truth about her foot injury

203
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,698
and caring for her mother.

204
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:47,898
I see.

205
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:50,098
Even if she was awake,

206
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:55,698
it's hard to imagine an injured woman could have pushed Shibata.

207
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:58,098
He might be right.

208
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,598
But what is it?

209
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,998
Something's bothering me.

210
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:06,698
Shinichi, how'd you hurt your hand?

211
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:07,698
Huh?

212
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:13,098
I probably hit the door too hard when we came here.

213
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:21,998
Inspector, we found this button in a potted plant on the shelf.

214
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:24,798
It's Shibata's.

215
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:25,898
I see.

216
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:30,998
His button must have flown off during their tussle.

217
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:36,398
The sweater he was wearing was from a pretty high-end brand.

218
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,598
The biggest boy.

219
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,798
Hey, Conan!

220
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:57,298
Sorry. I dropped something.

221
00:13:57,298 --> 00:13:59,598
But it's not here.

222
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,198
Come on.

223
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,498
You can't just enter a crime scene.

224
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,998
Do something about him.

225
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:08,798
This isn't a playground.

226
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,498
Sorry.

227
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,298
There you go again.

228
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:17,898
I can't help it.

229
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,298
Anyway, that was a bold move.

230
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:22,498
I nearly missed it.

231
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,198
What do you mean?

232
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,298
I finally figured out the truth

233
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:31,298
about this case that was hidden behind the veil.

234
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,165
They're so late.

235
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,565
Inspector, can we safely assume

236
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:51,865
they killed each other after getting into a fight over money troubles?

237
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:55,865
I think so.

238
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,165
Yuko.

239
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:58,965
We'd like to ask you more questions

240
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,865
about their relationship and the case.

241
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:03,965
Could you come with us to the station?

242
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:04,965
Yes.

243
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,765
Hold on.

244
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:09,265
Agasa, what is it?

245
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:14,565
I thought I'd give you an accurate version of the events.

246
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:20,065
What? But we just investigated the case and concluded that...

247
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:26,165
Don't you realize there's no way Shibata could have killed Kawai?

248
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:28,165
Couldn't have killed him?

249
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,465
What do you mean?

250
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:33,865
It should be obvious when you consider the difference in their height.

251
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,465
Difference in height?

252
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:40,265
Kawai was 185 centimeters.

253
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:42,465
Shibata was 160 centimeters.

254
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:45,365
They do have contrasting builds.

255
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,965
That's it.

256
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,165
If the smaller Shibata

257
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:54,065
tried to stab the much taller Kawai in the chest,

258
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:57,865
he would use a reverse grip.

259
00:15:57,865 --> 00:16:01,965
Wouldn't the blood end up on his pinkie finger?

260
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,765
There are other things that don't make sense.

261
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,165
Like what?

262
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:11,965
Like Shibata's button.

263
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:14,365
Conan told me

264
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:16,965
he saw that Shibata's third button was missing

265
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:21,065
when he looked under his sweater.

266
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:24,365
Even if the button came off in the struggle,

267
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:27,565
it's hard to believe an unexposed button

268
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:31,765
could have ended up inside the pot on the shelf.

269
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,165
You're right.

270
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:37,065
And there's one more thing.

271
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:42,565
Yuko, you were in this room until we arrived, weren't you?

272
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:45,765
No. I was in the second floor bedroom.

273
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:49,565
Then how did you know it was Genta who screamed?

274
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:53,365
The second floor doesn't have windows facing the yard.

275
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:59,565
You couldn't have known which child screamed just from the sound.

276
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,765
But you knew.

277
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:07,765
That's because you were watching Genta from this room when he screamed.

278
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,965
It's the only explanation.

279
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,065
Am I wrong?

280
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,665
I...

281
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,065
The ice pick and the blood on his hand.

282
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:19,165
The button in the potted plant.

283
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:22,865
And at the time, this house was locked.

284
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,265
When you put it all together,

285
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:27,765
the only person who could have killed Shinzo

286
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:31,565
was the person who was inside the house at the time.

287
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:34,165
It's you, Yuko.

288
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,465
What?

289
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:38,165
But how did she stab him?

290
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:43,565
She's not very tall, and her foot's injured.

291
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:47,065
What if Kawai had been stabbed in the stomach by Shibata

292
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,465
and was sitting in a chair?

293
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:55,265
A woman with a foot injury could stab a badly injured victim.

294
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,965
Then it could have been Shibata

295
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:01,865
who stabbed my seated husband, not me.

296
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:06,665
That doesn't explain how Shibata fell and died.

297
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:09,365
It's hard to imagine he pushed him hard enough

298
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:14,265
to kill him from a seated position.

299
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:19,865
Shibata was most likely dead when you looked in the room.

300
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:24,465
I don't know what happened between you two then,

301
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:27,865
but you decided to kill him, grabbed the ice pick,

302
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,965
and finished off your gravely wounded husband.

303
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,465
Am I wrong?

304
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:35,465
You're making it all up!

305
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:38,365
I knew about the scream

306
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:42,365
because I overhead Genta telling the police about it!

307
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:44,465
There's no proof I did it.

308
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:46,465
Stop acting like I did.

309
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,765
It's the button.

310
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:50,965
The button?

311
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,665
What does that prove?

312
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,365
Are you saying I picked it up and put it in the pot?

313
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:02,565
No. The button flew into the pot while they were fighting.

314
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:07,565
But you panicked and didn't notice it had fallen off.

315
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,365
I didn't notice?

316
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:13,565
What are you talking about?

317
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:14,965
Hold on.

318
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,965
If the button came off while they were fighting,

319
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:21,065
how did it get into the pot?

320
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,065
The answer's simple.

321
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:27,365
Shibata wasn't wearing a sweater.

322
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:37,165
Yuko, the sweater he was wearing belongs to you, doesn't it?

323
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,565
What do you mean?

324
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:46,265
Not knowing what to do with your bloody clothes,

325
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:52,065
you realized Shibata was about the same height as you.

326
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,965
To make it look like he'd done it,

327
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,365
you put your clothes on him.

328
00:19:57,365 --> 00:20:02,065
Fortunately, it was a color that a man might wear.

329
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:08,165
It may have been missed if they were assumed to have killed each other,

330
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,965
but a quick investigation

331
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:13,365
should reveal if you were wearing the sweater.

332
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:22,165
Yuko Kawai, can we ask you again what happened?

333
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:23,865
It was what he said.

334
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,765
Darling!

335
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:40,465
Shibata thought he'd be able to return to work

336
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:43,465
if he apologized and returned the money.

337
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:46,765
What? But isn't that what you promised?

338
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:51,565
His family in the hospital died.

339
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:55,165
Shibata and his family got what was coming to them.

340
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:56,565
That's awful!

341
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:57,865
Don't just stand there!

342
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,665
Call an ambulance!

343
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:02,165
You said you'd handle it!

344
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:05,065
You told me not to worry!

345
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,865
Shut up!

346
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:12,065
This happened because you took sympathy on that trash!

347
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:16,865
Both of you are wasting money on helping useless old people!

348
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,065
What?

349
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:25,565
What are you doing?

350
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:36,965
I'd put up with my arrogant husband for so long.

351
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:41,265
But his callous words

352
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,565
brought me to my senses.

353
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:49,765
I even tried to frame Shibata.

354
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,965
Conan, you're late!

355
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,465
Sorry.

356
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,565
We only got to play a little soccer

357
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:23,965
to help Doc lose weight.

358
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:25,465
It's too bad.

359
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:26,565
I know.

360
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:29,965
Next time, let's start in the morning, for the Doc's sake.

361
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:32,465
But I'm fine.

362
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:34,465
I'm so excited.

363
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:35,565
Right, Doc?

364
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,465
But I'm not...

365
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:38,665
That's great.

366
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:41,165
Now, you'll lose weight soon.

00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:46,365
I should help by restricting your portion sizes.

368
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,765
You've got the wrong idea.

369
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:52,965
Good luck, Doc.

370
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:58,065
"Next Episode"

371
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:00,265
What? No way!

372
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:01,665
The Prince of Beer?

373
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:03,865
What's that symbol?

374
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:05,165
Oh, this?

375
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:09,165
"Masked Comet Byun" -It's the symbol of Masked Comet Byun.

376
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:10,465
It was...

377
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:14,065
pretty cool.

378
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,265
No!

379
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:24,265

00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,108
Next Conan's Hint:

"A comedy duo"

382
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:31,308
I wish I could diet by limiting my portions!

383
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:32,708
Okay, now you're fasting.

384
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,208
I guess I am.
