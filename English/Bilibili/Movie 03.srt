1
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Ayumi,

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
it's time for bed. Go take your bath.

3
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,400
Just a little longer? It's the good part!

4
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,200
Aren't you going to go swimming tomorrow?

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,900
Fine.

6
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
Who are you?

7
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,800
Are you Mr. Vampire?

8
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,300
No.

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Flying is exhausting. I just need a rest.

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,900
I'm just a wizard.

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
My little lady.

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,500
He's over there. Don't let him get away.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
Arrest Kaitou Kid!

14
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,500
Farewell,

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,300
my little lady.

16
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,100
What? You saw Kaitou Kid?

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Really, Ayumi?

18
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Yes, he's so handsome.

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,500
He really is Heisei era's Lupin.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
What are you going to do, Heisei era's Holmes?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,100
Don't be stupid,

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
one day I'll definitely catch him.

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,000
(Detective Conan The Last Wizard of the Century)

24
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
I am Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

25
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,000
When I was at an amusement park with Ran,

26
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,600
I witnessed a man in black in the midst of a suspicious transaction.

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,700
While caught up in watching the deal...

28
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,700
I failed to notice his partner sneaking up behind me.

29
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,300
That man forced me to swallow poison...

30
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,000
When I woke up,

31
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,400
my body had shrunk!

32
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,300
If they know that Kudo Shnichi is still alive,

33
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,000
they'd try to kill me

34
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,900
and even my families and friends.

35
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
So I listened to Hiroshi Agasa's advice

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,800
and hid my true identity.

37
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,600
When Ran asked about my name,

38
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,100
the name Conan Edogawa suddenly hit me.

39
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,300
In order to get more information about that Black Organization,

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,600
I went to live with Ran, whose father is a private detective.

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,400
I am Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective.

42
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
People call him 'Sleeping Kogoro'.

43
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,100
Actually, that's because...

44
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,600
With a tranquilizing wristwatch, I put him to sleep,

45
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
and imitate his voice with the voice-changing bow-tie,

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,200
and then solve all the cases.

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,800
The two objects were both invented by Hiroshi Agasa.

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,300
Though it's hard to tell, he is actually a genius.

49
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,300
His other inventions include

50
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,000
criminal tracking glasses,

51
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,200
power assisted kick shoes and other stuffs.

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
He invented lots of special things for me.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
For example, this upgraded skateboard could be used at nighttime

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,900
after it stores enough solar energy during the day.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Apart from Agasa,

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,600
there are two others who know my true identity,

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Heiji Hattori, a high school detective in Kansai

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
and Ai Haibara, a transfer student.

59
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,900
Haibara used to be a member of the Black Organization.

60
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,700
In order to escape the organization...

61
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,200
She took the same drug as I did,

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,700
and her body shrank as well.

63
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,400
While I am investigating the Black Organization,

64
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,500
I keep running into tricky cases.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,800
And now, a new rival appears...

66
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,100
The silver lining in the darkness and chaos.

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Though my body was shrunken, my mind is still clever.

68
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,600
I am the famous detective who can solve all the cases.

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,000
Only one truth will prevail!

70
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,100
The thief with the case number 1412, better known as Kaitou Kid,

71
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,100
has committed 134 heists,

72
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,600
15 of which

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,500
in the USA, France, Germany

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,800
and 12 other overseas countries.

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,900
The jewels he has stolen amount to 152 pieces,

76
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,700
worth a total of 38,725,000,000 yen.

77
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,000
He sent a notice letter yesterday:

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
"From the lion of dusk to the maiden of the dawn...

79
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
when the second hand on the clock indicates the twelfth symbol,

80
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,300
From a multi-storied building with a shining sky,

81
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,500
I shall call upon you and gratefully accept the Memories Egg...

82
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,400
The Last Wizard of the Century.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Kaitou Kid

84
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
Kaitou Kid.

85
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,900
The Memories Egg he mentioned in the letter

86
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,100
refers to a treasure found in storage last month
that's owned by the Suzuki Group.

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Originating during the Romanov Dynasty,

88
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,600
it is one of the Imperial Easter Eggs.

89
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,300
This imperial Easter egg

90
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,200
was a gift from the Russian czar to his wife on Easter Sunday.

91
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,200
It was made by famous jeweler Faberge.

92
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,100
Among all the eggs he made from 1885 to 1916, only 50 eggs were found.

93
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,300
This egg which was just discovered will be the fifty-first piece.

94
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,900
It will be displayed in the Modern Arts museum
which is about to open in Osaka Park

95
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,900
from August 23rd.

96
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
Then, about the code in the letter,

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,400
Officer Nakamori.

98
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,100
Yes.

99
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Firstly, "From the lion of dusk to the maiden of the dawn"

100
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,900
refers to the evening of
the last day of the zodiac Leo, August 22nd, to

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
to the sunrise on the first day of the zodiac Virgo.

102
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,100
So it indicates the day he plans to commit his heist.

103
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,100
"when the second hand on the clock indicates the twelfth symbol",

104
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,900
I think it must be a reference to the time of the crime,

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,600
but I don't have a definitive answer yet.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,600
At last, "From a multi-storied building with a shining sky",

107
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,700
I think it indicates the place where Kaidou Kid will show up,

108
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
which is Tenshukaku, also known as Osaka Castle.

109
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,900
Anyway, the notice implies that,

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,600
between the evening of August 22nd and sunrise on the 23rd...

111
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,600
Kaitou Kid will appear at the main tower of Osaka castle,

112
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
and steal the Imperial Easter egg.

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,500
This time, we'll work with the police in Osaka.

114
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,200
Following Mr. Suzuki's wishes,

115
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,100
we asked Kogoro Mouri to help with the investigation.

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,400
Hello, everyone,

117
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
we have to protect the Easter Egg at all costs,

118
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,100
even if we fail to capture him.

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,800
How could we let go of him so easily?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
The Easter Egg means nothing.

121
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,600
Listen up, you lot!

122
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,100
Our dignity and reputation is on the line now,

123
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
we have to put that asshole behind bars!

124
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,100
We have to do it.

125
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,400
The, the task seems tricky.

126
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,500
Ran, over here.

127
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,200
Sonoko.

128
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,200
What a fancy car.

129
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
As expected of the Suzuki Group!

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Because today is a special day.

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,100
Special?

132
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,500
Because I can meet my dream lover Kaitou Kid-sama.

133
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,900
I have to take it seriously.

134
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Geez, Sonoko...

135
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,500
Your dream lover, Kid-sama?

136
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,200
By the way, our driver is my dad's secretary, Nishino.

137
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,100
Nice to meet you.

138
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,900
He has been traveling all over the world

139
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,600
and speaks English, French and German fluently.

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Awesome.

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Agasa, this is outrageous.

142
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,500
How could you only let Conan go to Osaka?

143
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,700
I really want to meet Kid again.

144
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,600
Conan's always one step ahead of us.

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,500
Don't talk like that.

146
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
How about having some watermelon to cool off your anger?

147
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Great.

148
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm eating now.

149
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,200
Wait,

150
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,200
you can only eat it before you solve my riddle.

151
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,400
Are you for real Agasa?

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,700
You have to.

153
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,200
What would the world come to
if children were raised having everything handed to them!

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,500
Listen closely,

155
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,400
I have many grandchildren, how old are they?

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,100
You have grandchildren?

157
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,900
That's just a riddle.

158
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, we can't think of any answer because Conan's not here.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,600
Then, what about the watermelon?

160
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Zero.

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,100
They're still eggs.

162
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,500
'Washi' is a pun on 'eagle'

163
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,800
'ooku no mago' in other words would be 'tamago'- a pun for eggs.

164
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
An egg is zero years old.

165
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,700
Correct. Ai, you are brilliant.

166
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,900
I knew you would get the answer.

167
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,600
Haibara.

168
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,800
You are so clever.

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,500
Haibara is also one of the Detective Boys,

170
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
so that means,

171
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,900
let's start to eat.

172
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
What will happen to the egg over there?

173
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Show me what you've got,

174
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,200
Kudo.

175
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,100
This place is heavily guarded.

176
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,100
Even an ant couldn't get in.

177
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,900
Of course.

178
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,000
We are dealing with Kaitou Kid this time after all.

179
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,100
He is known as...

180
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,400
the elusive and changeable gentleman thief

181
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,800
who can crack all kinds of defense
and break into any impenetrable treasury

182
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,300
like he has some kind of magic.

183
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Also, he's also a master of disguise
who can even copy others' looks, voices and personalities.

184
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,600
Come on,

185
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
this time our enemy truly is tough.

186
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Kudo.

187
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Hattori.

188
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
It's that guy again.

189
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,900
Hey,

190
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,000
why do you always call Conan by Kudo's name?

191
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,900
Sorry, sorry.

192
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,200
Because his eyes are just like Kudo's.

193
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
So the name just slipped out of my mouth.

194
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,300
You are such an idiot.

195
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,500
You've been saying, 'Kudo's coming' since this morning.

196
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,500
I think you better go see a doctor.

197
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,900
Is he Heiji Hattori, the high school detective in Kansai?

198
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,000
He's a good-looking guy.

199
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,500
Stop.

200
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,900
He and Kazuha are childhood sweethearts.

201
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Though they always bicker with each other like that,

202
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,600
they are actually a sweet couple.

203
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,100
I can tell.

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,500
They are just like you and Shinichi.

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,600
I want a boyfriend who's also my childhood friend.

206
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Hi, Mr. Mouri.

207
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,100
Thanks for traveling all the way here.

208
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,500
Hello.

209
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Ran, Conan, you are here too.

210
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Sonoko, can you introduce them to me?

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,500
They are Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama.

212
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Heiji was called the high school detective in Kansai.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,700
He's pretty famous in Kansai.

214
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,000
That's perfect. I'd really appreciate your help.

215
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,400
I have it covered, old man.

216
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
You little...

217
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
how dare you call the chairman of Suzuki Corporation an old man?

218
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,400
It's fine, Mr. Mouri.

219
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,500
Let me introduce,

220
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,200
this is Sergei Ovchinnikov,

221
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
a high-level representative of the Russian Embassy.

222
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,300
It's nice to meet you.

223
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,500
The one next to him is an art dealer I invited here,

224
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Shoichi Inui.

225
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,700
This is Seiran Hoshi.
She's a historian specializing in the Romanov Dynasty.

226
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Hello.

227
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,300
And this is Ryu Sagawa,

228
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,300
a freelance reporter who applied to report the Easter Egg.

229
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Nice meeting you.

230
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,600
So what's the appraised value of the egg?

231
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
800 million yen.

232
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
What? 800 million?

233
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,200
If you are willing to sell it, I could offer you more.

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,300
Mr. Chairman,

235
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,100
the Imperial Easter Egg belongs to Russia.

236
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,300
You should donate it to the Russian National Museum

237
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,600
instead of selling it to a shady broker.

238
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,100
"Shady," you say!?

239
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,700
Great,

240
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,700
you guys are making a better story than the egg.

241
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
You seem pretty cool about this.

242
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,700
If you really are a historian of Romanov Dynasty,

243
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,300
you should want that egg the most.

244
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,800
That's right. But I don't have 800 million yen...

245
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,500
That's not wrong.

246
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,500
Even I could only scrape together 200 million.

247
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Kaitou Kid is not the only one who's going after that egg.

248
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,400
Anyway, let's talk about the egg at a later date.

249
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,700
I see.

250
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,600
Okay, it's time for me to leave.

251
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,400
Mr. Chairman, I brought the egg here.

252
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,900
Thanks.

253
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,000
Put it on the table.

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,600
Yes, sir.

255
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Everyone, please sit down.

256
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,900
Can we see the egg now?

257
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,700
It doesn't look very impressive.

258
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,500
When I was young, it was one of my toys.

259
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,900
Your toy?

260
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,000
This is the Imperial Easter Egg.

261
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,000
Nishino, please prepare some refreshments for everyone.

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,900
It's not as pretty as I thought.

264
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
It's like an ostrich egg.

265
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
This could be opened, right?

266
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,500
Yes, you are pretty clear about this.

267
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,100
It contains the model of Tsar Nicholas' family,

268
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,900
all made of gold.

269
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,800
Marvelous.

270
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,200
There's an interesting mechanism in this egg.

271
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,400
This is interesting.

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,300
The design drawing of this egg's internal structure

273
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,200
was recorded in Faberge's paper,

274
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,400
which shows that this egg is authentic.

275
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,700
Is its English name 'Memories Egg' translated from Russian?

276
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,100
Yes.

277
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,800
The name is ВОСПОМИНАНИЕ,

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
the meaning of which is memories.

279
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,500
Why does turning the pages of the book represent memories?

280
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
You fool.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,400
The Tsar called his children over and told them stories on the book.

282
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,900
Isn't that a good memory for them?

283
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,200
Are the shining things inside the egg gems?

284
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,200
No, that's just glass.

285
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,100
This is the gift which the Tsar presented to his wife.

286
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
Isn't that odd?

287
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,100
When the 51st egg was made,

288
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Russia was in financial crisis.

289
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,400
What's weirder is Kid's letter.

290
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,300
A multi-storied building with a shining sky...

291
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,600
Why would Osaka Castle be shining?

292
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,700
Dummy.

293
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Mr. Taikou who built Osaka Castle

294
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,100
wanted Osaka Castle to witness the development Osaka

295
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,300
because the castle is like a shining light for the city.

296
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,700
That's right.

297
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,400
Kid will definitely show up

298
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,700
at the Osaka Castle. However,

299
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,900
we still haven't figured out what the words

300
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,400
"when the second hand on the clock
indicates the twelfth symbol" means.

301
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,200
Could it be the 12th letter of Gojuon?

302
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,500
The 12th letter of Gojuon?

303
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,300
That's しシ(shi), so it's four o'clock.

304
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,700
No, the hint Kid gave can't be that simple.

305
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,300
I know it, Officer.

306
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,100
It's not the Gujuon, but the Latin alphabet.

307
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,400
Latin alphabet?

308
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,000
The twelfth letter of the alphabet is L.

309
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,100
Which refers to,

310
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,700
three o'clock?

311
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
As expected of a renowned detective! What a brilliant idea.

312
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,700
That's right. 3 o'clock in the morning is before dawn,

313
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
this fit the note "the dawn of the maiden".

314
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,100
Just you wait, Kaitou Kid.

315
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,400
I'll bring you to justice this time.

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
I got an "Excellent Luck"!

317
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,200
Let me see.

318
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,400
"Awaited person...You'll reunite with your love"!

319
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,100
Then that'd mean Shinichi, right?

320
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,000
That's great. This time I have to meet him.

321
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,400
I am right here.

322
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,800
How do we kill time before 3 o'clock in the morning?

323
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,700
Anyway, let's go eat something delicious.

324
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Kazuha, you should show them around.

325
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
What about you?

326
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,300
I'll take care of this little guy here.

327
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,800
Why? Let's go together.

328
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,600
Boys should hang out with boys.

329
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,400
What do you say, Co... Co... Conan?

330
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah.

331
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,200
You better change that habit quickly.

332
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,500
Come on, what's that attitude?

333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
You want me to expose your identity?

334
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,200
Please... please get used to calling me Conan.

335
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,600
That's good.

336
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,100
Don't forget to smile

337
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,900
when you ask a favor from others.

338
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,600
That's weird. Why are they so close?

339
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,200
Anyway, girls should hang out with girls.

340
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,700
Let's find some hot guys in the city of waves

341
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,500
and let them give us a treat.

342
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,600
Do you want to go to Ebisubashi?

343
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,600
You are thinking about the twelfth letter riddle, aren't you?

344
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,600
Yeah.

345
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,600
It'll be more reasonable if it's in Russian alphabet.

346
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Russian letters?

347
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
The twelfth letter in Russian alphabet is K like the English letter K.

348
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,600
But we can't tell what time is it from letter K.

349
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Also, I feel the words at the end of the letter,

350
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,800
"The Last Wizard of the Century" also very strange.

351
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,900
What an annoying guy.

352
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,200
He never used that name until now.

353
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Plus, Kid only steals gems.

354
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,000
Why is he interested in this egg?

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,600
Checkmate.

356
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
By the way, which lot did you draw?

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,700
I haven't even looked at it yet.

358
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Why?

359
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,600
That's the important lot
which could predict the result of the battle with Kid.

360
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Come on.

361
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,000
It's good fortune. But the words on it are meaningless.

362
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,500
How can we know if we'll win the batter or not?

363
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,500
The one you are waiting for will come.

364
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,400
Travel: Don't go. Your secret will be exposed.

365
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,600
No way.

366
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,500
No freaking way.

367
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,700
The lots from that shrine are always right.

368
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,700
You are lying.

369
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,900
It's true.

370
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Let's go to the restaurant.

371
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,300
We already know that Kid will arrive
at three o'clock tomorrow morning.

372
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,300
We only need to come back before that.

373
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,300
Fine.

374
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,000
Mr. Chairman, we are almost finished.

375
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,800
Okay, thank you.

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Are you going to put it in the exhibition room?

377
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
We'll put a fake one there.

378
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,600
A fake one?

379
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,200
We used to

380
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,400
put the treasure at the place
where Kid announced in the letter like idiots.

381
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,200
That's why he always gets what he wants.

382
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
This time we are planning to put the egg at a place he doesn't know.

383
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
I see.

384
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,500
Where are you going to put it then?

385
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,500
I won't tell you that.

386
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,600
Only my two subordinates and I know it.

387
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,900
Of course, neither of them

388
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,000
is Kid in disguise.

389
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,300
What are you doing?

390
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,700
You might be Kid in disguise too.

391
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,900
So are you.

392
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
What are you doing?

393
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,900
My name is Natsumi Kosaka.

394
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,600
This is my family steward, Mr. Sawabe.

395
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,300
There's something I want to say to your chairman

396
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,600
about the Imperial Easter Egg on this pamphlet.

397
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,300
Unfortunately, our chairman has gone out.

398
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,200
If you don't mind, I can relay a message for you.

399
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
There's something wrong with the picture of the egg.

400
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,200
It looks different from the sketch my great-grandpa made.

401
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,700
That's funny.

402
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,500
If 3 a.m. looks like a "L",

403
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,700
now we almost have a "へ" (he).

404
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,600
へ (he).

405
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,100
It's seven thirteen now.

406
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,100
At seven twenty, it'll be exactly like a へ.

407
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,600
Between the dusk of the Lion and the dawn of the Virgin.

408
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,900
The twelfth letter is へ.

409
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,000
Hattori,

410
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,800
Kid didn't mean 3 a.m. in the letter,

411
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,200
but seven twenty at night.

412
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,200
What did you say?

413
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,800
Where are you going, Kudo?

414
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,000
To Osaka Castle.

415
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,600
Keep a close eye on that egg.

416
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,400
It's raining.

417
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,000
The weather forecast said that it would be sunny.

418
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,100
Wait, Kudo.

419
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,800
The Shining Sky chamber doesn't refer to Osaka Castle

420
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,700
but the Tsuuten Tower.

421
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Tsuuten Tower?

422
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,700
There's a weather station on top of Tsuuten Tower that shines.

423
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,800
What do you mean?

424
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Ladies and Gentlemen,

425
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Now, let's get this show on the road!

426
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,500
What... what is that?

427
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,600
It's fireworks,

428
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
such an enjoyment in summer.

429
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,500
It's so beautiful.

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,700
The fireworks in Osaka are also splendid.

431
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
That's weird.

432
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,500
Today is not the day for fireworks.

433
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Officer, there are fireworks being set off at Osaka Castle.

434
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,400
A lot of fireworks.

435
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,800
Shut up, that's not Kid.

436
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,800
We've still got more than 7 hours till he shows up.

437
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,500
He will never guess that

438
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,700
the egg will be hidden in such an insignificant warehouse.

439
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,300
Hattori, where's Tsuuten Tower?

440
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,200
Over there.

441
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,700
But there's no firework.

442
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
The fireworks at Osaka Castle

443
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
are an attempt to divert attention away from Tsuuten Tower.

444
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,300
But why?

445
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,500
Why did he choose Tsuuten Tower?

446
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,400
Damn it, it's too late to go to Tsuuten Tower.

447
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
Let's stay here and wait for Kid to come.

448
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Mr. Nishino, where is the egg now?

449
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,600
Officer Nakamori took it to somewhere else.

450
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
What?

451
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,700
Next.

452
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Blackout.

453
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
What is it this time? What happened?

454
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,700
That's a bit odd.

455
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Let's have a drink under the moonlight.

456
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,200
This is so refreshing.

457
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,600
Don't panic.

458
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,600
Use the emergency power, now.

459
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,300
Yes, sir.

460
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,200
I know what he's up to.

461
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,100
Hoenzaka Empire Hospital,

462
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,100
Dojima Century Hotel,

463
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,900
Tenma Emergency Center,

464
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Channel 10 Hotel, Naniwa TNS Hospital,

465
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,000
Kansai World Hotel.

466
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,900
Bingo.

467
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,700
Out of the way, you can't turn right.

468
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,300
The cars on the straight lane go first.

469
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,100
He knew that the egg was transferred to somewhere else.

470
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
In order to know where that egg is hidden,

471
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,400
he caused a blackout in the centre of the city

472
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,500
so some places have to use the emergency power.

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,900
Except for the hotels and hospitals,
the place where there's light should be his target.

474
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,200
Kid.

475
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Shoot.

476
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,500
Crap, it's a dead end.

477
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,900
Get on the motorcycle, Kudo.

478
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,200
I get it now.

479
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,200
Tsuuten Tower is the best place

480
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,300
to find lights.

481
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,500
Before he sent out that letter,

482
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,900
he already knew that this would happen.

483
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,900
He also knew that that place wouldn't be heavily guard

484
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,500
in order not to draw too much attention.

485
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,800
If we can't get there quickly,

486
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,400
the egg will be stolen.

487
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,100
Hattori,

488
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,400
wait here.

489
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,400
What? Hey, Kudo.

490
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,900
Kid.

491
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,200
Damn it.

492
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,800
No.

493
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Hurry up, Kudo.

494
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,500
He needs to fly on his hang glider against the mild wind.

495
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,500
You mean he'll fly against the wind?

496
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,800
He's starting to descend!

497
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,300
Up ahead is Osaka Bay.

498
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,900
He's gotta land there.

499
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,500
Hattori, are you all right?

500
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,300
What are you doing here? Go after him.

501
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
I won't let you go if he gets away.

502
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,900
Hattori.

503
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,300
Are you OK, young man?

504
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,700
Please call an ambulance and the police here.

505
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,300
Wait here, Hattori.

506
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,900
That's...

507
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
The injury.

508
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,000
The egg is still here.

509
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,300
This is Kid's monocle.

510
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,600
He was shot and fell into the sea?

511
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,500
Then, who was that guy...

512
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,700
At that night, a wide-range search for Kid's body went underway.

513
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,400
However, the police found nothing
and nobody knew if Kid's still alive.

514
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,700
The next day, the exhibition was cancelled

515
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,400
because they needed to check if the egg was damaged.

516
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,700
The egg was transported to Tokyo on Suzuki's cruise liner.

517
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,800
My great grandpa's name was Kiichi.

518
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,500
He was a craftsman working for Faberge

519
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,100
and married a Russian woman.

520
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,500
After the second year of the revolution,
he and his wife returned to Japan.

521
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,300
My great grandma had a daughter

522
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,800
but died soon after giving birth.

523
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,600
Nine years later, my great grandpa also passed away.

524
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,500
So their daughter,

525
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,300
is my grandma.

526
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,800
My grandfather and my parents

527
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
died in a car accident when I was five.

528
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,900
I was raised by my grandma.

529
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,300
However the elder mistress herself had passed away last month.

530
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,100
I'm a baker in Paris.

531
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,800
This time I came back to Japan to sort through my grandma's stuffs.

532
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,300
As a result, I found an old sketch which belonged to my great grandpa.

533
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,500
A middle part is missing.

534
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
Memories.

535
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
This is the sketch of Memories Egg.

536
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,300
But this one has gems.

537
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Maybe the gems fell off.

538
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,900
Is it possible that there were originally two eggs.

539
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,200
Because if there's only one egg,

540
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,500
the outlines don't align.

541
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,000
Is it possible that he drew two eggs on a large paper,

542
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,600
and the middle part has gone missing?

543
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,100
I see.

544
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,500
But why is it called memories?

545
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,600
There's a mirror here.

546
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,000
Crap, it fell out.

547
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
What are you doing?

548
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,700
There's a small glass piece. I accidentally got it off.

549
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
What?

550
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,100
Conan.

551
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,700
It doesn't matter.

552
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,100
That glass is easy to take down.

553
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,800
It was put there afterwards.

554
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,900
Wait, something has been printed on the glass.

555
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,900
Could it be that?

556
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,000
Mr. Nishino, please turn off the light.

557
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,100
You took command here again. What do you want?

558
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,200
Why... why would there be a picture?

559
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,700
It's a secret mirror.

560
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,700
Secret mirror?

561
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
I've heard of that before.

562
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,900
It's a kind of magical mirror which only exists in Japan and China.

563
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,000
That's right.

564
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,700
The mirror has been through some special manufacturing procedures.

565
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,700
Some secret Catholics in Japan

566
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,400
used these secret mirrors
to project crosses on the wall to worship in secret.

567
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,600
Mr. Sawabe, the castle is...

568
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,100
Yes, it's Yokosuka Castle.

569
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,700
Yokosuka Castle.

570
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,600
The one which we always see on television commercials?

571
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,500
Yes.

572
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,400
It was built by my great grandfather
and inherited by my great grandma.

573
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,900
So, this castle belongs to Kosaka's family.

574
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Natsumi,

575
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,900
your great grandfather made the two eggs, didn't he?

576
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,900
Before the Russian Revolutions,
your great grandpa and his wife made the two eggs.

577
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,600
After that, they took the eggs with them when they came back to Japan.

578
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Maybe they have sold the gems from the second egg

579
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,800
to build Yokusaka Castle.

580
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,400
The second egg must be hidden somewhere in that castle.

581
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,700
Your great grandpa left the message in the other egg

582
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,300
through the secret mirror.

583
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,000
Actually, besides the sketch, I also found this key.

584
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
You found this?

585
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,900
This is key to the place where the second egg was hidden.

586
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,700
The dream egg which has gems inside.

587
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,100
It'll be worth more than 1 billion yen...

588
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,000
No, 1.5 billion yen,at least.

589
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Is that the real reason why Kid wanted to steal it?

590
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,200
No.

591
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,300
Mr. Mouri,

592
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,100
I wonder if you could go to the castle with me
after we go back to Tokyo.

593
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,300
I'd be glad to.

594
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,300
Can I go with you?

595
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,100
Me too.

596
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
Please let me film it.

597
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,700
I want to go too.

598
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Fine, then everyone, let's just go together.

599
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,000
What is happening here?

600
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,500
The looks in these people's eyes all changed.

601
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,500
Do they all want to have the second egg to themselves?

602
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Be good.

603
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
We stopped the bleeding.

604
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,100
As soon as the wound is healed, it could fly again.

605
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,900
Really? That's perfect.

606
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Luckily, Hattori's sprain isn't so bad.

607
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,100
Did Kid die?

608
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,000
That guy wouldn't die so easily.

609
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,400
Maybe he's already on this ship.

610
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm coming.

611
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,400
Nice, what a great look on your face.

612
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,500
I just filmed it.

613
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,100
What is he doing?

614
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,200
Ran,

615
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,800
we are here to visit you.

616
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,000
Miss Kosaka, Mr. Nishino, you are here too.

617
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,300
Please come in.

618
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Thanks.

619
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,100
Thank you.

620
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,100
I should leave now.

621
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,900
That's right. He must be shy
because there are so many beauties in the room.

622
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,900
That's so adorable.

623
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,900
We forgot another beauty. I'll go get her.

624
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,600
It's Seiran, right?

625
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Let's go, little one.

626
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,100
Do I have to go too?

627
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Okay, thank you.

628
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,100
I'll right back. Please wait for a second.

629
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,700
Grigori.

630
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,100
Is that a picture of your boyfriend?

631
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
Well...

632
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,800
That's so sweet. Everyone has a boyfriend.

633
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,400
I have to get Kid.

634
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,700
If it's so easy for you to get him,

635
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
the police wouldn't have worked so hard.

636
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,700
Natsumi, so you have been living in Paris since you were 20?

637
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,700
Yes, so sometimes my Japanese sounds weird.

638
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,600
Speaking of weird Japanese,

639
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,800
I don't know why I just remembered a sentence from my childhood.

640
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,600
What is that?

641
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,600
Posledniyvolshebnikveka.

642
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,900
I think it means, "Posle, did you buy the meat?"

643
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,200
However, that name doesn't ring a bell at all.

644
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Natsumi, the color of your eyes.

645
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,600
That's right. It's gray.

646
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,600
The same color as the eyes of my mother and grandma.

647
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I think I inherited them from my great grandma.

648
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,000
Speaking of which,

649
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,300
Seiran, your eyes are also gray.

650
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,900
That's true. Do all the Chinese have gray eyes?

651
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,500
Seiran means "blue orchid" in Japanese.

652
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,800
My name means "orchid" too.

653
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,900
That's the Japanese transcription.

654
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,100
In Chinese, it should be pronounced as Chinglan.

655
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,900
Chinglan.

656
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,200
That's right, "sei" being "ching" and "ran" being "lan".
My last name is "pusi" in Chinese,

657
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
so my name is Pusi Chinglan.

658
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,900
Ran's Chinese pronunciation is the same as the Japanese's.

659
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,200
Yes, your last name would be Maoli in Chinese.

660
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,700
So my name is Maoli Lan?

661
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,900
What a cute pronunciation.

662
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,500
What about me?

663
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,300
Yours is Lingmu Yuanzi.

664
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,400
Lingmu Yuanzi.

665
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Seiran, I think we are about the same age.

666
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
I'm 27 years old.

667
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,100
We really are the same age. Which month were you born in?

668
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,400
May. May 5th.

669
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,300
My birthday is May 3rd. Our birthday are only two days away.

670
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,500
Your birthday is one day away from mine.

671
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,100
One day away. May 4th.

672
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,300
That's Shinichi's birthday.

673
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,500
Is it a coincidence?

674
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,800
Or...

675
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,600
could Conan be...

676
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,000
That's silly...

677
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
How would that even be possible?

678
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,100
It must be because I miss him so much.

679
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm such a fool.

680
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,000
Natsumi, Seiran,

681
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,400
do you want to have a drink together?

682
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,800
Is it convenient?

683
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,000
Of course, please have a seat.

684
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,500
So sexy.

685
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,900
I can't stand that old man anymore.

686
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,600
Please.

687
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,400
Thanks.

688
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,100
Mr. Sagawa, that pendant you're wearing.

689
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,900
The historian of Romanov Dynasty truly knows something.

690
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,300
So you've noticed that.

691
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,800
Do you want to have a look?

692
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,100
Has he been wearing that the whole time?

693
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,300
Maria.

694
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,900
Is this the ring which belonged to Maria,

695
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,100
the third daughter of Tsar Nicholas II?

696
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,600
Since you already said that, then it must be.

697
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Where did you get that?

698
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,600
Is it real?

699
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,100
I can't jump to conclusions without an appraisal.

700
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,000
Nishino, your ball point pen is about to drop.

701
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,000
Thank you.

702
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,100
Mr. Mouri. Is Mr. Mouri here?

703
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,000
Are we finally going to eat?

704
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Something bad happened. Mr. Sagawa, he...

705
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,100
Mr. Sagawa died in his room.

706
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,200
What?

707
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,000
Mr. Sagawa.

708
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,100
He was shot in the right eye.

709
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
So was Kid.

710
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,900
Boy, move away.

711
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,100
Are you all right?

712
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,400
His face just started to get rigid.

713
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,100
The murder must have been committed 30 minutes ago.

714
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,900
The pendant is missing.

715
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,000
Chairman Suzuki, this is a homicide.

716
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,400
Please contact the police.

717
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,700
Ok.

718
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,100
I see. We'll be right there.

719
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,500
Inspector Megure.

720
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,500
Shiratori, shouldn't you be on vacation in Karuizawa?

721
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,000
It's too boring staying in the villa.

722
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Do we have a case?

723
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,300
You're just in time. Let's go together.

724
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,900
Officer, thanks for coming.

725
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,900
Come on.

726
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,300
Why do you always run into cases?

727
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,100
That's the God's will.

728
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,400
Or say, Mr. Mouri, you are the God.

729
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,800
God of Death.

730
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,800
Officer Shiratori's words are so harsh.

731
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,400
What's with this band-aid?

732
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,500
I'm fine. I got into a fight with a criminal yesterday.

733
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,300
The victim is Ryu Sagawa, 32 years old.

734
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,100
He's a freelance photographer.

735
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,200
Officer, the murder was committed by a robber.

736
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,200
Our suspect stole the ring.

737
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,800
Ring?

738
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,400
Yes.

739
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,200
The ring which belonged to Maria,
the third daughter of Tsar Nicholas II.

740
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,600
Mr. Sagawa wore the ring as a pendant on his neck.

741
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,500
If the target is the ring,
why didn't the suspect just take it from the victim's neck?

742
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,900
The room is in a mess

743
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,100
and even the pillow was ripped. Don't you find it weird?

744
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,600
You little fool, don't walk around.

745
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,400
Inspector Megure, we found this on the floor.

746
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,400
A ball point pen.

747
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,900
M·Nishino.

748
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,000
This ball point pen, Mr. Nishino,

749
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,800
is yours, right?

750
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,500
Yes.

751
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,300
Why did it show up in Mr. Sawaga's room?

752
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,500
You are the one who found the body, aren't you?

753
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,500
I am.

754
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,700
It's time to eat. So I went there to inform him.

755
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,100
Did you enter the room at that time?

756
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,000
No.

757
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,200
If you didn't, why was your ball point pen

758
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,700
found in the room?

759
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,200
I have no idea.

760
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,000
What were you doing at half past seven?

761
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,400
At around 7:10, I had a shower.

762
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,400
Then I took a nap.

763
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,300
Dad, could it be Mr. Nishino?

764
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,000
No, it can't be.

765
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,900
If Mr. Nishino is the murderer,

766
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,800
he might also be the one who shot Kid.

767
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,300
Inspector Megure.

768
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,100
When we searched the victim's room,

769
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
we found that all the tapes have gone missing.

770
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,200
What?

771
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,200
That explains the matter.

772
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,400
No wonder why the whole room was turned upside down.

773
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,400
Conan, don't run around.

774
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,700
It's fine. I'll watch him.

775
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,700
Ran.

776
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,800
The criminal who has a gun might be around.

777
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You should get back.

778
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,000
But, what about Conan?

779
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,300
I'll bring him back.

780
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,200
Just go.

781
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,700
But.

782
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,300
Don't worry. I have it covered.

783
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Agasa, it's me.

784
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
I need you to look into something for me urgently.

785
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,800
What? A sniper who only shoots right eyes?

786
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,500
I see. I'll get into it.

787
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,400
Call me in ten minutes.

788
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,400
Ten minutes.

789
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,000
Am I being paranoid?

790
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,200
I got it, Shinichi.

791
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,600
When I had a look at the ICPO crime database,

792
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,900
I found someone whose age, gender and origins are currently unknown.

793
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,200
The person's called Scorpion.

794
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,000
Scorpion.

795
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,400
Officer, I found it.

796
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,000
It's under Mr. Nishino's bed.

797
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,500
How's that even possible?

798
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,800
This is the conclusive evidence.

799
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,400
Wait, Officer, I didn't do it.

800
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,300
If you are not guilty,

801
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,100
why is the ring at your place?

802
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,100
I don't know.

803
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,700
The criminal should be Scorpion.

804
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,700
If Mr. Nishino is Scorpion...

805
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,900
Padded pillow.

806
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,000
Conan.

807
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,800
Mr. Nishino, you are allergic to feathers, aren't you?

808
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
That's right.

809
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,300
Then the murderer can't be Mr. Nishino.

810
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,400
What?

811
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Keep going.

812
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,500
Because we found feather all over Mr. Sagawa's room.

813
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,300
The murderer even cut through the feather pillow.

814
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,700
That's not something a person who's allergic to feathers will do.

815
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,900
Are you really allergic to the feathers?

816
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,400
Yes, I can testify for him.

817
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
He gets sneezing fits whenever there are feathers.

818
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,100
That's why Mr. Nishino doesn't use a feather pillow.

819
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,600
I see.

820
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,700
Mr. Nishino escaped from Ran's room

821
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
because there was a pigeon.

822
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,600
So who's the murderer?

823
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,700
Officer, have you heard of Scorpion before?

824
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,400
Scorpion?

825
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,500
The bad guy specializes in stealing treasures
belonging to the Romanov dynasty

826
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,700
and shoot his victims through the right eye.

827
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,500
You reminded me.

828
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,800
That's the world's most wanted criminal.

829
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Are you suggesting that the murderer is that person?

830
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
I think Scorpion did this.

831
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,300
He should also be the one who shot Kid.

832
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,900
What did you say?

833
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,200
Kid's monocle was broken.

834
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,400
Scorpion shot Kid.

835
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,900
Because he wanted to take away the egg in Kid's hand.

836
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,300
How did you know about Kid?

837
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,100
Well, because, actually...

838
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,300
Hiroshi Agasa told him.

839
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,200
Isn't that right,

840
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,500
Conan?

841
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,400
Yeah.

842
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,900
Damn it.

843
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,500
I felt someone watching at me when I phoned Agasa.

844
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,400
And that person turned out to be Officer Shiratori.

845
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,500
Your secret will be exposed.

846
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,500
Does it mean Officer Shirator will find out?

847
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,500
But if the murderer is Scorpion,

848
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,000
why did he put the ring he stole from Mr. Sagawa's room

849
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,200
into Mr. Nishino's room?

850
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,400
That I don't know.

851
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,700
This is bad.

852
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,900
I can't use the tranquilizer wrist-watch
in front of Officer Shiratori.

853
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,800
Anyway.

854
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,600
Mr. Nishino, you know Mr. Sagawa, do you?

855
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,900
Yesterday, when we were in the museum,

856
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,700
Mr. Sagawa seemed to be surprised to meet you.

857
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,900
Really?

858
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,000
Mr. Nishino, you have lived abroad for years.

859
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,900
Maybe you two have met in a foreign country.

860
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,900
Have you met Mr. Sagawa before?

861
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,100
Yes, when I traveled in an Asian country three years ago,

862
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,000
I saw him taking photos of the girl
whose house was burnt down because of the war.

863
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,100
I told him to stop, but he didn't listen.

864
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,000
So I beat him up.

865
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,100
So, Mr. Sawaga must have held a grudge against Mr. Nishino.

866
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,300
I know it.

867
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,000
Mr. Nishino, you must be Scorpion.

868
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,800
Mouri, we know he's not Scorpion from the feathers.

869
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,000
That's right.

870
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But Mr. Nishino was saved by that.

871
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,600
If Mr. Sagawa wasn't killed by Scorpion,

872
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,500
Mr. Nishino would be regarded as the thief who stole the ring.

873
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,700
Wait a minute.

874
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
So that's what it is.

875
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,300
This case is just like the two eggs.

876
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,100
We are actually investigating two cases.

877
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,900
Two cases?

878
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
That's right. That's right.

879
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,600
In the first case,

880
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,000
Mr. Sagawa tried to frame Mr. Nishino.

881
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,800
In order to make everyone think that Mr. Nishino stole his ring,

882
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,600
he showed his ring to everyone on purpose.

883
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,400
When Mr. Nishino was in the shower,

884
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,600
Mr. Sagawa snuck into his room and put the ring under his bed.

885
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,700
After that, Mr. Sagawa stole Mr. Nishino's ball point pen

886
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,400
to let everyone believe that Mr. Nishino is the thief.

887
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,800
However, the second case happened next.

888
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,000
Mr. Sagawa was shot

889
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,600
by Scorpion.

890
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm afraid the reason why he was killed is that

891
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,200
the photos he took and his ring
are able to reveal Scorpion's true identity.

892
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,800
However, the ring he wore on his neck went missing.

893
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,200
So Scorpion searched the entire room.

894
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,300
Uncle, you are so brilliant.
You are worthy of the name the famous detective.

895
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,000
That's just a piece of cake.

896
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,100
So, Scorpion might be hiding somewhere on this ship.

897
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,900
About that,

898
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,000
one of the lifeboats went missing.

899
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,100
What?

900
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,500
So, Scorpion escaped using the lifeboat?

901
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,600
We already searched the area,

902
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,900
but it might be difficult to find him.

903
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,700
He got away.

904
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,300
Did Scorpion really get away?

905
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,500
Anyway, since we know that the killer is not on the ship now,

906
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,800
everyone could rest assured.

907
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,600
Yes, we can stop worrying.

908
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,000
But Scorpion is still looking for the other egg.

909
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,700
He might show up in Kosaka's castle.

910
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,200
No, he might have already headed to that place.

911
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,300
Inspector Megure,

912
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,400
when we arrive at Tokyo tomorrow,

913
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,000
I'd like to go to the Castle with everyone.

914
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,900
Okay, I agree.

915
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,100
Hey listen,

916
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,500
we can't take you with us this time.

917
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,000
No, Conan should go with us.

918
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:46,700
What?

919
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,900
His unique way of thinking might be of help.

920
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,200
This boy's way of thinking?

921
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,500
I am so angry at Conan.

922
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,200
That's right. He never contacted us after coming back from Okasa.

923
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,100
He completely forgot that
he's also a member of the Detective Boys.

924
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,400
Agasa, you still haven't found your driver's license?

925
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,000
I remembered putting it here.

926
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,600
If you don't hurry, Conan will be one step ahead of us again.

927
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,100
Ai, you are so good at finding things.

928
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,900
We've got another trouble.

929
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,700
Mr. Mouri,

930
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,900
did Mr. Sawaga's ring really belong to Maria before?

931
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:12,400
It was given to Inspector Megure for appraisal.

932
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Maria was the kindest one among the four sisters,

933
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,500
who had a pair of gray eyes.

934
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,400
Gray eyes?

935
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,900
Like Natsumi and Seiran.

936
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:32,100
After the Russian Revolutions, the Tsar's families were all executed.

937
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,800
But only Maria and her brother's corpses weren't found.

938
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,800
Is that so?

939
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,000
What a beautiful castle.

940
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,700
It's like the Scholoss Neuschwanstein in Germany.

941
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,200
It's said to have been the model for Cinderella's castle.

942
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,800
By the way, why is this a German style building?

943
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,600
Isn't Natsumi's great grandma a Russian?

944
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,900
Conan.

945
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,200
Conan.

946
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,600
How are you doing?

947
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,400
Agasa, why are you here?

948
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,200
I got a phone from Conan

949
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,700
and decided to drop by since I was on the road anyway.

950
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,900
Here, I upgraded it according to your request.

951
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,500
Thanks.

952
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,500
But why did you bring them here?

953
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,800
They slipped into my car when I wasn't looking.

954
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,300
This is like the castle in the fairy tale.

955
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,100
There must be a lot of treasures inside.

956
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,200
How many bowls of grilled eel rice can I have?

957
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,800
Listen to me, you are not allowed to enter.

958
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,600
Fine.

959
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,100
We know.

960
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,700
Why did they agree so easily?

961
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,500
Mr. Inui is so slow.

962
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,100
He said he needed to go somewhere else first.

963
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,800
Sorry, it took me a while to prepare.

964
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,500
Why are you carrying a bag?

965
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Are you planning to go for an adventure?

966
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,600
It never hurts to be more prepared.

967
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,100
Be careful, Scorpion might be around.

968
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
I know.

969
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Please lock the door.

970
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,000
Don't let the kids in.

971
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:31,900
Okay.

972
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,700
Okay, let's get started.

973
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,600
What do you want to do?

974
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,400
Look for the treasures.

975
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,400
There has to be another entrance.

976
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,600
Let's go find it.

977
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,800
This is the Knight's room.

978
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,500
It is decorated with suits of armors and tapestries in Western style.

979
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,900
This is the Lady's lounge.

980
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,700
The late mistress used to spend a whole day here

981
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
because she said this was the most comfortable room.

982
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,600
This is the Tsar's Gallery.

983
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
I'd like to use the restroom.

984
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,300
It's on the right of the hallway.

985
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,900
Just as I thought.

986
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,800
The egg doesn't seem to be here, but it doesn't matter.

987
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,100
What is happening here?

988
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,800
Old Master Kiichi created this trap 80 years ago.

989
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,100
There are other traps like this in the castle
to protect the treasure from thieves.

990
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,500
Please be careful.

991
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,900
It means that you shouldn't act on your own, Mr. Inui.

992
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,400
The only thing you need is a flashlight.

993
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,100
Old Master Kiichi really liked setting traps.

994
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,100
So it means.

995
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,100
Is there a basement in this castle?

996
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,300
No.

997
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,400
What about Natsumi's great grandpa's room on the first floor?

998
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,200
There's an old study.

999
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,200
Please come in.

1000
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,400
There are some old photos of Old Master Kiichi

1001
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,700
and photography works at that time.

1002
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,200
Natsumi, where are your great grandma's photos?

1003
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,600
Well, about that...There aren't any.

1004
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,400
So I don't know what my great grandma looked like.

1005
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,800
That's strange. There are so many photos of Old Master Kiichi.

1006
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,400
Isn't this man Rasputin?

1007
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,900
That's right. His signature is even on the photo.

1008
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,100
G. Rasputin.

1009
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,200
Dad, who's Rasputin?

1010
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,500
I only know that he was called an evil of the century.

1011
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,400
He was also called the Mad Monk

1012
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,300
and is said to be responsible for the ruin of the Romanovs

1013
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,800
because he was good at fawning on the Tsar's family.

1014
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,500
For a time, he had even come into power of the country.

1015
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,500
At last, he as killed by Duke Yusupove, a member of the royal family.

1016
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,300
When his body was found by the river,

1017
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,000
his skull caved in

1018
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,200
and one of his eyes was missing.

1019
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,900
One of his eyes?

1020
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,800
Mr. Inui,

1021
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
finding the egg is more important
than the story of Rasputin, isn't it?

1022
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,000
That's right.

1023
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,400
But how can we find it in such a big house?

1024
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,100
Uncle, give me this.

1025
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,200
What are you doing?

1026
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,500
There's wind coming up.

1027
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,400
There has to be a secret basement.

1028
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,300
What?

1029
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,400
So,

1030
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,900
Old Master Kiichi who liked to create traps

1031
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,500
must have hidden the switch somewhere.

1032
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,800
What are those?

1033
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,600
They are Russian letters.

1034
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,100
Can we open the door of the secret basement with that?

1035
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,200
We have to enter the password.

1036
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,900
Mr. Sergei, can you type Russian letters for us?

1037
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,600
Memories. It has to be the word memories.

1038
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,100
ВОСПОМИНАНИЕ.

1039
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:44,900
Weird.

1040
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,400
Then it should be Kiichi Kosaka.

1041
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,500
КИИУИ КОСАКА

1042
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,300
Nothing happened.

1043
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,700
Natsumi, have you heard anything about the password?

1044
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,300
Not at all.

1045
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,200
Posledniyvolshebnikveka.

1046
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,300
Natsumi has said that before.

1047
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,900
Maybe that's Russian.

1048
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,100
What is he talking about?

1049
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,400
Don't interrupt.

1050
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,400
Natsumi, Posle what?

1051
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,900
volshebnik veka.

1052
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,600
Posledniyvolshebnikveka.

1053
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,000
Maybe it's the pause.

1054
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500
Posledniy volshebnik veka...

1055
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,100
Posledniy...

1056
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:44,200
Could it be ВОЛШЕБНИК КОНЦА ВЕКА?

1057
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,800
That's right. It is ВОЛШЕБНИК КОНЦА ВЕКА.

1058
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,200
What does it mean?

1059
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,800
In English, it should be, "The Last Wizard of the Century."

1060
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,100
In Japanese, it's...

1061
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,900
The Last Wizard of the Century.

1062
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,500
The Last Wizard of the Century. I seem to have heard of that before.

1063
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,400
Kid's letter.

1064
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,700
That's right. What a coincidence.

1065
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,300
Coincidence? Is that really a coincidence?

1066
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,800
I'll type first.

1067
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,400
ВОЛШЕБНИК КОНЦА ВЕКА

1068
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
What's that sound?

1069
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,200
That's...

1070
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,800
What on earth?

1071
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,800
Awesome, kid.

1072
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,600
No, it's also locked here.

1073
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,000
Come on.

1074
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,300
If we don't move faster, the treasure will be taken away by others.

1075
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,400
Ai, where are you going?

1076
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,700
I just want to check that tower.

1077
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,600
Ai, what's in there?

1078
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,900
It has to be the treasure.

1079
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,100
Great.

1080
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,600
It's opened.

1081
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,000
Haibara, there's nothing.

1082
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,200
I didn't say there was.

1083
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,800
Stop looking. Let's go home.

1084
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:49,800
What?

1085
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,400
Oh no.

1086
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,300
It hurts, you guys.

1087
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,000
Your belly is so soft.

1088
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,200
Thanks to you, I didn't get hurt.

1089
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,300
What is that?

1090
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,700
It's a snake.

1091
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,500
It's not a snake.

1092
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,000
It's a rope ladder, but an old one.

1093
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,100
It was hung there before, but broke afterwards.

1094
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,400
It freaked me out.

1095
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,800
What do we do? Should we wait for Agasa to come and save us?

1096
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,300
Or should we keep moving?

1097
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,800
Well.

1098
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,100
Of course we will...

1099
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,200
Let's go.

1100
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,900
By the way, Natsumi,

1101
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,700
why would the password be the last wizard of the century?

1102
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,200
That might be my great grandpa's nickname.

1103
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,600
He attended the World's Fair in 1900 when he was 16.

1104
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,900
and exhibited the marionette at that time.

1105
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,700
After that, he went to Russia and lived there.

1106
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I see.

1107
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,000
The year 1900 truly is the end of a century.

1108
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,900
There's still road ahead. This tunnel is deep.

1109
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,100
What's wrong?

1110
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,600
I think I heard something.

1111
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:36,900
Is it Scorpion?

1112
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:37,900
I'll go have a look.

1113
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,900
Conan.

1114
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,400
I'll go with him.

1115
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,300
Mr. Mouri, please stay here with everyone else.

1116
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,100
Okay.

1117
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,200
It's you.

1118
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,000
You guys.

1119
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,600
Conan.

1120
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,200
Geez...

1121
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,700
In this world,

1122
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,100
I got your love.

1123
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,400
What are these kids doing here?

1124
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,300
It's fine, Mr. Mouri.

1125
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,900
The more the merrier!

1126
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,900
But...

1127
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,700
To solve all the mysteries...

1128
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,500
You still...

1129
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,900
It's a dead end.

1130
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,100
Are we on the wrong path?

1131
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,100
It can't be. There's supposed to be only one path.

1132
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,200
Which means, there are traps too.

1133
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,900
So many birds.

1134
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,000
That's weird. That big bird has two heads.

1135
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,800
Two-headed vulture, the symbol of Tsar.

1136
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,800
Is it the sun which is behind the crown?

1137
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,300
The sun...

1138
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,800
Light...

1139
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,300
Could it be...

1140
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,200
Officer Shiratori,

1141
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,300
please shine your flashlight at the crown on the two headed vulture.

1142
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,900
It flashed.

1143
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,700
What's happening?

1144
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,900
Everyone, back off.

1145
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,300
The entrance.

1146
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,900
I see.

1147
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,200
This crown is formed by photometers.

1148
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,700
This is so cool.

1149
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,300
Such a brilliant mechanism.

1150
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,800
It's like we are in an egg.

1151
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,000
What is this?

1152
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,400
Looks like a coffin.

1153
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,200
It's a Western style coffin made of wood.

1154
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,000
Speaking of which, that's a huge lock.

1155
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,400
Natsumi, the key.

1156
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,500
That's right.

1157
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,300
It does fit into the lock.

1158
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,000
So, what's inside of this coffin...

1159
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,400
Can I open it?

1160
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,700
Yes.

1161
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,100
It's heavy.

1162
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,400
There's a skeleton and an egg.

1163
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,100
The skeleton holds the egg on its chest.

1164
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,700
Natsumi, is this your great grandpa?

1165
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,400
No, I think it should be my great grandmother.

1166
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,300
In Yokosuka, there's only my great grandfather's grave.

1167
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,500
I always found that strange.

1168
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,500
Maybe it's because she was a Russian

1169
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,400
who couldn't get a funeral in an ordinary cemetery.

1170
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,300
Natsumi, this may be a bad time,

1171
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,900
but can I have a look at that egg?

1172
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:49,700
Okay.

1173
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:54,900
Please.

1174
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,400
There's a hole at the bottom.

1175
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,000
It's empty.

1176
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,500
How could it be?

1177
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,000
What happened?

1178
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,500
It's empty.

1179
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,000
Isn't it like a Matryoshka?

1180
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,900
Matryoshka?

1181
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,600
I have that kind of doll at home.

1182
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,700
My father's friend bought it from Russia as a gift.

1183
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,300
What is a Matryoshka Doll?

1184
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,300
It's a set of dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another,

1185
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,100
a Russian toy.

1186
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,800
That might be true. Check this.

1187
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,300
The grooves inside should be used to hold something in place.

1188
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,200
Damn it, if we had the other egg here, we could confirm that.

1189
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,100
We have it.

1190
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,200
I knew you would need this,

1191
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,500
so I borrowed it from Chairman Suzuki.

1192
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,800
You didn't take it out secretly, did you?

1193
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,800
No way, how's that possible?

1194
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,900
Let's try it.

1195
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,300
It fits right in there.

1196
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,300
So, Old Master Kiichi didn't make two eggs

1197
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,400
but split it in two parts.

1198
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,000
You seem to have doubts.

1199
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:19,900
Yeah.

1200
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,000
There should be another mechanism.

1201
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,500
The mechanism which fits the nickname
'the last wizard of the century'.

1202
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
By the way, those gems are pretty.

1203
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,700
No, those are not gems,

1204
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,900
just glass.

1205
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,100
Glass.

1206
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,200
Wait. Come to think of it,

1207
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,300
the glass on the top of the egg,

1208
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,500
Old Master Kiichi's room,

1209
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,500
the light and mechanism...

1210
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,100
And the platform.

1211
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,900
That's right.

1212
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,400
The glass pieces on the inside and outside of the eggs are lenses.

1213
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,800
Mr. Sergei, I need this egg.

1214
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,300
What do you want to do again, boy?

1215
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,400
Wait, Mr. Mouri.

1216
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,500
Do you need my help?

1217
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,100
I need your flashlight.

1218
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,300
Please concentrate the light and put the flashlight on the platform.

1219
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,100
Okay.

1220
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,800
Mr. Serger, Mr. Hoshi,

1221
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,700
please blow out the candles.

1222
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,400
What are you going to do?

1223
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Just wait and see.

1224
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,000
The egg became transparent.

1225
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,400
Even without turning the key,

1226
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,000
the Tsar's family is rising!

1227
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,000
There are photometers inside the egg.

1228
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,400
What!?

1229
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,600
This is...

1230
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,500
The picture of Nicholas II's whole family.

1231
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:25,100
So they are not looking at the book

1232
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,900
but the album.

1233
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,300
That's why it's called the Memories Egg.

1234
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,600
If the Tsar's families weren't killed,

1235
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:41,400
this egg should be a very precious gift.

1236
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:48,700
Your great grandpa really was the last wizard of the century.

1237
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,700
He would be glad to hear that.

1238
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,400
Natsumi,

1239
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,400
that's your great grandpa's photo, isn't it?

1240
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,900
There are two people sitting on the bench.

1241
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,200
It is.

1242
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,700
So the person next to him is your great grandmother?

1243
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,700
She is.

1244
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,700
I finally saw her.

1245
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,800
That's the only photo which was taken in Japan.

1246
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,100
It must've been added to the album by Old Master Kiichi.

1247
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,400
This woman...

1248
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,500
looks just like Natsumi.

1249
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,300
This egg is a great legacy of Old Master Kiichi,

1250
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,300
no, I should say a great legacy of Japan.

1251
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:54,600
Russia will give up the ownership of the two eggs.

1252
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,600
It only has a value if it's in your hand.

1253
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,100
Thank you.

1254
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,200
But the egg inside belongs to Chairman Suzuki.

1255
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,600
I'll try to persuade Chairman Suzuki.

1256
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,500
He'll understand.

1257
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,100
By the way, where did Mr. Inui go?

1258
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,500
I didn't see

1259
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,500
Rasputin's photo there.

1260
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,200
Wasn't he close to the Tsar's family?

1261
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,700
Indeed, we saw it in Old Master Kiichi's study.

1262
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,000
That Г can't be...

1263
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,900
This finally ended in a satisfactory way.

1264
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,100
That's...

1265
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Next...

1266
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,700
Watch out.

1267
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,500
What are you doing, Conan?

1268
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,200
Don't pick it up, Ran.

1269
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,800
Ran.

1270
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Shinichi.

1271
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:55,800
Everybody, get down.

1272
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,500
The egg...

1273
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,900
Damn it, I won't let you get away.

1274
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,000
Don't go.

1275
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,700
Mr. Mouri, please take care of them.

1276
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,600
Shinichi.

1277
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,600
Mr. Inui.

1278
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,300
Damn it.

1279
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,600
Damn it.

1280
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,800
There has to be a switch that can open the door from the inside.

1281
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,800
Only this piece has a different shape.

1282
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,700
Wait.

1283
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,100
Do you want to get out of here alone?

1284
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,800
I won't let you get away.

1285
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,800
I know who you are.

1286
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,200
You pretend to be a Chinese,

1287
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,400
but are actually a Russian.

1288
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,500
Am I right?

1289
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,800
You are the descendant of Rasputin, the Mad Monk.

1290
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,700
Seiran.

1291
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,600
What's going on? The road is blocked.

1292
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,500
We can't get out?

1293
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,200
Everybody, follow me.

1294
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,000
What?

1295
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,300
Cut the nonsense, just follow me.

1296
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,000
I see.

1297
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,200
I didn't even notice that.

1298
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,100
It's Sagawa's voice.

1299
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:53,800
If I rearrange the letters in your name Seiran Hoshi,

1300
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,700
it'll become Rasputin.

1301
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,700
Weren't you... weren't you already killed by me?

1302
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,100
You think that some of the treasures from the Romanov Dynasty

1303
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:16,200
should be left to Rasputin who was close to the Tsar's family.

1304
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:22,600
So you want to get all the treasures on behalf of your ancestor.

1305
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,200
You insist on shooting your opponents' right eyes

1306
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,700
because you want to honor your ancestor who was brutally killed.

1307
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,100
Mr. Inui.

1308
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,800
It's just me.

1309
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,600
What?

1310
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,400
This is a voice-changing bow-tie

1311
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,800
which could change my voice to anybody else.

1312
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,600
Who the hell are you?

1313
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,000
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

1314
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,900
You killed Mr. Sagawa

1315
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,000
because you were afraid that he would expose your true identity.

1316
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,700
Mr. Sagawa liked to film others

1317
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,700
when he went to people's rooms.

1318
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:12,600
It happened so fast, so you forgot to flip the photo over.

1319
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,500
That's not your boyfriend's photo,

1320
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,600
but Grigori Rasputin's.

1321
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,400
The word Grigori starts with the letter G,

1322
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,600
which is Г in Russian.

1323
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,400
That's why I wasn't reminded of your relationship with him

1324
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,500
when I saw Г Rasputin's photos

1325
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,100
in Old Master Kiichi's study.

1326
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,200
You thought that Sagawa took a picture of Rasputin's photo,

1327
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,600
so you murdered him.

1328
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,500
Isn't that right, Seiran?

1329
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,400
No, or I should call you Scorpion.

1330
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,500
You know a lot of things, kid.

1331
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,600
You killed Mr. Inui because

1332
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,900
he saw you attaching the silencer onto your pistol.

1333
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,400
You said as if you were there.

1334
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
As for your reason to kill Uncle Mouri,

1335
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,400
it's because he badmouthed Rasputin.

1336
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,500
Dad, who's Rasputin?

1337
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,900
I only know that he was called an evil of the century.

1338
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,400
You even tried to kill Ran.

1339
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,300
Have you finished?

1340
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,900
I feel sorry for you, but you have to die.

1341
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,600
Is that pistol Walther PPK/S?

1342
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,600
So, the maximum capacity would be 8 bullets.

1343
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,100
One for Mr. Inui, one for Uncle Mouri, one for Ran.

1344
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,100
You just fired 5 times just now.

1345
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,900
So, there are no bullets left in your gun.

1346
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,700
Let me teach you something.

1347
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,100
If you load the magazine with eight bullets

1348
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,400
when there was already a bullet in the chamber,

1349
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,400
you'll have nine bullets in total.

1350
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:58,000
Which means, there's still one bullet in the pistol.

1351
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,600
Then shoot me,

1352
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,600
if there really is one.

1353
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,400
Stupid child.

1354
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,100
Why?

1355
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,300
Too bad for you, Scorpion,

1356
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,700
I asked Agasa to make these glasses

1357
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:49,000
with bullet-proof glass.

1358
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,700
Conan, are you all right?

1359
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:54,900
I'm fine.

1360
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,700
Let's get out of here.

1361
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,100
Conan.

1362
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,100
We're saved...

1363
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,200
No, the castle is on fire.

1364
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,400
Conan.

1365
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,400
Shinichi.

1366
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,200
You fool.

1367
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,600
Conan.

1368
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,900
What? You are so loud.

1369
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,100
Conan.

1370
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
This egg was taken back from Scorpion by Officer Shiratori.

1371
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,400
Officer Shiratori.

1372
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,600
Where is Scorpion?

1373
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,300
She was arrested and sent away in a car.

1374
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,500
Scorpion is Seiran.

1375
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,800
What?

1376
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,800
Seiran is Scorpion?

1377
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,800
Natsumi, please take it.

1378
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,800
Thank you.

1379
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,700
Seiran, the girl with beautiful legs, is Scorpion.

1380
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Natsumi,

1381
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,700
I'm sorry that things became like this.

1382
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,200
It's fine. Even if the castle was burnt down,

1383
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,400
I still have the masterpiece left by my great grandpa.

1384
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,300
Besides, I think the basement should be fine.

1385
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,700
That's right. After this comes to an end,

1386
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:07,900
we can bury Old Madam in Old Master Kiichi's grave.

1387
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,900
At last, Kid still didn't show up.

1388
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,400
Maybe he really is dead.

1389
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,800
No, he's still alive.

1390
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,700
Uncle Mouri already fell asleep.

1391
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,700
Looks like he's really tired.

1392
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,400
We can't blame him. He's too exhausted.

1393
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,400
Sister Ran.

1394
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,500
Thanks for saving me in the castle.

1395
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,200
You were so cool at that time.

1396
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,300
Just like Shinichi.

1397
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,100
You were like Shinichi so much at that time.

1398
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,200
Ran.

1399
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:26,100
But you two are not the same person.

1400
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,100
Right?

1401
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,400
Conan.

1402
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,800
I can't hide it from her anymore.

1403
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,100
Well... Ran.

1404
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,500
Actually, I, I am...

1405
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,500
Shinichi.

1406
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,000
You are Shinichi?

1407
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,400
Why did you ask like that?

1408
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,500
I heard that you were involved in a case,
so I dropped by to check on you.

1409
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,200
How's that possible?

1410
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,700
You fool.

1411
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,200
What is wrong with you? Why didn't you even call me?

1412
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,600
Sorry, I have so many cases to deal with.

1413
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,500
I don't have so much time to stay tonight.

1414
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,200
Wait, let me get you a towel.

1415
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,100
Wait, Kaitou Kid.

1416
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,100
I was totally fooled by you.

1417
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,800
I never thought that you would disguise as Officer Shiratori.

1418
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,000
Shiratori, you made a great contribution this time.

1419
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,100
What did you say?

1420
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:19,300
I just came back from Karuizawa.

1421
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,300
You knew that something would happen on the ship, right?

1422
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,200
I wasn't certain,

1423
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:32,600
but I tapped the wireless phone on the ship.

1424
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:33,800
What's more,

1425
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,000
you stole that egg

1426
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,700
only to return it to Natsume.

1427
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,000
You knew that Old Master Kiichi, the creator of the egg

1428
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:48,200
was called the last wizard of the century.

1429
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,900
That's why you called yourself that in your letter.

1430
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,400
What else did you find?

1431
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,200
Natsumi's great grandmother is

1432
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,300
the third daughter of Nicholas II.

1433
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,800
Maria's body was never found.

1434
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:14,000
Because she was saved by Old Master Kiichi
and escaped to Japan before the execution.

1435
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
They fell in love with each other

1436
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,600
and had a child.

1437
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:22,100
However, she passed away soon after she gave birth.

1438
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:27,000
Old Master Kiichi sold the gems Maria
had brought with her and built a castle

1439
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,500
in order to protect Maria's body
from the Russian Revolutionary troops.

1440
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:35,600
The castle is a German-style architecture
instead of a Russian-style one

1441
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:40,200
because Maria's mother, Queen Alexandra, was German.

1442
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,500
So,

1443
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,200
Maria's body and that egg were buried in the basement.

1444
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:52,100
Then, Old Master Kiichi left a clue in the other egg,

1445
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:57,400
waiting for his descendants to find the castle.

1446
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,000
If you think about it that way, all the mysteries are solved.

1447
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,700
Let me give you some advice,

1448
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:07,300
some things are better left unsolved.

1449
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,500
Indeed.

1450
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,800
Maybe this puzzle should never be solved.

1451
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,400
I have another mystery for you, the famous detective.

1452
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,500
Why would I show up wearing Shinichi Kudo's face

1453
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,400
in order to save a tricky enemy.

1454
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,500
Shinichi.

1455
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,500
Idiot, what kind of question is that?

1456
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,400
You came to my rescue

1457
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,100
because I saved that pigeon.

1458
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:52,400
Am I right?

1459
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,400
Why didn't you stop him, Conan?

1460
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,700
Because Brother Shinichi said he'd be back.

1461
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,000
Fine, next time you meet him,

1462
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,200
you should do this to him.

1463
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:13,400
It's better not to come back for the moment.
