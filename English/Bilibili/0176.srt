1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.940
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.840
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.840
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.540
Today, those guys finally appear.

5
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.640
I'm going to expose their black conspiracy.

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.190
Let's hurry home and play more soccer!

10
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.490
Yeah, let's do that!

11
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.590
I'm the captain!

12
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.490
What? You again?

13
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
Hey, did you see yesterday's game!

14
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.190
It was really something, wasn't it?

15
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.390
Yeah, you mean Hide's over head kick, right?

16
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690
The game's over.

17
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.190
That was indeed a work of art!

18
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.090
Hide is the best!

19
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.190
It's time to wake up from your dream.

20
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.390
Let's celebrate our re-encounter

21
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.790
with a rose, the flower that you like,

22
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.290
with color as red as that of blood.

23
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.890
Okay, Sherry?

24
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.290
What a terrible dream.

25
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.590
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Haibara Part)"

26
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.490
Haibara!

27
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.690
Here's the MO I borrowed!

28
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.290
Please tell Dr. Agasa that

29
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.290
the game was way more than we expected!

30
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.390
Sure. I'll tell him.

31
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.890
I didn't really care for the boss character, though!

32
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.690
But, it was way better than the previous game!

33
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.490
Look!

34
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.190
See! It's snowing!

35
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.390
-What? -No joke?

36
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.690
Snow?

37
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.090
Let's celebrate our re-encounter

38
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.290
with a rose, the flower that you like,

39
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.390
with color as red as that of blood.

40
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.890
Okay, Sherry?

41
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.990
See, why don't you look at the snow from the window too, Haibara!

42
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.690
Don't touch me!

43
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.390
-What? -Haibara?

44
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.190
Is something wrong?

45
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.290
I'm sick and tired of this place.

46
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.390
If I could, I want to disappear from here, right this minute.

47
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.690
It'll turn out that way in time anyway, I guess.

48
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.890
What?

49
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.890
Are you changing schools, Haibara?

50
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.290
What?

51
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.890
Don't tell me that someone is bullying you?

52
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.990
I'll get the guy, so tell me who!

53
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.090
So, don't say that you're going to go away!

54
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.990
I'm only joking.

55
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.190
Don't take me seriously.

56
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.290
What?

57
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.690
I was just kind of annoyed

58
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.390
because I have a cold.

59
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.290
I didn't want to give it to you,

60
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.990
Oh, it's just a cold.

61
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.390
They say people get fussy when they get sick.

62
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.390
Come along...

63
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.090
If you've got a cold, you got to go to the infirmary.

64
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.390
Take that!

65
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.890
What was that?

66
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.090
Here you go!

67
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.690
I did it!

68
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.590
What a face.

69
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.690
You're going to get it, Mitsuhiko!

70
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.590
Wait!

71
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.490
This is not where I belong.

72
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.090
What?

73
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.590
I've got to get out of here fast,

74
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.290
so that I don't get those kids involved.

75
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.990
I bet you're thinking of something stupid like that?

76
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.990
Don't worry.

77
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.890
It is a dream story for a body to shrink with medicine.

78
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.090
Nobody would believe it nor even think of it happening!

79
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.290
We got to keep on acting like children

80
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.690
so that this won't be disclosed.

81
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.690
Until the time is right.

82
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.290
Don't worry!

83
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.890
If things start looking bad, I'll do something about it for you!

84
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.590
Bye!

85
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.690
See you tomorrow!

86
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.890
Bye-bye!

87
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.190
Bye!

88
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.090
Kudo.

89
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.290
You don't know a thing.

90
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.490
They're not people that you can take on alone.

91
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.490
If we ever get off our guard, that's it.

92
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.290
They won't let us be.

93
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.090
Yes. If it is like in my dream,

94
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.090
they are looking for us

95
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.690
somewhere in this town.

96
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.290
What is it?

97
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.490
Is something wrong with that black Porsche?

98
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.290
Porsche 356A.

99
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.990
It's a classic car from 50 years ago.

100
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.590
The owner seems to be away.

101
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.790
I've only seen it on TV and in books,

102
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.790
but I guess there are people

103
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.590
who are really riding these cars around.

104
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.090
Gin.

105
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.190
What?

106
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.390
Gin owns this car too.

107
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.290
Gin too?

108
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.890
Yes. This car came out in my dream.

109
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.290
Hey, just what are you?

110
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.990
Oh, Dr. Agasa?

111
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.490
Will you bring the following things

112
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.590
to the intersection of Yonchome?

113
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.190
I'll explain later! Hurry!

114
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.090
Hey.

115
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.190
Did you bring the stuff?

116
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.790
Yeah.

117
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.090
A wire hanger and a wrench.

118
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.890
What are you going to do with these things?

119
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.090
Hey.

120
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.790
Old cars can be opened like this.

121
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.790
Kudo?

122
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.490
Just what are you going to do?

123
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.890
I'm going to set up a wiretap and transmitter in the car.

124
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.190
But you don't even know if this car is his.

125
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.190
What's the matter?

126
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.090
On the other side of the street.

127
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.090
On the other side of the street?

128
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.890
Gin. Vodka!

129
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.890
You idiot!

130
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.790
The ground around the car sure is messed up.

131
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.390
Maybe the passersby were looking at your car,

132
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.890
because it's rare?

133
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.390
"Germany's Rainfrog"

134
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.290
It sure became famous.

135
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.990
Bull's eye.

136
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.390
What a place to run into them.

137
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.490
I'm delighted. Gin!

138
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.890
I'm not letting them get away this time!

139
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.090
Go straight.

140
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.090
I want you to go after them without getting too close.

141
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.090
No.

142
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.590
You won't be able to do a thing

143
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.590
even if you figure out where he is.

144
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.590
With our bodies like this.

145
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.690
Do you have any idea

146
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.790
what dangerous situation are you in now?

147
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.190
Shut up! Be quiet!

148
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.190
Telephone?

149
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.890
Yeah, it's me.

150
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.890
How's it going?

151
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.890
What? He hasn't come yet?

152
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.790
No big deal.

153
00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.390
The target will come to Haido City Hotel at 18:00 sharp.

154
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.790
Not even aware that it is going to be his farewell party.

155
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.090
Target? Farewell party?

156
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:12.190
Anyway, we've got to shut him up before he is arrested.

157
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.690
We can use that poison if needed.

158
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.090
The poison?

159
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.190
Don't goof, Pisco.

160
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.890
Pisco?

161
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.990
I've heard that code name before though.

162
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.790
I've never seen the person.

163
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.390
Pisco. Haido City Hotel.

164
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.190
A reddish brown hair?

165
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.090
Gin? What's up?

166
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.890
What is that?

167
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.490
It's probably a transmitter and a wiretap.

168
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.790
Oh, no! He's found it!

169
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.690
What?

170
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.690
I didn't think you'd appear from your side.

171
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.590
I'm honored and welcome you, Sherry.

172
00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:24.079
What're you going to do?

173
00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:26.579
Things look really bad.

174
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.579
Your transmitter and wiretap have been crushed,

175
00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:31.279
so we can't pursue them.

176
00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.979
Moreover, the chewing gum that you used to place them

177
00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:38.279
into their car is in their hands...

178
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.779
If they ever check on that...

179
00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.579
Don't worry!

180
00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:43.079
I got rid of my teeth marks too,

181
00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:46.679
and the most they can figure out from my saliva is my blood type.

182
00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:49.179
I wiped off all the fingerprints in the car too.

183
00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:51.979
Then, we should turn a corner

184
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:54.379
and pull away from them right away.

185
00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:55.679
It's dangerous to just vaguely follow

186
00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:58.879
the traces of their car like this.

187
00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.379
Yeah. I'll stop pursuing them.

188
00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:03.279
But that doesn't mean I'm going to run from them.

189
00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:04.679
What?

190
00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:06.579
The Haido City Hotel.

191
00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:08.379
They're planning to make a guy named Pisco

192
00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:10.579
to assassinate somebody there.

193
00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:13.279
We got to go to that hotel

194
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.479
to at least prevent the assassination.

195
00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:17.779
My, how righteous.

196
00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:19.779
Not for me.

197
00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:21.579
Besides, I'm not interested in something abstract

198
00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:23.179
like righteousness.

199
00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.679
I don't think we can do much anyway,

200
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:28.379
going to such a dangerous place.

201
00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:31.679
Yeah. I don't intend to take you along either.

202
00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:34.879
It'll be too dangerous to take you along,

203
00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:37.979
since they know what you looked like as a child.

204
00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:42.079
Well, you just wait in the car with Dr. Agasa!

205
00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:43.579
If worse comes to worse, I'll at least try

206
00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:45.779
and get back the poison!

207
00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:47.279
The poison?

208
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.179
Gin was saying this on the phone,

209
00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:52.279
"We can use the poison if needed."

210
00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:57.279
It's probably the APTX4869.

211
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.579
The one that shrunk our bodies.

212
00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:01.179
The poison in question.

213
00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:06.779
Yeah, right, Sherry.

214
00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.179
The chick who betrayed the organization.

215
00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.779
She should be headed that way soon.

216
00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:12.779
If you don't know what she looks like,

217
00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.579
look her up on the organization's database.

218
00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:17.879
After I check on whether she left

219
00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.179
anything more than the wiretap and transmitter that I found,

220
00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:22.979
I'll join you.

221
00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:24.879
Yeah. I'm sure.

222
00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:26.779
She'll come

223
00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:30.079
because I mentioned about the poison.

224
00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.579
Whether you want to take advantage

225
00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:33.979
of the dopey detective or not,

226
00:14:33.979 --> 00:14:36.479
it's up to you

227
00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:38.679
Anyway, as soon as you find the chick,

228
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:41.779
show me what she looks like.

229
00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:44.779
Yeah. No problem.

230
00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:48.179
If she's gone from neck down.

231
00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:08.379
Gosh.

232
00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:11.079
I thought you weren't interested?

233
00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:12.379
I had no choice

234
00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.879
because I'm the one who made the poison.

235
00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:18.479
I don't want you calling me a killer anymore.

236
00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:19.879
Be careful.

237
00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.779
It's easy for them to tell

238
00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:24.579
the one who set the transmitter will show up here too.

239
00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:26.879
If they find out that you're involved...

240
00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:28.279
I'll be fine.

241
00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:30.079
You got rid of the evidence, didn't you?

242
00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.379
They'll take it as being a simple prank

243
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:32.879
or something done by someone

244
00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:35.579
who has a grudge against the organization.

245
00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:38.779
Are you sure it's this hall?

246
00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:39.779
Yeah.

247
00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:42.679
"Farewell Party" -Gin said that it's a farewell party.

248
00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:45.579
The guy called Pisco and his target

249
00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:48.279
are also supposed to come here.

250
00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:50.179
That's enough talking already.

251
00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:51.279
Here we go.

252
00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:08.679
Darn it. I know it's a farewell party,

253
00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:10.879
but get a load of all the people in black.

254
00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:13.579
Each and everyone of them looks suspicious.

255
00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:16.679
Sherry.

256
00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.779
Sherry.

257
00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:25.679
Sherry.

258
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.479
Sherry.

259
00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.979
What's the matter little girl?

260
00:16:36.979 --> 00:16:39.079
Are you separated from your parents?

261
00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:44.179
Yes! We're looking for them together.

262
00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:45.679
Let's go, Hana!

263
00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:52.079
Hey, what is wrong with you?

264
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.879
It's not like you.

265
00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:56.679
You're the one who said you wanted to come along, right?

266
00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:00.979
I had a terrible dream.

267
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.179
A dream?

268
00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:05.279
Gin found me on my way back from school.

269
00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:08.379
I was cornered into a back alley and...

270
00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:11.279
You were the first one to get shot.

271
00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:13.779
And with the dry sound of the pistol going off,

272
00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:15.479
people were killed one after the other.

273
00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:16.579
Yes.

274
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.979
Just because they were all involved with me.

275
00:17:20.979 --> 00:17:24.879
Maybe I should've been executed by them

276
00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:26.979
right there and then.

277
00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:33.679
Do you know?

278
00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:37.479
You wear that and nobody can tell who you are!

279
00:17:37.479 --> 00:17:41.279
Even Clark Kent would be surprised too.

280
00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:45.779
Then you, who took off his glasses, would be superman?

281
00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:48.579
Except, I can't fly.

282
00:17:48.579 --> 00:17:51.479
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

283
00:17:51.479 --> 00:17:53.079
Thank you.

284
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:56.779
You've seriously got a bad personality.

285
00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.079
But, Gin.

286
00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:04.779
I wonder if she's really going to be there?

287
00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:05.979
Yeah.

288
00:18:05.979 --> 00:18:08.879
She's that kind of chick.

289
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:10.979
She'll try and stop the poison from being used.

290
00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:15.079
Unaware that we will be waiting for her.

291
00:18:15.079 --> 00:18:19.979
What if she doesn't come?

292
00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:23.979
At least I know that she's hiding in the Beika Town vicinity.

293
00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:25.579
If we find a clue as to where she lives,

294
00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:28.179
hunting her down is no problem,

295
00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:31.979
because traitors cannot cover their smell up.

296
00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.879
Indeed a farewell party for a master.

297
00:18:37.879 --> 00:18:40.079
Look at all the big shots.

298
00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:45.079
"Mika Nanjo (38) -A woman novelist, winner of the Ueki Award.

299
00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:50.079
"Yasuo Mihei (62)" -The owner of a pro baseball team.

300
00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:55.079
"Naoya Tarumi (35)" -A top-notch musical producer.

301
00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:59.979
"Chris Vineyard (29)" -A famous actress from the U.S.

302
00:18:59.979 --> 00:19:04.979
"Yoshiharu Tawara (58)" -A famous university professor.

303
00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:09.979
"Kenzo Masuyama (71)" -A big shot of the economics world is also here.

304
00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:13.679
And? Did you figure out who Pisco's target is?

305
00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:16.479
Yeah. Gin was saying in the phone that

306
00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.379
the target would be here around 6 pm

307
00:19:18.379 --> 00:19:21.979
and is someone on the wanted list of the police.

308
00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:25.879
It's got to be that guy who is surrounded by reporters

309
00:19:25.879 --> 00:19:27.379
at the entrance.

310
00:19:27.379 --> 00:19:29.279
I see.

311
00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:30.479
"Shigehiko Nomiguchi (56)" -The politician

312
00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:32.279
who made the headlines sweating,

313
00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:34.979
while justifying himself.

314
00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:37.879
If they want to shut him up before he is nabbed,

315
00:19:37.879 --> 00:19:40.279
could he be a member of the organization too?

316
00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.479
I wonder.

317
00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:44.379
We'll find out when he's nabbed.

318
00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:47.079
Please explain it so we understand!

319
00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:49.779
Will you excuse me?

320
00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:51.879
What? Inspector Megure.

321
00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:53.379
I called him from the restroom a while ago,

322
00:19:53.379 --> 00:19:55.179
using my voice changer.

323
00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:57.479
I told him that somebody

324
00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:00.579
is after the life of that politician.

325
00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:04.379
Now what, Pisco?

326
00:20:04.379 --> 00:20:07.579
You couldn't possibly assassinate someone

327
00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:10.579
under this condition, could you?

328
00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:13.079
If you intend to carry out your mission aggressively,

329
00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.779
I'll put you to sleep with this gun of mine!

330
00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:18.779
Ladies and Gentlemen!

331
00:20:18.779 --> 00:20:20.779
"Naomichi Mugikura (43)" -Now, we will view a slideshow

332
00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:24.079
of Director Sakamaki memories

333
00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:26.379
when he was alive!

334
00:20:26.379 --> 00:20:27.679
Slideshow?

335
00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:32.679
Now, can anyone tell me

336
00:20:32.679 --> 00:20:36.379
where and when this film was taken?

337
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:40.079
Hey, that politician is leaving!

338
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.079
What?

339
00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:42.679
Hey, hurry up and look for him!

340
00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:43.879
Yes, sir!

341
00:20:43.879 --> 00:20:44.979
Darn it, where on earth is he?

342
00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:47.079
Where'd he go?

343
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.679
Yes.

344
00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:52.579
This is one of Director Sakamaki's major films!

345
00:20:52.579 --> 00:20:53.879
The one that received various awards,

346
00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:55.879
the filming of "The Rainbow Colored Handkerchief".

347
00:20:55.879 --> 00:20:58.479
This is an important slide of the time

348
00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:00.979
the director's hair was still fluffy.

349
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:07.479
-How is it? -No, we can't find him yet!

350
00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:08.879
Look closer!

351
00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:09.879
Yes, sir!

352
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:14.379
Let's go on to the next picture.

353
00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:16.179
What? This looks to be

354
00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:20.179
a snapshot of lunch they are having in between filming.

355
00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:22.279
Although I'm pretty sure you're all familiar.

356
00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:25.179
Director Sakamaki used to love soba!

357
00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:26.579
Since the filming of

358
00:21:26.579 --> 00:21:28.479
the "Rainbow Colored Handkerchief" was in Shinshu,

359
00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:30.179
every day at lunch time, he would go here and there

360
00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:34.079
to try out one soba restaurant after another.

361
00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:35.879
By the time filming ended,

362
00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:38.579
it is said that he used to say gregariously that

363
00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:40.779
"All the soba shops in Shinshu are mine."

364
00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:43.079
Let's go on to the next slide!

365
00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:44.279
A flash?

366
00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:47.079
Oh, I know how precious the picture is,

367
00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:49.279
but it won't come out if you use a flash unit!

368
00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:53.479
What's that?

369
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.379
What was that sound?

370
00:21:55.379 --> 00:21:58.579
Above?

371
00:21:58.579 --> 00:22:01.079
-What the... -What was that sound?

372
00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:02.579
Hey, what's up?

373
00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:03.879
What was that sound?

374
00:22:03.879 --> 00:22:05.779
Hurry, turn the lights on!

375
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:12.079
What is going on, anyway?

376
00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:13.679
What is happening?

377
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:14.879
What happened?

378
00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:17.479
A handkerchief?

379
00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:05.379
"Next Episode"

380
00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:06.479
There they are!

381
00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:07.679
Just as I thought.

382
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:11.679
Pisco is among the seven of them

383
00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.779
Haibara, big trouble!

384
00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.079
They're coming!

385
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:19.979
Wait...

386
00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:21.479
Haibara!

387
00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:24.279
Next Conan,

388
00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:28.300
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Conan Part)"

389
00:24:28.797 --> 00:24:31.197
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:33.697
"Handkerchief"

391
00:24:33.697 --> 00:24:35.097
In the next episode Haibara is in real trouble.

392
00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:36.397
Are you aware that you're in trouble too?

393
00:24:36.397 --> 00:24:37.997
-What about me? -You don't.
