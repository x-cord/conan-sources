1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:02,324
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:05,824
Travel mysteries are so popular,

4
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:07,724
mystery churns in the ocean.

5
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:13,724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,737
You two should thank me.

9
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:51,537
I've got a golden arm.

10
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,537
Alright already.

11
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:55,337
You're so persistent, dad.

12
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:56,737
You know, Pops...

13
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:58,337
You really are kind of talented.

14
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:00,237
In lotteries, at least.

15
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,137
I can't believe you won the first prize again

16
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,937
which was this trip.

17
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,737
What do you mean "kind of talented"?

18
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:07,237
I'm a genius.

19
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:12,537
What? You want to kill yourself?

20
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:15,937
"Seiji Hario (30)" -Go ahead then, go on, I dare you.

21
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:19,337
I've always done things this way, that's my style.

22
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:22,337
I get rid of anything I don't like.

23
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:29,437
Next stop, Shin-Shimonoseki.

24
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:30,837
Shin-Shimonoseki.

25
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:33,037
You may exit through the left.

26
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:40,037
"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 1)"

27
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,137
"The Strait Dream Tower"

28
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:45,237
"The Strait Dream Tower" -Conan, look.

29
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:46,237
You can see...

30
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,637
"Observatory on the 30th floor" -the entire city of Shimonoseki.

31
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,237
Wow, this is great.

32
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,637
Look over there,

33
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,437
"Ganryu Island" -that's Ganryu Island,

34
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:55,437
that's where Musashi Miyamoto and Kojiro Sasaki fought that famous battle.

35
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:58,137
It's smaller than I expected.

36
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,537
Hey, Ran. Isn't that Kyushu over there?

37
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:02,837
Yes, it is.

38
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:07,037
The Kanmon Strait is pretty narrow, isn't it?

39
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:11,037
Says here the narrowest area's only 700 m.

40
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,637
If you ran across it, you'd reach Kyushu in five minutes.

41
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:16,837
Oh for goodness sakes, how are you going to run across the ocean?

42
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,437
Really?

43
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:24,937
Dad, you're so embarrassing.

44
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:28,137
He's right, you can run across.

45
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:33,037
Are you talking about that bridge?

46
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,737
No, that's the Kanmon Bridge, it's only for cars.

47
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:39,237
But there's an underwater tunnel

48
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:42,337
"Keisuke Otsubo, Toru Akitaya" -directly under it for human traffic.

49
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,237
It's nicknamed "The People's Tunnel".

50
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,137
Gee, you sure know a lot.

51
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:50,237
We grew up in this neighborhood.

52
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:51,537
No wonder.

53
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:53,137
It can't be.

54
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,937
"Eiko Nojima, Akane Isaka" -Aren't you Kogoro Mouri?

55
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,537
Yes, I am.

56
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:03,137
I knew it.

57
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:06,337
He's that famous private detective.

58
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,937
My name's Akitaya.

59
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,237
I'm Keisuke Otsubo.

60
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:13,837
I'm Akane Isaka.

61
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,437
I'm Eiko Nojima.

62
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:18,037
We're all fans of yours, Mr. Mouri.

63
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,237
Aren't we? Aren't we?

64
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:21,337
-We sure are. -Yes.

65
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:23,437
Really?

66
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:29,837
Yeah, everyone knows Kogoro only for his name and his face,

67
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,537
which means...

68
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,837
If it's not an imposition,

69
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:36,437
would you join us for dinner?

70
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:40,037
Great idea. We'd really like to hear your stories.

71
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,637
I knew it.

72
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,437
Well...

73
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,337
They were nice enough to offer,

74
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:47,037
shall we accept?

75
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,737
Besides, they're locals so they probably know

76
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:51,037
where the good restaurants are.

77
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,537
We were raised here

78
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:55,937
but she and I have been living in Tokyo since college.

79
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:58,537
How do you all know each other?

80
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:01,937
We were all in the same class in high school.

81
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:05,437
High school classmates?

82
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,237
That's so nice.

83
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,037
12 years have passed since you graduated

84
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,837
but you're all still so close.

85
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:12,537
"Strait Dream Square" -I guess it's because

86
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:15,137
we all have such different personalities.

87
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:17,437
I am confident of my ability

88
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:19,637
but not very smart.

89
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:22,337
Otsubo's smart but he's a coward.

90
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,137
You've got some nerve.

91
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:27,937
Akane's smart too but she's pretty mean.

92
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,037
You've got some nerve.

93
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:33,737
Eiko's sweet but shy.

94
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,937
Actually, there used to be one more in our group.

95
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,137
Another close friend of ours.

96
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:41,637
Another member?

97
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,337
His name was Hondo,

98
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:47,237
he could draw really well, he wanted to go to an art college.

99
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:48,437
But...

100
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:53,337
In our senior year of high school,

101
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:55,637
he went to the Kanmon Bridge

102
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,137
and killed himself.

103
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,037
He committed suicide.

104
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,437
I see, he was talented but he probably felt

105
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:05,337
he'd already given it all he had and nothing left.

106
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:06,637
You're wrong.

107
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,237
His dream...

108
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,737
His dream was taken from him.

109
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,737
His dream?

110
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:18,137
He broke his arm.

111
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,137
And it didn't heal right.

112
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:26,337
I see.

113
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:30,737
Yesterday was his 13th memorial service.

114
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:32,537
So that's why you all came from Tokyo.

115
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:34,837
Well, that was part of the reason.

116
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,637
These two wanted to make an announcement to Eiko and me.

117
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:40,437
It seems they've gotten engaged.

118
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:45,337
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

119
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:49,837
Well, I realized one day that she was the only single one left.

120
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,137
How dare you!

121
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:54,037
I'm marrying you only because I feel sorry for you.

122
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,237
I think you two make a great couple.

123
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,737
So do I.

124
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,337
-You've got to be kidding. -You've got to be kidding.

125
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,137
Hey, come on.

126
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:13,137
Conan, look over there. It's so cute.

127
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,837
It's a cetacean.

128
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,737
Well, I see you're all together.

129
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,937
-Hario. -Hario...

130
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:31,537
Akitaya, I want to talk to you alone,

131
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:33,737
but I guess this is a bad time.

132
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:37,537
I'll be here for three to four days,

133
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:39,037
I'll see you later.

134
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,337
Who was that man?

135
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,837
That's Seiji Hario.

136
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,037
He was also one of our classmates.

137
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,337
Him too?

138
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:51,237
I wonder what he came back for anyway?

139
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,737
Probably for the memorial service.

140
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:55,737
Maybe he feels responsible?

141
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,537
What do you mean?

142
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:58,837
It's that creep's fault.

143
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:02,437
He's the one who broke Hondo's arm 12 years ago.

144
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:04,637
He's the one?

145
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:10,037
I'm sorry, I have to excuse myself.

146
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:12,037
I think I've worn myself out. I'm going home.

147
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,537
I'm terribly sorry.

148
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,637
I promise to be there for dinner though.

149
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,137
Excuse me.

150
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,537
I hope she's alright.

151
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:28,237
She didn't look very good.

152
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,237
Hondo was Eiko's boyfriend.

153
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,337
I guess she can't forget him.

154
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:37,737
She's still in love with Hondo.

155
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,437
That's why she's still single.

156
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,737
It's been 12 years already.

157
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:51,237
Is Akitaya married?

158
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,437
No.

159
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:53,637
Why?

160
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:55,937
I just was just curious.

161
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:03,637
So we'll see you all later for dinner.

162
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,937
Yes, please enjoy yourselves.

163
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,137
Since the olden days,

164
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:12,137
"Port of Shimonoseki International Terminal" -Shimonoseki has a history

165
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,137
of being a port city open to foreign ships.

166
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,737
Really?

167
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:16,937
Look, Conan.

168
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:19,837
Doesn't this place look like the Dragon King's palace?

169
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,437
"Akama Shrine" -Yeah, you're right.

170
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:28,437
"Kanmon Bridge"

171
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:31,837
Boy, this sure is a big bridge.

172
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:35,037
"Entrance Human Tunnel" -Look, that must be the tunnel

173
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,037
"(Shimonoseki side)" -Mr. Akitaya told us about.

174
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:39,037
-Let's go inside. -Okay.

175
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:46,137
"Human Tunnel B3 (Shimonoseki side)"

176
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,937
"Moji"

177
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,937
I wonder if there's a possibility this place might spring a leak.

178
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,037
I mean, we are underwater.

179
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:55,937
Oh for goodness sakes, dad, don't worry.

180
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:03,737
"Yamaguchi Prefecture" "Fukuoka Prefecture"

181
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:10,837
Look at me. I'm standing in two prefectures at the same time.

182
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,037
Peace.

183
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:18,737
"Shimonoseki"

184
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:22,137
Can you believe this?

185
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:25,837
We just walked across the Kanmon Strait.

186
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:26,937
Yeah.

187
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:32,837
"Moji Retro Town"

188
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,337
"Moji Harbor Train Station"

189
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:43,137
This ferry takes only five minutes

190
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,737
and even if you go through that tunnel we took and walked slowly,

191
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,737
it takes only 15 minutes one way.

192
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:51,837
Honshu and Kyushu are very close, aren't they?

193
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:56,137
This is one of those things you can't tell just by looking at maps.

194
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:57,237
Yeah.

195
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,837
The locals call balloon fish "fuku" instead of "fugu"?

196
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:09,237
Yes. Fuku, not fugu.

197
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,237
I see.

198
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,237
"Fuku" for happiness.

199
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:17,037
Your father's so funny.

200
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,537
Excuse me.

201
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:23,537
Hario.

202
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:29,637
Akitaya, give your company up.

203
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,037
You tell me to give it up?

204
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:35,737
I'm a consultant for a food manufacturer now.

205
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,937
They told me they want to buy your company.

206
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,537
They'll pay good money.

207
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,737
Sounds like a fair deal, don't you think?

208
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:48,637
You've got to be kidding.

209
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:52,037
My father started the company and he worked hard for it.

210
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:54,337
I'm not letting go of it so easily.

211
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,337
I could crush your company right now if I wanted to.

212
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,137
You're nothing, you're just garbage.

213
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,437
What'd you say?

214
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,137
Enjoy yourself tonight.

215
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:09,437
I'll contact you tomorrow.

216
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,637
Hario, wait.

217
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:17,737
Did you come back to Shimonoseki to tell him that?

218
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,337
Didn't you come for Hondo's memorial service?

219
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,437
Who's that? I don't know anyone named Hondo.

220
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,837
Hario!

221
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,437
Hey! Wait, Hario!

222
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:40,937
Have you no heart? Answer me, Hario.

223
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:42,937
Apologize to Eiko.

224
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:45,137
Don't touch me with your filthy hands.

225
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,037
Otsubo.

226
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,837
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,137
Are you alright?

228
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,437
Darn.

229
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:02,037
He's so mean... so mean.

230
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:03,337
Eiko.

231
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:19,787
"Next day"

232
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:22,087
They're all such nice people, that's why...

233
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,987
"Former Akita Company" -I kind of, feel sorry for them.

234
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,587
You mean Mr. Akitaya and his friends?

235
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:32,387
Yes, but there's nothing we can do to help.

236
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,087
Hey, you two!

237
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:38,087
I just found out it's a 15 minute bus ride to Chofu from here.

238
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:40,987
Do we have to go to that "Mouri Residence"?

239
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,387
Of course we do.

240
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:45,287
The famous Motonari Mouri is my ancestor,

241
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,087
his descendant lives there.

242
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,987
Are you really related to the famous Motonari Mouri?

243
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,287
I heard this the first time today.

244
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:55,687
I thought so.

245
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,987
I wonder if there was an accident or something.

246
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,387
I guess my ancestor will have to wait.

247
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,887
The victim's driver's license.

248
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:27,487
Seiji Hario, 30 years old, the address is in Tokyo.

249
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,487
Did you say Hario?

250
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:30,787
-It can't be... -It can't be...

251
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,887
Who are you?

252
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:36,687
The name's Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private detective in Tokyo.

253
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,087
Mouri, the famous private detective.

254
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,287
Yes, I suppose I am.

255
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,287
I've heard all about you.

256
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,887
I'm Kusuda with the Yamaguchi Prefectural Police.

257
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:47,387
I'm Anzai with the Shimonoseki Police Department.

258
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:53,187
You seem to recognize the victim.

259
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,487
Yes, sort of...

260
00:14:56,487 --> 00:15:00,887
He died of a cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the back of the head.

261
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:03,087
The murder weapon appears to be this rock

262
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,587
but we may not be able to get any fingerprints off of it.

263
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:10,887
Approximate time of death is between 9 am and 1 pm or thereabouts.

264
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,787
They've been scraped on the ground pretty hard.

265
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:19,387
I wonder why?

266
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,687
You again.

267
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,187
Keep out of the way.

268
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:27,287
There're no signs of a struggle

269
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,087
and nothing's been stolen.

270
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:33,287
Which means the murderer is someone who knew him and held a grudge.

271
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,887
Yes, we think so too.

272
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,287
Whoever did it must have hated him a lot too,

273
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,287
he was hit twice.

274
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,987
I've got it. I know how he got those marks.

275
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:44,987
There's four people I think we should talk to,

276
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,787
can you get them here?

277
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,987
Do you have an idea who the killer might be?

278
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:51,387
Dad, you can't be serious,

279
00:15:51,387 --> 00:15:53,987
you don't think one of them did it, do you?

280
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,287
I don't want to suspect them either.

281
00:15:56,287 --> 00:16:00,887
But this guy had a lot of enemies, he would've been very, very careful.

282
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:06,687
I'm sure he came back to Shimonoseki without telling anyone.

283
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,487
Which means he got someone mad

284
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,387
after he arrived in Shimonoseki yesterday

285
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,787
and then remember the scene we witnessed last night,

286
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:16,187
put them together and those four start to look pretty suspicious.

287
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:17,587
No way.

288
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,187
"Shimonoseki Central Police Station"

289
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:24,187
I see.

290
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:26,587
So that's what happened

291
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:30,087
between you people and Mr. Hario last night.

292
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:33,987
Sure, we were all mad at him, but not enough to kill him...

293
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,587
Alright...

294
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:38,587
But for the record, I need a statement from each one of you

295
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:42,287
as to what you were doing this morning.

296
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,387
Mr. Akitaya, let's begin with you.

297
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,187
At nine this morning,

298
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,387
I went to the office for awhile

299
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,587
but I was worried about what Hario told me yesterday

300
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,987
about the buy-out

301
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,487
so I went to the beach alone

302
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:56,187
and sat in my car thinking about what to do.

303
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,987
After that, I went to Karato Ichiba,

304
00:16:57,987 --> 00:16:59,787
which is one of our customers.

305
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,687
I'm pretty sure I got there a little before 11 am.

306
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:09,987
I was out for a drive in my car all morning, alone.

307
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,187
Then I got a call from Akane

308
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,887
and I went to meet her at Kaikyokan.

309
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,287
I think that was about 10:50 am.

310
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,887
The two of us went to see the performing seals show at 11 am.

311
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:24,287
I was with Akane until 10 am,

312
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:27,787
"Moji Retro Town" -we were shopping in Moji.

313
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,787
Then we parted company,

314
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:34,387
I came back to Shimonoseki

315
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,687
but I realized I'd forgotten something

316
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:40,487
so I headed back to Moji on the 11 o'clock ferry.

317
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:46,687
I remember seeing Akane and Eiko at Kaikyokan.

318
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:49,187
-Right? -Yes.

319
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:52,487
We were in a hurry because the show was going to start though.

320
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,087
Look, it's Otsubo.

321
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,987
Over there, at the ferry landing.

322
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,487
Let's see.

323
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:07,787
Keisuke Otsubo,

324
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,287
we're always keeping an eye on you.

325
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:13,387
If you don't believe me, look over at the Kaikyokan.

326
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,487
You're right, he's waving.

327
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:19,887
Right?

328
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:23,787
I see, according to your statements,

329
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,787
at the time of Mr. Hario's estimated time of death

330
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,687
which is somewhere around 9 am and 11 am,

331
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:32,287
Mr. Akitaya, until past 9 am to 11 am

332
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:36,487
and Ms. Nojima, until you got to Kaikyokan at 10:50 am,

333
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,587
and Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka,

334
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:42,287
you parted company at 10 am, so for that one hour,

335
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,387
you all have no alibis for a short span of time.

336
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,887
Dad.

337
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:48,987
Now wait a minute.

338
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:51,587
Did you say between 9 am and 11 am?

339
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:54,387
At 11 am, Hario was still alive,

340
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,187
he called me on the phone.

341
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,787
What did you say?

342
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,387
He called you at 11 am?

343
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:02,387
-Yes. -It can't be.

344
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:05,087
Are you sure, Akitaya?

345
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,487
It was a weird call.

346
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,787
He said Hondo's ghost was after him

347
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:11,287
and he wanted me to help him.

348
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,987
A ghost was chasing him?

349
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,887
Hondo's ghost.

350
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,387
Yeah.

351
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,687
He sounded like he was crying.

352
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,387
What do you mean his ghost?

353
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,287
I've heard enough nonsense.

354
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,387
What's the matter?

355
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,987
Nothing, it was just a prank call.

356
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,687
I hadn't been with the customer very long when the call came

357
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,287
so it must've been about 11 am.

358
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,187
No mistake.

359
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:39,187
I wonder where he called me from though?

360
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:43,187
The sound of his footsteps and his voice seemed to have a strange echo.

361
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:48,587
A place near the murder scene which would produce an echo...

362
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,887
The pedestrian tunnel.

363
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,787
There's supposed to be a surveillance camera there.

364
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,087
I'll go check.

365
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,887
Mr. Mouri, if the victim did indeed make the call at 11 am,

366
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:01,987
then that means he was killed after that.

367
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:05,187
And that means...

368
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:12,187
They all have alibis for that time.

369
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:18,087
Yeah, I remember this guy.

370
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:21,687
He was running all around the place inside the tunnel.

371
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,887
I thought somebody was chasing him

372
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,987
but I didn't see anyone.

373
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,987
So I just figured he was strange.

374
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:33,487
Do you remember what time it was?

375
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:38,987
I'm pretty sure it was about 11 am.

376
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,587
He's sure about that?

377
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,287
Yes. He said it was so strange,

378
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:46,287
he checked the time so he could make a report.

379
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:50,587
The call he claims he got, must've been from there.

380
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:53,687
So the murder took place after that,

381
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,187
after 11 am.

382
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:04,487
That's right. I understand.

383
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:09,087
We've verified Mr. Akitaya, Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka's alibis.

384
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:15,487
Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka saw Mr. Otsubo at the ferry landing.

385
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,687
So you're all in the clear, so to speak.

386
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:20,487
Sorry to have kept you here so long.

387
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:25,187
We've verified your alibis so you're all free to go now.

388
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:28,387
I apologize for the inconvenience.

389
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:32,887
I'm so happy, they've been cleared.

390
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,287
Me too.

391
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:41,687
See you later, Eiko.

392
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:43,887
See you later.

393
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,387
I'll call you later.

394
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,387
Okay.

395
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:14,487
I've got it.

396
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:18,087
I know how to break their alibis now.

397
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:53,087
"Next Episode" -Hey listen, that surveillance camera you mentioned,

398
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:55,787
is it the ceiling type?

399
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:57,587
Ceiling type?

400
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:01,887
But Mr. Mouri, what if this man wasn't really Mr. Hario?

401
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:02,987
You're right.

402
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:07,087
He might have been killed way before this

403
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:12,687
which means, anyone of those four could have committed the murder.

404
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,787
Next Conan,

405
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,787
"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 2)"

406
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:22,855
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:24,955
"Palm mark"

408
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,055
The next episode concludes this case.

409
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,155
Kyushu is more assertive than Honshu.

410
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:29,634
-What do you mean? -Because they hesitate.
