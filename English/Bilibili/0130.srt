1
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:04,082
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:06,182
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:07,682
Today's stage is a jam packed stadium.

4
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:09,682
Fear closes in on the cheers of the audience.

5
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,182
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:13,182
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,382
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:57,195
I'm a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

9
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:59,295
I went with an old friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

10
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,995
to an amusement park.

11
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,695
where I witnessed a suspicious deal with a man dressed in black.

12
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,395
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

13
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:09,695
that I didn't notice a second man sneak up from behind me.

14
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,595
He beat me up and forced me to take a poison,

15
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:14,295
and when I woke up...

16
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,795
My body had shrunk!

17
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:19,195
If they learned Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

18
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:21,595
people around me would be in danger.

19
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,795
Per Dr. Agasa's advice, I decided to conceal my identity.

20
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:25,995
When Ran asked my name,

21
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:29,395
I quickly answered "Conan Edogawa".

22
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,095
To get information on the men,

23
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:35,395
I wound up living with Ran and her detective father.

24
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:44,695
"Indiscriminate Murder Threat at the Stadium (Part 1)"

25
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,695
Hey, don't you think that

26
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:58,795
the dancing lion looks like Inspector Megure?

27
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,395
Huh?

28
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:03,295
Just what do you think you're doing, Takagi?

29
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,095
Very true!

30
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:06,695
It does, doesn't it?

31
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:08,695
It also looks like Genta.

32
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:09,695
What are you saying?

33
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,195
See, you look just like it!

34
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:13,695
How dare you!

35
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:14,995
Stop right there!

36
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,695
Hey! We'd better hurry, or the game will start!

37
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,195
Yeah, I know.

38
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:24,195
-Let's go, Mitsuhiko. -Okay.

39
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,695
Hey, Ran. One more serving!

40
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,295
What? Another serving?

41
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,195
This is your sixth serving.

42
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,095
What's the big deal?

43
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,695
After all, it's New Year's Day. Let me drink all I like.

44
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,595
You're always drinking all you like anyway.

45
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:46,395
Where is the little one?

46
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,895
Conan went to watch a soccer game.

47
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,295
He said it's the Emperor Cup Finals.

48
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:52,695
What's the fun of going out

49
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:56,295
to watch a soccer game on New Year's Day?

50
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:58,695
What better way is there to spend New Year's Day

51
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:01,195
than to watch Yoko on TV while drinking sake.

52
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,395
Here goes!

53
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,095
Treat me...

54
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,395
Stone, paper, scissors squad!

55
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,395
What's this program about?

56
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:12,495
A special New Year's program, maybe?

57
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:15,195
Besides, I don't think Yoko's coming on today

58
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,095
until the Afternoon Drama Special.

59
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:20,295
What? She's not coming on until this afternoon?

60
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,195
What bummers!

61
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,495
I guess I'll take a snooze,

62
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,295
so wake me up when the drama starts.

63
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:28,195
Hey, Dad! You'll catch a cold.

64
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:35,695
"January 1st, National Stadium, Emperor's Cup Finals"

65
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,095
"Big Osaka, Tokyo Spirits"

66
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:52,695
Who's the one that just scored? What's his name?

67
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,695
Hide of the Spirits.

68
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:58,295
Hide struck a heading at Naoki's centering.

69
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,995
-Just as expected of Hide! -Yes!

70
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:03,295
If it were not for his wound, he would have surely been chosen

71
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:06,295
as one of the players on the Japan team.

72
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,795
Talking about the Japan team,

73
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,595
it's too bad they couldn't win the World Cup.

74
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,795
To think that they couldn't win even one game is so vexing.

75
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:17,795
I wonder all the adults were so excited about it too?

76
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,795
Dad said that it's like a dream that Japan got to play.

77
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:24,095
It seems to be a super fantastic match.

78
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,895
-You idiots. -Huh?

79
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,995
The World Cup is one of the world's greatest events

80
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,395
in which nations all over the world,

81
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,695
compete with their entire heart and soul.

82
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:34,695
It's no wonder that the Japanese are making a big thing of it.

83
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:38,095
Well, but I'm sure vexed that Japan couldn't win even one game.

84
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:39,595
But it only goes to show that the walls of the world

85
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,995
are not easy to break through.

86
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:44,195
How can you be so reserved?

87
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,895
You're the one who looked the most vexed

88
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:49,495
after we finished watching TV.

89
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:50,995
Exactly, exactly.

90
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:54,595
You were having a fit on the table of Dr. Agasa's home.

91
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,495
I couldn't help it

92
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,395
because participating in the World Cup

93
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:01,295
was my dream since I was a kid.

94
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,395
What do you mean "Since you were a kid", Conan?

95
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:07,895
You're still a kid, Conan.

96
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,495
When on earth did you begin watching soccer, anyway?

97
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,995
Well, that is, you see...

98
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,495
What's so funny, Haibara?

99
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,095
Mr. Renown Detective, you turn into a mere child

100
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:23,595
when it comes to soccer, don't you?

101
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:24,895
Leave me alone.

102
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:27,795
Didn't you come here to watch the game?

103
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:30,095
I just came here because you all did.

104
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:33,595
They know what I used to look like when I was a child, you know.

105
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:38,095
If I were to be seen on the TV screen,

106
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:40,495
they'll find me on the spot.

107
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:43,595
If that happens, would it put you into a fix too?

108
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:47,595
That's why I wasn't really up to coming...

109
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:49,195
Hey!

110
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,195
How's that? This way, it wouldn't matter

111
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,495
if you're were to be seen on camera, right?

112
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,695
Come on!

113
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,795
Forget about them for now,

114
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,295
and let's watch the game.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,395
Soccer games are best seen live.

116
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,795
All right! Go!

117
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,495
Shinichi.

118
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:18,995
I'll bet it hasn't even crossed your mind

119
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:23,095
that you are already deeply involved in a secret project

120
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:27,495
that our organization has been working on since half a century ago.

121
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,795
Switch from camera 2 to camera 1.

122
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:33,595
Camera 1 don't miss the goal scene.

123
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:35,695
Camera 4, what are you doing?

124
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,595
Mr. Kaneko.

125
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,395
What is it, at a busy time like this?

126
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,295
Will you please take this call?

127
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,695
The call? Is it for me?

128
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,795
Yes. He's been repeatedly saying

129
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,795
that you'd regret if you don't take the call.

130
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,495
Shoots. What a nuisance.

131
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:58,395
Yes, this is Director Kaneko.

132
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,595
Hello? Who are you?

133
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:04,195
I'll say this only once so listen close.

134
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,895
Look at the boy in the front row

135
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,195
who is leaning out against the railing,

136
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,895
right up ahead to the right side of the bleachers.

137
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,595
What?

138
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:15,095
Hey, camera 13 is open now, isn't it?

139
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,895
Will you zoom the bleachers to the right?

140
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,295
Yes, sir.

141
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,095
Hey, camera 13!

142
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,595
Very composed.

143
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:26,395
People watching such an interesting game

144
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:27,995
would normally react like that.

145
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:29,695
Go, Hide!

146
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,595
-Hang in there! -Right there, Ramus!

147
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,195
Doesn't your heart ever skip a beat, or don't you ever get excited?

148
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,095
Don't you have such emotions?

149
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,895
I wonder, maybe if you look around, you'll find them.

150
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,095
Even when you came to class the first day.

151
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:46,895
I would normally be embarrassing to study among kids,

152
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:49,095
but you didn't seem to mind at all.

153
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,095
Most naturally.

154
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:54,195
-You were there. -What?

155
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:58,195
I remained composed because you were in that class.

156
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:02,195
You, who are in the same predicament as I.

157
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:06,895
Yeah, I see them, 5 kids.

158
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:10,495
The boy on the left edge wearing the blue cap?

159
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:13,195
Yeah. What about that kid?

160
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:21,695
Can I ask you one question?

161
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,895
What?

162
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,195
How old are you anyway?

163
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,695
-48 years old. -What?

164
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:28,995
I'm just kidding.

165
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:30,395
I'm actually...

166
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,995
-What is it? -What's the matter?

167
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,395
The ball suddenly bounced and...

168
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,895
Conan!

169
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,395
Hey!

170
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:50,895
There are two holes in the ball.

171
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:51,995
Don't tell me that...

172
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:55,095
You shouldn't be in here.

173
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,995
But I dropped my cap.

174
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,795
Your cap?

175
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:04,295
If so, it should be left somewhere on this rubber court.

176
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,895
Here it is! This is it!

177
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:12,795
Here you go, sonny.

178
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,595
The cap that you dropped.

179
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,195
Hey, sonny! Just what do you think you're doing?

180
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:24,095
Hey!

181
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:26,795
What's your problem, sonny?

182
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:30,395
This is a 7.62 millimeter bullet.

183
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,195
A full metal jacket.

184
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,795
It's a gun! A gun!

185
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:39,295
Somebody in this stadium fired a gun, Inspector Megure.

186
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:42,495
And, where is the victim who was shot?

187
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:46,395
Nobody was shot, just a soccer ball was.

188
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,995
A soccer ball?

189
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,595
I did as I was told by the man who called

190
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:52,695
and was looking at the ball that rolled right below the boy

191
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:57,295
in the front row wearing a blue cap with monitor.

192
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:58,595
Then, the ball suddenly...

193
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:02,995
bounced and the air leaked out of the ball.

194
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,595
I'm sure the ball was shot by a gun.

195
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:10,795
But maybe it was a prank where an air gun was used.

196
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,795
It's most likely a Tocaref.

197
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:13,995
Huh?

198
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,795
Conan?

199
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:18,095
The Youth Detective Squad at your service...

200
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,895
Come off it, you guys.

201
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:22,095
You guys were here, too.

202
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:23,295
It's her, right?

203
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:27,295
The child with the blue cap that you were looking at?

204
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:29,295
What? Yeah, right.

205
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,895
Which means that you guys were watching the whole thing too?

206
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:35,595
Yes. The ball suddenly bounced and air leaked out of it.

207
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:39,595
So, I went down into the field right away and found this.

208
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:42,795
A bullet that pierced through the rubber court.

209
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:44,695
What?

210
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:51,395
7.62 millimeter bullet. Russian made.

211
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:55,095
A Russian gun that can be loaded with this bullet

212
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:58,295
would be one that is frequently smuggled via China into Japan,

213
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,895
most probably a Tocaref.

214
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,995
It is extremely deadly

215
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:05,195
and has a high capability of killing its target.

216
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:07,395
Gun fire was not heard,

217
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,495
so the killer probably used a silencer.

218
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:14,495
Why are you so knowledgeable?

219
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:19,595
Of course Pops told me all of this.

220
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:24,295
Gosh. What's with him teaching a kid something like this?

221
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:26,895
The game's off! Off!

222
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,795
Stop the game right this minute

223
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,495
and evacuate the spectators as well as the players.

224
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:31,495
Yes, sir...

225
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,995
No!

226
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:36,795
The man who called said,

227
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:39,595
if we do anything funny like stop the game

228
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,395
or let the spectators go,

229
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:45,095
he'd shoot indiscriminately throughout the stadium!

230
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:46,695
What?

231
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:52,695
And, what does the criminal want?

232
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:55,495
He says to have 50,000,000 yen put into a bag

233
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:57,195
and ready by half-time.

234
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,195
As to where to take it, he said he'd call back later.

235
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:03,095
Did he demand that of you people?

236
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:06,295
Yes, to Nichiuri TV.

237
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:11,695
Could it be someone who has a grudge against Nichiuri TV?

238
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:14,095
Or, could it be a terrorist?

239
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:17,495
Do you have any idea as to the voice of the man?

240
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,395
The thing is,

241
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:22,395
his voice is muffled and hard to make out.

242
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:24,995
He probably had a cloth over the receiver

243
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:27,195
or was wearing a mask.

244
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:29,995
And, did you get the 50,000,000 yen ready?

245
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:33,395
Yes, it's on its way here.

246
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:39,195
Okay! Scatter plain clothes officers through the audience!

247
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,495
Our chance is when the criminal calls.

248
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:46,195
The moment he calls,

249
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:48,195
nab everyone who is using the phone.

250
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,495
Yes, sir...

251
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,295
It's dangerous here.

252
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:55,195
-You folks go on home. -Okay.

253
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:58,395
Hey. Is that kid wearing the blue cap a girl?

254
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:02,095
How rude. Can't you tell by looking at her?

255
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,495
Strange. The man who called said,

256
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:10,995
the boy in the blue cap to the extreme left of all the 5 kids.

257
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:14,495
Please wait, Inspector Megure!

258
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:17,595
It's not a good idea to nab the criminal just like that.

259
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,495
What do you mean?

260
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,095
The ball was right below us,

261
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,195
which means that the criminal shot from nearby us, right?

262
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:29,095
Yeah. He shot from a range that is not difficult to shoot from.

263
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:32,095
Besides, it'll be no laughing matter if he missed.

264
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:36,895
If the criminal is nearby, why did he mistake her for a boy?

265
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:40,595
Looking at her clothes, anybody can see that she's a girl.

266
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:44,395
Maybe he couldn't see her skirt because of a wall or something.

267
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,495
If the wall blocked his view,

268
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:50,995
it would mean that he was at the back stand right opposite us.

269
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:52,995
In other words, the person who told us

270
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:55,595
about the gun going off over the phone,

271
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:59,095
and the person who actually fired are different people.

272
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:02,795
There are at least more than two people involved, right?

273
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,595
Hey! Inform all the officers by radio,

274
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:10,195
and tell them not to move until I order them to.

275
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,395
Yes, sir!

276
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:13,195
What are they going to do?

277
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:17,395
Can they find the criminals with what little clue there is?

278
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:19,795
How do we find him in this stadium

279
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,895
packed with 56,000 people?

280
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,084
To all officers scattered among the audience.

281
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,384
There are more than two criminals.

282
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:43,184
And one of them is most likely armed with a Tocaref.

283
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:45,584
Don't do anything even if you see somebody suspicious.

284
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:49,284
Just keep on watch until further orders.

285
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:50,784
We can't be sure what the criminals will do

286
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,584
to save their companions.

287
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:56,984
Listen. Don't you ever let them suspect that you're officers.

288
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:58,784
Be very careful

289
00:15:58,784 --> 00:16:01,284
and exert your entire efforts into nabbing the criminals.

290
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:04,884
The next time the criminal will make his move is when he calls

291
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:06,784
to designate where to pick up the ransom he demanded.

292
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:10,984
Check each and every person in this stadium

293
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,484
who is using the phone at that time.

294
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:16,184
-And check also for binoculars. -Huh?

295
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,884
I said before just a while ago, didn't I?

296
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,584
That the criminal was watching us

297
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:23,584
from the back stand right opposite us.

298
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,484
He could see that there were 5 of us,

299
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:29,684
as well as that there was one kid wearing a blue cap, from so far away.

300
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:32,284
He couldn't have possibly seen that the ball

301
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,984
was right below that kid with his bare eyes.

302
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:37,884
Besides the cellular phone,

303
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:40,284
the criminal probably has binoculars, or...

304
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:42,684
-Opera glasses! -A telescope.

305
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:44,584
A mobile video camera.

306
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,884
A camera with zoom lenses should also be checked.

307
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,984
True.

308
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:52,484
There is a high probability that one of the criminals

309
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,784
have something that will help him view quite a distance away.

310
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:56,784
Please keep that in mind.

311
00:16:56,784 --> 00:17:00,384
Inspector! The phone!

312
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,984
I wonder if it's from the criminal?

313
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:04,084
Stay calm.

314
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:07,384
Okay, the phone is ringing. It could be the criminal.

315
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:12,084
All of you go and check on anybody

316
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,184
and inform me of his location.

317
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,384
If it's from the criminal,

318
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:19,084
try to do everything you can to prolong the conversation, understand?

319
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:21,184
Yes, sir.

320
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:24,684
Hello? This is Kaneko, the director.

321
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:28,284
Hello?

322
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:30,784
Why didn't you answer the phone right away?

323
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,384
Don't tell me you contacted the police?

324
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,684
No way. I just had some problems picking up the phone.

325
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,984
It's from the criminal. Find him.

326
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,484
Well, never mind. Is the money ready?

327
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:42,884
Yeah.

328
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:45,984
Put the money at the exit of Gate 18.

329
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:49,384
Place it there during the loss time of the first half of the game.

330
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,284
Don't goof.

331
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:54,384
Hey, wait! Hello?

332
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:58,884
He hung up. How about it? Did you find him?

333
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:00,384
This is sector "E".

334
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,384
An elderly man was using the phone till just a while ago.

335
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,684
This is sector "K".

336
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,884
There is one person here on the phone,

337
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:10,084
but he is still using it so I don't think he's the criminal.

338
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:13,184
He may be contacting the others in his group.

339
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:15,184
Keep your eyes on him.

340
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:17,684
Hey, Takagi! How about your side?

341
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:25,284
The ones who were on the phone at that time

342
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,984
are the 8 people here.

343
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,584
Were you also watching the aisles

344
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,884
and dressing rooms of this building?

345
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:35,184
Yes. Officers were also watching over the restrooms,

346
00:18:35,184 --> 00:18:37,184
but nobody was on the phone.

347
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:41,684
And of course nobody left the stadium either.

348
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:46,084
I had the cameras that were open, check the audience too,

349
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:50,484
but it seems that only these 8 people were using the phone.

350
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:53,084
There seems to be no mistake

351
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:56,984
that one of the criminals is among the eight.

352
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:58,384
But, Inspector.

353
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:01,684
I wonder if the criminal is really going to come get the money?

354
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:04,284
Well, I don't think he'll come just like that.

355
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:07,284
Don't take your eyes off the eight in question.

356
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:10,784
We'll have to nab them all

357
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,784
before they realize that we are here.

358
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,384
Where's my wireless radio?

359
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,384
Oh, this?

360
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,384
Yes, that's it.

361
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:24,984
-Here you go. -Thank you, Conan.

362
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:27,984
Okay, now all of you who are checking the building...

363
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:30,084
What did you set up on that wireless radio?

364
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,284
Yeah, a wire tap.

365
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:36,184
I want to at least be aware of what the police is doing.

366
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:39,584
Do you know where Genta and the others are?

367
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:42,484
They ran off delightedly

368
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:44,684
when I told them that they could come back in

369
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,984
with half of the ticket that they had.

370
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,484
Delightedly...

371
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:51,384
Don't tell me they...

372
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,984
This is Genta. Genta here.

373
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:58,884
Did you find any suspicious looking guy? Over.

374
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:00,584
Mitsuhiko here.

375
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:03,684
No, no one suspicious. Over.

376
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,184
Ayumi! How's it going over there?

377
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,184
Nope, nothing's happening here.

378
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,984
Yes, this is Ayumi.

379
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:14,984
What do you mean, "this is Ayumi"?

380
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,684
Just what do you think you guys are doing?

381
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:20,584
The criminal is armed with a gun, you know!

382
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,884
Let me and the police handle the criminals

383
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,484
and you kids hurry on out of here.

384
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:27,284
No way!

385
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:29,384
You're a kid too, aren't you?

386
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:32,684
We want to help arrest the criminals, too.

387
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:35,784
We're all members of the Youth Detective Squad, aren't we?

388
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,384
All right.

389
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:39,784
Don't you dare move on your own

390
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,384
even if you find somebody suspicious then.

391
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,984
Contact me, understand?

392
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,884
Okay...

393
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:47,384
Gosh.

394
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:49,984
They may come in quite handy.

395
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,384
I'm sure it wouldn't dawn on the criminals to suspect children.

396
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,884
That's true, but...

397
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:58,384
Oh, no. It's already loss time.

398
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:02,384
It's time to put the bag with the cash at gate number 18.

399
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:08,884
Sato here. The bag is still intact.

400
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:12,884
Tamiya here. Nobody is approaching the bag yet.

401
00:21:20,684 --> 00:21:22,184
He's come, Inspector!

402
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:24,284
He's a man wearing sunglasses, dressed in a gray coat

403
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,984
and wearing a white mask.

404
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,684
The man just picked up the bag.

405
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,784
Is there anybody else around?

406
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:33,284
-No, he's alone. -Okay.

407
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,184
Nab him!

408
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,384
The gun! Look for the gun!

409
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:47,684
It's nowhere!

410
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:50,784
Talk! Where is it? Where's the gun?

411
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,284
Don't touch!

412
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,284
Don't touch my partner!

413
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:57,584
I'll shoot at the audience!

414
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,484
Get away from him!

415
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:02,984
Partner?

416
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:06,284
So the police were snooping around after all.

417
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,084
Hey, what's this all about?

418
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:11,484
Mr. Kaneko of Nichiuri TV.

419
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,684
Well, that's...

420
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:15,784
Taking me lightly, huh?

421
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,284
I guess one person will have to die to set an example!

422
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:20,684
Hey, wait!

423
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:23,284
We're in a fix.

424
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:26,484
Well, I wonder who I should kill?

425
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:29,184
I've gotta whole load of targets to choose from.

426
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,784
"Next Episode"

427
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:07,184
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

428
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:09,684
Ayumi, which one is the criminal?

429
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:11,984
He's the one!

430
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,184
You're under arrest!

431
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:16,684
-Hey, you guys! -You're not getting away!

432
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:18,284
You won't get away!

433
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,684
I've finally figured it out, mister.

434
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:27,584
You're the one who blackmailed Nichiuri TV, right?

435
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:29,284
Next Conan,

436
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:33,305
"Indiscriminate Murder Threat at the Stadium (Part 2)"

437
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:36,686
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:38,486
"TV Camera"

439
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:40,486
In the next episode, the case and game is settled.

440
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:42,886
Goal! To the criminal!
