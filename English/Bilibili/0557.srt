1
00:00:01.682 --> 00:00:05.282
Okay, Conan, watch the house while I'm away.

2
00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:06.482
Yep.

3
00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:07.782
I'll be going then, bye.

4
00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.982
See you, bye.

5
00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:12.582
Ran's gone to club practice,

6
00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:14.382
Pops is checking on an infidelity case,

7
00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:17.282
and Genta guys haven't called or anything.

8
00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:20.082
I guess I can take it easy today.

9
00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:23.982
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

10
00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.382
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

11
00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:28.182
Doc and Haibara hitchhike?

12
00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:29.982
There is a suspicious couple on the car that they get into.

13
00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:31.582
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:33.382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:36.082
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

16
00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:26.854
"Dangerous Twosome"

17
00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:28.154
"Mouri Detective Agency"

18
00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.454
Hey...

19
00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:33.254
Did your Beetle stop on you again?

20
00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:35.154
Right...

21
00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:39.054
I came to introduce my new invention in Yamanashi, you see.

22
00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:42.254
The one that you go to every year.

23
00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:44.154
Then the car suddenly stopped moving

24
00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:45.754
on our way back home.

25
00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:49.154
I did call the auto service

26
00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:52.354
and had them tow the car away though

27
00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:56.354
and had them drop us off at a nearby bus stop.

28
00:02:56.354 --> 00:02:57.754
You mean the bus isn't coming?

29
00:02:57.754 --> 00:02:59.554
Oh, no...

30
00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.854
Oh, I'm sorry, we're not riding.

31
00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:12.754
Hey, don't tell me that your wallet...

32
00:03:12.754 --> 00:03:14.454
Yeah.

33
00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:17.154
I must've dropped it somewhere.

34
00:03:17.154 --> 00:03:20.554
It didn't seem to have much money inside but...

35
00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:22.154
I see.

36
00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:24.354
You called me and wanted me to ask Pops

37
00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:29.354
to go and pick you up,

38
00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:32.654
but Pops is out investigating an infidelity case and not home.

39
00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:34.254
What?

40
00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:36.554
There's nothing to get all worked up over, is there?

41
00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:39.354
You can have you know who, come pick you up by cab.

42
00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:40.454
You know who?

43
00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.454
You know! Who else?

44
00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:43.854
She's staying over at your place,

45
00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:45.554
watching house anyway, isn't she?

46
00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:47.854
The one with the stink eyes who's always yawning.

47
00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:49.754
I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:53.454
I've got stink eyes and is yawning all the time.

49
00:03:53.454 --> 00:03:56.754
I mean why are you there too?

50
00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.454
You're always looking down

51
00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:00.354
at Doc's inventions, aren't you?

52
00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:03.654
Right, I didn't want to come along,

53
00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:06.954
but I didn't want to stay home and watch the house either.

54
00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:10.654
Not in that house where the God knows who man

55
00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:11.954
is living next door.

56
00:04:11.954 --> 00:04:14.454
You mean Mr. Subaru Okiya?

57
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.554
Don't worry about him.

58
00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.154
He seems to be a good person.

59
00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:19.254
That's right!

60
00:04:19.254 --> 00:04:22.754
Why don't you have Subaru come pick you up by car?

61
00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:26.954
I don't know about you,

62
00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:29.054
but I suspect him as being one of the the men

63
00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:33.054
of the Black Organization as you call it, you know.

64
00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:37.554
Subaru? No way.

65
00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:38.754
I sensed it.

66
00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:39.954
Huh?

67
00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:42.454
Back then at Ikkaku Rock...

68
00:04:43.454 --> 00:04:45.254
The pressure I felt back then...

69
00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:52.754
was undoubtedly that of the Organization.

70
00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:55.854
No way.

71
00:04:55.854 --> 00:04:58.554
If so, both you and I would've been gone long ago.

72
00:04:58.554 --> 00:05:02.254
I hope you're not locking him up in that house of yours

73
00:05:02.254 --> 00:05:04.654
and making him watch me,

74
00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:06.454
using me as bait

75
00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:08.354
and waiting for him to make his move, are you?

76
00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:11.154
Don't talk stupid!

77
00:05:11.154 --> 00:05:12.354
I'd never do something like that!

78
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.654
At any rate,

79
00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:15.354
make up a reason

80
00:05:15.354 --> 00:05:18.254
and chase him out of your house, will you?

81
00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:21.754
Because the Organization may have already found out

82
00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:25.454
that I'm Sherry, the one who betrayed the Organization,

83
00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:29.054
and Shinichi Kudo that they already thought died is still alive

84
00:05:29.054 --> 00:05:31.054
because of information from him.

85
00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:34.254
Right, it could be that they are slowly making plans

86
00:05:34.254 --> 00:05:36.354
to kill us secretly behind the scene

87
00:05:36.354 --> 00:05:39.454
and the assassins of the Organization may already be right nearby.

88
00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:48.554
If you're in trouble, I'll give you a lift.

89
00:05:48.554 --> 00:05:49.954
You don't have money on you, right?

90
00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:52.954
Oh, thank you.

91
00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:55.354
We're going to Tokyo, but is that okay?

92
00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:59.054
Yes, we were just on our way back to Tokyo too.

93
00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:00.454
Okay, then get in the backseat.

94
00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:04.054
-Thank you. -I guess we'll somehow manage to get back home.

95
00:06:04.054 --> 00:06:05.754
I want you to think about

96
00:06:05.754 --> 00:06:07.054
chasing him out of your house

97
00:06:07.054 --> 00:06:08.454
before we arrive back home.

98
00:06:08.454 --> 00:06:10.654
Hey, Haibara!

99
00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:14.954
Well, you really are a great help indeed.

100
00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:25.154
He hasn't had much sleep last night.

101
00:06:25.154 --> 00:06:26.754
Oh, I see.

102
00:06:30.654 --> 00:06:32.754
It's a little loaded there, but bear it, will you.

103
00:06:32.754 --> 00:06:34.854
Huh? Loaded?

104
00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.954
It means that since there are things in the backseat,

105
00:06:36.954 --> 00:06:38.854
it's a bit cluttered, isn't it?

106
00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:41.054
By the way,

107
00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:42.654
tell me, will you?

108
00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:44.154
What?

109
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.754
How did you know

110
00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:47.854
that we didn't have money?

111
00:06:47.854 --> 00:06:51.454
She probably heard me talking on the phone, I think.

112
00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:54.054
About me saying that I lost my wallet.

113
00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:57.654
Do you think a person who is driving can accurately hear

114
00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.754
what someone's saying on the side of the road?

115
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:04.854
It's understandable if they stopped after overtaking us,

116
00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:07.554
but you stopped before overtaking us, didn't you?

117
00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:10.654
I stopped the car,

118
00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:15.054
because I saw you not boarding the bus despite it coming.

119
00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:17.154
And you're saying that

120
00:07:17.154 --> 00:07:20.054
you heard what was said when you stopped the car?

121
00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:22.154
No, when I stopped,

122
00:07:22.154 --> 00:07:26.754
the stain on the chest of that old man caught my eye.

123
00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:30.354
I spilled coke here, you see.

124
00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:34.854
You spilled it with your seatbelt fastened, didn't you?

125
00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:37.354
Since there aren't any stains in the middle.

126
00:07:37.354 --> 00:07:40.654
Moreover, you spilled it just a while ago.

127
00:07:40.654 --> 00:07:43.954
No one would ever go out with stained clothes, you see.

128
00:07:43.954 --> 00:07:45.454
Right...

129
00:07:45.454 --> 00:07:49.254
Which means that you were driving till just a while ago.

130
00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:52.754
Yet, there was no car near you.

131
00:07:52.754 --> 00:07:55.154
And, when I bought canned coffee

132
00:07:55.154 --> 00:07:56.854
at a vending machine alongside the road,

133
00:07:56.854 --> 00:08:00.954
considering that I saw a tow truck pulling a car along back then.

134
00:08:00.954 --> 00:08:03.154
I figured that maybe you had car trouble,

135
00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:04.954
called a tow truck and had it moved.

136
00:08:04.954 --> 00:08:08.254
Then, you had them drive you over to the bus stop,

137
00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.754
but you realized that you had lost your wallet,

138
00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:14.954
so even if you wanted to ride the bus, you couldn't.

139
00:08:14.954 --> 00:08:16.954
Exactly.

140
00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.754
Just as I thought.

141
00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:23.054
So, is it okay for me to start off now, little lady?

142
00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:25.154
Yes.

143
00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.354
Quite a bit of traffic.

144
00:08:44.354 --> 00:08:46.854
There seems to have been an accident a little beyond.

145
00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:48.654
You can sleep if you like, until we get to where we're going.

146
00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.554
Thank you.

147
00:08:50.554 --> 00:08:53.454
By the way, where in Tokyo is your home?

148
00:08:53.454 --> 00:08:56.554
Beikacho 2-chome.

149
00:08:56.554 --> 00:08:59.154
Beikacho... what a coincidence.

150
00:08:59.154 --> 00:09:00.354
Coincidence?

151
00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:03.354
We happen to be headed there too.

152
00:09:03.354 --> 00:09:06.854
To the Mouri Detective Agency at Beikacho 5-chome.

153
00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:10.254
Oh! Is that so?

154
00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:12.154
We happen to be an acquaintance of his...

155
00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:18.454
I'm a bit sleepy.

156
00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:21.654
Let's take a snooze while we can, gramps.

157
00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:23.454
Yeah.

158
00:09:23.454 --> 00:09:24.954
Wake us up when we get there, okay?

159
00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:26.354
Okay.

160
00:09:26.354 --> 00:09:28.554
What's the matter, Ai?

161
00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:31.254
These people are strange.

162
00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:32.354
You saw his face, didn't you?

163
00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:34.554
The guy in the passenger's seat.

164
00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:38.354
Yeah... he does have a large scar,

165
00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:40.254
and looks sort of frightening,

166
00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.654
but I don't see why that would make him worthy of suspicion.

167
00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:44.254
Haven't you notice?

168
00:09:44.254 --> 00:09:46.054
The back rest of the driver's seat.

169
00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.554
There's one there.

170
00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:54.454
And two on the left door of this backseat.

171
00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:56.454
These are probably bullet traces.

172
00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:57.654
What?

173
00:09:57.654 --> 00:10:01.354
They may have thought it's been cleanly wiped off,

174
00:10:01.354 --> 00:10:04.154
but there are traces of blood stains

175
00:10:04.154 --> 00:10:05.654
left on the seam of the seat.

176
00:10:05.654 --> 00:10:07.154
What?

177
00:10:07.154 --> 00:10:08.954
Is anything the matter?

178
00:10:08.954 --> 00:10:10.054
No...

179
00:10:10.054 --> 00:10:12.754
Gramps talking in his sleep is so noisy.

180
00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:13.854
I see.

181
00:10:15.954 --> 00:10:19.954
So, let's pretend to be asleep for a while and check things out.

182
00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.854
About who these two are

183
00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:26.854
and why on earth they're going to the Mouri Detective Agency.

184
00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:32.354
What is it?

185
00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:35.354
It seems that we've got additional load while I was asleep.

186
00:10:35.354 --> 00:10:37.554
I picked them up part way.

187
00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:40.354
They seem to be acquaintances of Detective Mouri.

188
00:10:41.854 --> 00:10:43.854
That sure is convenient...

189
00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:46.454
we don't have to go through the trouble of looking for his place then.

190
00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:49.554
By the way, what do you think of that brat?

191
00:10:49.554 --> 00:10:51.354
What brat?

192
00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:53.254
That boy called Conan Edogawa

193
00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:55.654
that's hanging around Kogoro Mouri.

194
00:10:57.154 --> 00:10:58.654
What do I think?

195
00:10:58.654 --> 00:11:02.654
Well, I think he's pretty bright for a kid his age.

196
00:11:02.654 --> 00:11:04.054
The way I see it,

197
00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:07.654
I think it's that brat that's got everything under control.

198
00:11:07.654 --> 00:11:10.854
That brat is sure some monster.

199
00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:13.954
Well, we brought along a lot of gifts for him too,

200
00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:16.554
and if we give him a sweet pat,

201
00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:18.754
I'm sure he'll sing us a tune or two.

202
00:11:18.754 --> 00:11:21.554
I wonder though, if that will do the trick?

203
00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:24.854
Half killing is enough.

204
00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:25.854
Half...

205
00:11:25.854 --> 00:11:27.054
Half killing?

206
00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:29.454
It's a bit early yet, isn't it?

207
00:11:29.454 --> 00:11:32.754
We've still got a little more to go...

208
00:11:32.754 --> 00:11:35.254
before we kill them all off.

209
00:11:38.354 --> 00:11:40.454
I'm really looking forward to it.

210
00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:45.954
I'm sure my half killing will be delightful.

211
00:11:45.954 --> 00:11:50.654
It's not the usual half killing you see around.

212
00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:03.435
I'm looking forward to it.

213
00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:07.035
I'm sure it'll delight him to tears.

214
00:12:07.035 --> 00:12:09.035
My half killing after all

215
00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:13.035
is not the usual you see around.

216
00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.135
Oh, you got up?

217
00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:19.035
Yes.

218
00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:22.435
Did you hear what we were talking about just now?

219
00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:23.535
What you were saying?

220
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:26.335
I got up because gramps snoring was too noisy.

221
00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:28.635
Were you talking about some thing

222
00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:30.135
you didn't want anyone to hear about?

223
00:12:30.135 --> 00:12:33.235
No. It's fine if you didn't hear anything.

224
00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:36.235
Boy, this traffic jam is so annoying.

225
00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:38.935
Despite already being in Tokyo.

226
00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:39.935
Would you like to take a break at a drive-in

227
00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:42.035
and have tea or something then?

228
00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:44.935
Maybe the traffic will start moving more smoothly after we rest a while.

229
00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:46.535
I'd like to hear about your connection

230
00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:48.735
with the Mouri Detective Agency too, besides.

231
00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.035
Huh?

232
00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:54.035
But, it's only if you two are not in a rush.

233
00:12:54.035 --> 00:12:57.935
If you want to get home that fast,

234
00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:00.235
get off the car and fly home on your own.

235
00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:02.935
Fly... how?

236
00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:09.235
Okay, let's take a break at the drive-in then.

237
00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:11.135
Will you look at the map for me, then?

238
00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:13.235
It's in the dashboard.

239
00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:14.335
Okay.

240
00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:19.035
A gun?

241
00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:25.135
"Mouri Detective Agency"

242
00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:26.335
What?

243
00:13:26.335 --> 00:13:29.935
You hitchhiked and got on the car of bad guys?

244
00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:32.635
Yes, a twosome, a man and a woman.

245
00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:35.135
It seems they want to get information

246
00:13:35.135 --> 00:13:36.835
out of Detective Mouri and you.

247
00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:39.335
Are they people from the Black Organization?

248
00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:42.835
I wonder... I don't smell anything like that,

249
00:13:42.835 --> 00:13:44.735
but they're armed with a gun.

250
00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:47.135
Are you still with them?

251
00:13:47.135 --> 00:13:50.535
Yes, Doc is talking with them now.

252
00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:52.535
I pretended to go to the restroom

253
00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:54.335
and am talking to you over the cell.

254
00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:56.035
Is Doc okay, or what?

255
00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.035
No need to worry.

256
00:13:59.635 --> 00:14:03.235
is that we asked you to look for a cat for us.

257
00:14:03.235 --> 00:14:04.935
No, I didn't mean that!

258
00:14:04.935 --> 00:14:06.535
If they're dangerous guys,

259
00:14:06.535 --> 00:14:07.735
I think you should get out of there as soon as possible!

260
00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:09.035
Don't be silly.

261
00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:13.135
They're headed that way ready to half kill you.

262
00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:15.135
We can't just let that happen, can we?

263
00:14:15.135 --> 00:14:16.935
Half kill?

264
00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:19.035
That's what the man said.

265
00:14:19.035 --> 00:14:20.935
It's enough to just half kill them.

266
00:14:20.935 --> 00:14:23.535
That killing them all off should be put off yet.

267
00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:25.535
Killing everybody off?

268
00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:28.335
In other words, they going to half kill you all

269
00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:30.235
and get whatever information they want from you,

270
00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:33.335
then kill us all off, right?

271
00:14:33.335 --> 00:14:36.635
Hey, are you sure that they aren't from the Black Organization?

272
00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:40.435
Well, I can't say for sure just yet.

273
00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:42.435
And if that thing that they want to hear from you is about me,

274
00:14:42.435 --> 00:14:45.535
the whereabouts of the one who betrayed the Organization,

275
00:14:45.535 --> 00:14:47.135
everything will fall in place.

276
00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:49.835
If you're at that drive-in,

277
00:14:49.835 --> 00:14:51.035
I can speed over on my skateboard...

278
00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:54.535
In 30 minutes.

279
00:14:54.535 --> 00:14:57.835
Please hold them in place somehow until I get there.

280
00:14:57.835 --> 00:14:59.935
Hold them in place, how?

281
00:14:59.935 --> 00:15:03.535
Just say something like you coincidentally ran into an acquaintance

282
00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:05.435
who's going back to Tokyo from Chiba

283
00:15:05.435 --> 00:15:07.235
and that you're going to have that person drive you home.

284
00:15:09.835 --> 00:15:11.835
Chiba?

285
00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:14.635
We're at a drive-in that's on our back

286
00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:16.135
from Yamanashi to Tokyo, you know?

287
00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:18.235
They'll figure out that it's a lie right away.

288
00:15:18.235 --> 00:15:19.635
If they found out you lied,

289
00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:21.035
they'll think that something happened

290
00:15:21.035 --> 00:15:22.535
and look for you guys, won't they?

291
00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:24.935
I see, so you want us to hide somewhere

292
00:15:24.935 --> 00:15:27.435
in the drive-in till then.

293
00:15:27.435 --> 00:15:30.435
But, if they don't see through the lie...

294
00:15:30.435 --> 00:15:33.235
They'd be no problem.

295
00:15:33.235 --> 00:15:36.235
I'll call Officer Takagi and ask him to ambush them

296
00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:38.435
at the Detective Agency and arrest them.

297
00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:41.835
I'll tell him that they're armed with a gun and dangerous.

298
00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:44.835
I think I'd be handle the two

299
00:15:44.835 --> 00:15:46.535
with the tranquilizer gun and my soccer ball.

300
00:15:46.535 --> 00:15:48.735
But what after that?

301
00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:52.335
What if they're men from the Black Organization?

302
00:15:55.435 --> 00:16:00.035
On a car of a friend going from Chiba to Tokyo.

303
00:16:00.035 --> 00:16:01.235
Lucky you.

304
00:16:01.235 --> 00:16:02.735
Oh, yes.

305
00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:06.235
Thank you for giving us a lift all the way here.

306
00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:07.535
Goodbye.

307
00:16:11.335 --> 00:16:14.235
They're lying.

308
00:16:14.235 --> 00:16:16.935
Yes, but I wonder why?

309
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:20.635
They heard us talking about half killing.

310
00:16:20.635 --> 00:16:23.535
That we were talking about a while ago.

311
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:27.135
Just as you had hoped,

312
00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:29.835
the twosome figured out that it was a lie right away

313
00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:31.535
and are looking all over for us.

314
00:16:31.535 --> 00:16:34.135
And where are you two?

315
00:16:34.135 --> 00:16:36.535
For now, we're in the toilet.

316
00:16:36.535 --> 00:16:39.035
But, it's just a matter of time until they find us.

317
00:16:39.035 --> 00:16:42.535
It could be someone involved in a case that Pops handled

318
00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:45.635
and solved before that has a grudge against him too.

319
00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:48.135
Tell me what the two are like.

320
00:16:48.135 --> 00:16:51.135
The woman is wearing a knitted cap and wearing sunglasses.

321
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:54.035
Her bangs are divided to the right and left and over her forehead.

322
00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:57.335
The man is tanned and is unshaven.

323
00:16:57.335 --> 00:17:01.135
I saw that he had a big scar on his left eye.

324
00:17:01.135 --> 00:17:03.135
A large scar on his left eye?

325
00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:06.435
Well, he sure isn't someone straight.

326
00:17:06.435 --> 00:17:11.235
There was a gun in the dashboard of the car.

327
00:17:11.235 --> 00:17:13.935
In the car there are three bullet marks

328
00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:16.235
and traces of blood being wiped off.

329
00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:18.035
Did you notice anything else?

330
00:17:18.035 --> 00:17:20.035
What else could there be?

331
00:17:20.035 --> 00:17:22.035
Oh, that's right.

332
00:17:22.035 --> 00:17:24.535
They used strange language.

333
00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:25.635
Strange language?

334
00:17:25.635 --> 00:17:28.835
It's a bit cluttered, but please bear it,

335
00:17:28.835 --> 00:17:30.135
and if you want to get home that fast,

336
00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:33.035
get off the car and fly home on your own.

337
00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:35.835
Cluttered... fly?

338
00:17:35.835 --> 00:17:37.835
Maybe it's a code or something?

339
00:17:37.835 --> 00:17:40.135
At any rate, I'll be there in five minutes.

340
00:17:40.135 --> 00:17:41.135
So stay still over there till...

341
00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:43.035
Hey gramps, are you there?

342
00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:45.735
If there, answer me!

343
00:17:45.735 --> 00:17:47.635
It's occupied!

344
00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:50.135
I guess we don't have much of a chance.

345
00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.635
He's going around knocking on all the doors of the toilet.

346
00:17:52.635 --> 00:17:54.235
I'll be right out!

347
00:17:54.235 --> 00:17:55.635
What shall we do?

348
00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:56.835
Wait a second.

349
00:17:56.835 --> 00:17:59.235
The words cluttered and fly are...

350
00:17:59.235 --> 00:18:01.235
Conan?

351
00:18:01.235 --> 00:18:03.335
Half kill and kill them all...

352
00:18:03.335 --> 00:18:04.635
Conan?

353
00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:07.235
A large scar on his left eye...

354
00:18:09.635 --> 00:18:10.935
Hey, what's up?

355
00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:12.435
Here he comes.

356
00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:14.435
Answer me, I said!

357
00:18:14.435 --> 00:18:15.635
Conan.

358
00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:17.135
Don't worry.

359
00:18:17.135 --> 00:18:19.735
If you shout in an adult voice

360
00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:21.335
that you're using the toilet,

361
00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:23.635
I'm sure he'll leave right away.

362
00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.135
That man will probably be hesitant

363
00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:28.235
if he learns that a woman is inside.

364
00:18:28.235 --> 00:18:29.935
I guess so...

365
00:18:32.135 --> 00:18:35.535
I guess the gramps seems to be in here.

366
00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:40.735
How rude! Can't you see that I'm using the toilet?

367
00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:42.235
You lewd dirty rat!

368
00:18:45.835 --> 00:18:49.835
Oh, sorry...

369
00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:58.935
Wait. This is the men's room.

370
00:18:58.935 --> 00:19:00.435
I figured.

371
00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:02.935
Doc would never use the women's restroom.

372
00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:05.035
Figured...

373
00:19:05.035 --> 00:19:08.135
Maybe he figured out at hearing my voice just now.

374
00:19:08.135 --> 00:19:10.135
Isn't there a little window in the toilet

375
00:19:10.135 --> 00:19:11.635
where you can make it outside?

376
00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:17.935
There is...

377
00:19:17.935 --> 00:19:21.135
Then, get out of there with Doc.

378
00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:24.435
What after we get out?

379
00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:28.735
Well, when you get out of there, it's most likely that...

380
00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:30.835
The woman will be waiting

381
00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:32.635
and not long after her...

382
00:19:36.935 --> 00:19:39.135
I'm sure the man will come.

383
00:19:45.635 --> 00:19:47.935
Give in and get caught already.

384
00:19:47.935 --> 00:19:49.335
Give in?

385
00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:53.835
It'll be all right.

386
00:19:53.835 --> 00:19:55.335
These two are...

387
00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:56.735
police officers.

388
00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:01.635
Police officers...

389
00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:05.135
But, why are you wearing sunglasses?

390
00:20:05.135 --> 00:20:06.735
The thing is, the other day...

391
00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:08.235
"Yui Uehara, age 29" -a culprit I was escorting along

392
00:20:08.235 --> 00:20:10.735
"Yui Uehara, age 29" -punched me and I ended up with black and blue.

393
00:20:11.535 --> 00:20:14.935
You're lucky that all you got was a bruise.

394
00:20:14.935 --> 00:20:17.135
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -The shot that the guy

395
00:20:17.135 --> 00:20:18.235
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -fired skimmed pass my forehead,

396
00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:19.735
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -and this is how I ended up.

397
00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:48.235
"Mouri Detective Agency"

398
00:21:48.235 --> 00:21:50.835
Well, with that scar and those sunglasses,

399
00:21:50.835 --> 00:21:53.535
it can't be helped that they thought you were bad guys.

400
00:21:53.535 --> 00:21:56.935
Just the other day I arrested a guy,

401
00:21:56.935 --> 00:21:58.635
but the instant I got him in the car,

402
00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:01.535
he fired randomly with the gun he had on him.

403
00:22:01.535 --> 00:22:02.835
And when we pinned him down to arrest him,

404
00:22:02.835 --> 00:22:04.735
I got this bruise on my right eyes

405
00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:07.535
and Kan-chan hurt his forehead.

406
00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.635
The bullet traces and blood stain in the car

407
00:22:09.635 --> 00:22:11.935
were made back then.

408
00:22:11.935 --> 00:22:15.035
But, amazing how you figured out it was us.

409
00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:16.835
Tsumoi in Nagano dialect means cluttered

410
00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:20.135
and fly means to run home.

411
00:22:20.135 --> 00:22:22.935
Besides, Inspector Yamato is the only one

412
00:22:22.935 --> 00:22:24.535
at the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

413
00:22:24.535 --> 00:22:25.835
who knows us well

414
00:22:25.835 --> 00:22:27.535
and has a big scar on his left eye.

415
00:22:27.535 --> 00:22:30.535
But, I think that the joke was carried too far this time.

416
00:22:30.535 --> 00:22:33.635
Saying things like half killing and kill them all.

417
00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:36.435
That's why we thought you mistook us

418
00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:38.635
for being dangerous people and fled.

419
00:22:38.635 --> 00:22:39.635
So, we came to look for you,

420
00:22:39.635 --> 00:22:43.535
thinking that you fled despite having no cash on you.

421
00:22:43.535 --> 00:22:44.735
Mistook you?

422
00:22:47.035 --> 00:22:48.735
The phrase half killing means...

423
00:22:52.535 --> 00:22:55.135
this rice cake.

424
00:22:55.135 --> 00:22:57.235
It looks so good!

425
00:22:57.235 --> 00:23:00.435
Yes, Kan-chan's rice cake is the best

426
00:23:00.435 --> 00:23:01.635
because his grandmother taught him how to make it.

427
00:23:03.435 --> 00:23:07.135
And why is the Bota rice cake called half killing?

428
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:08.835
It's called half killing

429
00:23:08.835 --> 00:23:11.935
because only half of the mocha rice is smashed to make it.

430
00:23:11.935 --> 00:23:14.235
By the way, when all the mochi rice is smashed,

431
00:23:14.235 --> 00:23:15.735
it's called killing all.

432
00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:19.935
In other words, killing them all off can be put off till later means,

433
00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:23.335
New Year's when mochi is eaten is still sometime away, right?

434
00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:24.535
Exactly.

435
00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:27.935
Is that how people in Nagano refer to it?

436
00:23:27.935 --> 00:23:32.535
No, Kan-chan after hearing that old folklore from his grandmother,

437
00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:35.235
is using it that way in his own way.

438
00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:38.135
Kan-chan loves stimulating trouble toned words, you see.

439
00:23:38.135 --> 00:23:41.335
And what happened in Nagano?

440
00:23:41.335 --> 00:23:43.735
I'm sure you didn't come here

441
00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:45.035
just to bring us the mochi, did you?

442
00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:49.235
Oh, well, there's something we just can't solve.

443
00:23:49.235 --> 00:23:52.435
So, we wanted you to help us out.

444
00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:56.835
The mystery about the blood smeared Red Wall.

445
00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.735
What?

446
00:23:58.735 --> 00:24:02.735
The blood smeared...

447
00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:05.835
mystery of the Red Wall?

448
00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:09.935
"Next Episode" -The hopeless...

449
00:24:09.935 --> 00:24:12.435
House of Death.

450
00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:16.535
It seems that Kan is not relying on Detective Mouri,

451
00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:19.435
but rather you.

452
00:24:19.435 --> 00:24:22.835
So, this is the Red Wall.

453
00:24:22.835 --> 00:24:26.735
Hey, don't tell me that this is...

454
00:24:26.735 --> 00:24:28.135
Human blood?

455
00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:30.035
What did you come here for?

456
00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:31.835
Komei!

457
00:24:31.835 --> 00:24:33.335
Next Conan,

458
00:24:33.335 --> 00:24:37.226
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Three Favors)"

459
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.830
Next Conan's Hint:

460
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.930
"Red spray"

461
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.830
The title of the next episode is sure disturbing.

462
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.830
Your stomach sure needs to get rid of disturbing fat too.

463
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.930
I'm that fat?
