"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.740
Dad was suddenly invited to a party.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.040
That's why Pops' Sunday suit is hanging outside.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.440
Right. And this is done.

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.140
What is wrong?

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.640
I'd like to give Shinichi a better tie.

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.040
What're you blushing for, Conan?

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.140
Well...

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.540
Where's Pops?

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.140
At the barber.

11
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.640
He's late, isn't he?

12
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.940
I'll go get him then.

13
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.640
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.840
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.440
What is the secret of the strange eye-witness

16
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.240
who was at the site, but didn't see what happened?

17
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:06.878
Hold it!

24
00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:10.178
Wait up!

25
00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:15.978
I'm closing already.

26
00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:18.478
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

27
00:03:22.778 --> 00:03:25.078
There's another customer here too.

28
00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:26.878
Please. If you do me first,

29
00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:28.778
I promise to patronize you shop from here on.

30
00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:30.078
All right.

31
00:03:30.078 --> 00:03:33.278
Since he's fast asleep, I'll do you first.

32
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:34.678
Thanks.

33
00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:38.078
Hot, hot!

34
00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:39.478
One moment please.

35
00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:46.578
I wonder what kind of dishes are going to be served at today's party?

36
00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:48.978
French cuisine would be just great.

37
00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:52.678
Chinese food's not bad either,

38
00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:55.078
shark's fin and Peking duck.

39
00:03:56.978 --> 00:04:01.378
It's the shuttle bus of the swimming school that opened recently.

40
00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:06.278
Hei. It's a noisy like always.

41
00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:08.778
It's so noisy.

42
00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:12.978
I'll sue them for disturbing the public. Darn!

43
00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:17.878
I wish they'd hurry and go somewhere else.

44
00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:20.878
Cut out the noise, cut out the noise. Darn.

45
00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:26.778
Thank God...

46
00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:31.478
What?

47
00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:32.678
What is it?

48
00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:41.578
He's dead.

49
00:04:41.578 --> 00:04:43.478
Ebihara?

50
00:04:45.878 --> 00:04:47.778
Pops!

51
00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.278
You weren't at the usual shop,

52
00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:50.678
so I came searching for you!

53
00:04:50.678 --> 00:04:53.578
Conan! Didn't you see anyone suspicious?

54
00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:55.278
No, I didn't.

55
00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.078
Is anything wrong?

56
00:04:57.078 --> 00:04:58.478
Please call the police.

57
00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:01.078
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:01.078 --> 00:05:02.478
-Pops. -Hey! Conan.

59
00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:04.478
Children out...

60
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:05.578
This is...

61
00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:09.178
Hey.

62
00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.978
Okay. I'm going to fly this one more time.

63
00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:16.578
Hey, Genta!

64
00:05:16.578 --> 00:05:18.078
Conan.

65
00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:20.378
Didn't anyone come out of here?

66
00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:22.878
Nobody came out!

67
00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:24.978
Is anything wrong?

68
00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:29.278
I wonder if something happened?

69
00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:34.478
Darn!

70
00:05:34.478 --> 00:05:36.878
A murder was committed right behind me.

71
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.178
Audacious dare-devil.

72
00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:40.878
Who on earth are you?

73
00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:44.578
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

74
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.078
You mean that famous...

75
00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.878
Exactly.

76
00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:51.578
Conan, is it another case?

77
00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:55.378
Hey, children aren't allowed inside!

78
00:05:55.378 --> 00:05:56.778
That goes for you too.

79
00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:58.578
Yes, you're right.

80
00:06:00.078 --> 00:06:03.378
And, when I turned to look surprised at the loud noise,

81
00:06:03.378 --> 00:06:06.678
the owner of this shop, Mr. Ebihara was lying on the floor.

82
00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:08.878
He was already dead.

83
00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:10.278
I see.

84
00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:14.778
Your ears heard every detail of what happened, right?

85
00:06:14.778 --> 00:06:16.578
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:19.378
So, what you heard was this fall?

87
00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:20.778
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:23.378
It was on the cash register counter.

89
00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:24.578
It probably fell

90
00:06:24.578 --> 00:06:28.178
when Mr. Ebihara's arm touched it as he collapsed.

91
00:06:28.178 --> 00:06:29.478
I see.

92
00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:36.578
Why is only that dart on the ground such a distance away?

93
00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:38.278
Mr. Noda, was it?

94
00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:40.778
You say you were fast asleep

95
00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:43.278
when Mr. Mouri walked in here?

96
00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.278
"Masao Noda (43)" -Yes, sir...

97
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:48.978
That's why I didn't notice Mr. Mouri coming here at all.

98
00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:51.578
At around what time did you come here?

99
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:55.178
Well... since I was looking around or a shop that was opened

100
00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:57.378
that I'm not sure what time it was.

101
00:06:57.378 --> 00:06:59.478
But, the incident occurred

102
00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:02.378
only several minutes after I entered the shop.

103
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.278
We got report of the incident by phone

104
00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.178
at the police at around 6:36 pm,

105
00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:11.978
so Mr. Mouri would've entered the shop around 6:30 pm.

106
00:07:11.978 --> 00:07:14.978
Around what time did you come?

107
00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:17.978
At around 6:20 pm.

108
00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:20.778
Only, because of daily exhaustion,

109
00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:24.178
I fell asleep as soon as I sat in the chair.

110
00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:28.578
And, are you sure that no one went in or out

111
00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:30.878
of this shop on the day the incident occurred?

112
00:07:30.878 --> 00:07:32.178
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:33.378
Just about that time,

114
00:07:33.378 --> 00:07:37.378
the shuttle bus of the swimming school was in front of the shop.

115
00:07:37.378 --> 00:07:39.578
I think it would be impossible for anyone to go in and out of the shop

116
00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:41.178
without being seen by anyone.

117
00:07:41.178 --> 00:07:44.478
I didn't seen anybody come out of the shop too.

118
00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:47.378
There's no one who went out of the back door either?

119
00:07:47.378 --> 00:07:49.978
No. Nobody did.

120
00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:54.078
We were playing all the while at the vacant lot in back.

121
00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:56.678
The culprit probably threw the dart

122
00:07:56.678 --> 00:08:00.078
from outside the shop and killed Mr. Ebihara.

123
00:08:00.078 --> 00:08:01.478
From outside?

124
00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:04.078
Just at that time the shuttle bus of the swimming school

125
00:08:04.078 --> 00:08:07.878
was playing music so loud that it was nothing but noise.

126
00:08:07.878 --> 00:08:11.978
I'm sure the owner opened the window to complain.

127
00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:13.278
So, the culprit took this opportunity

128
00:08:13.278 --> 00:08:16.278
to throw the dart at him.

129
00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:19.578
Right. The culprit was probably hiding

130
00:08:19.578 --> 00:08:21.478
in the alley in front of the shop.

131
00:08:21.478 --> 00:08:24.178
From the alley to here is about 4 m,

132
00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:27.078
so a dart would make its mark considering the distance.

133
00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:30.778
It seems that poison was smeared on the tip of the dart.

134
00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:35.178
I wonder why Mr. Ebihara was wearing a wig?

135
00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:39.378
It's true that he doesn't look like he needs a wig.

136
00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:40.978
What do you think, Mr. Noda?

137
00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:42.278
I wonder...

138
00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:47.078
A reason for wearing a wig...

139
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.578
Mr. Ebihara is wearing a strange sweatshirt, isn't he?

140
00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:56.278
That's a sweatshirt that the members of the darts bar

141
00:08:56.278 --> 00:08:58.678
Darts Lovers Club that was established in the neighborhood wore.

142
00:08:58.678 --> 00:09:01.578
Darts Lover Club?

143
00:09:01.578 --> 00:09:04.478
-Are you a member too? -Yes, sir.

144
00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:08.678
One who patronizes the darts bar is killed with a dart.

145
00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:10.178
It could be that the culprit is someone

146
00:09:10.178 --> 00:09:13.278
who also frequents the darts bar.

147
00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:20.078
They both frequent the darts bar.

148
00:09:20.078 --> 00:09:22.078
"Nozomu Shimazaki (28)" -Mr. Nozomu Shimazaki who works

149
00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:25.078
for a linen service company,

150
00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:28.478
"Tatsutaro Koike (45)" -and Mr. Tatsutaro Koike who works

151
00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:30.278
at a pharmacy in the neighborhood.

152
00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.978
I hear that you got into an argument

153
00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:35.678
with Mr. Ebihara at the darts bar last night.

154
00:09:35.678 --> 00:09:38.178
No...

155
00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:39.478
It's because that old man Ebihara

156
00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:42.278
started saying this and that's that weren't true.

157
00:09:42.278 --> 00:09:44.478
What kind of this and that's?

158
00:09:44.478 --> 00:09:45.678
Well...

159
00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:48.878
Mr. Ebihara started accusing

160
00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:50.978
Mr. Shimazaki of embezzling money from the company,

161
00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:53.578
so Mr. Shimazaki got angry and grabbed him by the neck,

162
00:09:53.578 --> 00:09:57.078
so all I did was go in between them to stop them.

163
00:09:57.078 --> 00:09:59.478
You gotta be joking! You went pale too,

164
00:09:59.478 --> 00:10:03.478
when he accused you of making up for the red of your store

165
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.878
by putting goods on the black market.

166
00:10:04.878 --> 00:10:06.778
No way...

167
00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:13.278
Noda, you're still coughing?

168
00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:15.178
Why aren't you wearing a mask?

169
00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:17.078
I must've dropped it somewhere.

170
00:10:17.078 --> 00:10:20.778
Mr. Noda, although you're standing there like this has nothing to with you,

171
00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:23.978
but you borrowed money from old man Ebihara too, didn't you?

172
00:10:23.978 --> 00:10:28.778
Right, Ebihara said that he lent you money to manage your shop.

173
00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:30.278
Well, how about it?

174
00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:32.178
It's true I borrowed money from him,

175
00:10:32.178 --> 00:10:34.278
but it wasn't all that much.

176
00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:35.478
I wonder about that.

177
00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:38.878
You were at the barbershop on the day of the incident, weren't you?

178
00:10:38.878 --> 00:10:40.878
Doesn't that make you really suspicious?

179
00:10:40.878 --> 00:10:44.978
No, Mr. Noda was sitting in the chair

180
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:48.178
next to mine at the time Mr. Ebihara was murdered.

181
00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:49.978
He couldn't have committed the murder.

182
00:10:49.978 --> 00:10:52.678
Who are you? Acting like some big shot.

183
00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:55.778
I'm the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

184
00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:58.578
-What? -What? The Sleeping Kogoro.

185
00:10:58.578 --> 00:11:02.278
By the way, where were you two

186
00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:03.978
at around 6:30 pm in the evening?

187
00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:05.578
Mr. Koike, first.

188
00:11:05.578 --> 00:11:07.678
I was at the shop.

189
00:11:07.678 --> 00:11:10.678
Do you have anyone that will testify that for you?

190
00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:12.478
I think not.

191
00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:14.078
There were no customers

192
00:11:14.078 --> 00:11:17.578
and my wife is the kitchen preparing dinner.

193
00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:19.478
So no one else?

194
00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:23.178
But, I didn't do it. Please believe me.

195
00:11:23.178 --> 00:11:25.378
How about you, Mr. Shimazaki?

196
00:11:25.378 --> 00:11:26.878
At about 6:30 pm

197
00:11:26.878 --> 00:11:29.078
I was still in the midst of making deliveries.

198
00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:31.678
That's right, I stopped over at a service station.

199
00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:33.678
A service station?

200
00:11:33.678 --> 00:11:36.778
Then, the employee there would remember you if we want to confirm it?

201
00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:39.378
No, it was a self-service gas station

202
00:11:39.378 --> 00:11:40.978
so I didn't see any employee.

203
00:11:40.978 --> 00:11:43.178
But, I have the receipt.

204
00:11:45.678 --> 00:11:48.078
6:24 pm.

205
00:11:48.078 --> 00:11:50.878
Even if I were to come here from that service station at top speed,

206
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:52.978
it would take 30 minutes.

207
00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:55.278
I saw that man a while ago.

208
00:11:55.278 --> 00:11:56.878
Where did you see him?

209
00:11:56.878 --> 00:11:58.478
In front of this shop.

210
00:11:58.478 --> 00:12:01.678
He was just about to come out of the shop.

211
00:12:01.678 --> 00:12:04.078
What time was that?

212
00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:05.478
In the evening.

213
00:12:05.478 --> 00:12:10.378
Let's see, I saw the clock through the window of the shop.

214
00:12:10.378 --> 00:12:12.378
It was 5:50 pm.

215
00:12:12.378 --> 00:12:14.378
That clock...

216
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:18.678
4:15 pm?

217
00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:21.578
What? 7:45 pm?

218
00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:26.678
That clock is a mirror image.

219
00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:28.978
So that the customers can see what time it is through the mirror.

220
00:12:28.978 --> 00:12:30.478
I see.

221
00:12:30.478 --> 00:12:32.578
So, he finally got it.

222
00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:34.878
It used to be an ordinary clock until some time ago, right?

223
00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:37.278
When did you deliver it to him?

224
00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:39.178
Oh, yeah, last night.

225
00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:42.978
Which means that the time Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki,

226
00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:46.878
was not at 5:50 pm, but rather, 6:10 pm.

227
00:12:46.878 --> 00:12:49.678
If he left here at 6:10 pm,

228
00:12:49.678 --> 00:12:53.178
he couldn't have made it to the service station by 6:24 pm.

229
00:12:53.178 --> 00:12:58.078
Well, I did come here to retrieve towels.

230
00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:01.578
And, I got into an argument with him about the night before,

231
00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:03.078
but I still had deliveries to make,

232
00:13:03.078 --> 00:13:05.378
so I left right away.

233
00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:08.078
Just as she says, it was before 6:00 pm.

234
00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:11.778
So, since that clock is a mirror image clock,

235
00:13:11.778 --> 00:13:13.578
it was 6:10 pm.

236
00:13:13.578 --> 00:13:16.578
Wrong. It was before 6:00 pm.

237
00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:20.678
Mr. Shimazaki, you killed Mr. Ebihara

238
00:13:20.678 --> 00:13:22.578
because he accused you of embezzlement.

239
00:13:22.578 --> 00:13:24.278
Don't be ridiculous.

240
00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:27.078
After leaving the shop, you hid yourself in the alley

241
00:13:27.078 --> 00:13:29.578
and killed Mr. Ebihara when he opened the window.

242
00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:30.978
I could never do it, not with my skill.

243
00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:35.578
I'm the worst darts player in the Darts Lovers Club.

244
00:13:35.578 --> 00:13:39.178
Right, you could do it, Mr. Koike.

245
00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:40.978
What're you talking about?

246
00:13:40.978 --> 00:13:43.678
You're the best player among all of us!

247
00:13:43.678 --> 00:13:46.578
There was poison smeared on the dart used as a murder weapon!

248
00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:48.278
Since Mr. Koike is a pharmacist,

249
00:13:48.278 --> 00:13:51.778
he could mix and make poison, couldn't he?

250
00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:54.078
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:57.378
Mr. Koike, you're the killer!

252
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:58.978
No!

253
00:13:58.978 --> 00:14:00.778
Which one's the killer?

254
00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:02.078
If you're a famed detective,

255
00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:05.478
I wish you would clarify who it is.

256
00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:08.478
Talk about unreliability.

257
00:14:08.478 --> 00:14:10.578
You guys get out of here!

258
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:14.578
Shoots, miser!

259
00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:17.878
We're also making important testimonies, and yet!

260
00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:19.578
Right! Right!

261
00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:25.978
If the culprit got a poisoned dart ready,

262
00:14:25.978 --> 00:14:29.278
it's obviously a planned crime.

263
00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:33.278
If so, would the culprit throw the dart from this far?

264
00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:40.678
The clock is not in view from the window.

265
00:14:40.678 --> 00:14:43.878
Ayumi, where did you see the clock from?

266
00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:47.778
Let's see.

267
00:14:47.778 --> 00:14:49.378
Around here.

268
00:14:49.378 --> 00:14:51.078
That's strange,

269
00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.978
I can't see the clock.

270
00:14:52.978 --> 00:14:55.478
But I did see it a while ago.

271
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:58.778
The clock was moved? But, why?

272
00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:06.878
I see.

273
00:15:06.878 --> 00:15:08.278
That's what it was.

274
00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:10.778
I got it.

275
00:15:10.778 --> 00:15:13.278
He's the culprit.

276
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.100
Mr. Shimazaki and Mr. Koike,

277
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.700
please come to the police station with me

278
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.900
and tell us about the details.

279
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.400
No.

280
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.900
Please wait.

281
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.700
I will solve this case right here and now.

282
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.600
What?

283
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.200
Are you saying that you've figured out the truth of the case?

284
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.000
The fact is that the culprit

285
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.600
was at the shop even before I got here.

286
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.300
And, he's still here.

287
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.600
What?

288
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.000
Yes, the culprit is...

289
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.800
Mr. Noda,

290
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.000
it's you.

291
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.900
Mr. Noda, you...

292
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.700
Come on, Mr. Mouri.

293
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.600
Back then, I was sitting in the chair next to you.

294
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.500
When you heard something fall and turned to look,

295
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.000
Mr. Noda also just got up from his chair, didn't he?

296
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Mr. Ebihara wasn't killed when that sound was heard.

297
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.500
The fact is, he was already killed when I got here.

298
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.100
-What? -Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.300
You met Mr. Ebihara when you came here, didn't you?

300
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.400
Yes, I met a person who had disheveled hair,

301
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.700
wearing a mask and wearing a Darts Lovers Club sweatshirt.

302
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.800
That was Ebihara.

303
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.100
No, that was you in disguise.

304
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.500
Disguise?

305
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.800
You quickly put on a wig and mask so as not to be recognized

306
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.900
because I suddenly came bursting in here.

307
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.000
Mr. Noda, you still actually have the mask with you, don't you?

308
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.100
Then, where was Mr. Ebihara's dead body?

309
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.100
On the chair next to me.

310
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.500
An apron was put on him

311
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.600
and he had a steamed towel on his face.

312
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.300
What?

313
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.300
Mr. Noda, after killing Mr. Ebihara in this shop,

314
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.600
you were planning to walk out of this shop

315
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.200
as if nothing happened.

316
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.800
However, I happened to come in just then.

317
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.600
I was lead to believe that you were the owner

318
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.900
because of your sudden disguise.

319
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.000
Therefore, you put a steamed towel

320
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.200
on my face to cover my eyes

321
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.700
and tried to flee out the backdoor.

322
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.700
But, children were playing in the vacant lot in back,

323
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.400
so you couldn't flee.

324
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.000
You couldn't go out from the front either

325
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.600
because there were people there too.

326
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.200
That's when the swimming school shuttle bus came by.

327
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.000
A shuttle bus?

328
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.800
With the loud music that was playing from the bus,

329
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.000
you hit upon an idea.

330
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.600
You decided to change places with the dead body and yourself

331
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.100
using this noise to your advantage.

332
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.800
In the midst of that loud noise

333
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.600
most other sounds would be erased.

334
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.400
You quickly lay the body down in front of the counter

335
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.600
and sat yourself down in the chair in place of it.

336
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.100
Then, how did he drop the things

337
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.800
that were on the counter?

338
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.200
He threw a dart.

339
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.600
There's a dart on the ground below the window.

340
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.800
I see.

341
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.500
Then, you pretended to wake up surprised by the loud noised

342
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.000
and along with me, became the first to discover the body.

343
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.100
Is that so.

344
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.900
But, Mr. Mouri,

345
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.900
why did Mr. Noda go out of his way

346
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.900
to put the dead body in the chair?

347
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.500
He didn't know you were coming, did he?

348
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.100
Mr. Ebihara was killed when he was sitting in the chair.

349
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.600
Why would the owner of a barber shop sit in the chair?

350
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.500
He was confirming the position of the clock.

351
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.500
The position of the clock?

352
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.200
That clock was brought here today

353
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.000
before the murder was committed.

354
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.300
I saw it from outside just a while ago...

355
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.100
Conan, when did you get here?

356
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.300
But, I couldn't see it from the window.

357
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.000
You couldn't see it?

358
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.600
Just what do you mean?

359
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.800
Maybe the clock was originally somewhere around there?

360
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.800
Yeah, that's right.

361
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.900
It was over there before.

362
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.800
If it's from that position you can see it, right?

363
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.100
When Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki,

364
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.600
a normal clock was still hung there.

365
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.400
Then, Mr. Noda came along later

366
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.100
and hung a mirror display clock there.

367
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.500
And, in order to check the position,

368
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.800
Mr. Ebihara sat in the chair.

369
00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.400
Then, the culprit pinned him down from behind

370
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.500
and poked the dart into his chest.

371
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500
Then, the culprit placed a steamed towel on his face

372
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.700
and placed an apron on top of him.

373
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.900
He did so, that if in case someone were to look into the shop,

374
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.700
it would just look like someone were waiting for a shave.

375
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.600
But, you just so happened to come

376
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.100
before the culprit could flee.

377
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.100
But, where is the original clock, then?

378
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.400
I found it in the shoe cabinet by the back door.

379
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.400
That's all baloney.

380
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.300
Do you have proof that the first person

381
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.700
you met was me in disguise, Mr. Mouri?

382
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.500
Mr. Noda, isn't what you're wearing under that shirt,

383
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.100
the sweatshirt of the darts lovers club?

384
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.600
Will you please take it off and show us all of it?

385
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.500
Please, will you?

386
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.700
All right.

387
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.600
Nothing's written on it.

388
00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.700
Too bad.

389
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.000
I won't fall for a childish trick like that.

390
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.900
Officer Takagi, take off Mr. Noda's shirt.

391
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.100
Quickly.

392
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.300
Yes, sir.

393
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.400
What do you think you're doing? Stop it.

394
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
Let me go.

395
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.400
He was wearing it back to front.

396
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400
He quickly changed it

397
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.500
while switching himself with the body.

398
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.200
No one other than the culprit has any reason to wear it backwards.

399
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.300
Noda, why did you...

400
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.700
The IOU that I wrote out to Ebihara

401
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.200
when I borrowed money from him

402
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.100
was handed over to a loan shark.

403
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.800
-What? -What?

404
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.500
Money collectors came every day demanding to get their money back,

405
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.700
that my wife had a neurotic breakdown.

406
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.500
Why'd Mr. Ebihara do something like that?

407
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.700
He was the one who originally was in debt.

408
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.900
But he sold me to them in order to get rid of his own debt.

409
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.300
No way.

410
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.800
I couldn't forgive him.

411
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.700
I just couldn't forgive him.

412
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.900
Darn, I thought we were feasting today.

413
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.000
You mean, he fell asleep right after solving the case?

414
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.300
Yes, fast asleep.

415
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.100
That's why he missed going to the party.

416
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.700
Ran! Give me another serving.

417
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.900
Too bad you missed out on the feast, pops.

418
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.500
How cute!

419
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.100
You all right.

420
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.400
Shigeko was taken by a man.

421
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.900
Taken?

422
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.900
The culprit may have taken a fancy to her,

423
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.100
but then he couldn't bottle up his desires anymore and took action.

424
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.900
As I thought...

425
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.900
A bird feather?

426
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.500
Why is it there?

427
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.100
