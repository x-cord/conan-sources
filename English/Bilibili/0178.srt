1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,040
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,840
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,740
The story takes a sharp turn.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,540
The secret of the Black Organization is coming to light.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,140
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,890
On the way back from school,

10
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,390
Haibara and I ran into Gin's car.

11
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,190
One of the Black Organization members.

12
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,390
I set a transmitter and wiretap in his car

13
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,590
and pursue him!

14
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,790
However, Gin destroyed the wiretap when he found them.

15
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,390
They have realized the existence of Haibara!

16
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,590
We found out about their murder plans via wiretap.

17
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,490
So we headed to a farewell party of a movie director

18
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,590
which are held at the Haido City Hotel.

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,490
During the slide show at that hall,

20
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,590
the chandelier falls off from the ceiling,

21
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,790
and falls on top of a politician named Nomiguchi and dies.

22
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,090
Moreover, Haibara was kidnapped by someone,

23
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,990
and was locked up in the wine cellar of the hotel!

24
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,990
Listen, Kudo. Listen very carefully.

25
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,290
The word "Apo" in the Apotoxin 4869

26
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,290
that shrunk our body,

27
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,590
which stands for apoptosis.

28
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,890
In other words, it means the death of a program.

29
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,490
Yes. The cells have a self-destruction structure

30
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,490
and is existing because of a signal that keeps that in check.

31
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,690
Hey, Haibara.

32
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,590
But, this drug not only guides apoptosis,

33
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,790
it also waits for the activation of trimorphism

34
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,090
and increases cell multiplication efficiency.

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,490
Cut it out, Haibara!

36
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,590
I'll listen to all you have to say

37
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,290
after you get out of there.

38
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,990
Never mind, and just listen, will you?

39
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,090
Because I'm never going to be able to...

40
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,990
to talk to you again.

41
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,090
-What?

42
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,190
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Solution Part)"

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,090
So I'm going to download the data of the drug into the MO,

44
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,290
and hide it here,

45
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,990
so come get it later, okay?

46
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,190
After they come to get me.

47
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,290
Hey.

48
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,390
Shinichi, in front there.

49
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,090
It's them.

50
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,090
Don't tell me they've come for Pisco.

51
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,190
No, no way!

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,290
Before the seven people are released,

53
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,890
the Inspector is supposed to call me.

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,290
Haibara, big trouble!

55
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,490
They're coming!

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,690
Hide in the fireplace or something for now.

57
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,690
Hey, what's up?

58
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,790
Hey!

59
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,090
Inspector! It's Kudo!

60
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,990
What? Black organization?

61
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,190
Pisco's not here.

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,490
He promised to meet us in 30 minutes.

63
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,190
But, we don't hear a thing from him

64
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,390
so we use the transmitter as a guide and come here,

65
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,990
only to find the computer and no sight of him.

66
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,590
Where on earth did he disappear to?

67
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,090
What's with this wine cellar anyway?

68
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,690
Probably a room that Pisco had kept, just in case.

69
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,190
If he failed to kill the guy at the hall,

70
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,590
he was probably going to kill the guy

71
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,490
some place else and bring him here.

72
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,690
I think we'd better get out of here really fast, Gin.

73
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,390
Yeah.

74
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,090
Hey?

75
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,790
Did they leave?

76
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,090
Yes.

77
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,190
And? What about your clothes?

78
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,590
You lewd bastard!

79
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,390
I'm dressed!

80
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,690
In the overalls that I found in the cellar,

81
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,690
I also have the MO with the data of the drug that I copied too.

82
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,490
What a surprise!

83
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,690
I wonder if that liquor called Paikal

84
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,590
has an enhancing factor

85
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,790
that quickens the speed of cell multiplication?

86
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,290
That's nothing to be relieved about,

87
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,390
because the effect is only temporary!

88
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,090
Get out of there from the chimney

89
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,590
before your body returns to that of a child!

90
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,690
Okay.

91
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,790
I feel just like Cordelia crawling out of the well.

92
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,290
Talk about a long way to go.

93
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,490
By the way...

94
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,990
Did you figure out who Pisco is?

95
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,790
No, not yet.

96
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,090
I don't have enough information.

97
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,690
Look, Shinichi.

98
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,690
Tomorrow morning's paper is on the internet!

99
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,090
I saw that a while ago, but I didn't see anything.

100
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,290
No, the place to look is the show biz section!

101
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,790
What?

102
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,590
The cameraman who was at the hall,

103
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,990
seems to have taken it just before the chandelier fell.

104
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,890
They are the two among the seven, right?

105
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,890
Wait a second! Maybe...

106
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,590
The traces of a burn!

107
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,390
Which means that this chain...

108
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,690
I see.

109
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,090
So, that's what it was.

110
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,990
"Haido City Hotel old building"

111
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,190
I'm out.

112
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,790
Good work, Ai!

113
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,090
Can you tell where you are?

114
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,090
It looks like a roof somewhere.

115
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,490
Is Kudo there?

116
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,590
No.

117
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,890
He was talking to Inspector Megure till just a while ago,

118
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,090
but he went rushing into the hotel.

119
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,390
Rushing in?

120
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,990
Don't worry!

121
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,990
He told me to relay this message to you,

122
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,590
"I figured out Pisco's identity!"

123
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,590
"I'll go pick you up right away"

124
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,190
"so stay put and wait for me."

125
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,590
I'm fine!

126
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,790
Even if I wanted to move, I'm so worn out.

127
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,190
I can't move an inch.

128
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,690
I missed you.

129
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,890
Sherry.

130
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,590
Gin.

131
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,790
Look.

132
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,290
Isn't it beautiful how the white snow flutters in darkness?

133
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,990
Bright scarlet blood that spreads over the snow.

134
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,290
That glasses and overalls you are wearing

135
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,490
to deceive us are miserable attire for dying.

136
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,890
But, this place is just a great place to die.

137
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,190
Am I right, Sherry?

138
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,190
I'm surprised that you guessed that

139
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,890
I was going to come out of this chimney.

140
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,190
It was your hair.

141
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,090
I found your reddish brown hair

142
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,290
near the fireplace.

143
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,990
I don't know if Pisco got you,

144
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,290
or if you snuck into that liquor cellar yourself,

145
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,290
But I hear you.

146
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,590
You trembling as you breathed

147
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,690
from within the fireplace.

148
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,490
I could've killed you in that dirty fireplace,

149
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,790
but I thought I could at least let you die glamorously.

150
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,190
Well... Thank you very much.

151
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,990
For waiting for me in such a cold place.

152
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,490
Now, won't you tell me while your lips are still moving?

153
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,790
The trick that you used to disappear

154
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,090
from the gas chamber of the organization.

155
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,190
The wine cellar?

156
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,890
Yes. I think it's a room with a large fireplace in it.

157
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,090
I wonder if we had that kind of a room in this hotel?

158
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,690
Maybe it's in the old building that is going to be renovated soon?

159
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,690
Old building?

160
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,490
Yes! I heard that they're using one of the rooms there

161
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,490
as a storage room.

162
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,190
A storage room? That's it!

163
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,390
Hey, wait, sonny?

164
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,090
I'm sure that Pisco is headed there too.

165
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,090
If he joins those two,

166
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,190
they'll find out that Haibara shrunk because of the drug.

167
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,790
Darn it! If only Inspector Megure could've

168
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,190
kept them confined for another five minutes.

169
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,190
What? Haibara was shot?

170
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,890
Right! On a roof somewhere by them!

171
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,290
Hurry and go there or...

172
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,190
Hey! Dr. Agasa...

173
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,090
Darn it! The battery's dead!

174
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,290
Haibara!

175
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,290
Gin, she won't talk.

176
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,390
We've got no choice.

177
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,190
I guess we'll just have to send her off.

178
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,890
To where we sent her older sister before her.

179
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:58,779
A needle?

180
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:07,979
Gin?

181
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:10,879
The chimney.

182
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,179
Get into the chimney.

183
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,179
Who are you? You're...

184
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,279
Hurry!

185
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,679
Gin!

186
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,879
What's the matter, Gin?

187
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,479
How wonderful!

188
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:20,679
I guess you don't remember because you were still a baby,

189
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,579
but I was on very intimate terms

190
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,879
with your parents who were scientists.

191
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,379
They told me a lot about the drug

192
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,779
that they were developing.

193
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,079
Who is he?

194
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,279
I didn't think you had developed it this far.

195
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,179
I'm sure that your parents who have died of an accident

196
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:41,779
is truly happy about this too.

197
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,779
Who are you?

198
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,979
But this is an order.

199
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:51,279
No offense.

200
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,479
Shiho.

201
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,279
Holdit right there!

202
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
Mr. Masuyama.

203
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,879
Or, should I call you Pisco, instead?

204
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,779
Who are you?

205
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,879
You may think that you succeeded

206
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,379
in dropping the chandelier on Mr. Nomiguchi

207
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,679
and made it look like an accident,

208
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,579
but you're not getting away with that.

209
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,279
You're the one who dropped it, right?

210
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,779
When you used the gun with a silencer!

211
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:21,979
Your target was

212
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,279
the fluorescent paint that you painted on the chandelier

213
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,379
in advance.

214
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,179
When the lights in the room goes out for the slide show,

215
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,379
the glow of the chain could be seen!

216
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,479
Of course, if you fired just like that

217
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,479
then the people around you would notice

218
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,979
the sparks from your gun.

219
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,379
But if you cover the silencer with the handkerchief,

220
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,579
the handkerchief would go off when you fire your gun,

221
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,979
so the sparks wouldn't be visible!

222
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:51,379
You used the handkerchief that was handed out at the hall

223
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,479
probably because it would be hard to trace

224
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:55,579
even if it was found later on.

225
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:56,979
Unfortunately...

226
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,279
Most of the guests who had received the purple handkerchief,

227
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,479
had already gone home,

228
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:05,079
and the suspects left were only the seven of you.

229
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,679
Mr. Tawara and Chris who were right below the chandelier

230
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,579
and couldn't aim at it are proven to be innocent.

231
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,779
Mr. Mihei, who spit out chain piece that was used as proof,

232
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,179
and Mr. Mugikura, who are being watched by the guests,

233
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,879
are also innocent.

234
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,479
Mr. Tarumi and Ms. Nanjo who were embracing each other

235
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,779
just before the incident are out of the question.

236
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,079
In other words the only one who could've

237
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,379
committed the murder at the hall is...

238
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,879
only you, Mr. Masuyama!

239
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,079
There!

240
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:38,779
The reason Mr. Nomiguchi came below the chandelier

241
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,479
because fluorescent paint was painted on the floor too.

242
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,979
You probably told him that

243
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,579
you can give him a chance to avoid arrest,

244
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,879
so he should wait for you at the place that glows

245
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,779
when the lights go out.

246
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,679
Isn't that right, Pisco?

247
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,179
A speaker?

248
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,879
Who are you?

249
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,179
Who the heck are you?

250
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,579
Conan Edogawa.

251
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,979
A detective!

252
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,979
A detective?

253
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,079
Don't tell me

254
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,979
that you're the one who called the police

255
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,079
while we were being questioned?

256
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,879
You and the other two at the rooftop

257
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,279
will be arrested by the police anyway.

258
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,779
Before that, I'd like you to tell me,

259
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,079
why did you have that purple handkerchief on you

260
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:26,279
during questioning?

261
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,279
That's why the Inspector had no choice but to release you.

262
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,579
Why did you have that handkerchief...

263
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:36,079
There are things in this world that you don't need to know about.

264
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,079
Besides, take a good look at the situation!

265
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,179
You couldn't have called the police.

266
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,379
You had better take a good look at yourself.

267
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,979
At your feet!

268
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,479
Spiritas.

269
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:55,679
It has an alcohol content as strong as 96%!

270
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,079
You understand, don't you?

271
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,879
What will happen if you smoke in a place

272
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,179
where such liquor is evaporating?

273
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,279
What?

274
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,779
A fire broke out from room 404 of the old building.

275
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:13,979
I repeat,

276
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,179
A fire broke out from room 404 of the old building!

277
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,279
What?

278
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,779
Let's go check it out!

279
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,579
Okay.

280
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,679
Hey, brat! Where are you?

281
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,579
Come out here! Darn it!

282
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,279
Where the heck are you!

283
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,979
So, that's where you are.

284
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:38,479
Just what do you think you're doing, Gin?

285
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,979
Have you gone senile, Pisco?

286
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,279
Why didn't you kill that cameraman right away

287
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,579
and get rid of the film?

288
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:48,179
Cameraman? What're you talking about?

289
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,079
The picture for the front page of tomorrow newspaper

290
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,379
has been switched to your face.

291
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:58,079
It shows you pointing the gun at the ceiling!

292
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,679
Don't!

293
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,879
If you kill me, you won't be able to find Sherry.

294
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,979
I have an idea of where she is.

295
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:09,679
Besides if you kill me, who has served that person,

296
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,679
you'll get yourself in trouble too.

297
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,279
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,079
But I just got orders personally

299
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,279
from that person a while ago to kill.

300
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,979
What?

301
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,679
You borrowed the power of the organization

302
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,479
and made it all the way up here.

303
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:26,079
I'll bet you've already seen enough good dreams.

304
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:31,279
Dream the rest of your dream in the world beyond.

305
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,279
What? Gin shot Pisco to death?

306
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,679
Yeah. I heard this through the glasses

307
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,579
that Ai left by the fireplace,

308
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:47,079
but it seems that he fled from the chimney

309
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,679
right after shooting the guy.

310
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,579
Strange!

311
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:55,679
Why can he move despite being shot with the tranquilizer gun?

312
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,879
I figured that though such a big man

313
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,979
he wouldn't be able to flee from the police

314
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:01,279
if he fell asleep.

315
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,279
And it also bugs me that

316
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,079
they knew too much of what Haibara was planning to do.

317
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,979
It seems that they knew that Haibara was going to be at the hall,

318
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,179
and besides can you tell who the person is

319
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,279
just by looking at a strand of hair?

320
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:17,679
Hey, Haibara?

321
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,579
When you were at the organization...

322
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:21,379
And?

323
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,079
Did they find out?

324
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,779
The fact that I shrank?

325
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,379
No, I don't think so.

326
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,779
No need for worry.

327
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,979
And what do you intend to do from now on?

328
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,779
Well...

329
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:41,079
As long as they know I'm hiding in this town,

330
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,379
I can no longer stay near all of you.

331
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:47,879
And besides, the MO that I had in the overall

332
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,979
probably went up in flames too,

333
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,079
that I have no reason to stay here anymore.

334
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,479
Don't worry, I'll leave by tomorrow.

335
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,879
Hey... You can't possibly leave in your condition!

336
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,079
All right!

337
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,979
Don't worry about that!

338
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,679
What?

339
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,779
You're not going to look for her here in this town?

340
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,479
Yes. I'm a shogun who hates to waste time.

341
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,579
She probably have ran away

342
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:22,479
with the man that saves her by now.

343
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,779
She's not stupid enough to stick around in this town

344
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,679
knowing that we know what she looks like!

345
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,979
My?

346
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:34,079
You're really into that young lady, aren't you?

347
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,979
Well, I'm so sorry, Vermouth.

348
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,079
A woman of your rank was called in

349
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,379
just to assist that old man,

350
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:45,079
and all he ends up doing is messing up the plan.

351
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,379
Really. I went out of my way

352
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,479
to give him the handkerchief before questioning and yet...

353
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,679
He did right to die.

354
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,879
Doesn't it bother you?

355
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:01,379
The guy who's sticking around with that young lady.

356
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,379
Yeah.

357
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:05,279
I sure would like to see the face of the guy

358
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,679
that's drooling all over her.

359
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,579
Yes. His dead face distorted with fear.

360
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:17,879
Are you going back to the States again?

361
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:21,979
No, I'm going to rest working as an actress for a while.

362
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:24,479
I'm going to take it easy in Japan.

363
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,579
Besides, I have something that concerns me too.

364
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,579
At any rate, Inspector!

365
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,579
Please don't leak the fact that I was involved in this case.

366
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:06,279
That's all right with me.

367
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,379
But what is going on anyway?

368
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:12,079
Mr. Nomiguchi, the victim, family disappears,

369
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,779
and the house of Chairman Masuyama, the suspect,

370
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,179
burns down completely.

371
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,779
I don't have the slightest idea what is going on.

372
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,279
I can't tell you anything just yet!

373
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,079
I'll contact you when I figure it out.

374
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,279
Hey! Kudo?

375
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,279
Yes.

376
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,379
Get rid of anybody and anything is suspicious.

377
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,579
This is the way they carry out their plan.

378
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,379
Now you know, don't you?

379
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,379
That we can't afford

380
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,679
to have anybody know our true identity.

381
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,679
Yeah! I understand it very clearly.

382
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,479
That I've got to crush them all no matter what the cost!

383
00:23:58,379 --> 00:23:59,979
"Next Episode"

384
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,379
What was that?

385
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:02,979
This is...

386
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:09,479
Strange.

387
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,779
What's that supposed to mean?

388
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:13,879
Did he get hurt in the restroom or something?

389
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,479
But... Why?

390
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:19,079
Dr. Agasa!

391
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,679
This is homicide!

392
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,279
What did you say?

393
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,279
Next Conan,

394
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,279
"Coffee Shop Truck Crash"

395
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:30,997
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,997
"Bus timetable"

397
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:34,597
Next episode will be the return of The Youth Detective Squad.

398
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,497
It looks like I can take a break.

399
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:38,097
Come on, help us out.
