1
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:05,283
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:08,283
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:11,243
Although smaller, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:13,083
Today's "MuneDoki" is the last one!

5
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,253
The alibi's just too strong!
Let your heart beat to the case!

6
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:18,503
There's always only one truth!

7
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,760
The Alibi Testimony Murder Case.

8
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,480
Wow! Look how fancy it is!

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,230
Now I see why
it's a five-star hotel!

10
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,540
This is going to be great, Conan-kun!

11
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,780
Yeah...

12
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,150
You kids are way too spoiled...

13
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,330
You're only here because the
restaurant's on the way, got that!

14
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,290
Yes, we know!

15
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,150
Say, isn't that the lawyer
who wants to hire you?

16
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,420
Yep, that's him! Mr. Tatsumi!

17
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,110
Your great detective work
is highly admired,

18
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,050
even within our judicial circles!

19
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,110
No, my work doesn't begin
to compare to yours...

20
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,980
All of my groups
know about you too! It's true!

21
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,490
Having your office in this
posh hotel is really impressive!

22
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,450
Tricks like this are necessary
when dealing with corporations.

23
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,330
So he's a popular lawyer who advises
a number of large corporations...

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,150
Wow!

25
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,180
What would you like to drink?

26
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,010
I'll have coffee.

27
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,640
These two don't need anything;
I'll kick them out soon.

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,220
There's no need to hurry.

29
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,850
Take your time and relax.

30
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,610
Hello? Room service, please.

31
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,570
If there's no reason to hurry,
then why's he so fixated on the time?

32
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,710
Excuse me while I use the restroom.

33
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,580
Sorry, but could someone
answer that for me?

34
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,300
It automatically records calls!

35
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,510
Hello?

36
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,470
Oh? You're not my husband...

37
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,010
Um, who may I ask is calling?

38
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,310
Who do you think?
Mrs. Tatsumi, of course.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,010
Oops.

40
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,970
What is that?

41
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,050
Little boy?

42
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,540
Could you put my husband on?

43
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,320
Yes, just a minute--

44
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,070
Mr. Lawyer, it's your wife...

45
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,720
She never learns...

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,970
It's me. I have guests right now.

47
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,270
We can talk later.

48
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,470
Sorry. Now, about my job.

49
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,470
Before that... Ran, Conan.

50
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,090
Right!

51
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,960
Let's go, Conan-kun.

52
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,720
There's a tea lounge in the lobby.

53
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,890
Tell them my room number
and order whatever you'd like.

54
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,260
Thank you!

55
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,640
I'd like you to investigate
possible infidelity.

56
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,000
Of my wife, Kazumi.

57
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,160
It's almost been an hour...

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,450
Here he comes.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,380
Dad!

60
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,660
Oh, there you are.

61
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,550
That took long. Is it a hard job?

62
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,920
No, not exactly...

63
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,750
Is something the matter?

64
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,720
He just wouldn't stop babbling
about how he'd like

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,180
to trust his wife again,
so it took longer than I expected.

66
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,680
So he's investigating
the wife's infidelity...

67
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,800
Anyway, I took the case.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,100
So let's go eat at this
restaurant of yours.

69
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,780
Hurray!

70
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,510
Which is what I'd like to say, but this
is the underground parking garage!

71
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,830
The restaurant is up there!

72
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,630
Whoops...

73
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,280
Were you even being
serious about going?!

74
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,320
Mr. Tatsumi...

75
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,430
Conan! Let's go!

76
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,360
Coming!

77
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,130
I think I drank too much...

78
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,550
A police car. I wonder what for?

79
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,010
What a huge mansion!

80
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,140
So this is Mr. Tatsumi's house...

81
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,100
Lawyers must really make a lot...

82
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,650
Inspector Megure.
I brought Detective Mori.

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,110
Oh! Thanks for coming, Mori-kun!

84
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,280
What's the deal, Inspector?

85
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,780
Well, come have a look.

86
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,250
You two wait there.

87
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
Isn't that's Mr. Tatsumi's wife?

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,220
Yes. Kazumi-san. Twenty-seven years old.

89
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,070
The cause of death was
suffocation by strangulation.

90
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,930
There's no question
this was a murder.

91
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,940
A staple!

92
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,400
What's this doing here?

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,980
Alright, you!

94
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,070
What do you think you're doin'?!

95
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,110
Now, now, Mori-kun.

96
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,150
All three of your testimonies
are needed this time.

97
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,990
Testimonies?

98
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,900
Yes, it's true that my wife
and I didn't get along.

99
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,000
That's why I hired Mori-san
to check up on her...

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,840
Inspector. What was
the estimated time of death?

101
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,940
We won't know the
details until the autopsy,

102
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,260
but judging from the state of rigor mortis,
I'd say between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m.

103
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,070
That's when we were--

104
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,230
Yeah, that's when
we were at the hotel.

105
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,860
Now I get it.

106
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,190
So they called us here
to confirm his alibi...

107
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,780
I parted with Mori-san
and left the hotel.

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,820
I finished researching my next case,
and then when I came home, my wife was--

109
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,680
--as you saw...

110
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Mori-kun. You're certain
you were with Mr. Tatsumi

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,060
between 2:00 and 3:00?

112
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,790
Yes. I'm certain.

113
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,810
He only disappeared
from my sight once,

114
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,840
and that was for only a minute.

115
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,800
Oh yes, the phone rang then...

116
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,230
Yeah! Conan-kun answered it!

117
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,350
Yeah! They said,
"I'm Mrs. Tatsumi, of course!"

118
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,480
Which means she was
still alive at that time?

119
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,440
The tape of that conversation should
still be in the phone at the hotel!

120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,240
Really?! May we borrow this tape?

121
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,700
Of course. That's fine with me.

122
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,390
At any rate,
Tatsumi-sensei was with me

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,980
between 2:00 and 3:00;
his alibi is airtight.

124
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,310
And besides, the hotel
is 10 kilometers from his home.

125
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,590
Lawyer's Wife Murdered

126
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,390
"Lawyer's wife murdered.

127
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,520
The focus of the investigation
is on the victim's associate?"

128
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,980
She was having an affair.

129
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,810
Mr. Tatsumi's wife
was killed by her other lover?!

130
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,430
Judging from the scene
of the crime, it wasn't a robbery.

131
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,780
Our testimonies cleared
Tatsumi-sensei of all suspicion.

132
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,240
Which narrows it down.

133
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,140
Damn it! I lost that case
thanks to whoever killed her!

134
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,290
That makes me mad!

135
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,890
Something's not right.

136
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,840
There are too many things
about this case that bother me!

137
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,300
Why was it necessary
to put the body in the bathtub?

138
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,260
What was that staple for?

139
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,060
The way Mr. Tatsumi
stalled the old man for an hour...

140
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,520
Why was he so
fixated on the time?

141
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,980
Was it mere coincidence that he
had someone else pick up the phone?

142
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,940
What did he put in the car trunk?

143
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,900
I guess all the questions
start from the hotel!

144
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,370
Was that Conan-kun?

145
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,910
Conan-kun! Where are you going?

146
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,200
I'll be back in time!

147
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,980
This is Mr. Tatsumi's office.

148
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,730
The guest elevator is down there.

149
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,840
Similarly, the employee
elevator is over there.

150
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,090
The emergency exit is far, too.

151
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,520
What's that?

152
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,780
It's a laundry chute...

153
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,250
The staple!

154
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,000
That's it!

155
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,020
As always,

156
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,930
I've prepared the room next to my office,
so please make yourselves at home.

157
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,030
The room next to his office?
As always?

158
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,640
This is--

159
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,140
Where is it coming from?!

160
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,810
From here.

161
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,990
So that's what this is...

162
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,430
They have a music box instead
of an alarm clock buzzer!

163
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,830
Are you staying here, little boy?

164
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,430
No, I'm exploring!

165
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,230
Or are you getting into trouble?

166
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,330
That reminds me--

167
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,840
--the music box stopped
during the phone call!

168
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,850
What a rare alarm clock!

169
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,800
Do any other rooms have one?

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,890
Of course. All the rooms do.

171
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,310
They each have a real
music box hooked up to a timer.

172
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,140
I've finally found it!

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,610
Definitive proof
that Mr. Tatsumi killed her!

174
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:03,568
You're late!

175
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:05,198
Look how late you are!

176
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:08,158
You knew we were going
somewhere! Where were you?!

177
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,038
Where's the old man?

178
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:12,668
He already left!

179
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:25,228
You did this! You killed Kazumi!

180
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,968
I'm with the police.
What's going on here?

181
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,098
Who are you?

182
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,938
Hirose. I'm a design engineer.

183
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,978
I'm the man you're looking for.

184
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:39,138
I had an affair with Kazumi, the victim.

185
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:39,898
What?!

186
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:46,778
But I didn't kill her! Why would I?!

187
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:49,288
She was about
to divorce this guy

188
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:52,038
and marry me!

189
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,308
Oh, that's news to me.

190
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,498
Don't play dumb!

191
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,288
You knew!

192
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,938
He knew?

193
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,508
Assuming I had known,
why would I kill her?

194
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:12,478
As a lawyer, I've heard
about scores of cases

195
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:16,188
in which affairs led to murder.

196
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:17,438
Why, you!

197
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,978
And besides, I have an alibi.

198
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:23,148
I couldn't possibly have killed her.

199
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,948
Isn't that right, Mori-san?

200
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,278
Yes, I can vouch for him.

201
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:30,898
Hirose-kun, was it?

202
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:32,748
So how about yourself?

203
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,708
What's your alibi?

204
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,818
Where were you between
2:00 and 3:00 p.m.

205
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,548
on the day she was killed?!

206
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,508
I was--

207
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,428
Where were you?

208
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,218
I was tricked!

209
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,598
Tricked?!

210
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,308
I came here because
of Kazumi's letter...

211
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,558
Here.

212
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,738
"I'll be waiting for you
at home at 2:30.

213
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:05,818
Signed, Kazumi."

214
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:08,148
But she wasn't home.

215
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:11,738
I rang the doorbell,
but nobody answered, so I left!

216
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,818
This is really hard to believe,

217
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:18,028
since you were at the
scene when it happened.

218
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:21,458
Anyone can easily
make something like this!

219
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,028
You're a sore loser!

220
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,938
It's clear that you're the killer!

221
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:28,688
Inspector. Take him in.

222
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:31,018
He ruined my case!

223
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:31,428
Ruined?

224
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,268
You got it all wrong!

225
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:34,518
He always does!

226
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:38,728
Hirose-san. I'd like you
to come down to the station.

227
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:40,978
Sorry, old man!

228
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,108
Are you all right?

229
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,868
I'm fine, thanks.

230
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:52,028
No! It wasn't me!

231
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,688
He's right.

232
00:14:54,688 --> 00:15:00,888
The real sore loser isn't
Hirose-san-- it's you, Tatsumi-sensei!

233
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,488
What do you mean, Mori-kun?

234
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,668
Are you saying
Mr. Tatsumi is the killer?

235
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:08,738
Precisely.

236
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:15,398
Really now, this is absurd.

237
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:18,638
This will tarnish your name
as a great detective, Mori-san!

238
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:24,228
I could say the exact same
thing to you, Mr. Tatsumi.

239
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:29,698
It truly was an impressive
trick of utilizing blind spots.

240
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,898
You had me completely fooled.

241
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,398
The place a body is found
doesn't necessarily equate

242
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:35,618
to the location of the murder.

243
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:40,188
In other words, the murder
didn't take place here at your home,

244
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,578
but at the hotel!

245
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:44,248
No way!

246
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:47,198
What are you talking about?!

247
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,118
Mori-kun!

248
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:52,408
The voice on the tape
of the phone call with Conan-kun

249
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:57,218
was professionally analyzed
and determined to be the victim's!

250
00:15:57,218 --> 00:16:00,038
Yes, of course it was her.

251
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:04,578
Because she called from the room
next to Tatsumi-sensei's office,

252
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:06,818
which he had rented.

253
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:08,278
Come again?!

254
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:09,778
The room next door?!

255
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,738
On that day, Tatsumi-sensei

256
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:18,158
made his wife wait in the guest
room that he always uses for clients.

257
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:23,038
He then had her call the hotel
at a predetermined time

258
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,628
with a cell phone.

259
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:30,008
He made someone else
answer the unconnected call.

260
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,468
Hello?

261
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:37,468
Because nobody would ever suspect
that the caller was in the very next room.

262
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:41,388
Immediately after
his business with me ended,

263
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:45,398
he went next door
and killed his wife.

264
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:48,318
He put the body
in a laundry basket

265
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:53,818
and dropped it down
a nearby laundry chute.

266
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,488
That was the hotel
employees' break time

267
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:03,998
so there wasn't a soul to be
found, was there, Tatsumi-sensei?

268
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:09,788
However, the bag
with the body was stapled.

269
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:12,468
Stapled with a cleaning tag.

270
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:17,118
That was the staple found in
the bathroom, Inspector Megure.

271
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,198
Now that you mention it...

272
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:21,428
But why was the
body in the bathtub?

273
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:23,388
His plan probably
started when he realized

274
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:30,448
that the trunk and the bathtub
are about the same size.

275
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,318
The body would stiffen,

276
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,108
so he couldn't
just toss it in the house.

277
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:42,538
Then he pointed the finger at Hirose-san
who was lured here by the fake letter,

278
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:46,958
and then he escaped suspicion
by having me vouch for him.

279
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,458
It really was quite impressive.

280
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:54,488
You disappoint me.
You're a lousy detective.

281
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:58,988
Where is your proof
that I killed her?

282
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:03,928
No court of law could
make me stand trial like this.

283
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,768
He's right, Mori-kun!

284
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,148
I do have proof.

285
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:12,778
Inspector. There's something
I'd like you to get right away.

286
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:17,408
The tape of the phone call...

287
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:19,238
Is that all you need, Mori-kun?

288
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,948
The tape of my wife on the phone?

289
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,158
What do you want with that?!

290
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,908
Play it, if you would.

291
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,788
Hello?

292
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,708
Oh? You're not my husband...

293
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,798
Um, who may I ask is calling?

294
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:36,218
Who do you think?
Mrs. Tatsumi, of course.

295
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,638
What's this?!

296
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:38,458
A music box?

297
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,958
Shh! Quiet!

298
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,048
Oops.

299
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,628
Little boy?

300
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,288
Could you put my husband on?

301
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:49,498
Yes, just a minute--

302
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,018
That's enough.

303
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,628
Now do you see?

304
00:18:54,628 --> 00:19:00,028
That hotel uses this music box
in place of alarm clock buzzers.

305
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,918
In other words,
your wife had set the alarm

306
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:06,498
but forgot to turn it off
when making the call.

307
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:10,588
Sorry, but music boxes like
this can be found anywhere.

308
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,458
It doesn't prove a thing.

309
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,708
Inspector.

310
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,838
Any music boxes
where the body was found?

311
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,918
No, none at all.

312
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:23,338
The killer could have run
off with it for whatever reason.

313
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,538
Unlikely.

314
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,208
And why's that?

315
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,378
Conan. The tape.

316
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,898
Right!

317
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,148
Here!

318
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:37,888
This is a recording of the music box
in the room next to Mr. Tatsumi's office!

319
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,118
Give it a listen.

320
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,208
That can't be!

321
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,168
It's missing a note!

322
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:58,088
That's right. The music box
in the next room over

323
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:05,098
is probably missing either
a cylinder pin or a tooth!

324
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:11,058
In other words, it's the only music
box like it in the world, Tatsumi-sensei!

325
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:16,528
Now then, let's hear the
phone recording one more time.

326
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,068
It would be a waste of time.

327
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:26,238
To think a lawyer would be
blackmailed by his own wife...

328
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:29,208
Blackmailed? By your wife?

329
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,498
She demanded 200 million.

330
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,038
Two hundred million?!

331
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,958
It took skill to get where I am today.

332
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:43,968
But because of my position, I'm often
privy to corporate secrets and the like.

333
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,668
I never made any demands,

334
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,998
but a lot of extra money
was added to my counsel fees.

335
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,588
Some of it was illegal,
to be more precise.

336
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,938
Kazumi found out about this.

337
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:58,168
I'll keep quiet
if you give me 200 million--

338
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:03,088
a year's worth of this dirty money--
in the form of divorce compensation.

339
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:06,868
It's not that much when you
consider you can keep your reputation.

340
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:11,918
But then she got
involved with that designer...

341
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:13,788
I couldn't let her get away with it.

342
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:17,628
"I'll do what you want,
but on one condition.

343
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:21,998
Call me at the specified time or
else I won't pay the 200 million!"

344
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:25,588
She agreed without a single question.

345
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:28,128
She would get
200 million and her man!

346
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,508
It was only natural.

347
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,498
But you shouldn't have made her call.

348
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,588
You had the call
recorded automatically,

349
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:38,478
but you should've listened to it
again before giving it to the police.

350
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,948
Your trick to pull off the perfect crime
actually wound up proving your guilt.

351
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:48,708
I gambled with myself.

352
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:53,368
No matter how good the lawyer,
the moment of truth is always a gamble.

353
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:58,338
Until now,
I'd never once lost that bet.

354
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:03,538
You may be a good lawyer,
but you were a poor criminal.

355
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,768
That's how it is, sir.

356
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,158
Inspector!

357
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:55,508
Good work, Mori-kun.

358
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,758
Despite being tricked
and taken advantage of.

359
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,578
Hope to work with you again.

360
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:01,758
Oh, uh, same here...

361
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:04,088
Tricked? Who? By who?

362
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,178
Oh, well!

363
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,548
Gimme a break.

364
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:10,758
Now his reputation keeps
getting better and better...

365
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,138
It was definitely
Matsuo-san who did this!

366
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:23,358
But how did he go from the
studio and back in four minutes?!

367
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:28,278
Aha! I've finally
found the secret path!

368
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:32,318
I wouldn't want
the criminal to leave

369
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:34,868
when the logic show's
just about to begin...

370
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:37,688
...Takashi Matsuo-san!

371
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:41,148
On the next Conan--

372
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,948
The TV Station Murder Case.

373
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,968
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,018
Bloody window.
