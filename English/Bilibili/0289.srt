1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:02,624
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:04,324
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,124
After a long interval, the young detectives are back again.

4
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:08,124
Mitsuhiko is acting weird.

5
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:09,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:11,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:13,824
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:05,711
Hold your arms out front and now raise them. Now stretch.

9
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:10,511
Good. One, two, three, four,

10
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,411
five, six.

11
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:14,311
Now for your arms and legs.

12
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:17,711
One, two, three, four

13
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:21,111
five, six, seven, eight...

14
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,511
Good grief.

15
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:26,411
I should be enjoying the summer of my junior year in high school.

16
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:27,711
Spin your arms outwards.

17
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,011
What the heck am I doing here?

18
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:31,911
Inwards.

19
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:35,211
Five, six, seven, eight.

20
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:42,411
"Mitsuhiko Lost In The Woods (Part 1)"

21
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,211
Radio exercise.

22
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,911
One, two...

23
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:49,211
Hey, Conan. Stop slacking off.

24
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,811
These exercise classes

25
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:54,411
are a very important part of our summer newsletter.

26
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:56,211
Yes, I bet.

27
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:57,811
She's right.

28
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,911
If you don't exercise properly now,

29
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:02,311
you'll regret it when you're older.

30
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,411
You might get high blood pressure,

31
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:06,911
diabetes, arteriosclerosis

32
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,611
and that might cause brain haemorrhages

33
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,411
and heart attacks.

34
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:16,811
One, two, three, four.

35
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,811
Well, I guess Dr. Agasa needs it.

36
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:27,111
By the way, what's this about a summer newsletter?

37
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:29,411
The Summertime News.

38
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,911
We're filling it with summer events.

39
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,511
Remember what the Dr. Agasa said at the fireworks display?

40
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,311
He said those kinds of newsletters

41
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:41,411
are rarely seen in the city these days.

42
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,411
And all they carry

43
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:46,411
are news about fireworks and these exercises.

44
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,111
Speaking of rarely seen,

45
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:51,811
he's not here today either. That Mitsuhiko.

46
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:54,511
I wonder if something's wrong.

47
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,311
He skipped a few times before, too.

48
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:00,411
He probably couldn't get up in time.

49
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,311
That's odd.

50
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,611
He's not loose like you, Genta.

51
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,011
He always arrives early.

52
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,611
-True. -Loose?

53
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,311
What part of me is baggy?

54
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,711
That's not what he meant.

55
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:19,111
Why don't we all go to Mitsuhiko's house after this?

56
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,911
He might have come down with a summer cold or something.

57
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,311
Good idea.

58
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,711
You mean Mitsuhiko wasn't there?

59
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:36,911
That's strange. He said he was going to go camping

60
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:39,311
with all of you after today's exercises.

61
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,611
Camping?

62
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:44,211
Yes. He was so excited last night.

63
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,111
He filled his bag with sweets.

64
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:50,211
He said he was going to share them with all of you.

65
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:53,211
Sweets?

66
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:57,511
Yes. The lady next door gave them to us.

67
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:00,311
But I guess he wasn't going camping after all.

68
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,111
What? I guess not.

69
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,911
Asami, do you have any idea where'd he go?

70
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:10,011
Some place where'd he sneak off to.

71
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:14,611
No. He'd only been hanging around you guys lately.

72
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,311
Oh, right.

73
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,711
Maybe you'd like to take a look in his room?

74
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:21,611
He sometimes leaves notes behind when he goes out.

75
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,311
What?

76
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,511
That's strange.

77
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,211
I don't think he left a note.

78
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:35,011
And his wallet's gone, too.

79
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:36,211
His wallet?

80
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,211
Seeing as he took non-perishable food and wallet

81
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,611
when he snuck out,

82
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:43,111
I think he intended to go far away.

83
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,911
Hey. You don't mean...

84
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,011
Probably, he ran away from home.

85
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,711
-Ran away from home? -Ran away from home?

86
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:51,611
You're kidding! Really?

87
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,411
This is like a movie!

88
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,711
What are you so happy about?

89
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,811
Even if he didn't run away from home,

90
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:00,911
he's been planning this for some time. I'm sure of that.

91
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:05,311
See. This is his exercise card.

92
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,711
He's skipped every Sunday.

93
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,911
You're right.

94
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:14,811
So Sunday's the key to his disappearance.

95
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,611
Maybe he was going on a date or something.

96
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,911
No way.

97
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,911
A date?

98
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:24,811
Well, he did mention that older girl.

99
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:30,011
She worked in the flower shop her family owned during weekend.

100
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:33,811
I remember he said that girl once praised him.

101
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,811
Maybe she asked him for a date and took him to the beach?

102
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:41,511
Why the beach?

103
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:46,111
Because he asked to borrow my sunscreen last night.

104
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,311
I bought it on the shop channel, it's foreign made and expensive.

105
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,311
I find it hard to believe.

106
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,411
That serious Mitsuhiko...

107
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,411
With a girl...

108
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,511
On the beach...

109
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,511
Eating sweets.

110
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,411
Not a romantic picture.

111
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,211
Asami, dear!

112
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:06,711
You're going to be late for your piano lesson unless you hurry!

113
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,311
Yes, mother. I'm coming.

114
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,311
Both our parents are school teachers,

115
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,411
so they're very strict about the language we use.

116
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,811
No wonder Mitsuhiko talks the way he does.

117
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,711
All right. If you find out anything interesting,

118
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,611
call me on my cellular.

119
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,311
I'd really like to know about Mitsuhiko's love life.

120
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,311
Her little brother's disappeared

121
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,711
but how can she so nonchalant?

122
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,211
It's unbelievable, right?

123
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,511
You're right.

124
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,211
What? Mitsuhiko?

125
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,511
You mean Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya?

126
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,511
He hasn't been by today.

127
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,511
Even at about 6:30 this morning?

128
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,911
We don't open until 7 am,

129
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:51,311
and I was at the exercises at 6:30 am.

130
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,811
So I would know if he came by at that time or not.

131
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:55,011
I guess you wouldn't.

132
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:58,411
But I did see him last Sunday morning at the bus stop

133
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,711
when I was on my way to the exercises.

134
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:05,011
It looked like he was being scolded by some older men.

135
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,511
He was being scolded?

136
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:09,811
Yes. Something about they won't tell him

137
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,311
and he shouldn't go get it.

138
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:15,111
What was he not supposed to go get?

139
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,811
I don't know.

140
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:20,111
They mentioned the name of a samurai from long ago.

141
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:23,411
Let's see. Was it Uesugi? Takeda?

142
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:27,611
No. Maybe Toyotomi or Tokugawa.

143
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:30,211
Did you say Tokugawa?

144
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:33,311
Maybe it's about the Tokugawa hidden treasure!

145
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:36,611
I'll bet the treasures buried in some beach.

146
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:39,311
That's what Mitsuhiko's gone to look for.

147
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,711
Darn it. That little sneak...

148
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:43,511
-Here we go again. -wants to keep it all to himself!

149
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:47,311
-I'm going to make him share it with. -Has Mitsuhiko disappeared?

150
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:51,311
Yes. He left for some place this morning but no one knows where.

151
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:54,811
It must have been him that I saw this morning then.

152
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,711
I saw a boy at the bus stop this morning.

153
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,411
He had his cap pulled down low

154
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,611
and was carrying a back pack.

155
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,011
He smelled kind of strange.

156
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,811
It looked like Mitsuhiko, so I called him out.

157
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:12,011
But he ignored me and boarded the bus.

158
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,411
What do you mean he smelled strange?

159
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:17,811
It wasn't exactly strange.

160
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:21,311
It was more tangy like a lemony smell.

161
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,111
A lemony smell?

162
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:26,311
Yes. That kid got on my bus.

163
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:29,911
His cap was pulled down low and he smelled like lemons, right?

164
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:33,111
I knew it. He's a runaway, isn't he?

165
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:35,111
We don't know if he did yet.

166
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:38,411
Well, you see. When kids get on the bus,

167
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,311
they usually look out the window.

168
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:43,911
But that kid sat in the back of the bus

169
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:47,011
and he looked like he was worried about something.

170
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:48,411
He just stared straight ahead

171
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,911
and it looked like he might be hiding from something.

172
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:52,911
He looked worried?

173
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:55,111
Like he was hiding?

174
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,911
Yes, I was right!

175
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,511
That Mitsuhiko's run away from home!

176
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,911
Don't say that.

177
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:03,711
Do you remember where he got off?

178
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,411
Let me think.

179
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,611
I'm pretty sure it was Beika Station.

180
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:14,311
What? A boy that smelled like lemon?

181
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:16,211
I'm not really sure.

182
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:20,411
He had a cap on and he was carrying a backpack.

183
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,911
Hey, I think I know which kid they're talking about.

184
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:27,111
Remember? He bought an adult ticket by mistake.

185
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:31,311
He was in a rush and wanted us to exchange it right away.

186
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,511
He was in a hurry?

187
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,011
Yes. He was really scared.

188
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,211
Like somebody was after him or something.

189
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:41,811
Do you know where he was heading?

190
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:44,711
Let's see.

191
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,811
It was an adult ticket for 190 yen.

192
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:51,111
So it'd probably be to the Chiba area

193
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:53,411
or maybe Gunma area.

194
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,211
It's no use.

195
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:04,011
Nobody who works here's seen him.

196
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,211
That means

197
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,611
he might have transferred to another line somewhere.

198
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,911
This is our last hope.

199
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:26,011
Yes. That boy passes through here.

200
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,211
-Really? -We did it!

201
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,611
We're a small station.

202
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,911
We don't have those automatic ticket gates like in the big city.

203
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:36,611
So I'd notice any kid that acted as suspicious as him.

204
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,711
He was the last to get off

205
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:41,811
and then he hid behind the station building.

206
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:44,211
But right after that, he ran off towards the mountain.

207
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:48,311
Well, well.

208
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:52,011
We got this far on only these clues, he smelled like lemons,

209
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,311
wore a cap and was carrying a backpack.

210
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,511
And the sun's starting to go down, too.

211
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,011
Hey, hey. Wait a minute.

212
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,211
There's nothing around here.

213
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,811
How are we gonna find him?

214
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,311
Don't worry. We've got this.

215
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:13,111
See, it's located the signal from Mitsuhiko's detective badge.

216
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,311
He's around here for sure.

217
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,911
What a relief.

218
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,911
Gosh. If he's got his badge with him

219
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,911
then all we've got to do is radio him.

220
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,511
I've been trying to, but he doesn't answer.

221
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,511
Well, we can find him faster

222
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:34,811
by tracking him with those tracking glasses.

223
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,511
Doesn't it bother you though?

224
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,611
Mitsuhiko always does everything by the book

225
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,411
and he's super careful.

226
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,011
Why do you think he went off into the mountains

227
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:49,211
without discussing it with us first?

228
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:51,911
Maybe he's running away from home after all.

229
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:55,311
Okay, okay. Don't go jumping to conclusions.

230
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:57,811
It might be something very innocent.

231
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,311
Like maybe he just fell in love with a girl

232
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,811
and he followed her all the way here.

233
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,811
Love can make you do crazy things.

234
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,411
He fell in love?

235
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,611
It happens and as they said,

236
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:11,011
"First love is lemon flavoured."

237
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:14,111
Come on! Let's go, guys.

238
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,711
-Huh? -We've gotta find him before it gets dark.

239
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,111
Wait for me!

240
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:48,462
It seems like he's someplace in this forest.

241
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,962
Now, what? Is he still not answering?

242
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:56,362
Yes. I'm pretty sure he can hear the beep though.

243
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:02,662
Hey. There's people over there.

244
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:07,362
Let's go and ask them if they've seen Mitsuhiko.

245
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,662
Wait a minute. I'll go.

246
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:10,962
You kids stay here.

247
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:13,562
Hey, come back here!

248
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,062
They may be dangerous people!

249
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:21,962
Hey! You guys over there!

250
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:30,862
Detective Yamamura of the Gunma Prefecture Police.

251
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:34,762
What's this? Aren't you the boy with Mouri's agency?

252
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:37,462
What're you doing in a place like this?

253
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:40,062
What... what do you mean by the way?

254
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:42,862
Hello there.

255
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:46,862
What's going on here?

256
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,862
It's not safe for you here.

257
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:56,762
I want all unauthorized people out of this forest right now.

258
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,662
Not safe?

259
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,562
Has a bear been sighted?

260
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:02,662
A man that more dangerous than a bear

261
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,462
is hiding out around here.

262
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:06,362
A man?

263
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,062
The truth is...

264
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,462
I can't say this out loud.

265
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,462
It seems a veteran cop let him get away

266
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,062
during inspection of the crime scene.

267
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:19,062
It's that serial killer, Kiichiro Numabuchi.

268
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,162
Are you serious?

269
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,262
I... I don't believe it.

270
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,962
Come on, keep moving.

271
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:35,562
Hey!

272
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:39,962
Hey. Are you okay?

273
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:43,262
Hey!

274
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,162
Move it!

275
00:15:57,362 --> 00:16:00,562
The guy I ran into in Osaka is here in this forest.

276
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:01,862
That's why you've got to leave right now.

277
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,462
But one of their friends is in here.

278
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,462
Hey, Conan.

279
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:10,262
We've got to let Mitsuhiko know about this.

280
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:14,762
Gosh! Why aren't you answering, Mitsuhiko?

281
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,962
There's a boy somewhere in here?

282
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:42,362
In the same forest a murderer is hiding out in?

283
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:43,762
Yes, that's right.

284
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,962
Why didn't you keep a closer eye on him?

285
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,162
You brought them here, didn't you?

286
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,962
No, I didn't.

287
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:53,662
That idiot Mitsuhiko came here on his own

288
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,362
without telling us about it.

289
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:59,262
And we asked all the people at the train stations if they saw him

290
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,262
and that's how we ended up here in Gunma Prefecture.

291
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:06,062
And we tracked him with the detective badge he has on,

292
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:07,862
that's why we came to this forest.

293
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:10,462
We used my tracking glasses.

294
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,462
Detective badges and tracking glasses?

295
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:18,862
My parents bought me those when I was a kid, too.

296
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,562
It's in the detective kit.

297
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,662
I got two magic pen, words you write it with it disappear

298
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:25,962
then there's the magic card where smoke appears when you rub it,

299
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,762
and then there's the secret paper that disintegrates in water.

300
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:33,162
One day though, I started to have my doubts.

301
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,762
I couldn't figure out how these things

302
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,762
could help in a real investigation.

303
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,562
Now, kids!

304
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:43,462
I want you to go somewhere else and play detective,

305
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,762
toys like that aren't dependable.

306
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:47,562
You don't know for sure if your friend is here!

307
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:51,162
You don't understand. We're not playing.

308
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:53,762
Honestly, we're telling the truth.

309
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:57,162
Mitsuhiko really is around here.

310
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,762
Since you're insisting so strongly, show me some proof.

311
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,762
Let me see those so called tracking glasses.

312
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:06,062
See, just push the button on the frames like this.

313
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:11,862
The batteries are dead?

314
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,662
I knew it. They're just ordinary glasses.

315
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:17,562
No. The batteries are dead, that's all.

316
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:18,562
What?

317
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,762
Hey, Yamamura. What're you doing?

318
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:23,162
Come on. We're going to go look for Numabuchi.

319
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:25,362
I know, but these kids...

320
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:29,962
Numabuchi got away because you took your eyes off him!

321
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:31,662
You'd better find him fast!

322
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,762
No, sir. That's not...

323
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:38,162
Just take those kids to a safe place,

324
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,062
then join the manhunt.

325
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:42,462
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

326
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:46,262
Good grief.

327
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,462
He's the one who left Numabuchi alone

328
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,562
and went to relieve himself behind the bushes.

329
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,862
I thought he was with the prisoner.

330
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,862
That's why I wasn't paying close attention to him.

331
00:18:56,862 --> 00:19:01,062
Which means it actually was your fault he escaped.

332
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:06,062
Well, I guess you could say that.

333
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,462
My goodness.

334
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:11,062
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

335
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,662
Where are you?

336
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,862
Come out! Come out wherever you are!

337
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:18,162
Hey!

338
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:19,962
How long are you going to keep this up?

339
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:22,962
That kid's probably already back home by now.

340
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,362
You kids go on home.

341
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:26,862
When it gets dark,

342
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:29,462
even someone who knows these woods like me, could get lost.

343
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:31,262
I'm not afraid of the dark.

344
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:33,362
Because we've got these.

345
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:37,262
They sure sell some handy things lately.

346
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,762
We didn't buy these.

347
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,162
Dr. Agasa made them for us.

348
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:43,462
Dr. Agasa? Made them for you?

349
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:48,262
That's right. I invented this and made them for the kids.

350
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:51,562
I also made those tracking glasses

351
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:54,562
and that detective badge with the radar.

352
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:57,762
So, wait a second. Don't tell me...

353
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:01,362
you were telling the truth about a boy wandering around here?

354
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:03,662
We were telling you the truth, of course!

355
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,162
That's why we're searching like this.

356
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,262
Why didn't you tell my superior that back there?

357
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:11,962
We told you already.

358
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,062
I... I've got to report this to my superior.

359
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:18,862
Darn it!

360
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:22,662
I left my cellular phone in the police car.

361
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,562
I'm... I'm done for.

362
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:28,162
I let the prisoner escape during the investigation.

363
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,462
I didn't tell to my senior

364
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,762
that a child had wandered into the woods.

365
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,562
I'm going to be discharged, I know it.

366
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:35,562
I joined the police

367
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:37,662
because I loved watching detective shows

368
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,862
and I finally got to become a detective.

369
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,562
Maybe being a detective wasn't right for me.

370
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,862
I guess I'm just not cut out for this job.

371
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,662
That's not true.

372
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:52,362
That's okay. You don't have to cheer me up.

373
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:56,462
But you solved a lot of cases before.

374
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:59,162
There's the Yoshifusa Yabuuchi case.

375
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:01,862
Then, the lawyer's case in Karuizawa.

376
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,562
And the Kashiragami Forest case, too.

377
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:07,162
You did a fantastic job on all those cases.

378
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:10,162
-Is that true, Conan? -That's amazing!

379
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:11,662
You... You think so?

380
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:17,362
Of course, it was either me or my dad that solved them though.

381
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:20,862
I noticed you had a wide forehead and look intelligent.

382
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,162
He's the intelligent cop type.

383
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:24,862
You think so?

384
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:27,562
Now, Detective Yamamura.

385
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,662
Let's get back to our search.

386
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:33,062
You know these woods better than anybody. We're counting on you.

387
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,162
No, Dr. Agasa.

388
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:37,462
From now, I want you to call me...

389
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:41,262
Yama. I'd appreciate that.

390
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:42,462
Yama?

391
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:45,862
I think he's been watching too many detective shows.

392
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,562
It's beeping again.

393
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:04,262
It must be Conan.

394
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:08,062
I knew they'd come look for me.

395
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:11,662
But if I take it off now and talk to them,

396
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,262
all my effort would have been in vain.

397
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,262
No. I wouldn't let that happen.

398
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,362
"Next Episode" -Or maybe Numabuchi's already got him.

399
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:11,162
Hey, don't say that, Ai!

400
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:13,862
It's not completely impossible, you know.

401
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:19,362
The man hiding out in these woods is a cold blooded killer.

402
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,362
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

403
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:22,662
Where are you?

404
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:25,862
If you can hear my voice, answer me!

405
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:27,662
It's dangerous in this forest!

406
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:29,662
There's a killer on the loose in here!

407
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:35,762
Next Conan, "Mitsuhiko Lost In The Woods (Part 2)"

408
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:38,747
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:40,647
"The General's name"

410
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,447
-Next episode... -Look out, Mitsuhiko.

411
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,947
Mitsuhiko, you little sneak.

412
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:45,947
Mitsuhiko, you did pretty good.
