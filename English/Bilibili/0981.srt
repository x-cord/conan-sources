1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.010
Yoshida-san?

2
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.420
What is it?

3
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.690
It's really hurt. Did it get hit by a car?

4
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.480
No, it doesn't seem like it.

5
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.680
There aren't any signs
that it was hit by a car.

6
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.520
Someone probably hit or kicked it.

7
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.950
Why would someone do something so cruel?

8
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.280
It's unforgivable.

9
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.240
This might serve as a clue
to finding the culprit.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.950
These bloodstains and fibers...

11
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.770
The cat must've scratched something
the culprit was wearing.

12
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.700
Yellow and pink...
That's distinctive clothing.

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.220
We need to find the culprit

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090
but we also need to get
this cat to a hospital.

15
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.340
Yoshida-san, let's go.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.190
Okay.

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.540
She's oddly kind to animals.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.850
He's in a weakened state, but he'll be fine.

19
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.360
It'll take some time, but he'll get better.

20
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.040
Beika City Animal Hospital

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.280
Now then, how will we find the culprit?
Beika City Animal Hospital

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.360
Beika City Animal Hospital

23
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.170
Is it a case?

24
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.860
Bocchan Restaurant

25
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.270
Bocchan Restaurant?

26
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.370
You kids again?

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.120
Are we cursed in some way?

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.600
Right back at you...

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.110
That man's shirt is yellow and pink!

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.760
Which means he's...

31
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.650
The animal abuser.

32
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.160
Does this have something to do with that cat?

33
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.550
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

34
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.270
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

35
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.170
An odd restaurant with characters
plucked from a novel!

36
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.380
The Detective Boys take
on a serial murder case!

37
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.920
Always determining the one truth

38
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.750
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.000
his name is Detective Conan!

40
00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:02.597
Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant
(Part One)

41
00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:05.467
"Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant, Part One!"
Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant
(Part One)

42
00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.927
Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant
(Part One)

43
00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:10.717
The victim was Bocchan Restaurant employee
Koga Ushio-san, thirty-six years old.

44
00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.557
Koga Ushio (36)
Bocchan Restaurant Head Receptionist
The victim was Bocchan Restaurant employee
Koga Ushio-san, thirty-six years old.

45
00:04:13.897 --> 00:04:18.557
The weapon hasn't been found, but is
most likely a kitchen knife-like blade.

46
00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:18.837
Sanshiro Lake

47
00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:21.637
The body was abandoned in Sanshiro Lake.
Sanshiro Lake

48
00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:26.927
Judging by the body's condition, he
was killed last night around midnight.
Sanshiro Lake

49
00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:28.567
Sanshiro Lake

50
00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:31.147
You lot again?

51
00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:35.067
Try not to get in our way by
walking around the crime scene.

52
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:36.527
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:38.347
Continue, Takagi-kun.

54
00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:39.427
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:44.127
This morning, Bocchan Restaurant
manager Akazawa Zenichi-san,

56
00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:44.267
Akazawa Zenichi (60)
Bocchan Restaurant Manager

57
00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.547
whose home is located here at the
restaurant, discovered the body.
Akazawa Zenichi (60)
Bocchan Restaurant Manager

58
00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:47.597
whose home is located here at the
restaurant, discovered the body.

59
00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:49.717
Who could have killed Uranari?

60
00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:55.267
It's possible that cat happened to be
here at the crime scene last night.

61
00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:56.637
What?

62
00:04:56.637 --> 00:05:00.647
Since their crime had been witnessed,
they intended to silence him.

63
00:05:00.857 --> 00:05:03.657
That's why they hurt the kitty?

64
00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:04.897
How awful.

65
00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:07.537
But it was a cat that witnessed their crime.

66
00:05:07.537 --> 00:05:10.157
It's plausible given a criminal's mentality.

67
00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:14.967
Then we should find the culprit
for that cat's sake, too.

68
00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:15.787
Yeah.

69
00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:17.097
You're right.

70
00:05:17.097 --> 00:05:17.787
Yeah.

71
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:23.637
Regarding the criminal profile, since the murder
occurred within the restaurant late at night,

72
00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:26.547
it's hard to imagine that it
was committed by an outsider.

73
00:05:26.547 --> 00:05:31.047
So it's likely that the murder was committed
by someone who works at Bocchan Restaurant.

74
00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:34.057
The culprit is probably someone
who works at the restaurant.

75
00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:35.197
Inspector Megure.

76
00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:37.767
All the employees have arrived for work.

77
00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:39.757
Everyone's here, huh?

78
00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:40.557
What?

79
00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:57.747
That's our uniform.

80
00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:01.077
What is that?

81
00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:04.207
Boys, Uranari's been killed.

82
00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:06.087
Indeed.

83
00:06:06.247 --> 00:06:06.517
Bocchan
Shima Rokusuke (22)

84
00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:08.817
What evildoer could do such a thing?
Bocchan
Shima Rokusuke (22)

85
00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:09.667
The sun may forgive them, but I will not!
Bocchan
Shima Rokusuke (22)

86
00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:12.337
The sun may forgive them, but I will not!

87
00:06:12.507 --> 00:06:12.527
Kiyo
Kiyohara Uni (71)

88
00:06:12.527 --> 00:06:13.827
How marvelous.
Kiyo
Kiyohara Uni (71)

89
00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:15.967
Bocchan's sense of justice is
this old Kiyo's pride and joy.
Kiyo
Kiyohara Uni (71)

90
00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:18.097
Bocchan's sense of justice is
this old Kiyo's pride and joy.

91
00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:20.277
Bocchan? Kiyo?

92
00:06:20.977 --> 00:06:21.017
Now you've done it, you dastardly Red Shirt!

93
00:06:21.017 --> 00:06:23.897
Yama Arashi
Hotta Izumi (32)
Now you've done it, you dastardly Red Shirt!

94
00:06:23.897 --> 00:06:24.057
Yama Arashi
Hotta Izumi (32)

95
00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:26.187
All to get at Madonna!

96
00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:26.667
Madonna
Toyama Chiaki (24)

97
00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:29.087
Please, Yama Arashi-san.
Madonna
Toyama Chiaki (24)

98
00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:29.277
Madonna
Toyama Chiaki (24)

99
00:06:29.287 --> 00:06:31.947
You make it seem like
I'm the reason for this.

100
00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:36.697
I'd never do anything as
senseless as kill someone.

101
00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:37.447
Right?

102
00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:39.157
Indeed.

103
00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:39.457
Nodaiko
Yoshikawa Kozo (43)
Indeed.

104
00:06:39.457 --> 00:06:42.207
You suspect the president? What a fool.
Nodaiko
Yoshikawa Kozo (43)

105
00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:43.997
Nodaiko, stay out of this!

106
00:06:44.357 --> 00:06:45.287
Now, now.

107
00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:45.707
Tanuki
Tanuma Toyoo (58)
Now, now.

108
00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:48.377
Let's not cast suspicion upon each other.
Tanuki
Tanuma Toyoo (58)

109
00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:51.127
You're always afraid to
rock the boat, Tanuki.

110
00:06:53.197 --> 00:06:56.967
Bocchan Restaurant recreates the
world inside a novel, doesn't it?

111
00:06:57.337 --> 00:06:59.377
I'm impressed you noticed, son!

112
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.887
That's our selling point.

113
00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.777
What? A novel?

114
00:07:03.777 --> 00:07:06.397
You haven't heard of "Bocchan"?

115
00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:09.157
Well, they are first graders.

116
00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:10.347
Yeah.

117
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.397
Mitsuhiko, could you explain?

118
00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:20.407
"Bocchan" is a famous novel written
during the Meiji Era by Natsume Soseki.

119
00:07:20.987 --> 00:07:25.417
The protagonist Bocchan leaves
his old maidservant Kiyo-san in Tokyo

120
00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:29.227
to begin teaching at a school in Shikoku.

121
00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.937
Grasshoppers? These are locusts!

122
00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:34.047
Grasshoppers and locusts are the same thing!

123
00:07:34.477 --> 00:07:39.927
But his students pull pranks on him,
like putting grasshoppers in his bed.

124
00:07:40.577 --> 00:07:43.427
The principal Tanuki is irresponsible.

125
00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:48.187
Meanwhile, he learns that his colleague
Uranari-kun's fiancÃ©e, Madonna-san,

126
00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:51.307
has been taken from him
by head teacher Red Shirt.

127
00:07:51.307 --> 00:07:54.697
The righteous Bocchan is
unable to forgive them,

128
00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:58.087
so he and his colleague Yama
Arashi-san beat up Red Shirt

129
00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:00.697
and his obsequious sidekick Nodaiko.

130
00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:03.577
It's a very satisfying story!

131
00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:06.247
Sounds interesting.

132
00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:07.457
And...

133
00:08:08.077 --> 00:08:09.697
You're lucky, miss.

134
00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:14.147
You get to wear those pretty clothes
while bringing customers their food.

135
00:08:14.147 --> 00:08:16.587
That's not my only job.

136
00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:19.007
You do other stuff, too?

137
00:08:26.537 --> 00:08:28.767
Bocchan Dancers?

138
00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:30.817
They all dance together...

139
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.527
We should get started on
looking for the culprit.

140
00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:40.237
Yeah.

141
00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:43.337
The culprit is probably one of them.

142
00:08:45.497 --> 00:08:49.267
Since we're temporarily closed,
they could let us leave.

143
00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:53.247
The police insist we stay
so they can question us.

144
00:08:53.477 --> 00:08:56.757
But they'll be providing food,
so we won't have to buy our own.

145
00:08:56.977 --> 00:08:59.757
Don't you have any ambition?

146
00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:04.027
I do appreciate not having
to buy my own lunch.

147
00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:09.247
Those three...

148
00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:11.597
Their colleague was just murdered.

149
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.147
It's understandable.

150
00:09:15.127 --> 00:09:18.487
After all, the victim Uranari-san wasâ

151
00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:22.197
Did he have problems?

152
00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:28.457
You think I did it?

153
00:09:29.807 --> 00:09:32.077
We received testimony.

154
00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:37.837
You and the victim Uranari-san, or
Koga Ushio, were romantic rivals.

155
00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:41.297
You fought over Toyama
Chiaki-san, who plays Madonna.

156
00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:41.967
That'sâ

157
00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:43.077
No!

158
00:09:44.157 --> 00:09:47.467
And you live on restaurant grounds.

159
00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:52.857
It's possible you invited over your
romantic rival last night, and...

160
00:09:53.307 --> 00:09:54.617
Impossible.

161
00:09:54.617 --> 00:09:58.487
He was responsible for all
of our reception staff.

162
00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:02.777
What kind of manager would murder
the backbone of his business?

163
00:10:03.047 --> 00:10:05.437
One thing may have led to another.

164
00:10:05.437 --> 00:10:09.387
You invited Uranari-san over and
asked him to leave Madonna-san alone.

165
00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:11.787
But he wouldn't listen, so without
thinking, you stabbed him.

166
00:10:12.107 --> 00:10:15.547
Why would I have been holding a knife then?

167
00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:17.187
To threaten him.

168
00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:20.547
After all, Red Shirt is a dastardly fellow
who will do anything to get his way.

169
00:10:20.807 --> 00:10:23.797
Please don't confuse the novel with reality.

170
00:10:24.187 --> 00:10:27.357
If you think I did it, I'd
like to see some evidence.

171
00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:33.347
Is that true?

172
00:10:33.847 --> 00:10:36.497
Did they both harbor
romantic feelings for me?

173
00:10:36.497 --> 00:10:38.727
You didn't know?

174
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.987
I thought they were simply pretending

175
00:10:41.987 --> 00:10:44.857
in front of our customers as
part of our business strategy.

176
00:10:50.747 --> 00:10:55.877
It must be shocking to learn that
two men were fighting over her.

177
00:10:56.057 --> 00:11:00.947
Not only that, but if a murder
was committed because of it...

178
00:11:00.947 --> 00:11:02.547
That would be hard.

179
00:11:02.807 --> 00:11:06.407
Come to think of it, what was
she about to say earlier?

180
00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:08.617
Something about Uranari-san.

181
00:11:08.617 --> 00:11:09.537
Inspector.

182
00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:15.057
The victim Uranari had a terrible reputation?

183
00:11:15.057 --> 00:11:17.937
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

184
00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:20.897
Uranari is a kind-hearted and good man.

185
00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:22.317
In the novel.

186
00:11:22.517 --> 00:11:27.827
But apparently they're all totally
different from the characters they play.

187
00:11:28.097 --> 00:11:29.577
What do you mean?

188
00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:31.577
For example, the dastardly Red Shirt

189
00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:35.747
is a good-natured man who
cares for his employees.

190
00:11:36.267 --> 00:11:40.297
Bocchan is actually a twisted
man with no sense of justice.

191
00:11:40.717 --> 00:11:43.587
Yama Arashi is a delicate crybaby.

192
00:11:44.047 --> 00:11:46.367
And Madonna seems plain,

193
00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:49.587
but she wrestled as a student.

194
00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:53.737
Uranari was incredibly strict,

195
00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:57.607
and he often yelled at his subordinates
as the head receptionist.

196
00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:00.777
Your acting is weak! All of you!

197
00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:03.027
You're getting paid, aren't you?

198
00:12:03.027 --> 00:12:05.217
Perform your roles thoroughly!

199
00:12:05.217 --> 00:12:06.657
Idiots! Fools! Morons!

200
00:12:07.157 --> 00:12:08.457
Got it?

201
00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:14.637
Naturally, everyone working in customer
service strongly disliked him.

202
00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:16.977
So that's what it was.

203
00:12:16.977 --> 00:12:19.167
The thing she almost said.

204
00:12:19.617 --> 00:12:22.347
So they're nothing like their
characters from the novel.

205
00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:27.607
Inspector, that means the culprit is
one of the good guys from the novel!

206
00:12:27.607 --> 00:12:29.647
Either Bocchan or Yama Arashi!

207
00:12:29.647 --> 00:12:32.617
Stop thinking about the novel already.

208
00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:36.277
But they did have old scores to settle.

209
00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:39.397
We'll have to question
the reception staff, too.

210
00:12:41.807 --> 00:12:44.397
All right. Summon them.

211
00:12:44.627 --> 00:12:50.077
Not just Red Shirt, but Bocchan and Yama
Arashi had motives for murder, too.

212
00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:08.384
The question is their alibis.

213
00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:14.674
We're lucky you happened to come
stay at my place last night.

214
00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:18.024
We're able to confirm each other's alibis.

215
00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:20.024
It's about your employee...

216
00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:23.304
Now you think my reception staff did it?

217
00:13:23.304 --> 00:13:26.404
They have motive as well.

218
00:13:26.734 --> 00:13:28.404
Just like you.

219
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:33.284
You were able to confirm
theirs, too? Which means...

220
00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:38.414
We haven't been able to verify
last night's alibis for...

221
00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:40.794
Shima-san, who plays Bocchan.

222
00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:43.294
Hotta-san, who plays Yama Arashi.

223
00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:45.624
Yoshikawa-san, who plays Nodaiko.

224
00:13:46.304 --> 00:13:49.304
You three are the only ones.

225
00:13:49.744 --> 00:13:52.004
Having an alibi is the bigger miracle.

226
00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:54.434
It was midnight.

227
00:13:54.674 --> 00:13:58.314
And we're suspects because
of that? Unbelievable.

228
00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:03.814
Indeed. We'll have to question you later.

229
00:14:04.004 --> 00:14:06.324
You mean we can't leave yet?

230
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:09.654
We appreciate your cooperation.

231
00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:19.444
We received testimony that those
three without alibis hated Uranari.

232
00:14:19.444 --> 00:14:21.304
Question everyone.

233
00:14:21.304 --> 00:14:24.074
Whether it's those three or Red Shirt,

234
00:14:24.074 --> 00:14:26.684
it's possible that someone mentioned
a desire to kill Uranari.

235
00:14:26.684 --> 00:14:28.214
If we can find that...

236
00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:30.344
Allow me to help.

237
00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:32.724
We should split up and help, too.

238
00:14:34.944 --> 00:14:39.564
You think I hated Uranari-kun?

239
00:14:39.564 --> 00:14:41.754
He was hard on you, wasn't he?

240
00:14:41.754 --> 00:14:44.484
My wife left me.

241
00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:47.484
She left me with massive amounts of debt.

242
00:14:47.764 --> 00:14:51.654
I have no choice but to work as hard
as I can in order to pay it off.

243
00:14:51.654 --> 00:14:53.314
What I'm asking about isâ

244
00:14:53.314 --> 00:14:55.164
But that damn Uranari.

245
00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:58.414
He hurled abuse at me for my weak acting!

246
00:14:58.644 --> 00:15:01.044
Who the hell does he think I'm playing?

247
00:15:04.024 --> 00:15:08.254
No adult man wants to play this role!

248
00:15:09.294 --> 00:15:12.264
He really is nothing like his role.

249
00:15:12.264 --> 00:15:15.014
My mom croaked last year.

250
00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.484
She was complaining until the end.

251
00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:21.024
She said I was trash who could never
hold down a job for very long.

252
00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:26.864
So I'm clinging to this job
to get back at my dead mom.

253
00:15:26.864 --> 00:15:28.364
But that damn Uranari!

254
00:15:28.364 --> 00:15:30.774
He tells us to act, but there
are limits to what a man can do!

255
00:15:32.334 --> 00:15:36.134
Besides, I don't care about justice.

256
00:15:38.914 --> 00:15:43.494
My mother still sends me encouraging letters.

257
00:15:43.494 --> 00:15:46.794
She says if I wish hard enough for
something, my dreams will come true.

258
00:15:47.024 --> 00:15:50.514
So I asked Uranari countless times

259
00:15:50.514 --> 00:15:53.924
to let me play Madonna
instead of Yama Arashi.

260
00:15:55.954 --> 00:16:01.414
But he never listened!

261
00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:06.344
Those three certainly hated Uranari-kun,

262
00:16:06.344 --> 00:16:08.414
but I doubt they had the guts to kill him.

263
00:16:08.414 --> 00:16:10.024
The guts?

264
00:16:10.784 --> 00:16:13.134
Anyway, this sure is good.

265
00:16:13.134 --> 00:16:16.534
Locust tsukudani is our specialty.

266
00:16:17.274 --> 00:16:19.084
So it's a fish called locust.

267
00:16:19.084 --> 00:16:21.654
It's not fish. They're grasshoppers.

268
00:16:21.654 --> 00:16:22.794
Grasshoppers?!

269
00:16:23.264 --> 00:16:26.164
Even if you don't like your
role, you just have to do it.

270
00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:29.674
Everyone was scouted for their specific role.

271
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.134
You were scouted, too?

272
00:16:32.724 --> 00:16:34.724
Based solely on my appearance.

273
00:16:37.684 --> 00:16:41.254
After all, I'm nothing like Kiyo-san either.

274
00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:51.314
I'm just happy to have a job here.

275
00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:54.324
Well, everyone would want to play Madonna-san.

276
00:16:54.824 --> 00:16:58.244
That's not what I meant.
I had a younger sister.

277
00:16:58.964 --> 00:17:01.304
She loved the novel "Bocchan."

278
00:17:01.304 --> 00:17:05.244
When she learned about this restaurant,
she said she wanted to work here.

279
00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:10.754
But six months ago, she died from an
illness called subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

280
00:17:13.984 --> 00:17:18.554
I thought I could work here in her
place, so I asked them to hire me.

281
00:17:19.034 --> 00:17:22.134
So you carried out your sister's wish.

282
00:17:23.124 --> 00:17:26.004
But maybe it was a mistake.

283
00:17:26.464 --> 00:17:32.114
If me working here caused a murder, then...

284
00:17:40.104 --> 00:17:43.524
I guess there's no need to keep
up the act in front of a child.

285
00:17:44.144 --> 00:17:49.034
Naturally, I knew that
everyone hated Uranari-kun.

286
00:17:49.584 --> 00:17:56.024
But you need people like
that to manage a business.

287
00:17:56.754 --> 00:18:01.634
Because he understood that,
he played the unlikable role.

288
00:18:01.954 --> 00:18:05.664
So he was an ideal business partner.

289
00:18:06.304 --> 00:18:09.644
But it's true that you were
romantic rivals, right?

290
00:18:10.444 --> 00:18:14.324
Opening Bocchan Restaurant has
been my dream since I was young.

291
00:18:14.324 --> 00:18:17.374
I worked really hard to
gather enough capital.

292
00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:20.314
I never experienced love or marriage.

293
00:18:20.864 --> 00:18:24.584
I can't believe I developed
a romantic rivalry at my age.

294
00:18:39.374 --> 00:18:42.174
We didn't find anything conclusive.

295
00:18:42.394 --> 00:18:48.434
Is the culprit one of
those three or Red Shirt?

296
00:18:49.284 --> 00:18:51.254
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

297
00:18:53.714 --> 00:18:55.764
However, the next day...

298
00:19:07.824 --> 00:19:11.454
"I offer my own death as an
apology to the man I killed."

299
00:19:11.704 --> 00:19:14.464
Inspector, this was found on
the altar in Red Shirt's home!

300
00:19:17.174 --> 00:19:20.344
That's probably the weapon
used in Uranari's murder.

301
00:19:22.104 --> 00:19:24.894
After killing his romantic rival Uranari,

302
00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:28.774
he realized he couldn't escape his
guilt, so he took his own life.

303
00:19:28.774 --> 00:19:33.434
I knew from the start that
the culprit was Red Shirt.

304
00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:38.084
Who started saying it was Bocchan and
Yama Arashi during the investigation?

305
00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:41.364
So it was Red Shirt.

306
00:19:41.624 --> 00:19:43.464
It must be hard for her.

307
00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:45.924
It's my fault...

308
00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:52.884
You mean she thinks it's because she was
trying to fulfill her sister's wish.

309
00:19:53.304 --> 00:19:54.534
You don't seem satisfied.

310
00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:57.994
If he really did it,

311
00:19:57.994 --> 00:20:00.634
then why leave the murder
weapon on the altar?

312
00:20:00.874 --> 00:20:02.814
Maybe he disposed of it initially,

313
00:20:02.814 --> 00:20:06.894
but once he decided to kill himself,
he left it there by way of apology.

314
00:20:07.334 --> 00:20:10.644
And why didn't he write his
note on a piece of paper?

315
00:20:11.314 --> 00:20:12.894
Because their handwriting would give it away.

316
00:20:13.184 --> 00:20:16.174
You mean Red Shirt's death wasn't a suicide?

317
00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:16.814
What?!

318
00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:19.234
I'm saying it's possible that it was faked.

319
00:20:19.814 --> 00:20:22.744
They knocked him out and
hanged him by the neck.

320
00:20:23.844 --> 00:20:26.184
Then they fabricated a suicide note

321
00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.584
and placed the murder weapon on the altar

322
00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:32.344
to frame Red Shirt for the
murder of Uranari-san.

323
00:20:32.854 --> 00:20:34.084
It's possible.

324
00:20:34.084 --> 00:20:36.754
If that's true, then they
must have left some evidence.

325
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.404
It's damp?

326
00:20:43.954 --> 00:20:46.764
There are drops of water on the leaves
of the branch beneath it, too.

327
00:20:48.154 --> 00:20:50.354
His hair and clothes are wet, too.

328
00:20:50.354 --> 00:20:51.514
Why?

329
00:20:51.514 --> 00:20:53.434
He just got out of the bath.

330
00:20:54.024 --> 00:20:57.184
You're getting in the way of
the adults! Get out of here!

331
00:20:57.494 --> 00:21:02.194
If Conan-kun is right, then the
culprit is one of those three.

332
00:21:02.504 --> 00:21:04.224
It could be Yama Arashi.

333
00:21:04.224 --> 00:21:07.624
He's big, so he could've carried Red Shirt.

334
00:21:07.624 --> 00:21:10.574
We still don't know that
the suicide was faked.

335
00:21:10.824 --> 00:21:16.404
If he could speak to us, we could
ask him who the culprit is.

336
00:21:16.404 --> 00:21:19.084
I wonder if he's all right.

337
00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:23.244
I'm glad he'll live, but...

338
00:21:23.244 --> 00:21:27.244
He was beaten all over, and
two of his legs were broken.

339
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.614
Then it couldn't have been possible.

340
00:21:28.614 --> 00:21:29.844
What's impossible?

341
00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:34.434
What's gotten into you?

342
00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:37.374
You found that cat here, right?

343
00:21:37.374 --> 00:21:39.184
He was meowing under there.

344
00:21:39.394 --> 00:21:42.204
Bocchan Restaurant is pretty far from here.

345
00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:46.444
A cat with two broken legs couldn't
have traveled that distance.

346
00:21:46.444 --> 00:21:48.244
You mean...?

347
00:21:48.494 --> 00:21:49.344
Yeah.

348
00:21:49.344 --> 00:21:53.744
That cat was attacked not at
Bocchan Restaurant, but near here.

349
00:21:53.744 --> 00:21:55.994
So, what?

350
00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:01.054
Edogawa-kun!

351
00:22:02.004 --> 00:22:04.004
It's a bloodstain. What's that?

352
00:22:04.304 --> 00:22:06.234
That cat's fur is stuck to it.

353
00:22:06.994 --> 00:22:10.514
The crime actually took
place here two nights ago!

354
00:22:18.154 --> 00:22:19.994
It's clear now.

355
00:22:19.994 --> 00:22:23.404
Red Shirt didn't kill Uranari-san.

356
00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:29.034
And Red Shirt's suicide was
also a disguised murder!

What's with the weird phrasing?

You think we did it?

Judging by the strength of the
force applied to his neck,

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.544
we believe it was applied by a third party.
