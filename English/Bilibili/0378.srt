1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,640
Time capsules come out one after another.

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,240
Gathering secrets that are scattered here and there.

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,940
Dig out the unexpected killer!

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,140
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:59,325
Doc, the members of the Youth Detective Squad and I,

8
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,525
came along on a weekend tour to Kibitsuji, Kurashiki in Okayama Prefecture

9
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:04,725
to study ancient history.

10
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:10,025
Out of the five people we met there, one person was killed.

11
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,925
A member of the group ends up being investigated as a major witness.

12
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,225
However, I had my doubts.

13
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:22,225
I see. So that's the story.

14
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,925
If so, the contents of the dying message would change.

15
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:28,825
The killer is among the four of them!

16
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:32,225
But in order to specify who it is,

17
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:35,125
the remaining two codes will have to be solved.

18
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:43,325
"Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 2)"

19
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,125
I don't have conclusive proof.

20
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:52,125
But if the motive of the murder has to do with the time capsule,

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,225
Then...

22
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,425
Let's continue deciphering the remaining code.

23
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:00,125
I agree! Let's finish what we started.

24
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:04,925
Although there's no treasure, I feel like we can't back off anymore.

25
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:08,725
Me, too! But what're we going to do?

26
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:11,225
The code was burned, wasn't it?

27
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,225
Right.

28
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,525
Thinking something like this could happen...

29
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:21,625
I, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, took notes!

30
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,425
All right, Mitsuhiko!

31
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:26,725
Good work, Mitsuhiko.

32
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:30,325
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad will launch the operation!

33
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,925
This is an umbrella.

34
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,625
And this is the sun, right?

35
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,925
You tried your best to copy it, didn't you?

36
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,725
I think this is!

37
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,325
Yes. That's it.

38
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:53,125
Doc sure is late.

39
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,825
I wonder what's taking him so long.

40
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,425
Isn't that his car?

41
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,225
We don't have all day, Doc!

42
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:01,725
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:04,025
And, where would you like me to take you?

44
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,825
To the neighboring Soja City.

45
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:07,725
The so-called Kibitsuji.

46
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:08,825
Roger!

47
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,925
Kibiji?

48
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,925
More accurately, called the Koumorizuka Tomb.

49
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,225
It's a famous tomb located in Kibitsuji.

50
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,025
Oh, I see!

51
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,925
This is it!

52
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,625
That's right, Genta.

53
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,825
It's an umbrella. "Koumori gasa (Umbrella)"

54
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,525
I see!

55
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:30,325
I almost forgot.

56
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:32,825
It's information regarding the case.

57
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:36,525
It seems that Mr. Saruwatari in place of Mr. Onitsura

58
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:40,425
is being questioned as a major witness.

59
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:44,025
Of course he's denying the charges.

60
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:47,025
Something about they found out that there was a change in cast

61
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,825
in the play that was performed 15 years ago.

62
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,025
A change?

63
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:54,125
It seems that Mr. Onitsura was not good at remembering his lines,

64
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:58,025
so he changed roles with Mr. Saruwatari.

65
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:03,525
So the possibility of the dying message "ONI" being Mr. Saruwatari came up.

66
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:06,125
He doesn't have an alibi and besides,

67
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,025
above all he was the one who was arguing with the victim.

68
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,825
It seems he soon may be arrested.

69
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,025
I kind of had a feeling

70
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:18,325
because dogs and monkeys don't get along. Just as I thought.

71
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:22,625
But in the story "Peach Boy", they work together to defeat the ogre.

72
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,725
That just goes to show that it's no more than a fairy tale after all.

73
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,825
It sure is a bit disappointing.

74
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:29,525
Anyway, let's hurry.

75
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:32,125
We've got to confirm all the capsules.

76
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:35,825
How beautiful.

77
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:39,125
There's something nostalgic about this.

78
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,525
In ancient times, this area was called the Land of Kibitsu,

79
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:46,825
and was said to be just as powerful as the Yamato Imperial Court!

80
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:51,125
Super!

81
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:55,125
This is the large key-hole shaped tomb, isn't it?

82
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,125
I'm sure we can go inside.

83
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,125
How scary.

84
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,425
This Komorizuka Tomb

85
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:06,525
is said have been built at the end of the 6th Century,

86
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:10,125
and in Kibitsuji a lot more other tombs have also been found.

87
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,725
It's really starting to get like we're treasure hunting.

88
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:15,425
But it's so fast that we've got lots of work to do.

89
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,725
We're capable of finding what we're looking for,

90
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,425
that's why we're called the Youth Detective Squad.

91
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:21,925
Besides, I'm sure that it's been dug over again anyway.

92
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,325
So it won't be hard to find.

93
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,325
There it is! I found it!

94
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:32,625
-Again? -Yes. Again.

95
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,225
It's dug over again by someone.

96
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,925
This is all that's inside.

97
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,725
What is this?

98
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:40,325
Is it a code again?

99
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,225
They've got us, Mitsuhiko.

100
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:46,925
That code's a dummy.

101
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,325
What? A dummy?

102
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,025
You mean it's fake?

103
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,325
Yes. Take a good look at the code.

104
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:56,525
A half folded umbrella under the sun.

105
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,125
There's no need to use it.

106
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,625
In other words, it's meaningless.

107
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,425
The real code is this new one here.

108
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,125
This is a shrine gate. And what's this?

109
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,225
A pot for cooking rice?

110
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:14,225
On top of it is a peach?

111
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,625
A shrine gate, rice cooker and peach.

112
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,225
Sounds familiar.

113
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,025
It's Kibitsu Shrine!

114
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,425
Kibitsu Shrine?

115
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,825
Yes!

116
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,525
It's the place where the hero...

117
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:37,825
Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto, who as legend has it, is enshrined!

118
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,025
You've really studied well beforehand. How amazing.

119
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,625
I see! The peach stands for Peach Boy

120
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,525
and the shrine gate stands for shrine.

121
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,625
Then, what about this pot?

122
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,625
That's...

123
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,625
I guess we'll find out if we go there.

124
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,825
I'll wait for all of you here.

125
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,725
-No fair. -No fair.

126
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:02,425
Hurry, Youth Detective Squad!

127
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,025
I'm tired.

128
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,125
I'm hungry.

129
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,425
Okay, let's go!

130
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,425
Wait, Conan!

131
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,725
Wait!

132
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,625
Let's take it slow.

133
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
I'm starved!

134
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,425
A rice cooker.

135
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,225
I see.

136
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,125
With the sound of the rice cooker

137
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,425
we can tell if our fortune is lucky or not.

138
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:43,225
Sounds interesting.

139
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,725
Okay! It's got to be somewhere around here.

140
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,025
Let's search.

141
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,825
I'm sure it's probably going to be dug over again.

142
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:52,425
That'll be our approach.

143
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,225
Here it is!

144
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,625
I guess it's not a dummy this time.

145
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,625
All that's inside is junk.

146
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,725
That's not nice.

147
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:07,425
It's their treasure of 15 years ago.

148
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:10,525
Shunya, please rest in peace.

149
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,925
Shunya.

150
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:15,025
He's the one who passed away in a traffic accident 15 years ago, right?

151
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:19,025
I see! The writings that we found in the capsules up to now

152
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,925
were all about Shunya!

153
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,625
Yes.

154
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,325
Most probably.

155
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:29,325
Which means that the remaining time capsule...

156
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:34,125
Are we going back to Kurashiki again?

157
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,525
A flower petal?

158
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,625
This is the pistil.

159
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,325
And this is the stem.

160
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,925
But it's scattered.

161
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:45,725
Maybe they're supposed to overlay one on top the other?

162
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:49,225
Could this be a water lily?

163
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:52,225
Right! Water lily in Kurashiki.

164
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,725
It's over there!

165
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,425
Where?

166
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:56,525
Over here!

167
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,225
Ohara art gallery?

168
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:00,925
Water lily.

169
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,725
How cute.

170
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:05,325
So the capsule is over here.

171
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:09,325
No. Water lilies were planted here only recently.

172
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,625
It says, the year 2000 in commemoration

173
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,325
of the 70th year since its establishment.

174
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,925
In other words, the water lily in the code

175
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:20,225
is referring to the drawing of a famous artist called Monet.

176
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,825
And most probably somewhere near the main building

177
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,325
where that drawing is exhibited.

178
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,525
This place is too big.

179
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:31,225
It was so easy until now, but...

180
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,325
Walk another 25 steps.

181
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:34,725
What's up?

182
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:38,825
Another 26 steps that is written on this code.

183
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:42,325
Could it be about this statue?

184
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:46,025
I see! It means that in the place after taking 25 more steps...

185
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,825
What?

186
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,225
I found it.

187
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:51,425
Fantastic, Ayumi.

188
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:54,125
It's amazing that you figured it out.

189
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,225
But how strange.

190
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:00,025
There doesn't seem to be any writing inside.

191
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,225
Just as I thought.

192
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,025
What's this?

193
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:05,425
Something is stuck to the bottom.

194
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:08,825
The envelope looks to be different from the ones up to now.

195
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,525
This is?

196
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:19,588
Well, everyone.

197
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:22,588
You are all acquaintances of that Sleeping Kogoro,

198
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:26,288
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

199
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:28,088
Mouri...

200
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,988
Kogoro.

201
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,288
That famous...

202
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:34,488
We just got word from Mr. Mouri a while ago,

203
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,788
telling us to get the details from Mr. Agasa.

204
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,088
Agasa.

205
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:40,388
Me?

206
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:45,688
I hear that you are just as good as Mr. Mouri in making deductions.

207
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:48,888
Who is this Mr. Kogoro?

208
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:51,788
Just what do you want with us at this point?

209
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:54,888
I'm counting on you, Doc.

210
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,688
Well...

211
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,188
Then, let me start my deduction.

212
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:10,988
About Mr. Saruwatari, who is thought will be arrested soon.

213
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:13,388
The fact is, he's innocent.

214
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:15,788
The real culprit is someone else.

215
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,188
That's what I kept trying to tell you!

216
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:20,788
What? Do you mean that it is Mr. Onitsura after all then?

217
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,488
You got to be kidding! I didn't do it!

218
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,888
Well, let me explain things in order.

219
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:30,188
15 years ago, you all put things that were precious to you

220
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,288
inside a time capsule and exchanged it with each other.

221
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,088
And each of you buried someone else's capsule.

222
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,888
Let me reconfirm something here.

223
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:43,388
Mr. Momoi hid Seiko's capsule in the Hinomi Watchtower.

224
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:48,188
Seiko hid Mr. Onitsura's capsule in the garden of the Ohashi residence.

225
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:53,788
Mr. Onitsura hid Mr. Saruwatari's capsule here in Ivy Square.

226
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:58,488
Mr. Saruwatari hid Yayoi's capsule or rather a dummy in Komorizuka,

227
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:01,688
and the actual capsule in Kibitsu Shrine.

228
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:06,188
And finally, Mr. Momoi's capsule in the Ohara Art Gallery.

229
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:10,188
This one was buried by Yayoi, am I right?

230
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:13,988
The members of the Youth Detective Squad dug the capsules out.

231
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:16,788
The problem is though, before the members of the squad got there,

232
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:19,488
every capsule was already dug over.

233
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:21,388
So like I said, the killer just wanted

234
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:23,688
to make it look like somebody broke into school.

235
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:27,388
There's one thing we just can't seem to understand.

236
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,988
Why was only Mr. Momoi's capsule missing something in writing

237
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:34,588
that was included in everybody else's capsule?

238
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:39,988
It just didn't appeal to me to bury something like that.

239
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,388
That's all there is to it.

240
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,388
No. I'll bet it was actually inside.

241
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:48,188
You removed it and got rid of it.

242
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,188
But Seiko happened to see you.

243
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:52,088
Isn't that it, Mr. Momoi?

244
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,088
What?

245
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,688
You?

246
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:56,688
Naoto?

247
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:57,788
You got to be kidding!

248
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,488
What proof do you have?

249
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,088
Let me explain.

250
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,888
First, the dying message.

251
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:06,588
The point is the position of the victim's finger.

252
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:08,288
Position of her finger?

253
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:11,488
Seiko, the victim, was left handed.

254
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:15,788
Therefore, she would've written her dying message with her right hand.

255
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,288
But if so, the position of her finger is odd.

256
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,588
Her finger should've near the last "I" of the message,

257
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:24,688
but it was by the first letter, "O".

258
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:26,388
True.

259
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:31,688
By the way, left handed people usually right their letters in reverse.

260
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,188
Don't you think the same goes for this?

261
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:36,588
That is, viewed from the position of the finger,

262
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,588
it was not written from left to right,

263
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,688
but rather, from right to left backwards.

264
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:46,288
And if the part that is erased is connected with a line...

265
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:47,388
I see!

266
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:51,188
It wasn't "ONI" but rather, she tried to write "Momo"!

267
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:52,788
Exactly!

268
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:58,088
In other words, "ONI" neither meant Mr. Onitsura nor Mr. Saruwatari,

269
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:00,588
but was pointing out that Mr. Momoi is the killer.

270
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,888
That's ridiculous!

271
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,388
That's all nothing but imagination!

272
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,288
I even have an alibi!

273
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:08,088
Yayoi.

274
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,688
You were walking together with Mr. Momoi

275
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:12,688
through the Fine Sights district, is that right?

276
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:16,188
You said you only separated for five minutes to go to the restroom.

277
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,488
Yes.

278
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:21,288
It's not obvious, but it's really nothing once you know about it.

279
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,988
Can you continue, Youth Detective Squad?

280
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:25,988
Yes!

281
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,688
The Ivy Square and Fine Sights District

282
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:31,288
are actually located back to back.

283
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,188
If you walk on the outside in front, they seem to be some distance apart,

284
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:37,388
but if you walk within the grounds or the buildings, they are very near!

285
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:40,788
A round trip takes 1 minute 50 seconds!

286
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:45,788
He probably made Seiko wait here beforehand.

287
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,188
Then he came to her and killed her.

288
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,288
Then, ran back.

289
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,388
Naoto?

290
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:53,188
No! That's a lie!

291
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:58,588
And after he killed Seiko,

292
00:15:58,588 --> 00:16:00,988
he dug over the capsules in this area.

293
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:03,388
It should've taken him about an hour.

294
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:05,988
So the time of the crime would've been about 14:00.

295
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:13,688
Wasn't he out of your sight for about an hour?

296
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:17,088
True. He said he wanted to go check something

297
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:19,688
so he was going to the bookstores and to the library.

298
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,188
You're only making assumptions.

299
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,288
You have no evidence to support what you're saying at all!

300
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:28,088
There is proof in your wallet.

301
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,788
My wallet?

302
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:35,788
You, the killer, in order to make it look

303
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:39,188
as if Mr. Onitsura, the alleged killer, broke into school,

304
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,988
removed the contents inside the victim's wallet.

305
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:44,488
However, since you couldn't just dispose of it,

306
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:46,688
you put it inside your wallet.

307
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,888
You still have it with you, don't you?

308
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,488
Tell me, will you?

309
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,588
Just what proof do you have to say

310
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,988
that the money from Seiko's wallet is in my wallet?

311
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:58,588
Officer Tsuyama, did you bring the you-know-what here?

312
00:16:58,588 --> 00:16:59,988
Oh, yes.

313
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,988
The thing that Mr. Mouri told me about on the phone.

314
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,588
This, right?

315
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,488
Officer Tsuyama, please check the wallet.

316
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:11,088
Do you see one bill in there that has something odd stuck to it?

317
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,188
Odd?

318
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,688
This is...

319
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,188
So what about it?

320
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:20,488
If a bill is dirty, does that make me the killer?

321
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:21,988
Mr. Momoi.

322
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:25,288
How are you going to explain this?

323
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:31,288
Normally it would only look as if the stamp of the ticket smeared off.

324
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:36,788
Only in your wallet there was the other half of the stamp mark

325
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:41,588
that was found on this pamphlet of the art gallery.

326
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,988
Seiko probably put the ticket on top of the pamphlet

327
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:47,688
then put them inside her wallet.

328
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,688
Not knowing that, Mr. Momoi,

329
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:54,288
you left the pamphlet back at the site and took only the bill with you.

330
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:55,988
Thanks to the admission stamp,

331
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,788
you took the bill that coincidentally became a pair.

332
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:08,388
It's because Seiko and that thing 15 years ago.

333
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:14,588
Because she started investigating what happened 15 years ago.

334
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:19,888
15 years ago, everything started back then.

335
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,488
Momoi, as a boy back then,

336
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:24,488
was bullied by other kids.

337
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:27,088
That day, when Momoi was being forced to shoplift by bullies,

338
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:29,488
he was seen by Shunya.

339
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,888
Momoi.

340
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:36,088
I thought he was going to squeak on me.

341
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:39,188
That he'd tell the teacher and my parents.

342
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:40,588
That's what I thought.

343
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,488
Back then, Momoi never spoke of anyone about that incident.

344
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,688
But because of his feeling of guilt,

345
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,788
he impulsively wrote the truth and put it inside the time capsule.

346
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,788
I was graduating anyway,

347
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,488
and I get to sever ties with those guys, too.

348
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:59,988
I thought that we'd never be digging the capsules out again.

349
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:01,388
Back then...

350
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:06,188
Three days ago, I got a call from Seiko,

351
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,988
saying that since she's going to hold an interview,

352
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,988
she'd like to dig out the capsules while she's at it.

353
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:13,988
And you snuck into school just for that one piece of paper.

354
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,888
You didn't have to kill her!

355
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,888
All you had to do was throw that paper away somewhere.

356
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:19,688
Then it would've been done and over with.

357
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:24,488
Where do you think I am now?

358
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,988
You know the capsule that I buried?

359
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:31,788
When I came to look for it, it was already dug up.

360
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,888
You're the only one who could've done it, right?

361
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:37,788
You're the only one who knew that I was going to dig out the time capsule.

362
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,588
Why did you do this?

363
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,388
Don't tell me

364
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:43,988
that I could've written some kind of scoop article about it?

365
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,588
She always used to bluff from before!

366
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,788
She just put a leading question to you.

367
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,988
I was scared.

368
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,988
I felt like she knew everything.

369
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,888
Miss.

370
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:59,588
I found this inside the last capsule.

371
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:02,588
We'll hear you out at the station then, Mr. Momoi.

372
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:03,688
Wait!

373
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,088
Please.

374
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:09,588
All together. For the last time, I'd like to go all together.

375
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,688
There's a place I really want to go.

376
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:17,988
You're the one who put this code inside the capsule and buried it, right?

377
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:22,688
I was asked by Shunya, a while before he died,

378
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,888
that he wanted to go with everybody to bury the capsule.

379
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:29,888
But after the accident, I was too scared to look inside and didn't look.

380
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:32,888
That code is an anagram, right?

381
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:37,388
Yes, it's opened in hiragana then you line it up backwards in order.

382
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,488
Monomokidanon...

383
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,988
Momodanonani...

384
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:43,988
Peach Tree Adventure Squad!

385
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,288
That used to be the name of our group!

386
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,188
We used to frequently gather here.

387
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:52,088
When we had to wait for each other or when we were practicing "Peach Boy".

388
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,888
This is Shunya's...

389
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:01,188
Momoi looked so cool in his "Peach Boy" character.

390
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:04,988
Next time, I'm going to be Peach Boy and rescue Momoi.

391
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:08,288
I'm going to make him stop listening to those guys!

392
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:11,788
But it's got to be kept a secret from teacher or his parents.

393
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:14,688
No matter what. No matter what.

394
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,188
No way.

395
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:23,488
Maybe Shunya ran onto the road because he wanted to help you.

396
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:25,288
Stop bullying my friend!

397
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,888
If only I remembered it back then.

398
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:35,188
I kind of knew, although I was a child

399
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,788
that it was no ordinary traffic accident.

400
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:42,288
But I couldn't say or do anything. I'm just as guilty.

401
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:44,988
As for me, I didn't feel a thing.

402
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:46,788
So I'm even guiltier.

403
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:53,888
I probably looked like an ogre.

404
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:59,088
The ogre in your heart can only be defeated by you yourself alone.

405
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,788
Yes. Because you're Peach Boy.

406
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:33,788
Lover's...

407
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,688
Just come along.

408
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:36,988
All right!

409
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:40,888
Now, you're my Peach Boy, Conan!

410
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:42,888
Bummers.

411
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,488
-Then, what about us? -Then, what about us?

412
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:47,088
Genta is the pig!

413
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:49,088
Mitsuhiko is the water sprite!

414
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,488
Those are "Son Goku's" characters.

415
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:57,388
You guys! Then, am I a hot dog?

416
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:04,388
"Next Episode"

417
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,688
Kimono Demon?

418
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:10,688
In other words, this is a locked room closed off by the snow.

419
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,488
I wonder what Ran and the others are doing?

420
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:20,888
The folklore of the Kimono Demon.

421
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:29,676
Next Conan, "The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 1)"

422
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,815
Next Conan Hint's:

423
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,715
"Outdoor bath"

424
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:37,315
-A secluded Japanese hot spring inn. -Curse of the kimono?

425
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:39,015
I don't understand the meaning after all.
