1
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.370
Yumi!

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.870
Yumi, wait!

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
Officer Chiba?

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.070
I just checked with the traffic department

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.570
and was told that you were patrolling Haido-cho on October 4th.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.570
October 4th?

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.870
You mean, that unusually hot day.

8
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.170
Did you see anything while you were on patrol?

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.770
Like what?

10
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.970
Don't tell me you're still investigating that weird case.

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.270
Yes, sort of.

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.270
Only the victim and that man were at the scene, right?

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.570
So why don't you just bring him in and get him to confess?

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.870
No, I can't do that.

15
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.170
Kazunobu Chiba.

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.270
He has an exceptionally strong sense of justice.

17
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.870
He's my childhood friend

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.770
and my first love.

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.470
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

20
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.570
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

21
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.570
Here's another fretful couple.

22
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.770
A queer case brings them close together?

23
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.470
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.870
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:07.811
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 1)"

27
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:10.211
Kazunobu Chiba.

28
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.111
-So, did you see anything? -He has an exceptionally strong sense of justice.

29
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:16.211
-No! I didn't see anything suspicious, okay? -He's my childhood friend

30
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.211
and my first love.

31
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:20.311
I'm going home then.

32
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:22.611
I've got a TV program I want to watch too.

33
00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:24.311
Don't cross!

34
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.511
The signal's red!

35
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:28.911
Who cares?

36
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:31.611
There are no cars

37
00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.311
and nobody's watching.

38
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.811
I'm watching.

39
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.711
And you're watching too.

40
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:40.211
If you go easy on yourself and break the rules once,

41
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:42.111
it can turn into a habit!

42
00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:45.211
And habits aren't easy to fix!

43
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:47.911
You don't know something as simple as that?

44
00:03:57.411 --> 00:04:00.211
His only faults are that he's a little too strict about rules

45
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:05.111
and that he still doesn't remember me.

46
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.411
-How about you? -What?

47
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.411
You were riding the mini patrol car together with Yumi, weren't you?

48
00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:13.611
Don't you remember if you saw something weird that day?

49
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:15.211
I know it was three months ago,

50
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:17.211
but if you think it over calmly, I'm sure you'll remember.

51
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:18.411
Jeez.

52
00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.511
You're the one who needs to remember!

53
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:23.411
-What? -Well, you know...

54
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.911
Weird like what?

55
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:30.511
Well, like...

56
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:32.011
an alien, maybe?

57
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.511
-What? -An alien?

58
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.711
Of course not, right?

59
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:41.511
I'll go ask somebody else!

60
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:45.711
Gee, he's so dense.

61
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:49.211
Did he gain weight again?

62
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.711
You think so?

63
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:54.111
He looks to be a little rounder.

64
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:57.411
He's more than round. He's obese. Obese!

65
00:04:57.411 --> 00:04:59.811
He'll die young!

66
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:03.411
He's the type you wouldn't want for a boyfriend, right?

67
00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:05.011
I know what you mean.

68
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:08.011
Even if he were to be the last man in this universe,

69
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:10.111
I wouldn't go with Officer Chiba!

70
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:11.711
Hey, you two!

71
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.511
Quit chatting and get going on patrol!

72
00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:16.211
-Yes, ma'am! -Yes, ma'am!

73
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.811
Hey, you look scary.

74
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:31.411
Yes, coming.

75
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:33.211
Hello, manager.

76
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:35.811
A package arrived for you,

77
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:37.511
so I kept it for you.

78
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.711
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:42.511
Be careful when you open it though.

80
00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:46.211
There was something strange written in the sender's field.

81
00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:51.911
Your biggest fan in the universe?

82
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:55.411
"Mouri Detective Agency"

83
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:57.611
An alien?

84
00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:00.311
Are you asking me to search for an alien?

85
00:06:00.311 --> 00:06:01.611
Yes!

86
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.111
You're asking me the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri?

87
00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:07.411
Well, it says so on your website.

88
00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:10.011
"Hina Wada (17)" -We'll travel to the end of the universe

89
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.411
"Haido High School, Second-Year" -to search for missing people.

90
00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:13.811
The Mouri Detective Agency.

91
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:17.711
That just means I'm willing to work that hard.

92
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.811
She's not asking you to go on a space hunt, you know.

93
00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:23.411
Right, Hina?

94
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:27.711
Yes! I definitely saw it with my own eyes.

95
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:29.711
An Unidentified Flying Object.

96
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.211
Unidentified Flying Object?

97
00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:35.511
UFO?

98
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.211
What kind of shape was it?

99
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:40.811
It was a long slender cylinder shape.

100
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:44.111
A cigar type UFO!

101
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:46.511
You saw it near Haido Park, right?

102
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:49.611
Yeah, while I was jogging with my club.

103
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:53.311
But are you sure it wasn't a blimp?

104
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:56.411
They're shapes are similar you see.

105
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:59.611
Similar...

106
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:02.611
Come to think of it, the Sister From Another Domain

107
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:04.911
that Sera's hiding in her hotel room

108
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:07.711
looked a lot like Haibara.

109
00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:11.011
If they're related,

110
00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:14.011
that would mean Sera's older brother, Akai,

111
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:17.011
and Haibara are related too.

112
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:18.411
Wait, wait.

113
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:22.911
Haibara's older sister, Akemi Miyano and Akai used to be...

114
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.811
Conan?

115
00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.811
What're you doing, Conan?

116
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:28.311
Aren't you coming?

117
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.911
Go where?

118
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:33.411
To the place where Hina witnessed the UFO.

119
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:37.911
Yoko played an extraterrestrial investigator on TV the other day,

120
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:41.511
so Dad's really into UFOs right now.

121
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:47.811
You're in the karate club too, Hina?

122
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:51.111
That's why you know each other even though you go to different schools.

123
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:52.311
That's right.

124
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:56.911
We usually run into each other at the semi-finals of karate tournaments.

125
00:07:56.911 --> 00:08:00.011
I've never beaten Ran, though.

126
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.511
No wonder she looked familiar.

127
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:06.411
And, I saw the UFO

128
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:09.211
at our summer training camp.

129
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:12.511
I told the other club members and my friends,

130
00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:14.411
but they didn't believe me.

131
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:19.011
Then I remembered that Ran's dad was the Sleeping Kogoro!

132
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:20.611
If UFOs exist,

133
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:22.811
I thought aliens do too.

134
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:24.211
So I figured no harm trying

135
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:27.011
and sent Ran an e-mail to ask for help finding it.

136
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:31.011
And? What if aliens actually do exist?

137
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.711
I'll ask them why they came to Earth,

138
00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:34.511
or about the planet they're from

139
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:37.111
and if they'll let me ride their craft.

140
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:40.111
I've got so many things I want to ask them.

141
00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:44.711
But they may be super unfriendly aliens, you know.

142
00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:45.911
Of course!

143
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:48.811
If so, we'll talk with our fists!

144
00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:51.211
That's what I practice karate for!

145
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:53.211
I see.

146
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.011
This is the place, right here!

147
00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:08.711
I saw the UFO flying between the two trees.

148
00:09:08.711 --> 00:09:11.111
It went into Haido Park,

149
00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:15.311
I rushed up the stairs and looked around inside the park,

150
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:18.211
but couldn't find anything.

151
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:21.311
I was jogging and didn't have my cell phone,

152
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.511
so I couldn't take pictures either, you see.

153
00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:26.711
But if you were jogging together with the members of the training camp,

154
00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.111
maybe some other members saw it too.

155
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:31.611
But the thing is,

156
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:35.811
I had muscle pains because I worked so hard on my "Beat Ranmaru" practice,

157
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:40.311
so only I had a different menu from everyone else and was running slow.

158
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:41.511
Ranmaru?

159
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:44.711
Well, Mouri Ran sounds a lot like Mori Ranmaru,

160
00:09:44.711 --> 00:09:46.811
so that's what I call it.

161
00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:50.011
Beat Nobunaga's sycophant! You know, like so.

162
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:52.511
Really?

163
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.611
What? Isn't this place...

164
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.111
And? How's Natsuko doing?

165
00:09:59.111 --> 00:10:01.811
Well, she's seriously injured with a depressed skull fracture.

166
00:10:01.811 --> 00:10:04.411
The surgery somehow finished,

167
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:05.811
but she has regained consciousness yet.

168
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:07.111
I see.

169
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:11.411
How did you figure out that maybe she was a school teacher?

170
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.411
Inside the bag that was on the ground near her,

171
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:17.211
there were quite a few sheets of answer sheets inside it.

172
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:20.111
Rather, what brings you here, Conan?

173
00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:23.211
I was taking a drive with him, you see.

174
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:28.911
Were those answer sheets still blank with no names or answers written in?

175
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.311
Well, the answers were already written in

176
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:34.611
and all finished grading too.

177
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:39.411
Then I don't think that teacher was attacked here.

178
00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:40.411
-What? -What?

179
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:47.411
Aren't these the stairs that Ms. Jodie's friend,

180
00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:50.711
Ms. Shibuya was pushed off from?

181
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:52.911
What? Really?

182
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:55.811
Ms. Jodie told me so!

183
00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:58.711
Right. Ran didn't know about it.

184
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:02.911
Ms. Shibuya is a teacher at Haido Elementary

185
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:06.411
and she seems to have been using these stairs on her way back home.

186
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:10.011
So, I'm sure the elementary school is near here too.

187
00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:11.511
I see.

188
00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:14.811
She could've mistook something that they flew from the elementary school

189
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:18.311
during science class for a UFO.

190
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:20.611
I don't think so.

191
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:23.311
Elementary schools were on summer vacation.

192
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:27.211
And the object came flying from the direction of my high school.

193
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:32.811
Well, on that day aside from our karate club using the gym,

194
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:34.911
there was nobody else there.

195
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:36.711
Haido High School?

196
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:38.911
I've always wanted to visit it.

197
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:41.811
We can go there, but I don't think we can go inside.

198
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:44.111
Why not?

199
00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:46.011
In the beginning of October,

200
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.311
there was a murder on the campus of the school building

201
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:50.511
that's being renovated now.

202
00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:52.511
It's winter vacation now,

203
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.211
so even we the students of the school

204
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:57.511
have a super hard time trying to get in.

205
00:12:09.278 --> 00:12:10.878
You're right.

206
00:12:10.878 --> 00:12:13.878
There are police cars parked in front of the back gate.

207
00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:16.778
Ran. Come, this way.

208
00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:22.778
This lock is broken, you see.

209
00:12:22.778 --> 00:12:24.078
It opens.

210
00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.778
-See! -Yeah, but...

211
00:12:30.578 --> 00:12:33.978
Hey, are you sure it's okay?

212
00:12:41.478 --> 00:12:46.078
This looks to be the site of the murder.

213
00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:49.278
Come to think of it, I saw it on the news.

214
00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:51.778
Something about a body covered with concrete

215
00:12:51.778 --> 00:12:55.078
was found on the campus of a certain high school.

216
00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:57.878
The name of the high school wasn't publicized,

217
00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:01.078
but I didn't think it was at Haido High School.

218
00:13:01.078 --> 00:13:03.278
But, wait.

219
00:13:03.278 --> 00:13:05.678
I think they found another body next to the corpse

220
00:13:05.678 --> 00:13:08.678
that was immersed in concrete lying next to it.

221
00:13:08.678 --> 00:13:12.378
He seems to have been incoherent,

222
00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:14.578
so it was concluded that the man was the perp.

223
00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:18.478
I thought that this case had long been solved.

224
00:13:18.478 --> 00:13:21.078
Hey, what with you guys?

225
00:13:21.078 --> 00:13:23.178
This place is off limits!

226
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.378
Mr. Mouri?

227
00:13:25.378 --> 00:13:26.778
Officer Chiba?

228
00:13:26.778 --> 00:13:29.778
Just what are you doing here?

229
00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:31.478
What?

230
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:35.178
Well, we were listening to this cute client of mine

231
00:13:35.178 --> 00:13:37.878
and happened to arrive here.

232
00:13:39.478 --> 00:13:44.478
Any rate, unauthorized personnel are not allowed.

233
00:13:44.478 --> 00:13:46.778
Are you feeling sick?

234
00:13:46.778 --> 00:13:48.278
No.

235
00:13:49.278 --> 00:13:53.078
I got off the police car partway and came, so...

236
00:13:53.078 --> 00:13:54.778
Why?

237
00:13:54.778 --> 00:13:57.378
The other day, I received a package.

238
00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:02.378
There was a fat file inside the package

239
00:14:02.378 --> 00:14:07.378
that described in length how obesity can lead to causes hyperglycemia,

240
00:14:07.378 --> 00:14:09.578
high cholesterol,

241
00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:12.178
high blood pressure,

242
00:14:12.178 --> 00:14:16.378
and increases the risk of diabetes,

243
00:14:16.378 --> 00:14:24.078
coronary infarction and strokes.

244
00:14:24.078 --> 00:14:27.578
After that various dieting methods were described,

245
00:14:27.578 --> 00:14:32.378
so I've been putting everything into practice left and right.

246
00:14:32.378 --> 00:14:33.678
Are you sure

247
00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:36.978
you're not being conned into buying supplements that are totally useless?

248
00:14:36.978 --> 00:14:41.978
No, there was nothing inside that advertised buying something.

249
00:14:41.978 --> 00:14:44.778
Besides, the handwriting of the sender,

250
00:14:44.778 --> 00:14:47.178
I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before.

251
00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:51.478
Never mind that and tell us more about the case, Officer Chiba.

252
00:14:51.478 --> 00:14:55.178
We're always helping you solve the case, aren't we?

253
00:14:55.178 --> 00:14:57.478
Jeez.

254
00:14:57.478 --> 00:15:01.878
The victim was a magazine editor, Mr. Kyogo Nakatsu,

255
00:15:01.878 --> 00:15:03.978
42 years old.

256
00:15:03.978 --> 00:15:06.078
He was lying face down

257
00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:08.378
"Kyogo Nakatsu (42), Magazine Editor" -with his face pressed into the concrete.

258
00:15:08.378 --> 00:15:10.178
The cause of death was suffocation.

259
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:16.878
Lying next to him, face up in the concrete

260
00:15:16.878 --> 00:15:20.978
"Yusuke Kuchiki (38), Unemployed" -was unemployed Mr. Yusuke Kuchiki,

261
00:15:20.978 --> 00:15:23.178
age 38.

262
00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:26.278
He frequently submitted photos

263
00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:28.978
to the UFO magazines Mr. Nakatsu was editor of.

264
00:15:28.978 --> 00:15:30.378
6 months ago,

265
00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:34.178
witnesses saw them arguing violently in the editorial office,

266
00:15:34.178 --> 00:15:35.778
so there is definitely a motive for murder.

267
00:15:35.778 --> 00:15:38.878
Then, the man must've killed him

268
00:15:38.878 --> 00:15:41.978
by pressing the victim's face into the concrete.

269
00:15:41.978 --> 00:15:45.478
The victim didn't inhale any concrete

270
00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:49.478
and he definitely fell onto the concrete after he was murdered.

271
00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:54.878
And we know that the victim wasn't suffocated with a string like weapon,

272
00:15:54.878 --> 00:16:00.578
but rather a bag-like thing that was pulled over his head.

273
00:16:00.578 --> 00:16:03.878
But that bag-like weapon can't be found.

274
00:16:03.878 --> 00:16:06.678
It was probably blown away by the wind,

275
00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:10.678
or stuffed with rocks and thrown far away.

276
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:13.578
On the day of the murder, there was no wind

277
00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:16.878
and a bag containing rocks can only be thrown so far

278
00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:18.178
and it won't be that hard to find.

279
00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:22.278
And? What is that man saying?

280
00:16:22.278 --> 00:16:25.478
That he's not the one who killed Mr. Nakatsu.

281
00:16:25.478 --> 00:16:28.578
He said that an alien who came down from the UFO

282
00:16:28.578 --> 00:16:31.478
killed Mr. Nakatsu while afloat in the air.

283
00:16:31.478 --> 00:16:35.878
Then went back inside the UFO and flew off.

284
00:16:35.878 --> 00:16:37.278
An alien?

285
00:16:38.778 --> 00:16:42.478
See! So aliens do exist after all!

286
00:16:42.478 --> 00:16:43.878
Yeah.

287
00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:48.078
No, it's not an alien.

288
00:16:48.078 --> 00:16:52.478
This is a murder committed by a human!

289
00:16:53.878 --> 00:16:57.278
Hey, hey. Don't tell me you really believe

290
00:16:57.278 --> 00:16:59.578
that an alien comes down from a UFO

291
00:16:59.578 --> 00:17:02.378
and kills a person in mid-air,

292
00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:05.578
goes back into the UFO and flees.

293
00:17:05.578 --> 00:17:08.778
Well, I don't want to believe it,

294
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.878
but the victim, Mr. Kyogo Nakatsu

295
00:17:10.878 --> 00:17:15.478
was definitely suffocated with a bag pulled over his head

296
00:17:15.478 --> 00:17:19.078
before falling onto the concrete.

297
00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:22.978
And Yusuke Kuchiki who was lying in the concrete next to him

298
00:17:22.978 --> 00:17:26.278
didn't have any bag

299
00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:30.278
nor have we found it anywhere nearby either.

300
00:17:30.278 --> 00:17:33.078
So, judging from the circumstances, Mr. Kuchiki's story of the alien

301
00:17:33.078 --> 00:17:34.978
is starting to sound plausible.

302
00:17:34.978 --> 00:17:39.778
He could've suffocated him somewhere else, carried the corpse over here

303
00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:42.678
and throw him onto the concrete, right?

304
00:17:42.678 --> 00:17:44.778
I don't think so.

305
00:17:44.778 --> 00:17:45.778
What?

306
00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:49.978
Look. The footprints of the two in the concrete.

307
00:17:49.978 --> 00:17:52.878
You can tell both of them walked on their own.

308
00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:55.578
And there aren't any traces of a body having been dragged.

309
00:17:55.578 --> 00:17:58.078
Then the perp carried the victim on his back

310
00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.278
and went onto the concrete.

311
00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:02.878
After laying the victim down in the concrete,

312
00:18:02.878 --> 00:18:06.678
the perp got out, changed his shoes

313
00:18:06.678 --> 00:18:09.178
and went back into the concrete.

314
00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:12.178
After putting the first pair of shoes on the victim's feet,

315
00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:15.278
he deliberately fell onto the concrete.

316
00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:16.678
If that's what happened,

317
00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:20.178
the footprints of the time he carried the victim onto the concrete

318
00:18:20.178 --> 00:18:22.578
have to be much deeper, right?

319
00:18:22.578 --> 00:18:25.978
But all the footprints are about the same depth, you know.

320
00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:28.878
Besides, all the footprints are facing that way,

321
00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:33.778
so I doubt he left before the concrete hardened.

322
00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:37.878
Then, maybe he got up after the concrete hardened,

323
00:18:37.878 --> 00:18:39.978
left the concrete once,

324
00:18:39.978 --> 00:18:43.478
got rid of the murder weapon bag somewhere,

325
00:18:43.478 --> 00:18:46.678
came back and lay back down in the concrete the same way.

326
00:18:46.678 --> 00:18:49.078
He had no reason to come back.

327
00:18:49.078 --> 00:18:53.278
Besides, when the construction workers came back to check on the concrete,

328
00:18:53.278 --> 00:18:55.578
the concrete had hardened completely

329
00:18:55.578 --> 00:19:00.778
that it was really tough trying to pull them out.

330
00:19:00.778 --> 00:19:03.778
Then maybe an alien is the perp after all?

331
00:19:03.778 --> 00:19:05.678
I don't think that's possible either.

332
00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:06.778
-What? -What?

333
00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:10.178
The person who was killed was lying face down

334
00:19:10.178 --> 00:19:13.978
and the other person was lying face up, right?

335
00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:15.578
Yeah.

336
00:19:15.578 --> 00:19:18.678
He said that he was exposed to a strong light and lost consciousness.

337
00:19:18.678 --> 00:19:21.478
Then, the shape in the foreground

338
00:19:21.478 --> 00:19:23.878
must be of the man who was lying next to the victim, right?

339
00:19:23.878 --> 00:19:26.078
Because you can see the shape of his butt.

340
00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:27.878
If so, this person seems to have laid down

341
00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:31.178
with his jacket hood over his head.

342
00:19:31.178 --> 00:19:32.478
So?

343
00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:35.778
Maybe he was just wearing his hood because it was cold?

344
00:19:35.778 --> 00:19:38.778
But this incident according to the TV news

345
00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.878
happened on October 4, right?

346
00:19:40.878 --> 00:19:42.078
That's right.

347
00:19:42.078 --> 00:19:44.878
It was when they were having the Haidocho Festival.

348
00:19:44.878 --> 00:19:47.978
Oh, right. That unusually hot day.

349
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:51.878
It was hot, yet he was wearing the hood.

350
00:19:51.878 --> 00:19:53.278
I see!

351
00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:56.678
He fell knowing that the concrete would harden.

352
00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:58.278
Unless he wore the hood,

353
00:19:58.278 --> 00:20:01.278
his hair would get stuck inside the hardened concrete,

354
00:20:01.278 --> 00:20:04.078
making it difficult to remove.

355
00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.578
If so,

356
00:20:05.578 --> 00:20:07.278
the person who was lying in the concrete together with the victim

357
00:20:07.278 --> 00:20:09.078
is the perp after all.

358
00:20:09.078 --> 00:20:12.178
There could've been an accomplice nearby too.

359
00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:14.578
There was no accomplice.

360
00:20:14.578 --> 00:20:16.878
The only way you can get into this school

361
00:20:16.878 --> 00:20:19.478
without going through the front or back gate is

362
00:20:19.478 --> 00:20:22.278
by using this door with the broken lock.

363
00:20:23.578 --> 00:20:25.278
See!

364
00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:27.078
We checked the footage

365
00:20:27.078 --> 00:20:30.078
on the security camera attached to that lamppost and found...

366
00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:31.378
On that day,

367
00:20:31.378 --> 00:20:34.678
only those two were seen entering.

368
00:20:34.678 --> 00:20:39.378
Then, the part where the victim was murdered wasn't recorded?

369
00:20:39.378 --> 00:20:41.978
No. It was a matter of the angle.

370
00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:45.678
But after the two entered, a while later,

371
00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:46.878
something strange was in view.

372
00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.578
Something strange?

373
00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:53.378
It went past from above and below the scene.

374
00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:56.978
A large, slender, creepy-shaped thing!

375
00:20:56.978 --> 00:21:00.078
It went over the fence to the other side and headed towards Haido Park.

376
00:21:00.078 --> 00:21:03.578
Maybe that's the same UFO that I saw?

377
00:21:03.578 --> 00:21:05.478
What? You saw it too?

378
00:21:05.478 --> 00:21:08.878
Yes! A slender cigar-type UFO!

379
00:21:08.878 --> 00:21:11.178
I saw it during summer vacation though.

380
00:21:11.178 --> 00:21:15.578
Goodness! So, aliens exist after all!

381
00:21:15.578 --> 00:21:20.678
But that alien could be a killer, you know?

382
00:21:21.678 --> 00:21:26.678
In that case, we'll help them have a change of heart using our fists.

383
00:21:26.678 --> 00:21:29.078
I wonder if you can make them have a change of heart.

384
00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:33.678
The man who was with the victim is probably the perp,

385
00:21:33.678 --> 00:21:36.978
but some unknown entity could also be involved.

386
00:21:37.978 --> 00:21:41.978
By the way, what is the concrete here for?

387
00:21:41.978 --> 00:21:44.678
It seems they were planning to put a sculpture here

388
00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.478
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Haido High School.

389
00:21:47.478 --> 00:21:51.878
The construction was supposed to be finished by summer vacation,

390
00:21:51.878 --> 00:21:55.478
but it was postponed for some reason till autumn.

391
00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:05.978
The victim was lying face down in the concrete

392
00:22:05.978 --> 00:22:09.478
and suffocated to death.

393
00:22:09.478 --> 00:22:11.578
The man next to him was wearing his hood

394
00:22:11.578 --> 00:22:14.778
and lying face up in the concrete.

395
00:22:14.778 --> 00:22:18.078
That man says that an alien flew down in a UFO

396
00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:20.278
and murdered the victim while floating in mid-air.

397
00:22:20.278 --> 00:22:23.478
Then got back on the UFO and flew off.

398
00:22:23.478 --> 00:22:26.678
And the large, slender, creepy shaped object

399
00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:30.078
that was recorded on the security camera...

400
00:23:54.378 --> 00:23:57.978
"Next Episode" -What is it? Did you find the alien?

401
00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.578
No, not yet.

402
00:24:00.578 --> 00:24:02.378
But I was wondering

403
00:24:02.378 --> 00:24:05.678
what color was the cigar type UFO that you saw, Hina.

404
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:06.878
It was black.

405
00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:09.678
It was a bit shiny and pitch black!

406
00:24:09.678 --> 00:24:11.578
Then go over to his place right this minute

407
00:24:11.578 --> 00:24:13.378
and ask him what's going on!

408
00:24:13.378 --> 00:24:16.078
Officer Chiba's changed, hasn't he?

409
00:24:16.078 --> 00:24:19.078
Rather, did he lose weight?

410
00:24:19.078 --> 00:24:20.678
Next Conan,

411
00:24:20.678 --> 00:24:24.278
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 2)"

412
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:27.021
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:29.421
"Trash Bag"

414
00:24:29.421 --> 00:24:30.621
If we're up against an alien...

415
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:32.421
It's a difficult case that will make you lose weight, huh?

416
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:34.021
He really lost weight.
