1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,870
I'm stuffed!

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,570
That Italian restaurant was good, wasn't it?

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,070
Yep! But I think you ate a little bit too much, Yumi.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,570
What's wrong with cutting loose on my day off?

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,470
I'm a little upset too, besides.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,070
About that envelope you mentioned

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,170
back at the restaurant that your boyfriend gave to you...

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,670
He's my ex! My ex-boyfriend!

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,070
He forced an envelope into my hands several years ago!

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,970
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,270
Yeah, really... You're late.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,870
Here.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,670
What's this?

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,770
Hey.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,170
Please don't open it until I get all seven.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,470
That's why I'm asking you what is it.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,970
When I get all seven, I'll call you.

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,670
Promise.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,270
That's what he said.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,070
It seems that he got all seven.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,170
But our days off didn't match at all

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,270
so I figured, forget it!

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,270
Maybe the content of the envelope

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,970
was a marriage registration or something.

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,770
What?

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,270
Nah, it can't be.

27
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,170
You know, in most cases...

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,770
He has his name already written in on the form.

29
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,470
If you agree to marrying him, he asks for you to write your name in.

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,970
I don't know what the seven are,

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,670
but he asked you to keep it safely, right?

32
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,770
Yes, I guess.

33
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,670
What kind of guy is he?

34
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,270
What does he do?

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,870
The thing is, he hasn't told me!

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,570
He told me that he'd call me when gets a hold of all seven.

37
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,970
He seems to be a master of something, though.

38
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,170
Well, it's probably just something like fishing, games or Rakugo!

39
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,770
Rakugo?

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,770
It's Master Taiko!

41
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,670
Everyone wants him in their commercials

42
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,070
and quiz shows these days.

43
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,570
Master?

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,170
You mean of Shogi?

45
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,970
Yes, of course.

46
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,870
Don't tell me your boyfriend is...

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,270
Master Taiko?

48
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,570
I... I guess so.

49
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,870
Then, by get all seven,

50
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,570
he was referring to the seven major shogi titles!

51
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,570
Really?

52
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,370
Why didn't you open the envelope?

53
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,670
He told you to open it after he got hold of all seven, right?

54
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,970
I was thinking to open it in front of him when I met him next.

55
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,970
And if something not worth it was inside,

56
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,370
I was going to tear it to pieces.

57
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,470
And? Where's that envelope?

58
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,870
I thought I saw a glimpse of it the other day.

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,570
Oh, right!

60
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,670
I stuck in between the pages of a fashion magazine!

61
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,970
And where's that fashion magazine?

62
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,570
Since it's already outdated,

63
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,770
I bunched it up with some other books and left it at the trash dump.

64
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,770
Then, let's go get it right away!

65
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,770
We could probably still make it if we go now.

66
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,570
Never mind already.

67
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,570
What?

68
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,170
I haven't even thought about marriage yet.

69
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,870
Besides, I don't want him to think that

70
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,770
I'm flimsy woman who changed my attitude

71
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,770
because I found out he was a shogi master.

72
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,370
Well, if you say so.

73
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,370
Although it's none of my business, what a shame.

74
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,070
Holding all seven titles

75
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,970
would earn him at least a hundred million yen a year.

76
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,370
Seriously?

77
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,270
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

78
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

79
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,470
The marriage registration is in the recyclable trash?

80
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,470
It won't be easy to find.

81
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

82
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

83
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,570
His name is Detective Conan!

84
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:38,870
"Marriage Registration Password (Part 1)"

85
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,870
You gotta be joking, right?

86
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,270
It's gone already!

87
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,070
My 100 million yen!

88
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,170
So, that's what she disappointed about.

89
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,870
Well, you could tell him the truth

90
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,770
and have him fill in another marriage registration form!

91
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,170
No way.

92
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,270
Because Chukichi's stubborn is an odd way, you know.

93
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,970
When I dated him before,

94
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,870
I jokingly asked him if he would give me a spare envelope

95
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,070
just in case I lose the original.

96
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,370
No! There's only one of it in this entire world.

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,770
There's no such thing as a spare!

98
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,670
That's what he told me.

99
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,670
Wait!

100
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,370
The trash collection truck

101
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,070
should still be going around the city, right?

102
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,570
If I ride the mini police car and sound siren,

103
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,870
maybe I'll be able to stop the truck.

104
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,270
That's an abuse of police authority.

105
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,770
It's Officer Sato and the mini police car lady!

106
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,070
What's up?

107
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,070
Are you working on a case?

108
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,270
Brats.

109
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,370
Right! Yumi threw something really important out with her trash.

110
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,470
It's a really grave incident!

111
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,070
Miwako.

112
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,870
-Really? -How stupid.

113
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,970
If it's something important, don't throw it away!

114
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,770
I didn't do it deliberately.

115
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,370
You threw it in the trash without thinking?

116
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,270
I had it stuck between the pages of a fashion magazine,

117
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,570
so I bundled it up with all the other magazines

118
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,970
and brought it out here!

119
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,270
But it looks like today's not the day to throw away recyclable trash!

120
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,870
-What? -Like always, scatterbrain.

121
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,170
Talk for yourself!

122
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,770
But the bundle of magazines isn't here,

123
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,570
so maybe the manager of this condo stored it elsewhere.

124
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,870
What?

125
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,770
If he could tell it was yours,

126
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,970
he would probably put it back in front of your room, maybe.

127
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,070
There it is!

128
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,070
I'm glad!

129
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,970
He's a hardworking manager, isn't he?

130
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,370
He even posted a paper saying that the day for recyclables is Tuesday.

131
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,070
I'm sure I stuck it in between.

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,370
It's amazing how the manager knew that this bundle was Yumi's.

133
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,970
If you work for a long time as a manger,

134
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,170
maybe after a while, you know

135
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,170
what kind of magazines certain residents buy and stuff.

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,970
Yumi's probably the only one

137
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,270
who has mahjong magazines jumbled up with fashion magazines.

138
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,470
It's not here! It's not here!

139
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,470
It's nowhere!

140
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,070
By the way, what are you looking for?

141
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,570
100 million yen!

142
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,070
What?

143
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,370
Well, you see...

144
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,370
Yumi used the envelope with something important inside it as a bookmark

145
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,870
and stuck it between the pages of a fashion magazine.

146
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,670
That envelope with the marriage registration inside it.

147
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,770
Yep, most likely.

148
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,270
The children know about it, too.

149
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,470
Was there anything written on that envelope?

150
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,170
The word "sealed" was written in the back of the envelope

151
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,570
just where the flap is,

152
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,470
and in the front, his name Shukichi Haneda was written!

153
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,070
Then, some woman may have picked it up,

154
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,770
filled her name in on the form

155
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,470
and submitted it to city hall already.

156
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,670
Oh no!

157
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,170
Well, if my husband were to be Master Taiko,

158
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,570
my heart would surely sway.

159
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,370
What?

160
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,970
Only joke.

161
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,670
Let's go see the condo manager and hear him out!

162
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,070
Maybe since it's an important envelope,

163
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,770
he could be keeping it for you, right?

164
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,170
Yes?

165
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,170
Hello. I'm Miyamoto of room 308.

166
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,870
I have something I'd like to ask you regarding the trash.

167
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,770
Wait up.

168
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,570
You've finally come, Chacha!

169
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,970
Chacha?

170
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,670
I told you, don't call me that.

171
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,870
It annoys me.

172
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,870
Hey, Yumi. Just what does "Chacha" mean?

173
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,570
Beats me!

174
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,270
When Chukichi came over here some time ago,

175
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,170
we ran into him, back then.

176
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,670
Since then, he started calling me Chacha.

177
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,270
I am absolutely sure that you are a vamp who has smitten Taiko!

178
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,070
I see.

179
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,270
Do you happen to like shogi, gramps?

180
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,070
Yeah. I thought that I was as good as any professional player.

181
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,370
But now, I know I was wrong.

182
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,370
Several year ago, I heard that a professional Jr. high school player

183
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,770
was coming to an event at a department store.

184
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,170
I figured that he was no more than a green-horn

185
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,970
and was all out to beat him to a pulp.

186
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,370
However, he in turn beat me hollow.

187
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,870
I fell in love with

188
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,970
his splendid tactics of the way he placed his pieces.

189
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,870
Today, I'm a great fan of his!

190
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,770
Each time he wins a title,

191
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,570
I'm as delighted as if it were happening to me

192
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,470
and was living an easy comfortable life.

193
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,170
Until I was caught by Chacha here.

194
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,470
Caught?

195
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,470
That's right. This old man was a serial pickpocket!

196
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,670
Pickpocket?

197
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,570
I caught him when he tried to steal my wallet in the train

198
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,570
and threw him into jail.

199
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,470
But when he completed his jail terms and was released,

200
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,070
he came saying that he didn't have a job

201
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,870
so I helped him get this job as the manager of the condo!

202
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,870
Really?

203
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,470
By the way, what I want to ask you

204
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,070
is about the stuff that was stuck between the pages of the magazine

205
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,470
that I threw out as trash this morning.

206
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,070
Is this it?

207
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,970
You... Don't tell me...

208
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,470
"Shukichi Haneda" -You looked inside the envelope?

209
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,070
Why should you care?

210
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,170
You threw it out as trash, anyway.

211
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,170
You old fart!

212
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,070
But all is well!

213
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,970
Since the content is really a marriage registration form!

214
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,270
Give it back to me! My marriage registration!

215
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,070
I wonder where I put it?

216
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,470
What?

217
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,170
I thought I put it in the bedroom beyond.

218
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,470
But I wonder. I'm very forgetful nowadays, you know.

219
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,770
Move, will you?

220
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,570
I'm going to look for it myself!

221
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,270
Hey! It's not on the desk nor is it in the drawers, it's nowhere!

222
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,970
I wonder. That's strange.

223
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,070
I'm sure it's some place in this room.

224
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,770
Well, why don't you have him give it back to you when he finds it then?

225
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,570
Okay.

226
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,070
There's not that much time left.

227
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,970
What?

228
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,570
On the registration form for the husband's employment field,

229
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,570
it showed seven crowns title holder professional shogi player.

230
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,370
I can tell that he filled out that form

231
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,670
with extraordinary resolution and determination!

232
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,470
I know that.

233
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,970
But in this championship match,

234
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,870
Taiko is really having a tough time.

235
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,070
The reason is most likely the marriage registration.

236
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,870
Because he hasn't received a reply from the person he really cares for

237
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,570
and cannot concentrate on shogi.

238
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,370
That's what he spilled out when interviewed by a magazine.

239
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,970
Right, in other words,

240
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,670
if Taiko were to lose this Osho Title match...

241
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,670
This marriage registration form that indicates "7th Crown Holder"

242
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,970
would become invalid!

243
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,170
What?

244
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,170
Then, call him up right away

245
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,270
and tell him, "Let's get married!"

246
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,370
What?

247
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,670
No use.

248
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,670
They don't have their cell phones while at the tournament hall.

249
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,670
What?

250
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,170
The only time you could meet him

251
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,570
would be when he leaves the tournament hall to go on lunch break.

252
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,270
If Chacha goes there at that time with the marriage registration,

253
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,570
he'll gain Herculean strength

254
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,870
and beat any opponent he's up against.

255
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,070
There's still an hour to go before lunch break, you know.

256
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,470
So you know where the envelope is, don't you?

257
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,470
Where is it? Where did you hide it?

258
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,670
Show me your resolution then!

259
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,670
Resolution?

260
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,470
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

261
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,170
How resolute you are about that!

262
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,970
If your feelings are that strong,

263
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,170
the envelope should be easy to find!

264
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,537
Resolution?

265
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:13,437
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

266
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,137
How resolute you are about that!

267
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,937
If your feelings are that strong,

268
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:20,037
the envelope should be easy to find!

269
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,837
Hey, maybe this is it?

270
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:24,837
What?

271
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:28,837
It says to insert the 8-digit password.

272
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:32,837
Moreover, it says only Yodogimi is authorized to enter the password!

273
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,137
Yodogimi?

274
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:37,237
Hideyoshi Taiko's wife, Chacha.

275
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:39,937
But what're the numbers to be entered?

276
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:42,137
If you enter a lot number at random,

277
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,037
I'm sure you'll get the correct number in time, no?

278
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:47,537
No, no! Yumi's the only one who can enter the password,

279
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,637
and it also says that mistakes are forbidden.

280
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,137
If you make a mistake even once,

281
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:54,737
it'll probably never open again.

282
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,637
Then, what shall we do?

283
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,037
It's easy!

284
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:04,837
We need to find the 8-digit number some place in this room

285
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,537
and if Yumi enters it into the computer,

286
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:09,537
we'll be able to locate where the envelope is.

287
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:14,237
Isn't that right, meany old gramps?

288
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,537
Yeah.

289
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:18,537
Now that we know, let's all look for it!

290
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:20,037
Aye...

291
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,637
Okay, let's look for it, too!

292
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,537
Okay.

293
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:43,437
Genta! Don't turn the wastebasket upside down!

294
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:47,337
But you never know where it'd be hidden.

295
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:52,537
What? A strange paper dropped out.

296
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:59,037
Hey.

297
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:02,637
What's this? It's incomprehensible.

298
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:06,237
But it seems that the thing written on that paper is some kind of code

299
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:09,737
and if you decipher it, the 8-digit number will appear.

300
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,437
That seems to be true.

301
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:16,237
Jeez. How do you expect us to solve something like this?

302
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:18,637
Well, I guess we'll do okay, right?

303
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:22,437
Because that code looks a lot like the code

304
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:25,537
that comes out in Sherlock Holmes' "Dancing Doll".

305
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:28,037
I'm sure that the Sherlockian who has taken a picture of it

306
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,037
on his cell phone and is staring at it now

307
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,637
has already solved it.

308
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:43,037
You mean you can't solve it either, Conan?

309
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,737
No joke?

310
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,837
Is it that difficult?

311
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,037
Yeah.

312
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,537
What is this?

313
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:55,237
Are they figures or letters or symbols?

314
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:57,937
Gosh. I can't find a clue.

315
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:00,037
Hey. If you hide it with something,

316
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:02,037
you might come up with a number.

317
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,037
See! If you hide over here this way,

318
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,537
it looks like the number 1!

319
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:07,037
You're right.

320
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:10,337
But, what should we hide it with?

321
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:14,637
I got it! The shogi piece!

322
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,137
If we place the shogi piece nicely

323
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:18,237
on top of the paper with the code on it,

324
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,537
maybe we'll find the 8-digit number!

325
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:23,137
I guess so.

326
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:24,537
It's strange that this shogi board is here

327
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:28,137
right in the middle of the room so conspicuously like this.

328
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:31,237
Yeah, it definitely looks like a clue.

329
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:32,537
Okay!

330
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:37,937
Now that we know, let's decipher this code together.

331
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,037
Yeah...

332
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,537
She's got them wrapped around her finger.

333
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:54,837
Yumi.

334
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:58,337
Why aren't you answering me yet?

335
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:02,037
Maybe she doesn't want to marry me?

336
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,437
No, no.

337
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:06,737
Even so, she would call to let me know of it.

338
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,837
Oops, I shouldn't be doing this.

339
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,337
I've got to concentrate on this match.

340
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:22,037
Maybe she hasn't opened the envelope yet?

341
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:24,237
Or, maybe she really threw it away?

342
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,037
I guess Yumi's prone to do so.

343
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,237
Master Haneda.

344
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,437
What?

345
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,737
You seem to be preoccupied about something.

346
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,837
Would you like to take an early lunch break?

347
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:38,537
I don't mind, you know.

348
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:40,937
No, we'll continue as is.

349
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:44,937
Right.

350
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:47,337
After getting hold of the 7th Crown title and I'm fully prepared,

351
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,337
I'll wait for Yumi's answer.

352
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,037
That's what I decided to do.

353
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:57,737
I'll carry out what I set out to do!

354
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:06,537
All of them... sort of look like numbers

355
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:08,137
but it's quite unclear.

356
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:11,237
I don't even know which numbers to type in first either.

357
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,737
Maybe this isn't the way to decipher the code?

358
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:20,237
Maybe the code isn't complete just with that one piece of paper.

359
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:21,737
What do you mean?

360
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:24,937
Maybe there's another similar type of paper with codes on it,

361
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,137
and if we put one paper on top of the other

362
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:27,837
and raise it up to the light and look through it,

363
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:31,637
the 8-digit number or a sentence indicating it will appear.

364
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,237
Then, we just look for another piece of paper with codes on it?

365
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:37,537
Yep, probably.

366
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,237
Okay! Everybody!

367
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:41,037
Let's look for the other piece!

368
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:43,537
Aye...

369
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:45,337
They're like lord and vassals already.

370
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:53,537
But searching for something like this brings back memories.

371
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,137
What? Memories of what?

372
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,737
Searching for bamboo shoots!

373
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,437
Bamboo shoots?

374
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,237
When I went over to Chukichi's condo,

375
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:05,537
he couldn't find the important fan that he wanted to show me

376
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,937
and he was flustered, so I found it for him.

377
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:12,737
What connection does that have to do with searching for bamboo shoots?

378
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:15,837
Because fans are made of bamboos, aren't they?

379
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,337
That fan was inside a pencil holder

380
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,037
and only a little of the top was showing.

381
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,937
So I told Chukichi!

382
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:27,337
"You can't find it because you try to look for the fan itself!

383
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,837
If you think that it's almost totally hidden,

384
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:30,537
it'll be easier to find."

385
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:34,437
Even for bamboo shoots, you only see the tip of it

386
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:37,537
and most the rest of it is hidden in the soil!

387
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,937
Really?

388
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,537
"Thoughts are like bamboo shoots

389
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:44,637
and most of them are buried in soil."

390
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:50,637
It explains that one should never judge a book by its cover.

391
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:54,837
It's a famous quote by Sankichi Sakata, an extraordinary shogi player!

392
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,637
Don't tell me she knew about it?

393
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,537
Well, I'm the one who put the fan

394
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:04,537
that was on the desk in the pencil holder

395
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:06,637
while Chukichi was using the restroom.

396
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:08,337
Just a coincidence.

397
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:11,837
But Master Taiko's name is Shukichi Haneda,

398
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,137
yet why do you call him "Chukichi"?

399
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:15,937
He's a finicky eater.

400
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,437
When we first started going with each other,

401
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:19,837
all he would eat was cheese, because he could pick it up

402
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,737
with his fingers without getting them dirty

403
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:25,937
And cheese is a favorite of mice?

404
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:29,837
Right! I couldn't stand watching that

405
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,537
so I made him eat super delicious short cake!

406
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:35,937
Then, Chukichi really got hooked on it!

407
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:37,737
Come to think of it,

408
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:40,937
the players usually eat sweet desserts during their matches.

409
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:43,437
Something about it peps up their brains.

410
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:47,437
If I remember correctly, Master Taiko started getting hold of the titles

411
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:52,037
ever since he started munching away on short cake during the matches.

412
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:55,737
Maybe this is just another coincidence, but...

413
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:58,137
She...

414
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:01,437
I wonder if it's really true?

415
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:04,537
Is there really another paper with codes on it?

416
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:07,637
Show me your resolution then!

417
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,737
Resolution?

418
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:13,837
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

419
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:15,837
How resolute you are about that!

420
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,837
Even if Yumi wants to be resolute,

421
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,737
there's nothing she can do, with an incomplete code!

422
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,537
In other words, the second piece of paper

423
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,137
should be as easy to find as the first.

424
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,737
Then, why can't we find it?

425
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:33,137
Gosh. What is going on?

426
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:57,137
"Next Episode"

427
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:01,937
What disappears when you make a copy?

428
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,537
I get it!

429
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:08,537
Men don't like to go back on their word.

430
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:11,137
Don't you dare lose to anybody till then!

431
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:12,737
You balding mouse!

432
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:16,037
She... I thought she was Chacha, but maybe...

433
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:24,337
Next Conan, "Marriage Registration Password (Part 2)"

434
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,380
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
"Origami"

436
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,480
What a mean old fart.

437
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,780
A difficult code.

438
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,880
We won't get to the marriage registration.
