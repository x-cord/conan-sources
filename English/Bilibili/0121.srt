00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:04,528
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,228
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:07,978
Today is about two beautiful sisters!

4
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:09,978
A case occurs behind dying words!

5
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:11,818
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:13,818
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:16,198
His name? Detective Conan!

Aoshima

10
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,761
I'm home!
Aoshima

11
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,151
Where were you? That took a long time.

12
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,391
I got stuck at the convenience store.

13
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,191
Aoshima Mina (24) Haido Dept. Store Clerk

14
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:34,941
I made sure to buy everything you asked for, Sis!
Aoshima Mina (24) Haido Dept. Store Clerk

15
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:37,731
Bath detergents, tape, and beer!

Aoshima Masayo (26) Beika Bank Employee
Thanks, I forgot to buy bath detergent,

17
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:44,031
and the convenience store by
my apartment is being remodeled.
Aoshima Masayo (26) Beika Bank Employee

18
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,011
and the convenience store by
my apartment is being remodeled.

19
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:51,001
But are you really taking the
video tape with that idol show on it?

20
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:58,461
Don't be like that. I moved
out of here for your sake.

21
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,341
That seems like a
lot of work. Can I help?

22
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:12,931
Could you cut some strips of
tape and stick them along the table?

23
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:16,511
Sorry for suddenly coming over like this

24
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,811
and having you
go shopping and help me pack.

25
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:22,341
Don't be silly. It's no problem.

26
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:28,091
Oh, I should thank you! Kenji-san
can't wait for tomorrow's concert!

27
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,171
Oh, right! I forgot!

28
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,411
Before we pack...

29
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:40,041
...we have to make a toast
to my happiness-filled little sister!

30
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,171
Oh, we don't have to do that!

31
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:44,671
No, no!

32
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:49,171
I've been so busy since you
announced you were getting married

33
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,881
that I haven't gotten
to celebrate it properly!

34
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,521
So this is your sister's
meager little celebration!

35
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,941
Please accept it.

36
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:21,001
Oh, my gorgeous Yoko-jou!

37
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:24,171
Your beauty is a crime!

38
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:27,841
Have a look at these
roses I've brought for you!

39
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:33,741
They're all bright red
after being enamored by you!

40
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,381
Get it?!

41
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,761
I think that stupid look is more of a crime.

42
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,571
Yes.

43
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:55,331
I guess kids can't understand stylish,
grownup lines like that!

44
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:59,211
Yeah, real stylish...

45
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,671
He seems to be in a good mood...

46
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:09,511
Yeah! Because Okino Yoko-chan
is having a concert tonight!

47
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:15,181
Shouldn't we go, Dad? It'll be
really crowded if we don't go soon!

48
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,341
Don't worry!

49
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:23,611
If we show them the autographed
tickets Yoko-chan gave us,

50
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:27,171
they'll let us go in the back--

51
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,571
Huh?

52
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,541
What's wrong, Dad?!

53
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,461
There's a hole here!

54
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,091
Don't tell me you dropped your ticket?!

55
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:52,681
Not there! Not there!
Not there! Where did my Yoko-chan go?!

56
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:57,971
What about the bathroom?
You ran in there right when we got here.

57
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,481
That has to be it!

58
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,721
The bathroom! The bathroom!
That has to be it!

59
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,381
Well? Did you find it?

60
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,221
Nope. Zilch.

61
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:23,171
Don't worry! I'm sure they'll
let us in if we explain the situation!

62
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,881
Don't be dumb!

63
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:29,511
I can't let myself look stupid
when I give her a bouquet!

64
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,631
Wait.

65
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:35,881
As I recall, you have
midterms next week, right?

66
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,171
Yeah.

67
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:42,841
Then give me your ticket
so you can go home and study!

68
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:43,851
Forget it!

69
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:47,561
I know! Let's say it was actually...

70
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:50,071
Come on, Dad.

71
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:54,591
Yes, yes! Let's say that
Conan dropped his ticket and--

72
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,201
Knock that off!

73
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,131
I'm sorry!

74
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:01,421
What do you mean you can't come, Kenji?!

75
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,751
A cold?! You'll get over it at the concert!

76
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,671
Do you know how hard it was

77
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,461
getting tickets to Okino Yoko's concert?!

78
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:16,341
Just get over here! My sister and
I planned on taking your car there!

79
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:22,141
Eh?! You can't?! Wait, Kenji!

80
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,211
Kenji?!

81
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,761
Urgh! You useless jerk!

82
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,111
U-Uhh...

83
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,481
Umm...

84
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,971
Yes?!

85
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:37,761
Do you have an extra ticket for
Okino Yoko-chan's concert tonight?

86
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,871
Y-Yes...

87
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:44,131
In that case, might you
let me have it for a small sum?

88
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:50,011
Hold on, Dad! That's a waste!
They'll let you in if you just explain!

89
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:55,721
Quiet! A man's pride
can't be exchanged for money!

90
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,171
You're so vain...

91
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,341
Mister!

92
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:03,391
You didn't lose your ticket in the car, either.

93
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,521
O-Oh.

94
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:11,671
So, would you be willing to sell it to me?

95
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,691
No, no, you appear troubled,
so you can have it for free.

96
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,301
For free?

97
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,031
For f-free?! Really?!

98
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:27,001
Yes! In exchange,
could I ask one favor of you?

99
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,961
Yes! Anything at all!

100
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,761
What's with him?

101
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,671
I thought he was acting on a
man's pride, but I guess it didn't matter.

102
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,051
I'm sorry to ask you to do this.

103
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:46,761
No, it's no problem!
We're just going to pick up your sister!

104
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,261
Good thing you rented this car, huh?

105
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:54,631
Yeah! It's lucky I had to
take a trip for work this morning!

106
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,401
But what could've gotten into them?

107
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:03,741
They couldn't wait for tonight's concert,
but then didn't show up.

108
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,171
Did you try calling her?

109
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:11,841
Yes... but she won't answer.
And the answering machine isn't on.

110
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,671
I just hope nothing strange has happened...

111
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:15,921
Strange?

112
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:20,381
My sister's been acting strange lately.

113
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:23,551
She's been depressed ever since
announcing she was getting married.

114
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,931
Sometimes she'll cry for no reason.

115
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:30,391
That's why I invited her to tonight's
concert! To cheer her up!

116
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,861
Say, it's had me curious this whole time.

117
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:39,191
That bandana around your head... is it...?

118
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,841
Oh! This is a limited edition bandana

119
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,551
that came with Yoko-chan's
album that was released yesterday!

120
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,701
So it was Yoko-chan's!

121
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:52,011
It's amazing you can get things like that!

122
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,171
You're so lucky!

123
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:56,761
Eh? You're fans, but you haven't bought it?!

124
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:00,171
It comes with a key holder, too!

125
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,341
Wow!

126
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:06,761
She gives us all her CDs
in person, so we don't get extras...

127
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:11,231
Eh?! In person?! You know Yoko-chan?!

128
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:14,811
Yes, we kinda met during a case...

129
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,521
C-Case?

130
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:22,491
Yeah, my name is Mori Kogoro.
I'm a detective.

131
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,581
Is something the matter?

132
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:35,671
N-No! I just recognized that name!
You're so famous that I...

133
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,841
No, I'm not that famous!

134
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:53,691
Oh? A house?

135
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,671
Your little sister lives here alone?

136
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:02,631
No, I lived here with her until just last week.

137
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:07,871
I moved out so her fiancÃ©
can move in with her next month.

138
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:12,291
Her shoes are here.

139
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:15,251
She must still be asleep.

140
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:22,421
I'll go get her.
You can relax in the living room.

141
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,761
Oh, but the time...

142
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,931
We'll only be a minute!

143
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,681
R-Right...

144
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:35,171
Come on, now.
It'll take an hour to get there!

145
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:38,231
Now, now! Don't be in such a rush!

146
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:41,341
Whoa! What is this?!

147
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,441
The room is filled with idol posters!

148
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:50,011
Yoko-chan, Anzai Asuka,
Two-Mix, Hoshino Terumi...

149
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:54,451
Amazing! They even have
Lex, and they disbanded!

150
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:57,371
It's also amazing you
know so much about this stuff...

151
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:02,131
Masayo-san certainly loves idols!

152
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:06,671
Her sister must've had
it rough, putting up with this.

153
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,051
I think they both like idols.

154
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:13,881
See? There are two of everything,
even photo books and CDs!

155
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:16,101
And they have their names on them.

156
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:20,761
But why didn't Masayo-san
take them when she moved?

157
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:24,841
There's probably so much
that she couldn't take it all at once.

158
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:29,491
See? Look at all these moving boxes.

159
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,341
Still...

160
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,171
W-What's that?!

161
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,871
Mina! Mina!

162
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:38,431
Mister!

163
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,511
Yeah!

164
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,881
I know you're in there!

165
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,131
What's wrong?!

166
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:43,801
Mina!

167
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:46,421
'Goodbye' [written reversed]

168
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,301
Mina! Mina!
'Goodbye' [written reversed]

169
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,091
'Goodbye' [written reversed]

170
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,801
W-What's that?!

171
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:00,551
Don't tell me it's locked from the inside?!

172
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,571
No, there's no lock on this door!

173
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:07,031
I think it's been
taped shut from the inside!

174
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:12,531
Alright! Let's all bust it open!

175
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:14,491
Ready, go!

176
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,541
Mina...

177
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,681
S-Suicide?

178
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,421
Ran! The police! Call the police!

179
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,801
Right!

180
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:47,881
M-My sister... Will she live?!

181
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:50,381
I'm sorry, but she's gone...

182
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,701
This can't be happening!

183
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:57,491
The door and the
window were both taped shut!

184
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:03,841
And on the floor are two open
bottles of different bath detergents!

185
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,671
Maybe it was a suicide?

186
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:10,301
But the cuts on her wrists bother me!

187
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:20,181
No, it's not! This wasn't
a suicide! It was a murder!

188
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:25,151
But if that's the case,
I don't get how it was done...

189
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:29,971
How did the killer leave the room?!

190
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:35,161
How could someone leave
this completely sealed space?!

191
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:45,681
The deceased is
Aoshima Mina-san, age 24.

192
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:49,401
The cause of death was blood
loss stemming from the severance

193
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:52,191
of her ulnar artery caused
by cuts to her left wrist.

194
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:57,151
And it was you, her sister,
who found her, Masayo-san?

195
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,571
Y-Yes.

196
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:03,831
And, at the scene just
by coincidence yet again...

197
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,561
...was I, Mori Kogoro!

198
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,731
Inspector Megure.

199
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:13,671
The truth is, Masayo-san had asked
me to pick Mina-san up in my car.

200
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:17,131
We went into the bathroom
when we noticed something was strange.

201
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:23,051
By which you mean the
tape on this window and door?

202
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:29,231
Yes... there was tape all over the inside,
so the room was sealed off.

203
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:32,021
There's no doubt
it was a suicide, though.

204
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:36,441
Still, why would someone
slitting their wrist to commit suicide

205
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,941
need to seal off this room?

206
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:44,401
It's probably because mixing
chlorine and acid-based detergents

207
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,651
produces a poisonous chlorine gas.

208
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:50,461
She sealed the room
so the gas wouldn't leak out.

209
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:55,191
But Mori-kun.
These are both chlorine-based.

210
00:15:55,191 --> 00:16:00,591
Besides, chlorine gas isn't
bad enough to seal the room...

211
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:06,521
Inspector... the late
Mina-san wasn't a pro like us.

212
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:09,521
She wouldn't have known
the strength of chlorine gas.

213
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,401
Even so...

214
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:16,691
I also believe she was in a very
confused state before killing herself!

215
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:20,061
In short, this is what happened.

216
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:24,651
To commit suicide, she prepared
two types of bathroom detergent

217
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,191
and sealed off this room.

218
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:31,401
But when she
tried to produce the gas,

219
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,611
she realized she had
bought the wrong detergents.

220
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:40,231
With no other choice, she cut
her wrist with a razor in the room

221
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,571
and left the cuts in the
warm water to kill herself.

222
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:47,441
Inspector, take a look at this.

223
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,401
Beer, Tape, Detergent, Detergent
I found this receipt in the living room.

224
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,481
Mina-san purchased two
bath detergents and tape
Beer, Tape, Detergent, Detergent

225
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,981
Mina-san purchased two
bath detergents and tape

226
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:57,111
at a convenience store last night.

227
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,781
It's proof she decided to
commit suicide and prepared hastily.

228
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:03,691
Hey! Takagi-kun!

229
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,241
Yes, sir?

230
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,901
Go confirm this at
the convenience store.

231
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,271
Understood!

232
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:15,211
The roll of tape was
found at the bottom of the bath,

233
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:21,901
so this situation is plausible
if Mina-san was acting hastily...

234
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:24,341
But she hurried too much!

235
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:27,191
C-Conan-kun!

236
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:31,721
This lady's wrist
is cut in rushed zig-zags!

237
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:37,521
S-So it is!

238
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:44,941
Most hesitant cuts made by
people committing suicide are parallel.

239
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,531
They almost never crisscross like this.

240
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:49,941
If I didn't know better, I'd say--

241
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,241
It just happened that way.

242
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:56,671
It just shows how
confused she was at the time.

243
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:59,271
Oh, geez...

244
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:02,771
But would someone like her clean up?

245
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:03,511
Clean up?

246
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:09,301
See? Look at this blood!
It suddenly stops at the edge!

247
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:15,311
That means she cleaned up
the blood after it went flying, right?

248
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:19,861
You're so stupid!
Nobody committing suicide would do that!

249
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,021
Then why does it suddenly stop?

250
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,231
Well... Because...

251
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:30,161
When the blood sprayed,
there was something here, or...

252
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:36,001
Or someone was next to
her when she cut her wrist.

253
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,001
Right?

254
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:43,151
Inspector, if I didn't
know better, I'd say...

255
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,231
Yes, it may've been a murder.

256
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:47,211
Could it have been the tape?

257
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,391
The tape was at the
bottom of the bathtub, right?

258
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:57,151
Ah! If the tape was
on the edge of the tub

259
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,351
and it fell when she cut her wrist...

260
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:04,651
...it would all fit!

261
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:09,071
Thank you! You've helped
solve the mystery!

262
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:12,031
It was nothing...

263
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,401
Inspector Megure.

264
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:20,671
It appears only Mina-san's
fingerprints are on the tape.

265
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:27,131
Prints from both index fingers
and thumbs show up clearly.

266
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:28,901
I see.

267
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:35,111
So we can probably assume this
"Goodbye" was her dying message.

268
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:37,181
Meaning it was a suicide...

269
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:42,811
Of course it was. This bathroom
was completely sealed off!

270
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,941
Oh no! I completely forgot!

271
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:52,061
F-Forgot what, Mori-kun?!

272
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:52,821
Masayo-san.

273
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,161
Y-Yes?!

274
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:59,271
As I recall, you said this then...

275
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,901
"Then"?

276
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:06,801
You said I could have a ticket
to Okino Yoko-chan's concert tonight!

277
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:07,461
Huh?

278
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:10,901
Stop that, Dad! This isn't the time...

279
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:16,931
Come on! We can at least
catch the finale if we go now!

280
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:23,111
I'll go get it. I think my sister
put them all in the living room.

281
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:25,361
Thanks!

282
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:40,251
Say.

283
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:45,271
These boxes have bend marks.
Did you put them together before?

284
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:52,171
Y-Yes! I had so many things to
take that I decided to get them later!

285
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:57,391
Oh! So that's why you
had your sister help you then?

286
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:01,931
After all, the edges
of that table are all sticky!

287
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:06,771
It got left behind by pieces of tape, right?

288
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:13,741
Having someone line up pieces
of tape makes packing a cinch, huh?

289
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:17,561
Conan-kun! Where are you?

290
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,771
That damn kid. Every single time!

291
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,121
Conan-kun!

292
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:25,401
L-Little boy!
Your sister is calling you!

293
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,731
Conan-kun!

294
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:28,751
You're right! I better go!

295
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:48,351
There's no point
wiping away the tape marks.

296
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:54,651
The examiner touched them
and photographed them after I told him.

297
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:57,311
Here you are!

298
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,781
I'm sorry for the trouble!

299
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,861
Bye-bye, lady!

300
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,481
Bye-bye!

301
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:05,461
Oh, Conan-kun!
You know not to scamper around!

302
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:13,771
There's no question about it.

303
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:14,801
Conan!

304
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:19,861
Yes. Mina-san's killer was Masayo-san!

305
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:20,401
Goodbye
Yes. Mina-san's killer was Masayo-san!

306
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:22,501
What I don't get
Goodbye

307
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:26,941
is how she escaped the room sealed with tape!
Goodbye

308
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:27,191
And what's this strange
feeling that's been bugging me?
Goodbye

309
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:34,811
And what's this strange
feeling that's been bugging me?

310
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:10,131
Hey! What's that?!

311
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:13,051
C-Could this be--?

312
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:19,641
Yes. Mina-san didn't commit suicide.
She was murdered.

313
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:24,761
By you, Masayo-san! Her older sister!

314
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:29,671
On the next Conan--

315
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:33,341
"The Sealed Bathroom Murder Case (Part 2)."
