1
00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:20.632
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:22.632
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.632
Ai and Mitsuhiko are at bay.

4
00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:26.632
Mushrooms on skewers, can they tell?

5
00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.232
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:30.332
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:32.332
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:56.491
We, the Youth Detective Squad,

9
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.791
went into the mountains to hunt for mushrooms.

10
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.791
Absorbed in what he is doing, Genta walks into the hunting area.

11
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:08.591
We split into two to look for Genta.

12
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:10.891
Ai and Mitsuhiko

13
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.191
finds the dead body of a hunter who is shot

14
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:15.691
and end up being the target of the killer themselves.

15
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:19.091
Dr. Agasa, Ayumi and I ran into Genta

16
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:20.891
and went along with the three other hunters

17
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.691
to search for Ai and Mitsuhiko.

18
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:31.791
"Mushrooms, A Bear And The Youth Detective Squad (Part 2)"

19
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:36.891
This is the last chip.

20
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.991
We've nothing left to drop anymore, Ai.

21
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:50.391
Ai?

22
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:52.691
What's wrong?

23
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:55.791
I think I sprained it slightly when I fled a while ago.

24
00:02:56.891 --> 00:02:59.091
I was trying to walk despite the pain.

25
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.991
Will you let me take a look at it?

26
00:03:03.991 --> 00:03:05.691
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:08.191
Hey.

28
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:10.991
Your leg is swollen purple.

29
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.291
I'm going to give you emergency treatment right now, so you stay put.

30
00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:16.791
Emergency treatment?

31
00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:18.991
You mean you've got bandages on you?

32
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:22.991
Nope. But, these scissors and towels will do.

33
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.391
See, if you cut at every other interval like this,

34
00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:28.991
it makes a perfect bandage.

35
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.791
Doesn't it?

36
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.491
Wrap this twice around the ankle,

37
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:41.691
go from the heels over to the top of the feet, and back to the ankle.

38
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:45.091
Then, repeat this several times, wrapping it firmly.

39
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.691
Finally, set it into place and tie it firmly

40
00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:49.691
and it's all done.

41
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.091
You're pretty good.

42
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:53.891
Actually, when I sprained my leg at camp some time back,

43
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.491
Conan...

44
00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:00.191
Conan...

45
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.491
Conan did the same for me,

46
00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.691
He sure knows a lot of things and is really admirable.

47
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:15.391
Moreover, he's moving on his initiative.

48
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.391
I could never even come close to him in any way.

49
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:24.291
Silly you.

50
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:26.191
What?

51
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:29.791
The important thing is not who you learned of that knowledge from,

52
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.191
but rather, where and how you use it.

53
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.291
You're the best rescue person around for me right now.

54
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.891
Thank you. You sure are a great help.

55
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.091
No problem.

56
00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:46.991
I'm happy to hear that.

57
00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:51.591
Anyway,

58
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:54.491
it's dangerous staying in the middle of a mountain path.

59
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.491
Let's sit down in the forest and think things out

60
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.991
of how to let Conan and the others know about us.

61
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:02.191
Yes, I guess so.

62
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:17.091
What? What was that?

63
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.291
Are you serious?

64
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:24.291
Yes. The dead body of a man is hidden under branches and leaves

65
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.391
was found near the place you mentioned to me.

66
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.091
Something about him being shot in the stomach

67
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:30.991
and having died instantly.

68
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:35.691
And the dead body of a bear cub seems to have been buried nearby, too.

69
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:36.691
A bear cub?

70
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:39.091
Yeah, but this one seems to have had a rock

71
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:41.991
placed over where it was buried.

72
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:43.991
At any rate, it's dangerous in the mountains.

73
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.091
Leave looking for the kids to me

74
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.091
-and you get out of the mountains. -Hey, is anything wrong?

75
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.291
Well...

76
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:54.391
A bear cub!

77
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:58.491
We thought we found the two, but there were two bear cubs.

78
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.591
We're having the owner of the inn

79
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:03.291
that we're staying at, look for the two, too.

80
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.091
What a scare.

81
00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:09.091
Come on, let's go after them.

82
00:06:09.091 --> 00:06:11.591
We'll be in a fix if the sunsets.

83
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.791
Hey, why are you hiding the truth?

84
00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:20.891
Don't tell me that maybe the killer is among one of the hunters.

85
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:22.891
It's not a maybe.

86
00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:24.491
The killer is among them.

87
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:27.891
The killer is undoubtedly...

88
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.691
among the three.

89
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.691
What?

90
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.591
He's planning to shut Ai and Mitsuhiko up

91
00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:39.591
because they witnessed the murder.

92
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.691
Then, why is he looking for them together with us?

93
00:06:42.691 --> 00:06:44.991
He's blocking their path,

94
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.091
and waiting for them to show up on their own.

95
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:49.191
He's going to say that he shot them

96
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:51.791
because he mistook them for a bear.

97
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.891
And, do you have any idea who the killer is, Shinichi?

98
00:06:55.891 --> 00:06:57.991
No, not at all.

99
00:06:57.991 --> 00:06:59.991
There aren't enough clues around.

100
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:01.791
But, don't worry.

101
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.591
I'm sure that the two who are witnesses

102
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:06.691
will tell us who the killer is.

103
00:07:06.691 --> 00:07:10.191
They'll let us know in a way that only we'll be able to understand.

104
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.291
Hey, look, there are a lot of mushrooms on the ground here!

105
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.791
Where?

106
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.491
What's with all this?

107
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:24.591
There are three mushrooms skewed to a branch.

108
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:26.891
The other four are scattered about.

109
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:29.391
The names of the mushrooms that are skewered are, from the top,

110
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:33.491
Tengudake, Matsutake, Shiitake.

111
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.391
The ones on the ground are 3 Shimeji and 1 Hatsutake.

112
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:40.191
Hey, is there some meaning to the mushrooms?

113
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:42.891
I wonder.

114
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:46.091
No, don't move.

115
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:48.991
But, I wonder if they'll figure it out?

116
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.091
They will.

117
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:52.391
That's something he really likes.

118
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:56.291
A code that we twisted our brains and thought out.

119
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:05.491
Nonsense.

120
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:08.691
It seems we don't have to worry about them.

121
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.591
They're absorbed in picking mushrooms.

122
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.891
Let's hurry on along then.

123
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:20.991
Strange, I was sure there was something to it.

124
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:23.091
Hey, Dr. Agasa, stay back.

125
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:26.091
I've figured it out.

126
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:29.991
I've identified the one who is trying to get rid of Ai and Mitsuhiko.

127
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:31.591
What?

128
00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:33.691
Get ready for this.

129
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:35.691
I'll put you to sleep

130
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:37.591
with this anesthesia gun in a sec.

131
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:40.991
What are you doing, Conan?

132
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:42.991
Get out of the way.

133
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:45.091
I was aiming at the killer right there.

134
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.291
The killer?

135
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:50.191
The killer is there, among the three.

136
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:56.591
But, how do you know?

137
00:08:56.591 --> 00:09:01.491
What else can it be? Ai and Mitsuhiko are dropping potato chips

138
00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:04.491
to let us know where they've walked by

139
00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:06.591
and yet, they're running from us.

140
00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:09.391
The police had already found the corpse together

141
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.091
with the bear cub a while ago and...

142
00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:15.191
The dead body of a bear cub?

143
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:17.991
Conan is aiming something at someone.

144
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:20.391
It's his wristwatch type anesthesia gun.

145
00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:24.391
It seems he's figured out

146
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:26.291
the message we left behind.

147
00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:28.691
When he shoots the needle into the killer,

148
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:31.991
we've got to carry the bear cub and join Dr. Agasa and the others.

149
00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:33.191
Okay.

150
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:47.691
What?

151
00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:52.891
Why?

152
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:55.691
Hey!

153
00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:59.291
Let's cut out this stupid cat and mouse game.

154
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:01.191
What do you say, Mr. Killer?

155
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:03.291
Killer?

156
00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:04.891
What?

157
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:06.891
I figured out who the killer is

158
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:10.191
by decoding the mushroom message.

159
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.791
The mushrooms total 7 in all.

160
00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:15.891
It stands for all seven of us.

161
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.091
The 3 mushrooms that are scattered stand for three kids.

162
00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:22.391
The big Hatsutake stands for Dr. Agasa.

163
00:10:22.391 --> 00:10:28.291
And the other three that are skewered onto the branch

164
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:31.291
stand for the three hunters and the rifles they are carrying.

165
00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:34.291
I see. I get it.

166
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:38.791
The only poison mushroom that is skewered on is the Tengudake.

167
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:41.991
Which means that the killer is carrying the rifle on his right shoulder.

168
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:44.291
Don't be ridiculous.

169
00:10:44.291 --> 00:10:45.991
Wrong.

170
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:49.891
Everybody who knows the mountains well enough

171
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:53.491
knows that the Tengudake is a poison mushroom.

172
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.591
If the killer figures it out first,

173
00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:58.291
then everything will go down the drain.

174
00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:59.791
Then which is the killer?

175
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:03.491
Remember, I thought you how to look for mushrooms,

176
00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:05.191
using tracking down a criminal as an example.

177
00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:09.291
See. You've got the criminal.

178
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:12.791
It's the Matsutake.

179
00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:14.791
I see.

180
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:17.291
Only we know about that.

181
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:23.191
Yeah. In other words, the killer that the code indicates is...

182
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:24.791
you.

183
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.180
Yeah.

184
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.280
In other words, the killer that the code indicates is you.

185
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.580
Mr. Matasaburo Saiga.

186
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.980
What?

187
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.580
The police have already found the corpse.

188
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.080
I don't have verification yet,

189
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.780
but I think it's the man with small eyes, your friend.

190
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.380
What?

191
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.580
Ai and Mitsuhiko coincidentally set foot into the scene of the crime

192
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.580
and found the body.

193
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.580
So, Mr. Saiga fired at them.

194
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.780
That's why Ai and Mitsuhiko figured

195
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.080
that they would be killed for having witnessed the murder.

196
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.080
Hey, gramps?

197
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.980
Hey. He's got a rifle, you know?

198
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.380
Hurry and use your anesthesia gun.

199
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.080
So, you can't take it anymore, can you?

200
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.880
Hey, Shinichi?

201
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.980
No, he didn't fire at Ai and Mitsuhiko to kill them.

202
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.680
The real reason he fired is...

203
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.680
Don't come out!

204
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.280
Hey...

205
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.180
What is that?

206
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.280
Jubei.

207
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.180
Don't run, brat!

208
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.680
If you show your back as you flee,

209
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.580
the bear will instinctively think that you are prey.

210
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.880
Without taking your eyes off it, back off slowly.

211
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.080
Jubei! Don't you know me?

212
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.980
Calm your anger down and go back to the woods.

213
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.980
You've got to get ready to hibernate, don't you?

214
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.180
You'd better hurry

215
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.880
or the other bears will take away all the good caves.

216
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.980
Go on! Jubei! Go!

217
00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.880
Jubei!

218
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.980
Ail! The bear cub! Give her back her cub!

219
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.780
The bear cub that is near you is probably Jubei's cub!

220
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.380
If you're carrying the cub, let it go!

221
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.180
Ai!

222
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.280
Right, Mr. Saiga fired his gun

223
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.980
in order to save Ai and Mitsuhiko

224
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.080
as well as Jubei.

225
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.180
The hunter that was killed probably tried to kill Jubei.

226
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.480
And in order to prevent that,

227
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.580
Mr. Saiga shot that hunter.

228
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.580
Since Ai and Mitsuhiko happened to come along just then,

229
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.880
he fired a threatening shot at them before Jubei had time to notice them,

230
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.780
and them flee away from where they were.

231
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.580
The blood stain that was found near Mitsuhiko's badge

232
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:08.280
that was on the ground, is probably one that dripped then.

233
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.580
But, he could've told them verbally rather than fire at them.

234
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.680
Like I think you've noticed just a while ago,

235
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.980
bears are extremely sensitive beyond imagination.

236
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.780
If the two were at a distance

237
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.980
where it was hard to still hear someone shouting,

238
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.880
and if the shooter was confident about his marksmanship,

239
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.580
this would've been easier than trying to relay something verbally.

240
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.180
Isn't that right, Mr. Saiga?

241
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.580
Hey, hey, hold it.

242
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.080
We came into the mountains to hunt, you know?

243
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.080
Why do we have to get killed for shooting a bear?

244
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.280
Moreover, it's the bear that the old man has been raving

245
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.080
about being really vicious.

246
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.780
Besides, aren't you the one who shot the eye of the bear and damaged it?

247
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.580
Yeah,

248
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.980
that's right.

249
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.380
It's the same as if I had damaged Jubei's left eye.

250
00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:02.680
I'm alive and kicking in exchange for Jubei losing her left eye.

251
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.380
In exchange?

252
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.080
It was 20 years ago,

253
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.580
I came to this mountain was still deeply covered with snow

254
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.180
in the spring to hunt bears.

255
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.580
I slipped from carelessness.

256
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.180
I fell several meters below and broke both legs.

257
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.280
I couldn't even utter a word,

258
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.280
Jubei appeared before my eyes

259
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.380
when I could not budge an inch on my own.

260
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.180
I gave up thinking that I would be eaten. So, I closed my eyes.

261
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.080
That was when I felt this strangely warm thing touch my face.

262
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.080
I frightenedly opened my eyes.

263
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.480
Jubei was licking my wound over and over again.

264
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.780
After she finished licking every part of me,

265
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.380
of all things she fell asleep beside me.

266
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.580
Whether she was planning to eat me after getting up,

267
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.680
or whether she mistook me to be one of her kind

268
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.680
because of the black fur I was wearing, I never found out.

269
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.280
But, it was a really comforting time for me.

270
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.080
I felt so good, I almost forgot the pain in both my legs.

271
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.180
Then a gunshot echoed through the mountains,

272
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.980
and she lost her left eye.

273
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.580
She left my side.

274
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.780
A hunter that had come after her,

275
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.480
thought that she was going to eat me, and fired at her.

276
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.280
In other words, thanks to Jubei finding me,

277
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.680
I was rescued before freezing to death.

278
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.380
Ever since then, I came to the mountains every day to find Jubei

279
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.280
and chase her all the way deep into the mountains

280
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.680
where she wouldn't be found by other hunters.

281
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.680
Then, all that talk about Jubei being vicious...

282
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.280
Yes, I was trying to keep people away from her, by scaring them.

283
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.280
It seems that recently what I've been doing

284
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.780
seem to be having opposite effects from what I expected though.

285
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.780
A hunter acting like a member of the humane society.

286
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.080
I feel sorry for the hunter who was shot.

287
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.180
He comes in to shoot a bear that he figures is his enemy

288
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.980
and ends up being shot by a hunter he thinks is a friend.

289
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.980
A bear is a gift from the heavens.

290
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.780
We, the bear hunters never did consider bears to be our enemy.

291
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.680
Besides, if a bear were to find me

292
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.880
and I unfortunately get hunted down, that too, is fate.

293
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.280
I will have no choice but to close my eyes.

294
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.580
But, that hunter was unforgivably unfair.

295
00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.780
What are you talking about?

296
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.980
He's referring to the use of a decoy!

297
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.580
I think that the hunter used the bear cub as a decoy.

298
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.880
What?

299
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.580
The boy's absolutely right!

300
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.080
That man most likely shot one of Jubei's cubs to death

301
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.980
and lured Jubei out!

302
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.080
Morever, he hung the dead body of the cub to a tree!

303
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.080
I doubted these very eyes of mine.

304
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.480
Because while watching the mother bear

305
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.280
desperately trying to pull her cub down from the tree,

306
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.880
the man who had his gun aimed

307
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.780
at the mother bear looked more like a beast than she did.

308
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.480
An hour after the incident,

309
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.880
we ran into the police who was searching the mountains.

310
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.580
The elderly bear hunter was taken away by the police.

311
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.180
He walked away gazing sadly

312
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.680
at the mountains where Jubei resides.

313
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.380
I see.

314
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.780
The bear cub's grave?

315
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.080
So, that's when you figured everything out.

316
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.180
Yeah.

317
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.680
At first, I thought that Mr. Saiga killed the hunter

318
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.680
because he wanted to kill Jubei himself,

319
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.780
but a person like that would never make a grave

320
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.380
for a bear cub like he did.

321
00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.380
Besides, he would've been able to hunt Jubei down any time

322
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.480
since he even knew when she gave birth.

323
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.080
But, if so, why didn't he say so in the first place?

324
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.380
If he did so, Mr. Saiga would've been arrested by the police

325
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.080
and Jubei could've been killed, right?

326
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.380
But, it's amazing

327
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.080
how you figured out the bear cub was with Ai and Mitsuhiko.

328
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.280
I saw the excrement and footprints of the cub on the potato chip

329
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.280
as well as the mother bear that Ayumi was concerned about,

330
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.480
coming after her cub, too.

331
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.780
Bears usually give birth to two cubs.

332
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.780
If the cub that Ai and Mitsuhiko

333
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.380
brought along with them are siblings,

334
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.880
everything makes sense.

335
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.080
I'm sure that Mr. Saiga was trying to stop Jubei

336
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.680
who would most likely have been outraged at having her cub killed,

337
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.580
from attacking Ai and Mitsuhiko who had her other cub with them.

338
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.580
Which means that the old man was more concerned

339
00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.180
about the bear than he was of us.

340
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.480
Yeah, probably.

341
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.980
It can't be helped.

342
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.980
That man's been friends with Jubei for the past 20 years.

343
00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.880
Is that so?

344
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.180
Being humane to animals

345
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.180
can be a nuisance when it comes this far.

346
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.680
But...

347
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.080
But, all is well.

348
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.580
Because the mother and her cub were both fine.

349
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.180
I hope they find a nice place to hibernate.

350
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.680
Yes, I sure hope so.

351
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.380
What's with that look of yours?

352
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.180
Nothing.

353
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.480
"Next episode"

354
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.680
It seems that you must insert a 100 yen

355
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.280
to get to watch an hour of this TV.

356
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.980
What? This is...

357
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.980
