1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,140
The light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,740
Today we'll meet a fake Kogoro.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,540
This sure is a tough case.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:11,853
"Aoiya Inn"

9
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:16,453
Welcome, great detective. We are honored.

10
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,753
I didn't notice at all.

11
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:20,053
"Yoshiro Onda (58)" -I had been told last night that

12
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,753
you will be arriving in a company of three.

13
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:27,353
I arrived early because the case was closed quicker than I expected.

14
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:29,353
By the way, do you have it?

15
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:32,953
This is the strange briefcase that I told you about.

16
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,553
Of course, I have not seen the inside for five years.

17
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:39,953
In fact, I couldn't because it is locked.

18
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,753
Don't worry. I think I can manage.

19
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:46,553
Excuse me.

20
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:50,053
Can't you open it here?

21
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,253
Don't worry.

22
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,953
I will let you know

23
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,753
as soon as the mystery is solved.

24
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:57,753
After all, I'm Kogoro Mouri.

25
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:05,753
"The Kogoro Mouri's Impostor (Part 1)"

26
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:09,453
The air is so clean, it's delicious!

27
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,453
It's lovely being in the bosom of nature.

28
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,153
Darn it. Why did we have to get off the cab

29
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,553
and walk the rest of the way?

30
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:19,653
Why not?

31
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:22,353
The inn is right out there when we get out of this forest.

32
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:25,753
We still have a lot of time before our appointment.

33
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:29,953
I wanted to get there to immerse myself in the spa!

34
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:33,053
By the way, why don't you do something about the sunglasses?

35
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,353
It makes you look suspicious!

36
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:35,453
Dimwit!

37
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,553
How can the great detective show up

38
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:39,853
with a mosquito bite on the eyelid?

39
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,353
And, there may be female admirers

40
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:44,053
waiting for me at the inn!

41
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,653
I don't want to look bad.

42
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,553
Pathetic.

43
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:55,253
Who put this rock here!

44
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,353
What's that?

45
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,753
It's a Jizo statue.

46
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,453
It must have fallen in some sort of an accident.

47
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:02,353
Let's put it upright.

48
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:04,253
No...

49
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:06,053
If you do that,

50
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:07,453
a curse might fall on you!

51
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:08,553
What?

52
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,853
It's the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

53
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,053
who barely escaped being arrested the last time.

54
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:18,953
Well, hold it.

55
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:22,053
The klutz at Gunma Police.

56
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,553
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:26,053
I have business at the Aoiya Inn

58
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:28,253
just ahead from here.

59
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,053
Could it be

60
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,653
it's about the case of the unidentified man in the red jacket?

61
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,353
Well...

62
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:39,153
Actually, I'm also on my way to Aoiya Inn.

63
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,953
The body was found around here, in the Kashiragami Forest.

64
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:46,553
Kashiragami is the name of a god who causes headaches.

65
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,153
People with worries on their mind

66
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,853
who go deep into the forest are captivated

67
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:53,353
by the forest and never come back.

68
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:56,053
This forest is famous for suicide.

69
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,353
Suicide?

70
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:01,153
Yes! The statue that you were about to set upright

71
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:04,253
was the "Forward Fallen Jizo" that appeases the spirits.

72
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,053
It is said that making it upright invites misfortune.

73
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,053
That's why it is left that way for a very long time.

74
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,053
Since we're all heading to the same place,

75
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,853
I'll take you all by car.

76
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:15,053
No.

77
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:18,453
My daughter wants to walk in the forest.

78
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:22,553
But your daughter is already in the car.

79
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:23,853
Gosh.

80
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:31,053
So the body that was found is an employee at Aoiya Inn?

81
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,153
Yes. The body was found

82
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:36,853
during a hunt for wild edible plants.

83
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,153
But, there was something wrong with the body.

84
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:41,553
Something wrong? What is it?

85
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,553
We found car keys

86
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,953
but no driver's license

87
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,453
We also found cigarettes

88
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,753
but we can't find any lighter or matches.

89
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:51,553
Besides that, the man supposedly died in the summer

90
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,453
but was wearing a sweater.

91
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,953
How do you know he died in the summer?

92
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:59,553
The evidence was found in the knapsack he was carrying.

93
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,553
A package of milk and a bun with product life

94
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,253
expiring exactly 4 years ago

95
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:06,553
on July 12.

96
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:08,553
This had been verified our receipt

97
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:11,053
from a nearby convenience store

98
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,153
where they had been purchased.

99
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:16,253
Both milk and the bun had been squashed

100
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:19,153
and ruined on impact when the body hit the ground.

101
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:20,453
Hit the ground?

102
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:23,153
The body had a noose on its neck,

103
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:25,253
and there was a broken branch nearby,

104
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,953
to which the rope was tied.

105
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,153
Most probably, the man hung himself

106
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,953
and the branch broke later.

107
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:34,053
That appears to make it like he had killed himself.

108
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,353
Yes. That is why I am planning to ask

109
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,153
the employee who discovered the body

110
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:40,353
to find the reason why he killed himself

111
00:06:40,353 --> 00:06:43,053
so we can be sure it's a suicide.

112
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,553
Why are you going there, Mr. Mouri?

113
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,053
Well, this man in the red jacket

114
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,553
reportedly saw the owner of the inn.

115
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,953
What? When was that?

116
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:57,453
He said that was around October five years ago

117
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,353
I have been told that this man showed up

118
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:05,453
at the inn suddenly and told the owner this

119
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:06,853
"I will pay 100,000 yen for you

120
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:10,553
to keep this briefcase and the envelope."

121
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:14,153
He said, "I'll come back to get it one year later no matter what."

122
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:16,253
A briefcase and envelope?

123
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,553
Yeah. He told the owner to give him back

124
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,053
in the briefcase

125
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,453
if he personally shows up and to hand anybody else

126
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:24,253
who shows up the envelope.

127
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,853
Although there's no proof the man in the red jacket

128
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,953
and the body found in the woods

129
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:31,653
are the same person or not.

130
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,253
The man reportedly emphasized

131
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,553
"not to forget the red jacket and long hair"

132
00:07:36,553 --> 00:07:39,853
so probably, it is the same man.

133
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:43,253
In the end, it appears he did not show up.

134
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,953
Come to think of it, the dead man had long hair.

135
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,853
So, this is what you think happened.

136
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:52,453
The man deposited the briefcase with the inn owner five years ago

137
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:54,553
and said he will return to pick it up no matter what.

138
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:56,853
Roughly one year later in summer,

139
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:00,353
he killed himself on his way to pick it up.

140
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:03,253
The guy's dumb.

141
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:05,353
You can get it if you're dead.

142
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:07,853
That's why I've been asked by the owner

143
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,953
to solve this mystery!

144
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:13,353
He had been paid not to report to the police.

145
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:15,953
That's why he didn't tell anybody.

146
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,853
Is that so?

147
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,253
Excuse me.

148
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:22,853
So, nobody came to claim the briefcase?

149
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:27,553
Actually, a man who claimed to be his proxy showed up

150
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:30,953
the next day the man in the red jacket deposited the case.

151
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:34,953
He was a strange man, bearded, wearing a hat and sunglasses.

152
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,553
Although the owner could not decide right away,

153
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:39,453
he decided to hand the envelope to the man,

154
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,953
as he was directed to do.

155
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,053
And then?

156
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:46,753
The man opened the envelope and read the memo right away.

157
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,153
He appeared angry

158
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,953
and tore up the memo.

159
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:55,053
And threw it away in the trash can in the lobby.

160
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,253
He left and never returned again.

161
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,953
What did the memo say?

162
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,453
The owner was curious and collected the pieces.

163
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:05,253
When he glued them together,

164
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,553
he saw seven letters

165
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,553
written hastily in blood back

166
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,553
"I will curse you to your death"!

167
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:18,453
Goodness, that's why I told you not to come.

168
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:20,353
But...

169
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,953
Don't worry!

170
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:25,353
Pops Kogoro will solve the mystery

171
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,953
as soon as he gets to see what's inside the case.

172
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:29,353
You're right.

173
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,753
And what's inside the case...

174
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:32,953
Could it be...

175
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:37,553
It's the long-haired man's hair.

176
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,653
I hate the pandemonium you stir up.

177
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:45,253
Welcome to Aoiya Inn.

178
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:48,053
"Masao Jinbo (34)" -I'll park your car in our parking area.

179
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,753
I'll leave it to you.

180
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,953
It's a great looking inn!

181
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,153
What? Is this your first time here?

182
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,153
You just said a while ago

183
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:03,053
you're going to ask an employee again.

184
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:06,053
The last time, we asked him to come over to our station.

185
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,653
Officer Yamamura!

186
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:09,153
Mr. Urakawa.

187
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:11,153
He's the one who found the body years ago.

188
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,153
His name is Mr. Urakawa.

189
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:16,753
Yes, I was shocked.

190
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:20,853
"Eiji Urakawa (37)" -I never expected to see a dead body there.

191
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,253
Although, he was nearly completely skeletonized.

192
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,953
Were you the only one who found the body?

193
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,453
-Yes. -Excuse me.

194
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:31,653
Do you always go picking plants all by yourself?

195
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:35,353
No. Mr. Jimbo, Mr. Touda who is the owner,

196
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:38,153
and I take turns picking plants in the forest.

197
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:42,753
However, I have the highest percentage of finding bodies.

198
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,953
I have the knack I feel the presence of dead bodies in the air.

199
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,053
Is that so?

200
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,453
In fact, it's usually my turn after our trip.

201
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,253
I had no choice.

202
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,553
A trip?

203
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,453
Every year before summer vacation,

204
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:57,853
the inn is closed for all employees

205
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,753
to participate in a group tour.

206
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,153
You see, the entrance to the forest

207
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,253
is right in front of the inn.

208
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:06,653
There are less people watching around here.

209
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:09,353
That's why more people commit suicide at that time.

210
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:13,453
If it is suicide, I have nothing to do.

211
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:17,953
Hey, isn't this person in sunglasses a police officer?

212
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,953
Oh, no, this is...

213
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:25,453
I am proud to present to you the great detective...

214
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:28,953
You must be the assistant to Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

215
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:30,753
-Assistant? -No. That's not it.

216
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:31,853
He is...

217
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,953
Mr. Mouri has already arrived

218
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,853
and is already waiting in his room.

219
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:40,353
What?

220
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:43,353
Are you saying that Kogoro Mouri is already here?

221
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,353
Yes, three hours earlier.

222
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,653
Then, what about the briefcase?

223
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,753
He brought it up to his room.

224
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:51,853
He is such a nice person.

225
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:56,553
He gave out autographs to all the employees

226
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,653
Please don't soil it

227
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:02,153
I'm planning to get it framed.

228
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,253
And, where is he now?

229
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:08,353
He's in Room 209

230
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,153
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

231
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,753
-Wait, Ran. -What?

232
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:15,953
You know, in the old Japanese samurai movies.

233
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,253
That delectable scene

234
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,553
in which the genuine one confronts the impostor.

235
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,253
Bearing the unbearable, suffering the insufferable.

236
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:27,253
When that impostor begins his deduction show,

237
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,353
I enter and show my genius as sleuth,

238
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:32,553
sweeping the crowd off their feet!

239
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:35,053
What kind of plan is that! How foolish!

240
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:38,553
Officer Yamamura, please talk some sense into him!

241
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,253
That sounds like a great idea!

242
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:42,553
Brilliant, isn't it?

243
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,353
Please let me in on that!

244
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,853
Leave me out!

245
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:51,953
Excuse me, but can I have your names?

246
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:54,453
His name?

247
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,053
Let's say. I'm just a plain old man named Mitsuemon Echigo.

248
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,753
I'm just a simple man

249
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:01,953
who travels through the country.

250
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,553
That's so cool.

251
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:05,253
What?

252
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:08,553
Just give me the cheapest room!

253
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,353
-Yes, sir. -Excuse me.

254
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:14,053
Your daughter appears to have left her cellphone

255
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:16,153
inside the car.

256
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,653
Isn't this your daughter's?

257
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:22,153
Thank you, I'm obliged.

258
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,953
Your gesture is appreciated!

259
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:26,253
Shall we be on our way?

260
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:30,553
Shall we take a bath and have a drink later?

261
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:31,553
No, thank you.

262
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:33,753
I do appreciate it but I am on duty.

263
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:36,353
He says he's Mitsuemon Echigo.

264
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,053
"Aoiya Inn"

265
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:52,953
Absolutely great!

266
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,253
No...

267
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:56,453
This way, you can do away with the impostor.

268
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,353
We'll be able to see his detective show tonight.

269
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,353
-How disgusting! -That sounds so good, right?

270
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,153
Darn it.

271
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:11,453
The show doesn't appear to be starting.

272
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:14,553
I told you to talk to him earlier!

273
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,053
That impostor might have escaped already!

274
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,953
No. It seems like nobody left the inn.

275
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:22,053
If he's not doing it,

276
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:25,453
it's time for us to go pay him a visit.

277
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,153
Hey! Are you there? Imposter!

278
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:30,553
Hey! Come out!

279
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:33,653
I'm going in.

280
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,153
Hey, it's all dark in here!

281
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:37,953
Hide being under covers

282
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,253
because you can't solve the mystery?

283
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,953
Wake up! The real Kogoro Mouri is here!

284
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,053
What's this?

285
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,853
This is...

286
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,261
Officer!

287
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,061
What's the matter?

288
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,861
Everything is the matter!

289
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,661
Detective Mouri has been found in his room, hanging from his neck!

290
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,961
What!

291
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:15,661
Anyway, you have to come in a hurry, too!

292
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:16,961
What?

293
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:26,061
Mr. Mouri! How can this be?

294
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,261
In my tears, your face looks distorted.

295
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,661
But, why did you do something foolish like this?

296
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:34,661
The Sleeping Kogoro has gone to sleep for eternity.

297
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:36,861
You overdid your joke!

298
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,561
What is this silly talk?

299
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,561
-What! -We haven't allowed anyone

300
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:43,661
into this area.

301
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,461
You'd better call your colleagues at the station,

302
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,661
as well as the forensic team!

303
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:52,261
A ghost!

304
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,561
What? An impostor?

305
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,961
Are you for real?

306
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:59,761
That man impersonated Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

307
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:04,561
This is the real great detective Kogoro Mouri.

308
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,061
I knew it!

309
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:10,161
I knew your face from somewhere.

310
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:12,061
Please forgive our blunder.

311
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:15,161
I had never seen your face.

312
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,561
But why did he pretend to be Mr. Mouri?

313
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,761
He probably wanted to see what's inside the case.

314
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:25,561
Look, the key is still in the keyhole.

315
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,861
True, let's look inside.

316
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,761
What?

317
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,361
This is...

318
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,361
Sports papers?

319
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:41,661
Akagimaru?

320
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:42,961
Isn't Akagimaru that sumo wrestler

321
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,161
who retired four years ago after sustaining a serious injury?

322
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,961
Look closely!

323
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,861
This paper features the September sumo tournament five years ago!

324
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:53,561
That was when he drew media attention

325
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:57,761
for winning for the first time in 18 years.

326
00:16:57,761 --> 00:17:00,461
Why is it here?

327
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:03,261
Hey, there's something under the newspaper.

328
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,561
Look, something that looks like black yarn.

329
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,461
For goodness' sake.

330
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:15,061
It's only a bundle of hair packed in a newspaper.

331
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:18,261
But the hair is long!

332
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:21,361
I hope it's not the curse of the longhaired man

333
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:26,361
in the red jacket who died four years ago.

334
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,261
If a curse can kill people,

335
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:31,361
the police and we detectives are out of business!

336
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:34,161
In other words, this is what happened!

337
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:37,861
Five years ago, two men had a wager.

338
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:41,861
Over what will happen to an athlete one year from then.

339
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,261
The two men were the long-haired man in the red jacket,

340
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,061
whose body was discovered sometime ago,

341
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,661
And the other, the man who claimed to be me

342
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:53,261
and was found hanging by his neck over there.

343
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,661
And the professional athlete is Akagimaru,

344
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:58,861
who enjoyed the peak of his career five years ago!

345
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:03,461
The longhaired man told the imposter

346
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,261
"My answer is in here."

347
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:07,161
"I will place this in the care of the inn owner"

348
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,461
"and give you the key."

349
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:12,261
"Let us check what will happen one year later."

350
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:16,661
Then, who's the bearded man with the hat?

351
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,161
He probably was the imposter.

352
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,461
The memo with the writing,

353
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:25,261
"I will curse you to death",

354
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,061
was probably a threat to kill

355
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,061
if he breaks the promise and comes earlier.

356
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:32,661
But the sports papers in the case...

357
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,861
what does that have to do with the answer?

358
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,561
Remember, there was one more thing with the hair.

359
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:41,561
When a sumo wrestler cuts his hair...

360
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,461
That means retirement!

361
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:45,561
You got it.

362
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,361
However, Akagimaru won the Nagoya tournament,

363
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:50,861
just before he suffered the fatal injury

364
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:53,261
and was promoted to the rank of ozeki.

365
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:56,061
The wager probably involved a large amount of money

366
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,761
Believing that the wrestler is not likely to retire,

367
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,661
the longhaired man committed suicide

368
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,061
before arriving at the inn.

369
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,561
But, why would this man commit suicide?

370
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:10,961
Because the prediction made by the longhaired man was right.

371
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:14,261
When he learned that the long-haired man died four years ago,

372
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:18,761
he wanted to know what was inside the briefcase.

373
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,261
He heard that the owner of the inn

374
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:23,961
had solicited my service over this case.

375
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,461
He pretended to be Kogoro Mouri

376
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:28,861
and was able to check what was inside the case. However...

377
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,761
The prediction turned out right.

378
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,161
He was driven by the sense of guilt of causing the long-haired man

379
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:37,861
to kill himself four years ago over the wager,

380
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:40,161
so he hang himself with his belt

381
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:44,361
to kill himself as well.

382
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:45,661
What wonderful brainwork!

383
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,561
You exceed your reputation!

384
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,361
Well... thank goodness for my agile mind!

385
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,761
Of course, you're right!

386
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,661
No one gets killed with a curse in this age of science and technology!

387
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,861
It is a curse!

388
00:19:57,861 --> 00:19:58,961
What?

389
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:00,161
Here, look at this carefully.

390
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,761
The length of hair is not even,

391
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:04,761
some are perfect and some are dyed.

392
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:07,861
In addition, it's slightly wet.

393
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,761
If all this hair had been wet for five years,

394
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:12,061
don't you think it's a curse?

395
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:18,861
No! This is not the curse of the longhaired man!

396
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,161
It is the evil spirit of a hippie

397
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:23,961
who has long-dyed and permed hair!

398
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,361
Hey.

399
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:29,361
By the way, your hair was wet a while ago right, Ran?

400
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,161
Well, of course!

401
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,361
I just had a bath!

402
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,161
Don't be so nosy!

403
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,861
Bath?

404
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,561
But you told me you couldn't get into the bath in the afternoon.

405
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,961
That's because it was closed for cleaning.

406
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,061
Talking about been wet,

407
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,461
the tatami mat at the entrance

408
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:49,661
was a bit wet, wasn't it?

409
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:52,761
Well, yes...

410
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:56,861
Are the baths cleaned in the early evening in this inn?

411
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,961
No...

412
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:02,661
The baths are cleaned usually in the middle of the night.

413
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,961
That means that someone in the inn

414
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,161
hung up the sign in front of the women's bathhouse,

415
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:09,761
to keep people away.

416
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:13,461
In order to collect a large amount of women's hair

417
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:15,261
from the drain to bring it here.

418
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,761
Placing the hairs in between the newspapers in the case,

419
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,761
to make it look like it's the curse of the longhaired man.

420
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:25,861
Possibly to distract the police investigation.

421
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:28,261
Then... Does this mean...

422
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:30,561
Yes. This is homicide!

423
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,261
The tatami mat was wet probably because

424
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,161
the culprit went into the bathhouse in a hurry

425
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,361
in socked feet.

426
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:42,061
Then he returned to this room with wet feet.

427
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:46,061
And the culprit knows where the "Closed for cleaning" sign is.

428
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:50,961
That means, the culprit is among the employees.

429
00:21:57,261 --> 00:22:00,561
Yes. This is a homicide.

430
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:03,761
The culprit probably is the person has something to do with

431
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:06,961
the longhaired man who died four years ago.

432
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,261
The nagging point is the strange circumstances

433
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,761
under which his body was discovered.

434
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:15,061
Car keys were found, but not his driver's license.

435
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:18,161
Cigarettes were found, but no lighter or matches.

436
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:21,861
And, he was wearing a sweater when it was summer

437
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:25,661
Most probably, the longhaired man didn't kill himself.

438
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:28,261
That was homicide too.

439
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:31,361
Someone had tampered the body

440
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,161
on purpose.

441
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:07,061
"Next Episode" -How childish.

442
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:10,061
I can't see how anybody can do something so embarrassing.

443
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:11,861
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm childish!

444
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:13,361
I have seals on mine too!

445
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:14,461
What?

446
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:18,261
The person who found that...

447
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,461
How did you know?

448
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:21,661
Just as I thought.

449
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,361
He's the killer!

450
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:31,461
Next Conan,

452
