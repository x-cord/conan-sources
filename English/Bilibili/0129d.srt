1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:05,763
In order to get the floppy disc that had the data of the poison,

2
00:00:05,763 --> 00:00:09,363
made by code name Sherry, alias, Ai Haibara,

3
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:12,663
from her older sister's teacher, Professor Hirota,

4
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:15,963
of Nanyo University, we headed off to his house.

5
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:21,963
However, the professor was found killed inside a room

6
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:24,863
where the door and the windows were locked.

7
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:28,863
The cause of his death was a violent blow on the back of the head

8
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,463
with a decorative object upon falling.

9
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:35,563
This is a carefully schemes murder behind locked doors.

10
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,963
The three suspects are Mr. Hosoya, who came around 20:00,

11
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:41,663
in exchange to Mrs. Hirota going out.

12
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:45,963
Mr. Morioka who came to play chess around 21:00.

13
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:50,363
And, Mr. Shirakura who came after the incident had occurred.

14
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:53,363
The problems in question are the key

15
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,863
that is under the notebook in a straight line from the telephone.

16
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:00,163
And the slightly bent out of shape cassette tape of the answer phone.

17
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,363
How on earth did the killer commit the murder?

18
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:08,163
Forget it, Shinichi. Forget this case.

19
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:11,963
It's checkmate.

20
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:16,363
Checkmate?

21
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,263
This is it!

22
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:23,263
Now all the men are out on the board.

23
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:26,463
It's an accident, an accident.

24
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:29,863
Professor Hirota was drunk, fell down together with the bookshelf,

25
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:32,263
hit the back of his head violently and died.

26
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,263
Judging from the circumstances at the scene,

27
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:36,063
it sure can be looked at in that way,

28
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,363
but there are several points that bother me.

29
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:40,263
I don't care about that.

30
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:41,363
The room was locked,

31
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:45,463
and moreover, the key was under the notebook among scattered books, right?

32
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:49,363
If there were a killer, how did that person lock the door?

33
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,963
That's why we're trying to figure that out.

34
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:55,663
I'm sorry, but I have some matters to attend to tomorrow,

35
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,063
-so if you will excuse me. -I'll be on my way, too.

36
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:59,763
I'm leaving, too.

37
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:00,863
Hey, wait.

38
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,063
Everybody, wait up.

39
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:06,363
I just...

40
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:08,763
Hey, what are you using my voice suddenly for?

41
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,463
I've figured it out.

42
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:14,163
How the trick of the locked door murder was carried out,

43
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:18,063
as well as who the killer is.

44
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:20,063
What?

45
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:24,463
Hey, Shinichi.

46
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:26,563
Never mind just move your mouth in keeping with my voice.

47
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,763
Seriously. Like I've been telling you,

48
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:30,263
no matter how you look at it.

49
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:34,363
No, no, that's why amateurs are no good.

50
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,463
An amateur.

51
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:36,763
And just who do you think you are?

52
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,963
The room was indeed locked from the inside.

53
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:41,163
No matter how you look at it, it looks to be an accident.

54
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:44,663
But, this trick of a locked room can be carried out perfectly

55
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:48,463
by using the cassette tape of the answer phone and the chess piece.

56
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:50,163
Cassette tape?

57
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:51,863
A chess piece?

58
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,563
Are you sure, Shinichi?

59
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:57,863
Hey, stop glancing at me.

60
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,263
Act more confident like a detective, will you?

61
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:05,063
Proof speaks more than words. Show us, will you?

62
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:09,463
The trick that you have imagined, right here, before us all.

63
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,563
Definitely.

64
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:15,963
I'll have Conan help me and replay how it was done.

65
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,463
Do you know what you're doing?

66
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:22,163
Yes, trust me. It'll work 100 percent.

67
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:26,163
Officer, do you happen to have a cellular on you?

68
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:28,063
Yes, I have one.

69
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,163
Lend me that glove, too.

70
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:35,263
Officer Yokomizo, I've brought the cassette tape.

71
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:40,263
It is the same as the one used in the telephone here.

72
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:43,563
Why? I asked for no such thing.

73
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:45,563
What? But just a while ago, this boy said...

74
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,563
Well, never mind, it's no big thing!

75
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,563
May I have the tape, officer?

76
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:56,263
First, pull out the tape to a certain length.

77
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:57,463
Hey.

78
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:59,663
Set the cassette into the phone.

79
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:02,263
Of course, the tape is left sticking out.

80
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:06,063
Next, straighten the tape that is sticking out, and pull it straight.

81
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:08,463
Go out of the door,

82
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:12,263
and pull the tape through the ring of the key.

83
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:15,563
Then leave that key outside the door, take the remaining tape

84
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:19,963
and go back to the place where the notebook was on the floor.

85
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:23,263
Next, place three pawns

86
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,763
that are of the same height in the shape of a triangle,

87
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:27,463
then hook the edge of the tape that is left,

88
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:30,563
onto the pawn that is closest to the phone,

89
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,663
and place the notebook on it.

90
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,863
What a joke.

91
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:37,563
You may be trying to knock the pawn over

92
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,363
with the force of the tape being pulled,

93
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,563
but that's just a paper plan.

94
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,463
The stand of the pawn is quite stable,

95
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,363
so the key will hook on to the pawn before it falls,

96
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:48,363
and come out from under the notebook.

97
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:51,463
It's the opposite.

98
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,963
I'm going to turn the pawn upside down after this.

99
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,363
Even if the head of the pawn is round,

100
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,463
so long as the cover of the notebook is firm like this,

101
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:01,963
it can be placed on.

102
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:07,963
You just wait and see. I'll do it for you right now.

103
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:12,963
First, the door is locked from the outside.

104
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,363
Then, the key is placed on the floor and a phone call is made.

105
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:27,563
The answer phone goes off, and the tape is wound.

106
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:31,663
The key is pulled in under the space of the door,

107
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:35,063
and moves under the notebook that is placed in the center of the room.

108
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,963
It will eventually bump into the pawn,

109
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:40,663
which will then lose its balance and the key...

110
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,763
will go under the notebook.

111
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:46,863
It went in.

112
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,163
I see.

113
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:50,663
So, if you keep on moving the answer phone,

114
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:54,163
the tape is wound, and the evidence vanishes.

115
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:56,863
Well? Did it work?

116
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,963
It was fantastic, Shinichi.

117
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:03,463
Oh, no. Well, it's just as I thought.

118
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,863
And if the pawn is place at a corner of the notebook,

119
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:09,863
it would make it more difficult from the pawn to roll under the notebook.

120
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:13,063
Well, even if it did, it wouldn't look very unnatural.

121
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:15,563
Which means that the one who called

122
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,463
and left 10 messages in the answer phone

123
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:19,263
in order to use the trick

124
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:22,963
is you, Mr. Akira Shirakura.

125
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:25,863
Then, are you the one who killed my husband?

126
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:27,663
Wait.

127
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,163
The tape was twisted here and there,

128
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,863
and that serves as evidence that the tape was used for the trick!

129
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,363
Is that right?

130
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:36,563
Just a minute, please.

131
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,663
I admit that the trick just now is really superb.

132
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:43,163
But, why do I turn out to be the one who set it up?

133
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:47,163
All I did was put a lot of messages in the answering machine.

134
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:49,063
In the first place, if I were the one who did it,

135
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,763
I wouldn't come all the way back here.

136
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:53,763
You came back to get something, didn't you?

137
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:57,663
Yes, you came to get the tape of the answer phone

138
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,963
because it had your fingerprints all over the place.

139
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:03,263
When I took a look at the tape a while ago,

140
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:05,263
I could tell in one glance.

141
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:08,463
There were the fingerprints of somebody all over the tape.

142
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:13,763
And I could also tell that this was an unprepared, impulsive murder.

143
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:18,863
You probably met Professor Hirota tonight and got into an argument.

144
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,963
You then, impulsively hit him on the head.

145
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:25,863
Fortunately, this trick crossed your mind,

146
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,263
and you were able to think up a locked door murder

147
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,563
which looked to be an accident.

148
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:32,063
But, since the murder wasn't planned ahead,

149
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,163
you didn't have gloves,

150
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:36,263
And you couldn't help getting your fingerprints on the tape.

151
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:39,463
Therefore, you decided to be the first to discover the corpse,

152
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:43,463
and after you made Mrs. Hirota confirm that the door was locked,

153
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,063
you were waiting for a time when you could switch tapes.

154
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,463
However, we found the corpse first,

155
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,963
and the police arrived sooner than expected,

156
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:55,463
so having no choice, you came here like you said in the tape.

157
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:59,863
You went out of the way to leave your name on the tape,

158
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:03,263
so that in case you couldn't grit the tape, back,

159
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:06,263
it would make it more difficult to see through the trick.

160
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:08,763
If there are many no-message recordings,

161
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,963
whether you like it or not,

162
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:13,663
attention would focus on the tape with your fingerprints on.

163
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:17,063
You can go ahead and check Mr. Shirakura if you like.

164
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,063
He's bound to have Professor Hirota's floppies on him somewhere.

165
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,663
After all, he couldn't have possibly checked the contents

166
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:27,363
of the large batch of floppies he took in such a short time.

167
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:31,463
Then, can we start by searching your house, Mr. Shirakura?

168
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,763
They're in the dashboard of my car

169
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,963
that is parked in front of this house.

170
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,863
All the floppies are there.

171
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:43,063
The one with the data of the pictures is there, too.

172
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,763
Pictures?

173
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:46,863
Didn't I tell you a while ago?

174
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:50,263
That I'm supposed be doing a column in a magazine

175
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,163
entitled, "The Unexpected Plain Face of a Model",

176
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:54,563
and that I took a picture of me dressed in woman's clothes

177
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:58,263
during a university festival, together with Professor Hirota.

178
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:01,263
But what he had sent me was a message that said,

179
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:06,563
"There is Nothing Better Than This Plain Face of Yours".

180
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,663
And a picture of my face in the past.

181
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:10,063
Your face in the past?

182
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:14,063
I had plastic surgery when I became a model.

183
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,463
I changed my name, too.

184
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:18,263
I thought it was just the picture.

185
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:20,763
My face wasn't all that clear because of the make-up and wig,

186
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:21,763
and with it being me dressed in woman's clothes,

187
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,163
I thought it would be a good joke.

188
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,263
I naturally couldn't give the editor a picture of the face of the past.

189
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:31,163
So, I came to ask the professor to lend me the picture.

190
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,963
But, he...

191
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:36,763
Oh, I forgot which floppy it was

192
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:40,263
that had the picture of you dressed in woman's clothes.

193
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:44,363
If it's the picture I sent to you, I can get it out right away.

194
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:47,763
I can send it directly to the editor's office if you like?

195
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,463
I got enraged at his words.

196
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:54,463
And when I snapped back to myself.

197
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,863
Professor Hirota was on the floor before me.

198
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:04,263
The rest is as he had explained.

199
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:06,963
Everything is right to the smallest detail.

200
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:10,663
Okay, please come to the station with us, then.

201
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:11,663
Hey.

202
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:13,163
Yes, sir.

203
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,163
Mr. Shirakura.

204
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,263
Maybe it's none of my business.

205
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,963
But I think that Professor Hirota sent you the picture of your past,

206
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:30,163
because he wanted you to have more confidence in yourself

207
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,463
as well as be true to yourself.

208
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:38,663
I would've liked to hear those words directly from Professor Hirota.

209
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:42,163
Too bad.

210
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:49,063
Well, that was a fantastic deduction.

211
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:52,663
Thanks to you, the case was solved, Mr. Agasa.

212
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:54,563
Well, no.

213
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:59,263
And I would like to have the floppy that I came to get, back right away.

214
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:04,263
No. We'll have to check out the evidence at the station first.

215
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,763
So, he says. What now?

216
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:10,863
Can't help it. I guess we'll get out of here for now.

217
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:13,263
Okay, then. We'll be heading home.

218
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,163
Take care.

219
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:17,563
Hey, come on, you too.

220
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,563
Why?

221
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:26,763
Why didn't you save my sister?

222
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,763
Your sister?

223
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:32,563
You still haven't realized?

224
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:35,663
Masami Hirota is an alias that my sister

225
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:37,363
took from Professor Hirota's name.

226
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,263
Don't tell me that the Masami Hirota of the 10 billion bank robbery

227
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,763
is your...

228
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:53,163
You can't go...

229
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,763
Ms. Masami Hirota.

230
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,463
You'll be killed if you go.

231
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,563
Thank you.

232
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:04,663
I'm sorry, Conan.

233
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:09,863
Who is behind the black curtain?

234
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:15,763
Where are you?

235
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:17,063
Show yourself!

236
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:18,563
Well done.

237
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,563
Masami Hirota.

238
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:25,363
Or should I said, Akemi Miyano.

239
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,163
Gunshot.

240
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:30,563
Ms. Masami.

241
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,063
Hold on there!

242
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:35,863
Ms. Masami.

243
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:39,463
It's a large organization consumed by mysteries.

244
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,663
The only thing I know about the organization

245
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:44,463
is that it's color is black.

246
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,763
Black?

247
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,163
That's right.

248
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:49,963
The way the individuals of the organization can identify one another

249
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:52,663
is their black crow-like trench coat.

250
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,563
Take this.

251
00:12:57,563 --> 00:13:01,563
Please, before they realize it.

252
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:05,263
I'll leave it to you, little detective.

253
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:10,063
So, she was your older sister.

254
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:11,563
That's right!

255
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:12,863
Hey.

256
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:16,463
With your power of deduction,

257
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,963
you could've easily seen through what my sister was up to!

258
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:23,063
Then why... why didn't you?

259
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:25,063
Why?

260
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:29,963
Her trembling, crying voice,

261
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:33,463
brought back memories of a painful and sad case

262
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,563
that I had almost forgotten.

263
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:42,363
The was probably the first time she showed her real self to me.

264
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:14,863
A week later, the floppy was sent to us from the police,

265
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:19,163
so we decided to take a look at it on the computer right away.

266
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:22,763
It's a wonder it made it through the investigation of the police.

267
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:24,863
All the floppies of the organization

268
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:28,563
are plain text files unless a password is entered.

269
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,263
They would never be suspected.

270
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,363
How is it? Will it come out?

271
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:36,663
Yes. And the data that is in here is not only of the poison.

272
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:39,963
The real name, address and code name of the person

273
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,863
who was working on the poison

274
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,563
before I was placed in my position is supposed to be in here, too.

275
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,063
The name of the person who invested in this research

276
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,463
should also be in here.

277
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:50,963
I see.

278
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:55,163
If we do it right, we make be able to strip them naked.

279
00:15:57,263 --> 00:16:02,463
Gin, seems like the old man called Hirota dropped dead.

280
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,863
Yes, it saved us the trouble of killing him ourselves.

281
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:10,063
But, we still don't know the whereabouts

282
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:11,963
of the woman who got away.

283
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,463
They're checking to see

284
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:17,863
if somebody within the organization helped her escape.

285
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:20,763
And now, the places they may drop into

286
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:22,863
have all been gotten rid of.

287
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:26,163
I'm sure she'll come out from her side soon...

288
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:28,863
I heard that the floppy with information on the poison

289
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,063
was forfeited by the police.

290
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:34,063
That's nothing to worry about.

291
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:37,663
That floppy is a bit rigged.

292
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:42,863
What's happening?

293
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:47,063
What is this?

294
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:49,563
Computer virus, Night Baron.

295
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:50,963
What?

296
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:53,463
The floppy has been programmed so that if it is booted up with a computer

297
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:57,963
other than the organization's, a virus eats the data.

298
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,363
How careless of me.

299
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,263
Then, all the data is...

300
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:04,663
Yes. Everything has vanished.

301
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:06,663
Even the computer program.

302
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:07,963
What?

303
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:09,563
Darn.

304
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:18,963
It seems that we're going to be hanging around each other for a long time,

305
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:20,363
Conan Edogawa.
