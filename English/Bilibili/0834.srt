1
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.170
Room 901, right?

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.570
Yeah, the floor on the very top.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.170
You snuck into the car, didn't you, glasses kid?

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.270
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.670
Its okay, sonny.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.170
Children are supposed to be active.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.470
Be careful. Okay?

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.470
Okay!

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.070
Hold it there, brat!

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.170
It must be beyond on the other side.

11
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.170
Geez, you're always.

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.570
This is not play, you know?

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.870
Die!

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.270
I did it.

15
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.270
Who are you?

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.670
Mr. Takarada?

17
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.470
Yeah. He asked for it.

18
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.270
Pops, call an ambulance.

19
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.970
Too late.

20
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270
He's been dead for at least two hours.

21
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.170
He's been strangled to death.

22
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.770
Strangled?

23
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.770
What?

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.270
A canvas stained black with crime.

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.770
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

26
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.270
A mysterious case in which a person is killed twice.

27
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.470
Somebody, somewhere is lying!

28
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.070
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.370
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.169
"The Man Who Died Twice (Part 1)"

32
00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.769
Yoichi Takarada?

33
00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.069
"Yoichi Takarada (48)" -You mean that notorious loan shark?

34
00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.269
According to Mr. Takarada's secretary, Haruyuki Shinkai,

35
00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.669
"Haruyuki Shinkai (27)" -Mr. Takarada rented this room to write novels in.

36
00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.469
Come to think of it, he used to over indulge in publishing his own books.

37
00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:52.869
And I heard that he enjoyed it too.

38
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.669
Mr. Takarada confined himself to this room today too

39
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.669
to concentrate on writing, is that correct?

40
00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:58.869
Yes.

41
00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.969
He was in here alone from morning.

42
00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.269
I didn't know that he was such a rogue.

43
00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.669
He asked you to come here, didn't he?

44
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.469
I've never met him before,

45
00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.469
yet he suddenly called me before noon and asked me to come here.

46
00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.769
He said he wanted to talk something over with me

47
00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.569
because he got a warning of murder.

48
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.469
He asked me to come at 3:00.

49
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.269
But, when I got here at the appointed time...

50
00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.469
The warning had already been executed.

51
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.769
This seems to be the warning note.

52
00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:29.869
It was on the table.

53
00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.169
"I will kill Yoichi Takarada" -He's preyed on countless people.

54
00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.269
"Grudge. Hatred. Murder." -One of his victims must've sought revenge.

55
00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:38.869
When that was delivered to the house this morning,

56
00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:40.669
that's what I thought too.

57
00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.669
I'd like to see them try it!

58
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.869
I didn't want his victim

59
00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:54.169
to become a killer.

60
00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.269
So before that,

61
00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:58.769
while the president was napping...

62
00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:00.469
Die!

63
00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.569
But, I was too late.

64
00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:13.269
We'll be asking about the damage you did to the body later.

65
00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:16.069
More pressing right now is the murder that was committed.

66
00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.069
Do you have any idea who the perpetrator might be?

67
00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.769
There were too many victims who had a grudge against him.

68
00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:25.569
But, is one of them really the murderer?

69
00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.069
Just what do you mean by that?

70
00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.069
Because...

71
00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.969
Inspector Megure.

72
00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.369
Did you come up with anything, medical examiner?

73
00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:33.369
Yes.

74
00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:35.769
The perpetrator, after knocking the victim unconscious,

75
00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:38.469
with a blunt object on the back of his head,

76
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.169
seems to have choked him using a rope or something.

77
00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.069
We believe he died approximately two hours before the body was found.

78
00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.169
That would be around 1 pm.

79
00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.869
Inspector.

80
00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:53.169
He's the manager of this condominium.

81
00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.269
He's says he saw a suspicious woman just around that time.

82
00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:57.569
What?

83
00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.469
"Kinsaku Tomii (58)" -After eating lunch,

84
00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.169
I came up to this floor to do my rounds.

85
00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.669
Just then, from the direction of this room,

86
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.369
I saw a blonde that I never saw before come walking towards me.

87
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.969
I think it was just around 1 pm.

88
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:14.969
Inspector.

89
00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.669
Does this woman look familiar?

90
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.469
She's wearing sunglasses so it's hard to tell.

91
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.469
But that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman, right?

92
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.569
The person could've tried to look like one too.

93
00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.969
She's only seen leaving,

94
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.969
so she could've secretly come in from the back door,

95
00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.469
and since she was witnessed,

96
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.069
maybe she decided to leave from the front door on her way out.

97
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.669
Didn't the president lock the door of his room?

98
00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:50.669
Come to think of it, the president had a habit of chain locking the door.

99
00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.669
Besides if he was concerned enough about the note

100
00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.869
to call on Pops, a detective,

101
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:59.169
he wouldn't let anyone suspicious into the room, would he?

102
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.569
Yeah, we haven't ruled out the fact that it could've been someone he knew.

103
00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:04.769
I got it!

104
00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:08.269
His family has finished identifying his body.

105
00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.869
His wife and younger brother are here, right?

106
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:11.869
Let's go see them.

107
00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:18.869
"Mika Takarada (36)" -How should I go on living on my own from now on?

108
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:19.969
"Koji Takarada (42)" -Darn it.

109
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:23.769
Who'd do something like this to my precious older brother?

110
00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:24.869
Mrs. Takarada.

111
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.269
Where were you at around 1 pm today?

112
00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:32.769
Are you suspecting me?

113
00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:36.569
No. This is just the routine.

114
00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.369
Of course they'll suspect you. Most naturally.

115
00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:42.569
Because you'll have assets and insurance money come avalanching in.

116
00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:46.269
Talk for yourself, you hated Takarada too!

117
00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:49.169
Where were you at around 1 pm?

118
00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:53.169
I was at home organizing the storeroom because Takarada asked me to.

119
00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:56.469
I see. What about you, Koji?

120
00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:00.269
I was out walking around Shinjuku.

121
00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:04.269
Do you have people who can verify for you?

122
00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:11.069
So I guess the answer's no.

123
00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:12.569
Excuse me.

124
00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:14.969
Mrs. Takarada's telling the truth!

125
00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:16.169
What?

126
00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:19.369
At a little after 2 pm when I left the house,

127
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:21.269
I was in the study.

128
00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:23.169
But at around 1 pm,

129
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.069
Mrs. Takarada was definitely in the storeroom.

130
00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:27.569
Shinkai.

131
00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:30.269
You're a lifesaver, thank you.

132
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:31.369
No problem.

133
00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:34.269
Then...

134
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:35.669
the only one left is.

135
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.869
Hey.

136
00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:41.069
It's odd that you're narrowing it down to the family in the first place!

137
00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:42.069
Excuse me.

138
00:08:42.069 --> 00:08:45.469
Could I please ask you to continue this at the house?

139
00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:50.669
All right.

140
00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:52.869
Let's move places.

141
00:08:52.869 --> 00:08:55.169
-Me too. -Yeah.

142
00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:56.269
Officer Takagi.

143
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.369
I want you to investigate the other case.

144
00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:00.969
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:07.869
If only he had noticed that the president was dead...

146
00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:11.769
He wouldn't have had to commit the crime.

147
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.069
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

148
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:16.869
Making amends?

149
00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:18.069
Yes.

150
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:22.269
I was naturally aware of President Takarada's unscrupulous practices.

151
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.569
But I convinced myself

152
00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:27.669
that his victims were fools for allowing themselves to be preyed upon.

153
00:09:27.669 --> 00:09:29.569
But the other day,

154
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.769
one of them committed suicide

155
00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:34.369
along with his entire family.

156
00:09:35.469 --> 00:09:39.869
Their child, who died wasn't even a year old yet.

157
00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:41.369
And at that time for the first time,

158
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:45.769
I blamed myself for playing a part in the president's evil deeds.

159
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:49.169
Then this morning, I got that warning note of murder.

160
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:52.169
I figured that the one who sent the note

161
00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:54.169
was in the same boat as the person

162
00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:58.069
who took the life of his young child when committing suicide.

163
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:59.469
That's why I...

164
00:09:59.469 --> 00:10:02.969
You wanted to prevent him from committing a crime.

165
00:10:04.169 --> 00:10:09.469
But why did you decide to kill Mr. Takarada yourself?

166
00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:11.169
As long as the president is around,

167
00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:13.569
new victims will keep on being created.

168
00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:15.869
So if I kill the president...

169
00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:18.769
since I played a part in helping the president,

170
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:21.269
it would be a way to make amends.

171
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:23.769
But, I didn't make it in time.

172
00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:26.669
That person had already committed the murder.

173
00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:29.269
But the killer doesn't necessarily have to be

174
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:32.569
someone who was a victim of the president.

175
00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:36.069
Officer, do you really think that one of the family members did it?

176
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.469
I just mean that we can't say for now who did it yet...

177
00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:44.169
I hated my big brother?

178
00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:46.769
No, I didn't, Inspector.

179
00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:49.769
But, Mika mentioned earlier that.

180
00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:52.969
Koji made a living deceiving people.

181
00:10:52.969 --> 00:10:55.969
Two years ago, when he failed in one of his attempts,

182
00:10:55.969 --> 00:10:58.869
he came crying to Takarada to help him clean up his mess,

183
00:10:58.869 --> 00:11:00.669
but was refused.

184
00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:03.669
So he had no choice but to go into hiding.

185
00:11:03.669 --> 00:11:06.569
So, you resented him for that.

186
00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:09.969
Yet he came here three days ago, asking us to take him in for a while.

187
00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.769
And today, Takarada was killed.

188
00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:15.369
What's with you?

189
00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:17.469
Getting back at me for what I said earlier or what!

190
00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.269
I'm just telling them the facts.

191
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:21.969
You're making it sound like I came home

192
00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:23.869
so that I could kill big brother!

193
00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:26.769
Officer.

194
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.969
I just coincidentally happened to come back.

195
00:11:29.969 --> 00:11:33.869
The one who killed big brother is one of the victims that he preyed on.

196
00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:36.369
For all I know, there are tons of them.

197
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:42.369
"Kyoko Kinoshita (40)" -Yes.

198
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.869
It seems to be true that a lot of people hated him.

199
00:11:45.869 --> 00:11:49.669
Then, you must've received a lot of threatening notes too?

200
00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:52.769
Yes and besides...

201
00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:54.469
Besides?

202
00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:55.769
What?

203
00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:57.569
What's odd?

204
00:11:57.569 --> 00:12:02.969
It seems that Mr. Takarada used to get a lot of threatening notes.

205
00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:05.069
The maid also mentioned that there was a time

206
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:07.969
when he was attacked with a knife too.

207
00:12:07.969 --> 00:12:10.969
But, he never seemed a least bit concerned, she said.

208
00:12:10.969 --> 00:12:13.269
Then, why did he decide

209
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:16.769
to call on you just this time, Pops?

210
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:22.169
More than that, he laughs it off in front of everyone at that time.

211
00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:25.869
Then he called you, right Pops?

212
00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:29.069
I wonder if he had any special reason to do so?

213
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:30.869
I see!

214
00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:35.469
Mr. Takarada knew who was trying to kill him.

215
00:12:35.469 --> 00:12:37.069
That's why he deliberately laughed it off,

216
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:39.469
so the perpetrator would get his guard down.

217
00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:42.869
Then he wanted me to investigate and nail the guy!

218
00:12:42.869 --> 00:12:45.069
I see. What?

219
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:46.569
Which means...

220
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:50.069
The perpetrator is a family member

221
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.569
and one of the three who were there at that time!

222
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:56.869
But, Pops, out of the three...

223
00:12:56.869 --> 00:13:00.569
Mr. Shinkai who stabbed Mr. Takarada

224
00:13:00.569 --> 00:13:03.369
without knowing that he was already strangled to death is ruled out.

225
00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:07.269
And if his wife Mika has an alibi...

226
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.069
Then the only one left is...

227
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:11.769
Hey. Hold it there.

228
00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:15.569
Yes, hello.

229
00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:19.169
Yes...

230
00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:20.369
Okay.

231
00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:24.269
They found fingerprints on the murder warning note.

232
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:27.569
Mr. Koji Takarada, your fingerprints!

233
00:13:27.569 --> 00:13:30.669
No way...

234
00:13:30.669 --> 00:13:33.669
Kyoko, come here, will you?

235
00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:35.969
Yes, ma'am, did you call?

236
00:13:35.969 --> 00:13:39.869
Call my lawyer, Attorney Watari, and ask him to come here!

237
00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:42.369
Tell him I'd like to discuss inheritance processes with him.

238
00:13:42.369 --> 00:13:46.769
And contact Beika Life Insurance too because I'm the beneficiary.

239
00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:50.069
-Hurry! -Yes, ma'am.

240
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:51.469
It's only natural, right?

241
00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:55.769
Because we've found that he's the perpetrator and the case is closed.

242
00:13:55.769 --> 00:14:00.069
No. We haven't concluded that yet.

243
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:04.169
I've been waiting all this time for this moment to come!

244
00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:05.869
Now that it's over let me tell you.

245
00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:10.169
I only married Takarada for his money.

246
00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:15.269
Since he was notorious, I was anticipating that he would die early...

247
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:17.469
Thank you so much, Koji.

248
00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:22.269
I feel dizzy.

249
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:24.269
What's with her?

250
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:26.269
At any rate, Koji,

251
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:31.469
to make it look like the murder was committed by someone

252
00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:34.069
who hated Mr. Takarada you sent out the warning note,

253
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:37.269
and killed him to take revenge

254
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:39.469
for what he did to you two years ago.

255
00:14:39.469 --> 00:14:40.969
I didn't kill him.

256
00:14:40.969 --> 00:14:43.469
I didn't write any note threatening to kill him either.

257
00:14:43.469 --> 00:14:45.969
But, your fingerprints are on it!

258
00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:48.969
How strange.

259
00:14:48.969 --> 00:14:52.369
Why's he so composed?

260
00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:53.669
I see.

261
00:14:53.669 --> 00:14:54.769
Okay.

262
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:58.069
Let me know if anything comes up.

263
00:14:58.069 --> 00:15:00.269
Excuse me. Officer?

264
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:03.069
Is Koji a suspect too?

265
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:06.769
Yeah, although he seems to be denying it.

266
00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:11.369
Officer! He's not the perpetrator.

267
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.169
He has an alibi!

268
00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:14.469
What?

269
00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:17.669
Hey, just what do you mean?

270
00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:30.936
When Koji came to stay at the house,

271
00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:33.936
I was instructed by the president to keep an eye on him

272
00:15:33.936 --> 00:15:39.236
because he didn't want to have to clean up after Koji again.

273
00:15:39.236 --> 00:15:42.336
So, when Koji secretly left the house today,

274
00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:44.436
I followed him.

275
00:15:44.436 --> 00:15:46.136
Koji was at the roof of a department store

276
00:15:46.136 --> 00:15:49.536
that was full of parents and children watching a hero show.

277
00:15:49.536 --> 00:15:51.836
He seemed to be waiting for somebody..

278
00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:56.136
Although I watched him for a while, nobody showed up,

279
00:15:56.136 --> 00:16:00.136
so I figured he was stood up and started home.

280
00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:04.036
That was around a little before 1 pm to a little after 1:30 pm.

281
00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:05.536
But you said that

282
00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:09.436
you were at the Takarada residence at that time, didn't you?

283
00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:12.336
That's because the police suspected Mrs. Takarada.

284
00:16:12.336 --> 00:16:14.236
That's why I decided to testify for her alibi

285
00:16:14.236 --> 00:16:16.036
and protect her on the spur of the moment.

286
00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:18.636
What? You lied?

287
00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:22.936
But now since Koji is suspected as being the perpetrator,

288
00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:25.236
I have no choice but to tell the truth.

289
00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:26.436
As for Mrs. Takarada,

290
00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:30.036
the house maid can verify her alibi for her.

291
00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:32.136
I'm sorry that I lied.

292
00:16:32.136 --> 00:16:34.636
Oh, no!

293
00:16:35.736 --> 00:16:38.736
Inspector! His story's been corroborated!

294
00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:42.236
It's no mistake that the place was crowded with parents and children too!

295
00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:43.736
Okay.

296
00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:48.836
That secretary called Shinkai followed me?

297
00:16:51.236 --> 00:16:53.036
He looked composed

298
00:16:53.036 --> 00:16:56.336
because he knew he was being followed.

299
00:16:56.336 --> 00:17:00.136
Mr. Shinkai was in fact, not Mika's alibi witness

300
00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:03.336
but Koji's.

301
00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:05.736
Now the situation's reversed

302
00:17:05.736 --> 00:17:08.136
because I've got somebody to prove my alibi

303
00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:10.736
while you don't.

304
00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:12.436
You've got nobody.

305
00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:13.936
Excuse me.

306
00:17:13.936 --> 00:17:15.036
Ms. Kinoshita.

307
00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:19.136
You went to the hospital from noon and were not at home, correct?

308
00:17:19.136 --> 00:17:20.936
That's correct.

309
00:17:20.936 --> 00:17:23.536
I'm really sorry.

310
00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:24.736
I'm fine.

311
00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:27.536
Even without a witness to my alibi..

312
00:17:27.536 --> 00:17:28.836
What?

313
00:17:28.836 --> 00:17:31.436
If Koji's not the perpetrator,

314
00:17:31.436 --> 00:17:34.936
what about the fingerprints on the murder warning note?

315
00:17:34.936 --> 00:17:36.936
It was probably contrived.

316
00:17:36.936 --> 00:17:40.736
It was probably made by using a paper with Koji's fingerprints on it.

317
00:17:40.736 --> 00:17:44.036
The real perpetrator did it to frame Koji up as the perpetrator.

318
00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:46.536
Just who are you talking about?

319
00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:50.036
I don't gain anything from killing my brother.

320
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:53.236
But as for you, you'll finally inherit the fortune soon.

321
00:17:53.236 --> 00:17:58.836
The more so I wouldn't go out of my way to kill him, would I?

322
00:17:58.836 --> 00:18:02.736
I already heard from his doctor that.

323
00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:04.336
From the doctor?

324
00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:05.936
What did you hear?

325
00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:10.836
Thank you very much.

326
00:18:11.936 --> 00:18:13.136
No mistake about it.

327
00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:17.336
He had terminal cancer and only had six months to live.

328
00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:18.836
Which means...

329
00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:21.036
Knowing that I would be inheriting a large inheritance

330
00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:24.236
as well as insurance money by just waiting six months more,

331
00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:28.936
why would I do something as stupid as to risk losing all of it?

332
00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:36.036
I guess this is her final trump card but...

333
00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:42.836
Thank you for your cooperation.

334
00:18:45.236 --> 00:18:46.636
Hey, look at that?

335
00:18:49.936 --> 00:18:53.036
So you went to the restroom and came back.

336
00:18:53.036 --> 00:18:56.236
Then this wig and sunglasses were here?

337
00:18:56.236 --> 00:19:01.436
Yeah. It was shoved inside with my things.

338
00:19:01.436 --> 00:19:03.936
Maybe the perpetrator thought that this was a trash dump

339
00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.436
and disposed of the stuff he used to disguise himself?

340
00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.536
Yeah, no doubt about it!

341
00:19:07.536 --> 00:19:10.836
Pardon me. Would it be okay for me to borrow this?

342
00:19:10.836 --> 00:19:13.836
Yeah. But give it back to me later, okay?

343
00:19:15.136 --> 00:19:16.736
Mrs. Mika Takarada.

344
00:19:16.736 --> 00:19:20.336
The hair sample that you provided us with...

345
00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:25.536
It matched the hair that was found on the inside of the wig!

346
00:19:25.536 --> 00:19:28.736
What? It can't be...

347
00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:31.536
I know nothing about the wig.

348
00:19:31.536 --> 00:19:35.436
So, there was a reason you couldn't wait for six months ahead.

349
00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:40.436
It could be but that wig was disposed, right?

350
00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:41.936
If the perpetrator were going to dispose of it,

351
00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:43.236
there are more inconspicuous ways to get rid of it..

352
00:19:43.236 --> 00:19:44.836
You...

353
00:19:44.836 --> 00:19:48.436
You've been waiting for a chance to kill brother, right?

354
00:19:48.436 --> 00:19:51.936
And just then a convenient scapegoat

355
00:19:51.936 --> 00:19:55.136
like me showed up.

356
00:19:55.136 --> 00:19:56.536
That was scary!

357
00:19:56.536 --> 00:19:59.236
You almost got away with framing me.

358
00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:07.336
I was here at home at the time Takarada was killed!

359
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:09.436
Believe me officers!

360
00:20:09.436 --> 00:20:12.336
We'll hear you out at the station.

361
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:14.036
Please come with me.

362
00:20:14.036 --> 00:20:17.136
Case closed. Let's head home too.

363
00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:18.536
But, Pops...

364
00:20:18.536 --> 00:20:21.436
Before that, I need to use the restroom.

365
00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:24.636
I didn't do it...

366
00:20:24.636 --> 00:20:26.536
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

367
00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:32.236
She stayed married to Mr. Takarada for his money.

368
00:20:32.236 --> 00:20:36.436
But when the perfect scapegoat to frame as the perpetrator,

369
00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:39.236
Koji showed up she planned to kill her husband.

370
00:20:39.236 --> 00:20:41.536
She makes a murder warning note with Koji's fingerprints on it

371
00:20:41.536 --> 00:20:43.436
by extracting them from a sheet of paper with his prints on it

372
00:20:43.436 --> 00:20:45.136
and sent it over to the house.

373
00:20:45.136 --> 00:20:46.236
She then goes to the room at the condominium

374
00:20:46.236 --> 00:20:48.636
and strangles Mr. Takarada to death,

375
00:20:48.636 --> 00:20:49.836
Just in case she's witnessed by someone,

376
00:20:49.836 --> 00:20:52.236
she flees wearing the wig and sunglasses she prepared as disguise.

377
00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:55.536
Then she disposed of them when she was done.

378
00:20:55.536 --> 00:20:57.636
That is how it should turn out,

379
00:20:57.636 --> 00:21:00.636
but everything seems so sloppy.

380
00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:03.236
What? Is that Koji?

381
00:21:03.236 --> 00:21:07.636
Yes. You're the only person I can ask about legal stuff, Attorney.

382
00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:09.636
If a wife kills her husband,

383
00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:12.036
she can't inherit his estate, can she?

384
00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:15.136
In that case, the money goes to...

385
00:21:15.136 --> 00:21:16.236
Oh no,

386
00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:20.636
he only had one younger brother as a family member.

387
00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:22.036
Don't tell me that...

388
00:21:22.036 --> 00:21:25.736
I don't gain anything from killing my brother.

389
00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:29.136
But, if he sets his sister-in-law up as the perpetrator,

390
00:21:29.136 --> 00:21:31.436
he can have all the inheritance to himself.

391
00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:32.536
If so...

392
00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:34.436
"Kyoko" "Afternoon, Hospital"

393
00:21:34.436 --> 00:21:38.736
Which means that Koji knew you were going to the hospital today?

394
00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:39.736
Yes.

395
00:21:39.736 --> 00:21:43.236
Not only Koji, but I'm sure that everyone else knew too.

396
00:21:43.236 --> 00:21:45.236
Because as soon as I got the appointment,

397
00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:46.236
I marked it on the calendar like this

398
00:21:46.236 --> 00:21:48.236
because I didn't want to inconvenience anybody.

399
00:21:48.236 --> 00:21:50.436
So, he knew after all.

400
00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:54.436
That today, there would be zero witnesses to testify for an alibi.

401
00:21:54.436 --> 00:21:56.736
What? Why what brings you here, Mrs. Takarada?

402
00:21:56.736 --> 00:21:58.036
It's all your fault!

403
00:21:58.036 --> 00:22:02.436
You should've kept on lying about witnessing me and prove my alibi.

404
00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:03.636
Oh, no.

405
00:22:05.136 --> 00:22:07.336
What a disgusting wife she was.

406
00:22:07.336 --> 00:22:09.836
But, things just don't work out that way.

407
00:22:12.136 --> 00:22:13.636
If he planned to trick the police rather...

408
00:22:13.636 --> 00:22:16.636
All of us, he...

409
00:22:20.336 --> 00:22:24.136
I'm not going to let you have it your way.

"Next Episode" -If one were to kill Mr. Takarada

411
00:23:47.536 --> 00:23:50.136
and make it look as if Mrs. Takarada had killed him.

412
00:23:51.336 --> 00:23:53.736
That's why he put it by that man.

413
00:23:53.736 --> 00:23:56.736
Just as would be expected of the famed detective, Mr. Mouri.

414
00:23:56.736 --> 00:24:00.736
We made a mistake to start with.

415
00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:03.036
We thought it was a crime committed by a member of the family

416
00:24:03.036 --> 00:24:05.636
But Mr. Mouri...

417
00:24:05.636 --> 00:24:08.436
It won't serve to support the killing.

418

Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:20.579
"Calendar"

421
00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:22.279
The perpetrator knows a lot about mysteries.

422
00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:23.879
-What? -Two deaths!
