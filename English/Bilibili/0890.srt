1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,040
Class 1-B was assigned

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,240
assistant homeroom teacher, Rumi Wakasa, out of season.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,640
"Rumi Wakasa (37), Class 1-B Assistant Homeroom Teacher"

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,540
We went to the old storage shed to look for lime

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,240
at the request of said clumsy and fearful teacher, but...

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,040
Ayumi!

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,140
You picked up a schedule in the storage shed, right?

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,840
Yeah, I still have it.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
See?

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,140
Did you figure something out, Conan?

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,740
I see. So that's how it is!

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,640
Now that I take a closer look,

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,140
there's something wrong with this schedule, isn't there?

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,340
Surely not even upperclassmen

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,640
have seven class periods in grade school.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,540
Then, what is this chart?

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,340
Since it was in the storage shed

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,540
where we found the skeleton holding the code,

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,740
this is probably...

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,840
Probably?

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,140
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,340
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,640
A basement, a skeleton and a code on a string.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,740
Keep your eyes on Ms. Wakasa!

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,740
His name is Detective Conan.

28
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:25,797
"The New Teacher's Skeleton Case (Part 2)"

29
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:32,897
It's probably what?

30
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:36,297
It's probably the key to the code.

31
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,897
The key...

32
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:39,297
To the code?

33
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,797
What's that?

34
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:43,197
A hint to help us read the code.

35
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:44,297
What?

36
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,997
Look closely at the code.

37
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:52,597
The characters on the right side are the days of the week.

38
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:55,297
Every day of the week is represented.

39
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:57,597
You're right.

40
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:00,797
But the "water" for Wednesday is missing.

41
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:04,097
That's the water radical.

42
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:07,197
River, lake, swim.

43
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,897
A lot of characters that incorporate the water radical

44
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,197
are related to water.

45
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:12,597
Really?

46
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:16,297
Then, what are the characters on the left?

47
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,497
They're parts of characters for school subjects.

48
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:21,297
Language is "ware".

49
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:22,897
Math is "nobun".

50
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:24,497
Social studies is "kai".

51
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,797
Science is "sato".

52
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,297
Art is "ko".

53
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:28,797
Physical education is "hon".

54
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:30,397
Homeroom is "shita".

55
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,597
So knowing that,

56
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:35,997
we can fill in the forty-nine spaces

57
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:38,997
on this seven by seven grid with Chinese characters.

58
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,697
And if you apply the Japanese alphabet to them

59
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,097
starting at the top left...

60
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:47,197
You get this chart.

61
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,697
Wow!

62
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,397
It seems like we should be able to read it

63
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:52,897
when we wrap it around a pen now.

64
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,197
I'll read out the code,

65
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,597
so you guys check it against the key.

66
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,397
Understood!

67
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,097
The first character is the earth radical and nobun.

68
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,697
Well...

69
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:05,597
It's the earth radical and nobun, so...

70
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,697
Su!

71
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:09,797
Next is the water radical and ko.

72
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,097
That's ma!

73
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:13,597
Next is the fire radical and ko.

74
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,097
Ho.

75
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,197
It's sumaho (smartphone)!

76
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:21,497
Looks like it really is a key.

77
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:22,597
Yeah.

78
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:24,097
What's next?

79
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:26,797
Tree radical and ko.

80
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:27,797
Me!

81
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:29,797
Water radical and ware.

82
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,897
U!

83
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,297
Sumahomeu...

84
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,197
Soneareta...

85
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:39,297
Ebuemua...

86
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,697
What does that mean?

87
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,897
Is it some kind of incantation?

88
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:47,297
Gosh. I was so sure this was it.

89
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,897
Thanks for waiting, everyone.

90
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,797
We're finished with classes for the day.

91
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:57,697
We'll play dodge ball in our next PE class.

92
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:59,297
Hooray...

93
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:02,197
Okay, everyone. Let's clean up and go home.

94
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,197
Okay...

95
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,097
Even if you apply the Japanese alphabet vertically

96
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:19,397
instead of horizontally to the key,

97
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:24,497
you still get "yuteshiriso, utsuawoko, movunimua".

98
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:28,097
Maybe it's not the Japanese alphabet but the English alphabet.

99
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,597
The English alphabet has twenty-six characters.

100
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:33,697
Most of the forty-nine spaces would be leftover.

101
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,397
I suppose you're right.

102
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:38,597
The other things that's bothering me

103
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:42,797
are these X's drawn here and there on the chart.

104
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,897
What do they mean?

105
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:49,397
I'm disappointed, though.

106
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:51,397
We couldn't crack the code.

107
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:54,197
-Yeah. -Who cares?

108
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:56,597
I doubt there's any point in cracking the code

109
00:06:56,597 --> 00:07:00,597
we found in the hand of a thief who died in an accident ten years ago.

110
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:03,197
-Yeah, but... -That was quick.

111
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:05,497
There's already a story online

112
00:07:05,497 --> 00:07:07,897
about the skeleton we found in the storage shed.

113
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:12,197
They even included a photo of the headband with the code.

114
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,497
Seriously?

115
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:14,497
Seriously.

116
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:16,697
They're calling it a "mysterious code".

117
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:19,197
Excuse me, children.

118
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:20,797
Ms. Wakasa.

119
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:22,997
The teacher of another class asked me

120
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:29,097
to get some lime for their science class tomorrow.

121
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:30,297
I see.

122
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,097
I saw three line markers

123
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:37,297
next to the skeleton in the storage shed.

124
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:41,197
There's probably lime inside those.

125
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,097
So?

126
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:46,697
So, if you don't mind...

127
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:47,697
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:50,097
You want us to come with you because you're scared, right?

129
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:52,297
Well, yes.

130
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:57,597
Sorry for making you come with me again.

131
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:01,297
Ms. Wakasa, you really are a scaredy cat.

132
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,597
Well, there was a skeleton in there until recently.

133
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:08,997
In any case, let's get the lime and leave before it gets dark.

134
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:17,197
This room has been ransacked.

135
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,597
It was tidy earlier, right?

136
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:22,797
Could forensics have left this mess while investigating?

137
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:25,497
No, they weren't investigating.

138
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:28,197
It's more like they were searching for something.

139
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:31,897
Could someone have come after the police left?

140
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,597
But why?

141
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,097
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

142
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:39,997
What time was that news story posted?

143
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,897
Well...

144
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,697
Two hours ago.

145
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,997
Two hours ago...

146
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:50,597
That's plenty of time to come here after seeing the code online.

147
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,397
Wait. You don't think...

148
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:53,597
Yeah.

149
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:58,397
The guy who wrote that code may have died ten years ago,

150
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:01,897
but the purpose of the code still lives.

151
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,997
Then we have to solve the code!

152
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:08,797
Let's check the basement where we found the skeleton first.

153
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:12,297
The person who searched the storage shed could be hiding down there.

154
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:13,497
What?

155
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:15,797
Ms. Wakasa, can you open this trapdoor?

156
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,197
What?

157
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:20,797
But what if someone jumps out?

158
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,097
It's okay.

159
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:25,297
I'll put them to sleep using my tranquilizer gun.

160
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:29,197
Tranquilizer?

161
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:33,697
-I'm opening it. -Okay.

162
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:34,997
Here goes.

163
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:45,797
The basement hasn't been ransacked.

164
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:48,997
So they haven't been down here to search yet.

165
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:52,497
Or they noticed us coming.

166
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:55,497
And ran away.

167
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:58,597
Well, they wouldn't be able to run

168
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,797
if we discovered them in the basement.

169
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,597
Maybe they're planning to return

170
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:03,997
once the students and teachers leave

171
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:07,597
and it's dark outside to resume their search for something.

172
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:10,497
So? What is this "something"?

173
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:13,297
We'll have to crack the code to find out.

174
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:17,497
Gosh. I know I can solve it

175
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:20,797
if I figure out what those three X's mean.

176
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,497
Normally, you'd think

177
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:28,397
it's the redundant "iue" characters in "waiueo",

178
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:30,897
but then the X's should be in the third

179
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,497
through fifth squares on the bottom row.

180
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:38,097
What do those X's mean?

181
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:42,997
Conan, let's carry the lime out.

182
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:44,297
Sure.

183
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:46,797
Today was the worst.

184
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:50,897
I want to go home, have a drink, and go to sleep.

185
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,597
Ms. Wakasa, you drink?

186
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,097
Yes, I do.

187
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:57,497
My favorite is whiskey.

188
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:01,797
One glass, and I can sleep with an Ebisu-like smile on my face.

189
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,697
Whiskey... Ebisu...

190
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,097
That's it!

191
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:11,397
This code isn't in modern alphabetical order.

192
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:15,397
Then the three phrases of the code are...

193
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:23,697
That code really is connected to that ten year old case.

194
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,197
Hey, Conan.

195
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:26,997
What are you doing?

196
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:29,097
Can't find the lime?

197
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,864
I'm hungry now.

198
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:45,264
Who's there?

199
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:48,864
What's wrong, Ai?

200
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:53,364
I thought I saw someone watching us from behind the entrance door.

201
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,164
Maybe it was my imagination.

202
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:59,064
No, maybe not.

203
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,764
If I'm right,

204
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,664
after the police collected that skeleton from the basement and left,

205
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:08,964
someone ransacked this storage shed in search of something.

206
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:13,764
The ones who murdered the wealthy man ten years ago

207
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,764
and stole 200 million yen worth

208
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:20,664
of gold ingots.

209
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:23,464
That very same group of thieves.

210
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:24,964
What?

211
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:28,064
Does that mean you cracked the code?

212
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,764
Yeah, because of what Ms. Wakasa said earlier.

213
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:34,864
What? What I said?

214
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,464
Ebisu and whiskey.

215
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:42,564
Long ago, those words were written...

216
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:45,064
Like this.

217
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,864
What are those characters?

218
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,864
There are weird characters mixed in.

219
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,664
They're no longer used,

220
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,364
but they're characters from the Iroha poem.

221
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:56,964
The katakana "a" with a line under it is "ye".

222
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:00,464
The character that looks like the "i" in "ido" is "wi".

223
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:03,264
So if you apply the Iroha characters

224
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:07,064
to the code instead of the modern alphabet...

225
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,764
You get this.

226
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,364
I see.

227
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:15,764
The obsolete "ye" and "wi" characters

228
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:18,464
correspond to the spaces marked with X,

229
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,064
and the last X is a leftover space.

230
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:26,564
Yeah. And if you read the code using this chart...

231
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,364
You get "Wakemaeha, youishita (Your shares are ready)"

232
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:32,264
"Sugunikoi! (Come immediately!)"

233
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:33,764
Is that...

234
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,064
Yes. That skeleton

235
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:39,464
belonged to the boss of the thieves who met here.

236
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:44,364
He exchanged the ingots for cash and had their shares ready.

237
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:46,764
And ten years later, after seeing the news story

238
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:50,064
and realizing their boss prepared their shares

239
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,664
before his accidental death,

240
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,164
they came here to look for it

241
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,664
thinking the cash could still be inside this storage shed.

242
00:13:56,664 --> 00:14:00,064
I found heaps of cash in the lime

243
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:03,064
inside the line markers in the basement.

244
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:04,464
No way!

245
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:07,364
But couldn't he have emailed them?

246
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:08,464
If they'd been emailed,

247
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:11,964
that would have led the police to the money if they were arrested.

248
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,664
I see.

249
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:16,464
In any case, we should tell the police.

250
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:20,464
We may not want to tell them about the money yet.

251
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:22,064
Why not?

252
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:24,264
If the police act,

253
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,064
the thieves won't come back here.

254
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:31,064
So we'll round them up first.

255
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:35,064
Just like Holmes did in the "Dancing Men story".

256
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,664
The sun's already setting.

257
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,164
You're right.

258
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:46,264
We couldn't find any lime.

259
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:52,364
All we found was a code written on some finish line tape.

260
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:56,564
But the writing looks pretty fresh.

261
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,964
As though someone just wrote it.

262
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:01,264
Yeah.

263
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:03,864
Yeah, but we can't read it anyway.

264
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:05,464
Just throw it away.

265
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,764
You're right.

266
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:10,764
I'm so hungry!

267
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:15,564
Anyway, I'm excited for tonight's episode of "Kamen Yaiba"!

268
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:18,764
Yeah. The mysterious Lady Yaiba's going to be in it!

269
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,364
I'm so excited!

270
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:21,564
Right, Haibara?

271
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,464
Gosh.

272
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,964
I told you guys not to come.

273
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:47,264
Yeah, but...

274
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:49,364
It's not fair for you to come alone!

275
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:52,064
We're all part of the Youth Detective Squad!

276
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,264
But the guys coming are...

277
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:58,764
But this is kind of fun, like a test of courage.

278
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:00,764
Yeah.

279
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:03,164
Even Ms. Wakasa came.

280
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:08,664
If it becomes necessary, I'll protect you.

281
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,064
Thank you.

282
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:12,264
I'm surprise the police sent anyone

283
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,864
on the basis of such uncertain information.

284
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:18,864
Well, actually...

285
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:23,864
I think your track record convinced them.

286
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:32,664
I only came because I thought Ms. Kobayashi would be here.

287
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:35,464
Well, Conan?

288
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:39,764
What did you write in code?

289
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,364
"I'll be waiting in the basement at midnight today."

290
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:47,064
"Let's meet for the first time in ten years", I think.

291
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:51,064
They'll think their boss is still alive when they read that.

292
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:07,264
Where are you, boss?

293
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:08,564
How could you?

294
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:10,664
We haven't heard from you in ten years.

295
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,864
We thought you ran off with the money.

296
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:16,864
Come to think of it,

297
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:20,164
the code said he'd be waiting in the basement.

298
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:24,164
Hey, answer me.

299
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,164
You're down there, aren't you?

300
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:28,064
A flashlight?

301
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:30,564
What's that doing there?

302
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,564
Hey, you down there?

303
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:34,064
Boss?

304
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:36,864
Quit hiding and come on out.

305
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,464
Hold it right there.

306
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:42,164
I'm Ninzaburo Shiratori

307
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:44,064
with the Metropolitan Police Department Section One.

308
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,964
You're coming down to the station with me

309
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,564
for a ten year old robbery and murder.

310
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,464
Then that code...

311
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:52,964
It was a trap?

312
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:54,364
That's right!

313
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,564
Conan wrote that code!

314
00:17:56,564 --> 00:17:59,564
And you fell for it!

315
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:00,864
Wait!

316
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:03,564
There were four thieves, and their boss is dead!

317
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:05,164
That should leave three!

318
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:08,064
If there's only two in the basement, then...

319
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,364
Inspector Shiratori!

320
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:27,564
Brats.

321
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,964
How dare you underestimate me?

322
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:33,764
Did you find the money?

323
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,164
Yeah.

324
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:38,564
It's stuffed inside the line markers.

325
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,964
Let's see.

326
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:42,964
How's this?

327
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:44,464
You can't beat this!

328
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:48,564
It's too bad the boss died, though.

329
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:52,564
It just means there's more for us.

330
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,364
We should thank him.

331
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,964
You're right.

332
00:18:56,964 --> 00:18:58,864
Okay, boys and girls.

333
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:01,464
Why don't you head down into the basement one by one?

334
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:05,064
The kids first.

335
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:07,364
Come on, hurry up.

336
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:12,664
What's wrong?

337
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,764
Take them out with your tranquilizer

338
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:17,764
or ball like you always do.

339
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:23,064
I'm not sure I can hit them with a dart in the dark.

340
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:27,264
And I should hold onto my ball launching belt,

341
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,264
for when we get trapped inside here.

342
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,564
Is Inspector Shiratori okay?

343
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:35,764
Yeah.

344
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:39,164
He just suffered a concussion and is unconscious.

345
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:43,764
Okay. You're last, teacher.

346
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:45,364
Okay.

347
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,664
Have fun teaching your last class in the basement.

348
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,264
Ms. Wakasa!

349
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,064
It hurts!

350
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,864
Hey, what are you doing?

351
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:03,764
Ms. Wakasa!

352
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,564
It won't open!

353
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:09,664
Hey! Get up and...

354
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:13,764
He's unconscious.

355
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,064
What?

356
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:24,464
Are you ready?

357
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:25,964
What?

358
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:37,764
To move onto the next world.

359
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:03,164
Hey, Conan.

360
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:05,864
I don't hear anything anymore.

361
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:08,264
Gosh. Okay, let's open the door.

362
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:09,564
Okay.

363
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:11,364
Ready, and...

364
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:20,064
No, stop!

365
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:21,364
Stay back!

366
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:22,864
-Ms. Wakasa! -No!

367
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:25,364
Ms. Wakasa!

368
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:27,264
Are you okay?

369
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,664
Yes.

370
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:31,664
Where are the thieves?

371
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:33,664
Huh? Come to think of it...

372
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:42,964
They've been knocked out.

373
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:44,764
Ms. Wakasa, you're amazing!

374
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,264
Did you beat all three of them yourself?

375
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:52,264
I was just wildly swinging the rake around.

376
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,364
Lucky me.

377
00:22:56,764 --> 00:23:00,664
"The next day"

378
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,964
I heard the news, Ms. Wakasa!

379
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,564
You took a group of children

380
00:23:04,564 --> 00:23:07,564
to catch some thieves in the middle of the night!

381
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,564
I'm sorry.

382
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:13,264
But there was a police officer there.

383
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:15,364
I thought we'd be okay.

384
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:17,764
Then why?

385
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:18,964
Huh?

386
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,664
Why didn't you invite me?

387
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:24,964
I'm the adviser for the Youth Detective Squad!

388
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,264
You're upset about that?

389
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,464
You are?

390
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:36,364
And the police officer who came was Shiratori!

391
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:40,064
You should've told me.

392
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:42,864
Not that it matters it was Shiratori!

393
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:46,264
Takagi or Chiba or Sato or anyone else would have...

394
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:49,164
Oh, that's not what I mean by anyone!

395
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:50,864
I mean...

396
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,364
In any case, I'm the adviser for the Youth Detective Squad!

397
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:55,264
"Next Episode"

398
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:56,564
"I'll be waiting in front of

399
00:23:56,564 --> 00:24:00,064
the large fox at the Yuda Hot Springs Station.

400
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,364
From Komakichi Kurataya."

401
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:05,864
You're the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

402
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:07,464
Haginyan!

403
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,264
I'm Washiyama of the Yamaguchikita Station.

404
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,064
I'm Tsurumi.

405
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,364
What?

406
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:18,164
Why am I being arrested?

407
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:20,464
Next Conan,

408
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:24,264
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour (Yamaguchi Part)"

409
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,407
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,207
"A letter"

411
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,707
I would've bent over backwards to go!

412
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:31,807
Then why don't we talk now?

413
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:34,107
Ms. Kobayashi, it's time for class.
