1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:02,324
Suspense and deduction closes the gap

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,124
between the love and hatred between two people.

3
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,924
Mysteries abound. Strange events.

4
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:08,024
Conan and Heiji. What will Jodie do?

5
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:09,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:11,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:03,111
Hattori and I have some doubts that Jodie, the teacher,

9
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:04,511
belongs to the Black organization.

10
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:08,511
So, we went to Jodie's room to see her.

11
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,711
But, we encountered an unexpected incident

12
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,111
at the entrance of her condominium.

13
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,211
Why is something like this...

14
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,711
Falling from above?

15
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:35,811
A man came falling from the 21st floor!

16
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,811
Had the front door been locked?

17
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,311
Yeah! It was locked up tight!

18
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:46,311
Well, this room was locked up.

19
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,011
So, it must be suicide.

20
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:52,211
That is what I first thought too.

21
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:58,811
Until I saw the curtain of the bedroom window from where Mr. Takai jumped!

22
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,611
The curtain was tagged down and the curtain rail was bent

23
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,511
and a few hooks came off, right?

24
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,711
Yes.

25
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:09,011
This shows evidence that he involuntarily grabbed the curtain

26
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,311
when he came close to falling.

27
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:15,111
Would someone trying to kill himself do that?

28
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,711
So, then this is not suicide but in fact...

29
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:19,811
Murder.

30
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,711
This is a homicide case.

31
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:36,011
"English Teacher vs. Great Western Detective (Part 2)"

32
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,411
And it's also a murder in a locked room,

33
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:46,411
like we so often see in novels or movies!

34
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:49,311
But, teacher...

35
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,611
Why are you here anyway?

36
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,511
My room is next door to Mr. Takai's.

37
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:56,911
Oh, really?

38
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:59,411
Those two just came to visit me.

39
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,811
And just when we were leaving the building to eat out for dinner,

40
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:06,211
Mr. Takai came falling down in front of us.

41
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:07,611
That's right!

42
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:11,211
And then?

43
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:14,511
So have you solved this locked room murder mystery?

44
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:17,111
No, not yet.

45
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,011
But I think the strange mark on the window glass

46
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,511
may have something to do with it.

47
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,811
Strange mark?

48
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:32,411
Yes. There is a mark like something hit it from outside.

49
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,411
But what?

50
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:37,511
Inspector Megure!

51
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,811
We've finished developing the pictures that Ms. Shimoda took.

52
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,311
Oh, that was fast!

53
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:49,311
Most are just ordinary photos of the building,

54
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:52,311
but there was a picture with a strange figure.

55
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:53,911
So, we blew up the picture.

56
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,911
This is the picture.

57
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,911
Isn't this...

58
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,811
It's Mr. Takai!

59
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,311
He grabbed the curtain after all.

60
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,111
He's throwing something into the room.

61
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,211
Isn't that a cell phone?

62
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:15,311
Okay then, he threw the cell phone at the window and made the mark on it.

63
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,511
But why did he throw it anyway?

64
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:20,311
Maybe a call made him very angry.

65
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,211
That can't be it.

66
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,911
Shut your mouths!

67
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,711
This is police business!

68
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,911
You civilians, don't belong here!

69
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,911
Talk about hot tempered!

70
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:34,411
I was going to help him but no anymore.

71
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:38,211
I'm fed up with those guys. How could this happen to me so frequently?

72
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:41,111
Yet, although it's true that they may be annoying,

73
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:45,311
for some reason, with them around, the case is usual solved.

74
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,111
I don't get it.

75
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,511
Me neither.

76
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:52,911
I don't know in what way the culprit lead Mr. Takai to jump from the window.

77
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,711
All Ms. Shimoda could've done

78
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:59,111
was shock him with the flash of his camera.

79
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,411
And there was nothing strange about the mail

80
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,311
that Mr. Nakamachi sent.

81
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,711
The only one left is Mr. Kawakami, who called him, but...

82
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:09,211
No one would jump to death from the window

83
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:13,111
only because he's told to do so, would he?

84
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,111
Another thing that bothers me

85
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:18,311
is the reason why he threw the cell phone into the room.

86
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,111
A plausible explanation could be

87
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:24,211
that he left a clue in his cell phone,

88
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:27,511
so he didn't want it to drop and break.

89
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:31,211
However, the cell phone didn't break even if it fell,

90
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:34,211
and there were no suspicious letters on the screen either...

91
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:35,911
What?

92
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,611
Hello?

93
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,211
What time is it now?

94
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,511
What?

95
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:44,411
What time is it now?

96
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,111
What time...

97
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,411
It's 8.00 pm.

98
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,711
What time do you think it is now, you dumb dork?

99
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,611
Kazuha?

100
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:54,911
Who is it?

101
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,611
I don't know.

102
00:06:56,611 --> 00:07:01,111
Darn! I've completely forgotten to meet her!

103
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:02,511
What're you doing, Heiji?

104
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,411
You're the one who said that you wanted to

105
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:07,711
go try out the delicious restaurant that Mr. Ootaki told you about!

106
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:10,711
Sorry, but I don't think I'll make it today.

107
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:13,411
Hey, Heiji! Where're you now?

108
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,511
I can't hear you well!

109
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,811
I'm in a weak signal area!

110
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:23,511
Heiji? Are you listening?

111
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:27,411
So... I can't get to where you are from here.

112
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,511
So, where the heck are you?

113
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,111
Tokyo. I'm in Tokyo!

114
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,711
What? Tokyo!

115
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,211
Oh, yeah, that's right.

116
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,511
I was going to get back to you

117
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:38,511
as soon as I finished what I had to do but...

118
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,111
What're you talking about?

119
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,411
You said we'd meet in front of

120
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:46,111
the Big Man of Umeda, at 7.00 pm tonight!

121
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:49,411
I wrote it down in my memo too.

122
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,511
Memo...

123
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,111
I see.

124
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,311
So, that's what it was.

125
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:10,211
No mistake.

126
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:13,311
Yeah, the murderer is that guy!

127
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,611
What? An experiment?

128
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,511
Here, right now?

129
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,511
Yeah, that's right!

130
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:32,111
If we reenact what the three did

131
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,411
before Mr. Takai fell to his death from the 21st floor,

132
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:38,311
we may be able to solve the mystery

133
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,111
of the locked room murder quite easily!

134
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,311
But...

135
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:47,811
Ms. Shimoda was only taking photos

136
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,711
and Mr. Nakamachi was only sending mail.

137
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,711
It's true that Mr. Kawakami

138
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:57,911
in his drunken state, cursed Mr. Takai on the phone

139
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:00,511
but it's far from murder.

140
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,411
Oh, come on. Let's give it a try!

141
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:07,611
However, in order to carry out the experiment, we're missing some things.

142
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:09,211
Missing some things?

143
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,011
What on earth are you talking about?

144
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,611
Liquor!

145
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:17,011
Remember, Mr. Takai fell asleep drunk before he fell to his death!

146
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,711
Yeah, that's true.

147
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:22,211
But who's going to play the role of the drunk victim?

148
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:27,211
Yeah, that's the problem. The police officer can't drink on duty.

149
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,311
That goes without saying.

150
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,311
I'm under age.

151
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,911
The only person who can play the role is...

152
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,311
Me?

153
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,011
Right, Ms. Saintemillion!

154
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,011
Will you play the role of the drunk victim for us?

155
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:44,711
Okay! But on one condition.

156
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:49,311
Can you prepare my favorite liquor?

157
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,711
As you wish. What is it?

158
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,411
Oh, good!

159
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:04,111
It's very delicious.

160
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,611
Glad you like it.

161
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:10,811
I feel I can drink like a fish now!

162
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,711
All right, Inspector,

163
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:15,711
we'll get everything set up.

164
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:17,111
Oh, okay.

165
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:20,811
Well...

166
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:23,211
What is it, Mr. Nakamachi?

167
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:27,511
We came here because you said you wanted us to check the crime scene.

168
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,811
But the foreign woman

169
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:33,111
is drinking in the bedroom of Mr. Takai, what's this crap?

170
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:35,311
Please give us a good explanation!

171
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:41,711
Well, we're going to re-enact the crime just as it happened.

172
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,911
Are you all set?

173
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:51,711
Yeah. Ms. Saintemillion is asleep on the bed

174
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:54,811
and I've put my cell phone next to the pillow.

175
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:59,711
And we reorganized the room a little bit without telling her.

176
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,211
How did you change the room?

177
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:07,011
You'll see when you look at it.

178
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:11,011
All right, let's start the experiment.

179
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:14,311
First, Mr. Nakamachi sent an e-mail

180
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,511
to Mr. Takai's cell phone, right?

181
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:17,511
Yes.

182
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,711
So, I have to send an e-mail too.

183
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,311
I've got mail.

184
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:40,111
"Who are you?"

185
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:47,111
Hey, teacher! Did you get my mail?

186
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:51,611
Oh, yes! I've got a lovely e-mail!

187
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,911
Oh, really?

188
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:58,211
Hey, Hattori. What kind of mail did you send her?

189
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:00,711
Don't worry about it!

190
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:03,311
Next for the flashes of Ms. Shimoda's camera,

191
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,811
as she took photos of the condo from the ground.

192
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,811
Officer Chiba, get with it!

193
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,811
Yes, sir!

194
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,411
But will this experiment help us

195
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,411
to solve the mystery of the locked room murder?

196
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:21,711
We'll never know until it's over.

197
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:24,611
And last, is Mr. Kawakami, who made the call.

198
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,911
That's bullshit.

199
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,111
Hello?

200
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,211
Oh, teacher?

201
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,411
Let's just chat for a while.

202
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,211
Okay. What shall we talk about?

203
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:43,211
Let's see, like...

204
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:46,811
How about answering the mail I just sent to you?

205
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:02,061
How about answering the mail I just sent to you?

206
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,361
Okay,

207
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:08,861
but first, let me ask about you!

208
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:11,261
Who on earth are you?

209
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,361
What?

210
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,361
Tell me that first.

211
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,361
You're not a mere boy, are you?

212
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,761
You're not a mere boy, are you?

213
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:29,961
Yes, I'm just a normal high school boy.

214
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,161
Really?

215
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,561
It's hard to hear you. What's wrong?

216
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:40,061
Oh, it's because this is a high rise condominium.

217
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:44,461
It often happens when I use the cell phone here.

218
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:46,661
Hold on!

219
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:57,561
I can hear you better if I go out on the veranda.

220
00:13:58,461 --> 00:13:59,661
What?

221
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:05,861
Help! Help me! Hurry!

222
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,561
-Help me! -What's up?

223
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,961
Help!

224
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:12,761
Ms. Jodie, are you okay?

225
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:16,061
Oh, thank you, Detective.

226
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,461
What is this?

227
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:21,961
You see, we changed the position of the bed.

228
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,161
In the expectation that Jodie would go out

229
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,961
with the cell phone onto the balcony to get a better connection.

230
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:32,261
She believed that she could get to the balcony from the window

231
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,561
which was supposed to be diagonally across from the bed.

232
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,361
But actually that window has no balcony.

233
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:44,261
So, she almost fell just like Mr. Takaki fell to his death!

234
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:54,861
You and Mr. Takai were talking on the phone

235
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,761
just before he plunged to his death, right, Mr. Noboru Kawakami?

236
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:05,361
Well, originally, Mr. Takai's bed was placed

237
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,361
in front of this window.

238
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,861
But the criminal moved the bed

239
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,961
to the front of that window without a balcony.

240
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,361
I see.

241
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,861
When he got the call on his cell phone,

242
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,661
Mr. Takai tried to go out of the window

243
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:24,261
next to his bed as usual.

244
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,361
Yeah, that's right.

245
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,961
Mr. Kawakami perhaps moved the bed

246
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,461
when he was drinking with Mr. Takai in the living room.

247
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,361
Mr. Kawakami excused himself,

248
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,661
most likely saying that he was going to the bathroom.

249
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:40,061
Then, he sneaked into Mr. Takai's bedroom

250
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:42,761
and moved his bed.

251
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:46,461
Then Mr. Takai, who was drunk and asleep in the living room,

252
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,261
was carried to his bedroom.

253
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,261
And Mr. Kawakami put the cell phone at the bedside.

254
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:53,261
All that was left to do was...

255
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:59,861
To call and say, "I can't hear you!" That's all.

256
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,361
-No way. -It can't be.

257
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:08,061
But what if Jodie had fallen because of this experiment?

258
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,761
She would've been fine!

259
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,761
What?

260
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,561
You see.

261
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,561
Look at that!

262
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:19,961
We tied a rope her waist without telling her!

263
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:23,561
I didn't realize it at all!

264
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,861
Well, that's the story.

265
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,761
Mr. Kawakami, all you have to do is explain

266
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,061
to the police why you killed Mr. Takai.

267
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:34,461
Yeah, I'll do that,

268
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,561
if I had intended to murder him.

269
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:38,861
What?

270
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:42,461
Yes, it's true that I changed the position of the bed

271
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,661
because Takai told me that he wanted to rearrange his room.

272
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,561
So I just helped him!

273
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,861
But what a shock to hear that

274
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:53,761
he fell to his death because of it.

275
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:56,561
It didn't even cross my mind until you pointed it out.

276
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,061
Goodbye, Takai.

277
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,661
What?

278
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:04,361
Go to the world beyond and tell her that you're sorry.

279
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,461
I was also very shocked

280
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:10,661
that you left him a message like this.

281
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,361
Mr. Kawakami.

282
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,061
You might not know,

283
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,561
but before he fell, Mr. Takai tried to hang on for a while

284
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:20,161
by grabbing the curtain.

285
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,661
Just before his death,

286
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:25,461
he pressed the voice memo button of his cell phone

287
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,461
and recorded your words, which provided evidence

288
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,361
that you had the intention to kill him.

289
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:33,561
Your sad words of parting, saying that you were satisfied that

290
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:36,561
you had avenged the death of your dear girl, your junior in school.

291
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,161
Here you go. It's your camera that you lent me a while ago.

292
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,261
Yes.

293
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,061
I appreciate your cooperation.

294
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:57,861
Thank you for acting as if you had been tricked.

295
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,961
Oh, think nothing of it at all.

296
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:03,661
I enjoyed it too!

297
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:04,961
By the way,

298
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:08,761
you didn't tell me your name, did you?

299
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:13,861
Before I tell you my name, won't you tell me your true identity?

300
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,861
But as for me,

301
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,561
I want to know why you pretend not being able to speak English

302
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:24,861
even though you can speak very well!

303
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:26,561
What are you talking about?

304
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,661
No use playing dumb!

305
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,661
When we talked on the phone a little while ago...

306
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:35,361
I asked you, "You're not a mere boy, are you?"

307
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:40,261
Then you answered, "Yes, I'm just a normal high school boy".

308
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:44,661
In this case, "No, I'm just another boy" is correct in Japanese grammar,

309
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,661
but your answer was "Yes, I'm just a normal high school boy".

310
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:49,661
Only a good speaker of English

311
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:54,061
could have answered the way you did.

312
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:57,961
I'll bet you answered unconsciously in English to me

313
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:01,861
since I'm an English-speaking foreigner.

314
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:07,161
My true identity is an English teacher! You can't fool me!

315
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:13,661
Well, actually, I wasn't pretending

316
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:16,861
not to be able to speak English. But...

317
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:22,161
Did silence work better than your funny disguised Japanese, didn't it?

318
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:27,761
Your Japanese grammar is excellent

319
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:31,161
but your Japanese intonation is terrible.

320
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,261
So, it's obvious that you're just pretending

321
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,061
not being able to speak Japanese well

322
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,561
to throw people off their guard.

323
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:41,061
But we can talk about it at another time.

324
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,661
So, see ya.

325
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,661
But if he knew that much,

326
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:55,461
don't you think that the victim role player

327
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,261
didn't need to actually get drunk

328
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,761
in order to carry out that experiment?

329
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,661
Yes. I think so too.

330
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:16,461
Yeah, that teacher is a very suspicious character indeed.

331
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:20,861
Secretly taking photos of us, pretending to take a bath and all.

332
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:22,561
Yeah.

333
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,861
Her hair and body was wet

334
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:28,061
while the hair dryer was still warm

335
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,861
and the body lotion spilled on the bathroom floor wasn't dry.

336
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:37,361
She had probably finished taking a bath before we got there.

337
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:42,161
But, in order to buy time, she took another hurried shower.

338
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:47,061
She was probably using that time to do something

339
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,661
she didn't want us to see.

340
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:54,661
But don't worry yourself over it.

341
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:57,561
I've already taken the film out of her camera.

342
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:02,861
She's suspicious, but she didn't look like a bad person.

343
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,261
And you suspected that the teacher and the American actress,

344
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:07,861
Chris Vineyard were the same person,

345
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,361
but they didn't look alike at all.

346
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,961
The only similarity is that they both have big boobs.

347
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:16,161
Yeah. That's right.

348
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:23,461
If that is her true face...

349
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:28,861
What do you mean?

350
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:31,361
But, don't you have to go back?

351
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,961
Isn't she waiting for you?

352
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,561
Oh, no...

353
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,661
I completely forgot about Kazuha.

354
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:41,361
Anyway, be careful, Kudo!

355
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,161
Your enemy was sharp enough to steal the document

356
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,461
from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police!

357
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:45,461
Yeah.

358
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,561
See ya!

359
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:51,261
If any other suspicious persons show up, just call me!

360
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:53,361
I'll run right over!

361
00:21:56,261 --> 00:22:01,161
Thanks but Jodie isn't the only one that's suspicious.

362
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:05,161
There are two other suspicious persons around me.

363
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,061
Heiji Hattori...

364
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:36,861
an interesting boy.

365
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,961
Son of Heizo Hattori,

366
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,561
General Manager of Osaka Police Department

367
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:46,761
And...

368
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,861
Just like Shinichi Kudo...

369
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,861
He's a private eye.

"Next Episode"

371
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,261
Hey, Station Manager.

372
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,961
Don't start this train!

373
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:11,761
Someone's been stabbed!

374
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:14,961
Please call all personnel positioned at the wickets immediately

375
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,261
and ask them to check all tickets of

376
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:19,761
Tokyo Spirits and Noir Tokyo supporters.

377
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:22,461
Look only for those who bought a ticket

378
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,361
before 5.00 pm and keep them here!

379
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:26,161
Do it now.

380
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:29,261
If you don't hurry, the killer will get away!

381
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:35,182
