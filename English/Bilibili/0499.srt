1
00:00:01.558 --> 00:00:05.158
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05.158 --> 00:00:06.558
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:09.058
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:12.458
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.058
This time, we're taking repeated sink or swim risks

6
00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:17.358
involving Rena Mizunashi.

7
00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:22.258
The Black Organization that found out where she was hospitalized...

8
00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:24.258
caused three different incidents to occur at the same time

9
00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.158
in the vicinity of the hospital.

10
00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:31.258
They also sent a bomb addressed to FBI agent James.

11
00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:32.658
Furthermore, they went on to send bombs

12
00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:33.858
under the pretense of get-well gifts

13
00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:36.858
to a great number of patients at the hospital.

14
00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:42.058
This plastic bomb alone is only capable of blowing up one room,

15
00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.958
but if several of these go off together...

16
00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:50.358
This hospital will unmistakably collapse.

17
00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:06.858
Sizzling hot suspense.

18
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.558
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

19
00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:11.558
Serious tactics of outsmarting and counterplotting.

20
00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:13.258
The hospital is in complete chaos.

21
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:14.658
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.358
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:18.458
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:55.614
"Red and Black Crash: Camouflage"

25
00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.614
What's fortunate is that the bomb is set to go off at 5pm,

26
00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.514
giving us four more hours to go,

27
00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:05.514
and that if we remove the fuse that is poked into the bomb,

28
00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:08.814
it won't function, thus, won't go off.

29
00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:13.614
In addition, almost all the packages have been delivered to hospital

30
00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:16.614
and the total number amounted to almost 60.

31
00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:18.414
That's why the Organization over capacitated the hospital

32
00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:21.314
with wounded and sick people?

33
00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:24.514
If only one courier service delivered a whole lot of packages,

34
00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:26.014
they would be suspected.

35
00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:28.714
But if the packages are delivered by different couriers

36
00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:30.814
in this state of panic at the hospital,

37
00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:31.914
nobody would really even bother to worry

38
00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:35.214
whether the deliveries are suspicious or not.

39
00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.514
But, how did those guys at the Organization

40
00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:38.914
get the name of the patients?

41
00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:40.414
From Kusuda.

42
00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:41.414
He was taking pictures of the board

43
00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:43.614
that indicated the names of the patients

44
00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:46.414
and the corresponding room numbers in the nurse station,

45
00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.914
so it's most likely that they wrote names of the people

46
00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:50.714
that the gifts were addressed by using the picture that he sent them.

47
00:03:50.714 --> 00:03:54.114
Yes. At any rate, we've got four hours to go.

48
00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:57.114
Dispatch all the agents, go to all the rooms

49
00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:58.714
and retrieve the bombs.

50
00:03:58.714 --> 00:03:59.914
Yes, sir...

51
00:04:01.214 --> 00:04:04.214
But, this is turning out way more difficult than we first figured.

52
00:04:04.214 --> 00:04:08.614
I thought they were only coming to retrieve Rena Mizunashi.

53
00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.114
Yes.

54
00:04:10.114 --> 00:04:12.914
I didn't think that they were going to go after her life

55
00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:17.014
and try to shut her up on the spot to begin with.

56
00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:19.314
Agree, sonny?

57
00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:22.614
Right.

58
00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:48.414
I'm the security officer, may I come in?

59
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.714
I'm checking for suspicious items.

60
00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:51.714
May I please ask for your cooperation?

61
00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:00.614
I wonder who this Mr. Kusuda is.

62
00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:04.414
Excuse me.

63
00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:07.414
May I check the delivery that you received?

64
00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:11.514
It's this stuffed bear.

65
00:05:11.514 --> 00:05:12.814
May I?

66
00:05:12.814 --> 00:05:14.014
Yes.

67
00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:15.314
I'm sorry, sonny,

68
00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.514
will you show me that bear, please?

69
00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:19.214
Yeah, okay.

70
00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:20.814
Thank you.

71
00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:22.014
I'll be done right away.

72
00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:23.014
Okay.

73
00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:28.214
That...

74
00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:30.314
Oh, it's the lady that comes on TV!

75
00:05:39.314 --> 00:05:41.714
Rena Mizunashi?

76
00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:45.014
It... it can't be? Why?

77
00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:48.814
I'm perfectly in good health now.

78
00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:52.614
To all you viewers out there,

79
00:05:52.614 --> 00:05:56.214
I'm really sorry to have worried you.

80
00:05:57.614 --> 00:06:00.714
I thought she wasn't on TV recently.

81
00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:02.714
Isn't that this hospital?

82
00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:04.414
No way.

83
00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:07.014
Nice being back.

84
00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:11.314
What? Rena Mizunashi is on TV?

85
00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:12.614
Is that true?

86
00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:14.114
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:17.114
She's aired on the TVs in the hospital rooms and the lobby!

88
00:06:17.114 --> 00:06:18.614
It's being aired from her room in the hospital

89
00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:19.814
with her wearing a hospital gown,

90
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:22.314
saying my wounds have healed completely.

91
00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:26.014
Haven't you had any word from her room?

92
00:06:26.014 --> 00:06:27.414
No.

93
00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:29.914
There are three agents guarding her room,

94
00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:32.914
and one of them is to come out every five minutes

95
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:35.814
to report the circumstances to me.

96
00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:38.514
You can't contact the room from your side, can you?

97
00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:41.114
No. The blood transfusion pump IV

98
00:06:41.114 --> 00:06:43.514
has a tendency to malfunction from radio waves,

99
00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.014
so I've ordered everyone to make sure

100
00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:48.814
to switch off their cell phones and wireless.

101
00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:51.014
At any rate, go to her room

102
00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:52.914
and find out what's happening, will you?

103
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.814
Yes, sir! Everyone feels the same

104
00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.514
and is headed for her room already.

105
00:06:58.214 --> 00:07:00.314
I see.

106
00:07:00.314 --> 00:07:03.114
So, that's what the Organization is after.

107
00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:05.414
Notify the agents of all the blocks!

108
00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:07.514
Tell them not to go to Rena Mizunashi's room!

109
00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:08.614
What...

110
00:07:08.614 --> 00:07:11.214
It may be too late already, though.

111
00:07:11.214 --> 00:07:12.814
Too late...

112
00:07:12.814 --> 00:07:16.814
Don't tell me that the Organization already...

113
00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:28.314
Is something wrong?

114
00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.614
I came to check things out

115
00:07:29.614 --> 00:07:32.114
because Rena Mizunashi was on TV.

116
00:07:32.114 --> 00:07:33.514
Didn't you see it?

117
00:07:33.514 --> 00:07:36.714
No, all the patients of the rooms that I went to,

118
00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:39.814
didn't have their TVs on.

119
00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:43.214
Besides, all the members that were added to the group this time

120
00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:46.314
are still not informed of what room she's in.

121
00:07:46.314 --> 00:07:48.714
Would you like me to go too?

122
00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:52.014
No, you go ahead and continue retrieving the bombs.

123
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.714
There should be about ten minutes more left.

124
00:07:54.714 --> 00:07:57.014
Do your job right, okay?

125
00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:58.014
Roger.

126
00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:02.914
What... what on earth is going on?

127
00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:06.514
Hey! You!

128
00:08:06.514 --> 00:08:07.914
What on earth is going on?

129
00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:14.814
What the... she's here.

130
00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:18.114
Then, what was that TV thing a while ago?

131
00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:20.614
We were their puppets made to dance

132
00:08:20.614 --> 00:08:25.214
on the palm of their hands just as they pleased.

133
00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:27.714
Puppets?

134
00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:29.814
The TV image we saw a while ago was taken previously,

135
00:08:29.814 --> 00:08:33.514
after she got involved in the explosion accident and got hurt,

136
00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:36.014
and commented that she would be returning to the program.

137
00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:37.514
To all you viewers out there,

138
00:08:37.514 --> 00:08:40.014
I'm sorry to have worried you.

139
00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:43.014
And after they doctored the clothing and background...

140
00:08:43.014 --> 00:08:46.214
As you can see, my wounds have healed completely.

141
00:08:46.214 --> 00:08:49.514
I saw the original video of it

142
00:08:49.514 --> 00:08:52.814
at the house of her biggest fan.

143
00:08:52.814 --> 00:08:55.714
But, why would the organization go out of their way

144
00:08:55.714 --> 00:08:58.614
to hijack radio waves and air that image?

145
00:08:58.614 --> 00:09:01.914
To gather the members of the FBI here.

146
00:09:01.914 --> 00:09:03.414
They saw through that nobody would be using cell phones

147
00:09:03.414 --> 00:09:05.914
or wireless in the hospital.

148
00:09:05.914 --> 00:09:09.614
So, what now since they have us all gathered here?

149
00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:12.314
We were looking for them till just a while ago, right?

150
00:09:12.314 --> 00:09:13.914
What?

151
00:09:13.914 --> 00:09:17.214
The toys that they delivered everywhere in this hospital.

152
00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.714
Where are they now?

153
00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:21.014
Oh, the bombs are in our pockets.

154
00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:23.114
With the fuse detached.

155
00:09:23.114 --> 00:09:24.914
Because we have to hurry to the next room

156
00:09:24.914 --> 00:09:27.314
after retrieving the bomb.

157
00:09:30.014 --> 00:09:32.014
Don't tell me that...

158
00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:38.114
Yeah, it was attached to that toy.

159
00:09:38.114 --> 00:09:40.214
A troublesome freebie.

160
00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:49.714
They're like flies that gather around trash.

161
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.114
They're coming one after the other, aren't they, boss?

162
00:09:58.614 --> 00:10:02.514
That's room 307 on the forth floor, isn't it?

163
00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:03.514
Yeah.

164
00:10:03.514 --> 00:10:05.214
Now that we have the room,

165
00:10:05.214 --> 00:10:08.414
it's our turn, Boss.

166
00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:10.414
From the beginning, the location of Kir's cage

167
00:10:10.414 --> 00:10:12.614
never interested me.

168
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:18.314
Our point is to let them believe that we know where she is

169
00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:22.314
and drive a wedge of terror into their brains.

170
00:10:27.914 --> 00:10:30.514
All we have to do now is wait

171
00:10:30.514 --> 00:10:32.714
and see how the FBI that panics will fly.

172
00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:34.214
Communicator.

173
00:10:34.214 --> 00:10:37.214
A communicator was rigged to the bombs.

174
00:10:37.214 --> 00:10:38.214
Yeah.

175
00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:41.814
In other words, everything that they did up to now

176
00:10:41.814 --> 00:10:47.414
was done to figure out which room Rena Mizunashi was in.

177
00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.014
They made it look as if they were going to attack us

178
00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:52.014
with the first bomb they sent us.

179
00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:54.714
They figured that we would panic at seeing the great number of bombs

180
00:10:54.714 --> 00:10:56.814
that were being delivered and run around to retrieve them,

181
00:10:56.814 --> 00:10:58.614
finally landing up here

182
00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:01.914
where the image of Rena Mizunashi was being aired.

183
00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:03.714
Then, you mean the Organization already...

184
00:11:03.714 --> 00:11:06.614
They're probably working out their next move,

185
00:11:06.614 --> 00:11:09.014
watching us with grins on their faces.

186
00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:11.314
So... what now?

187
00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:22.414
Now that we know, we'd better get out of here fast.

188
00:11:22.414 --> 00:11:25.814
We will take the last resort that we talked of this morning.

189
00:11:25.814 --> 00:11:27.714
We're splitting up in three different cars

190
00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:29.414
and going to confuse the Organization

191
00:11:29.414 --> 00:11:31.514
while we make it out of this hospital.

192
00:11:31.514 --> 00:11:33.714
The mission of the decoy car

193
00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:37.014
is the bait will draw them as far away as possible.

194
00:11:37.014 --> 00:11:41.314
Ask Jodie as to who will be riding which car.

195
00:11:41.314 --> 00:11:43.114
Hey.

196
00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:46.714
Why don't we take her on the Beetle of a man that I know?

197
00:11:46.714 --> 00:11:47.914
Huh...

198
00:11:47.914 --> 00:11:50.114
She can be placed lying down in the backseat.

199
00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:51.614
And those bad people are probably thinking

200
00:11:51.614 --> 00:11:54.414
that she's going to be moved out on a car

201
00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.714
that's big enough to load a stretcher.

202
00:11:56.714 --> 00:11:58.814
This way, they'll never be able to tell that she's in the car.

203
00:11:58.814 --> 00:12:01.314
That may be true but...

204
00:12:01.314 --> 00:12:04.514
I'll go outside and call him.

205
00:12:04.514 --> 00:12:06.514
I'm sure he'll come right over.

206
00:12:08.114 --> 00:12:09.914
I can't let you do that, sonny,

207
00:12:09.914 --> 00:12:12.714
not even for you.

208
00:12:12.714 --> 00:12:15.414
This is a job for the FBI.

209
00:12:17.814 --> 00:12:20.014
We can't get any more ordinary citizens involved,

210
00:12:20.014 --> 00:12:21.614
not more than we already have.

211
00:12:21.614 --> 00:12:23.514
Oh, but...

212
00:12:25.314 --> 00:12:27.814
Leave the rest to us.

213
00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:29.214
Then first of all,

214
00:12:29.214 --> 00:12:32.214
find the communicator that is attached to all the bombs

215
00:12:32.214 --> 00:12:33.614
and smash it.

216
00:12:33.614 --> 00:12:36.114
No.

217
00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:40.014
I'd like you to smash it after you hear me out.

218
00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:42.214
What is it, Akai?

219
00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:43.714
It just dawned on me

220
00:12:43.714 --> 00:12:45.514
after hearing what the boy had to say.

221
00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:48.314
An excellent plan to deceive them

222
00:12:48.314 --> 00:12:51.414
and get Rena Mizunashi out of here.

223
00:12:51.414 --> 00:12:52.614
What...

224
00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:53.714
What is it?

225
00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:15.467
That's true...

226
00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:18.567
we may be able to deceive them that way.

227
00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:22.467
Well, I hope so.

228
00:13:22.467 --> 00:13:25.267
Thank you, Conan for your great hints.

229
00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:26.367
Yep.

230
00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:29.267
The problem is who's going to drive the car

231
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.467
that Rena Mizunashi is riding.

232
00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:33.967
Right.

233
00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:36.067
Assuming that if the Organization finds out,

234
00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:37.867
the driver may have to face a predicament

235
00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:40.667
in which he would have to shake them off.

236
00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:42.567
The driver would have to be able to play off the cuff,

237
00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:44.667
know this area quite well,

238
00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:48.867
and last but not least posses above average driving technique.

239
00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:52.867
That person would be none other than you, Akai.

240
00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:56.267
No. I don't think I'm a good pick.

241
00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:58.667
The first thing they'll check

242
00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:02.467
is to see which car I'm in.

243
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.067
In that case...

244
00:14:05.267 --> 00:14:08.367
If so, I'll go.

245
00:14:08.367 --> 00:14:12.067
I guess there's no one else but me who can handle this situation?

246
00:14:12.067 --> 00:14:16.367
Oh, you're Camel that did a good job getting rid of the bomb.

247
00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:22.467
I think he's the right one as well.

248
00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:35.467
Fear of death is worse than death itself...

249
00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:36.667
As the saying goes, no fear.

250
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:40.267
I won't. Death is what I am always prepared for.

251
00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:42.067
After all, I've got no family that will cry of sadness for me

252
00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:44.967
even if I were to die in the first place.

253
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.967
Then please get ready on the double.

254
00:14:47.967 --> 00:14:49.267
Roger.

255
00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:53.867
I'm Andre Camel.

256
00:14:53.867 --> 00:14:56.267
I just got a call from my wife.

257
00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:00.067
Oh, excuse me...

258
00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:02.067
Huh? What is it?

259
00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:05.667
Oh nothing. Good luck.

260
00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:07.167
Thank you.

261
00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:16.867
What's with that look on your face?

262
00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:19.967
It's inevitable that this plan will succeed.

263
00:15:19.967 --> 00:15:24.467
Or is my guarantee not enough for you?

264
00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:27.667
No. It's more than enough.

265
00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:30.367
Okay, Camel.

266
00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:31.667
We're counting on you.

267
00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:34.567
Whether we succeed or not is on your shoulders.

268
00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.667
Yes, I understand, sir.

269
00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:38.167
In the event that you succeed,

270
00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.167
let me buy you a drink.

271
00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:42.567
Yes. I'll be looking forward to it.

272
00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:45.967
Wait!

273
00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:48.367
Well...

274
00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:52.567
I don't think we can leave it all up to you.

275
00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:53.967
Let me go instead, will you?

276
00:15:56.767 --> 00:15:59.767
I've got the route in mind.

277
00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:02.067
It doesn't matter to me,

278
00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:04.267
but don't blame me if you're bawled out later.

279
00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:09.167
Never mind that. I'd like you to answer two or three questions...

280
00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:39.967
Car number one, all set to go.

281
00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:42.667
Car number two, all set to go.

282
00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:45.367
Car number three, all set to go.

283
00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:48.167
Car number one, two, and three,

284
00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:50.167
are all set to go!

285
00:16:50.167 --> 00:16:53.667
Okay. Carry on as planned.

286
00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:55.967
Keep all communication circuits open

287
00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:58.867
and let me know immediately if something comes up.

288
00:16:58.867 --> 00:16:59.867
Roger...

289
00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:08.267
By the way, Camel.

290
00:17:08.267 --> 00:17:09.267
Yes?

291
00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:12.267
Would you happen to know where Jodie is?

292
00:17:12.267 --> 00:17:15.167
It seems she left saying that she was going to see you.

293
00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.867
Yes, she came about ten minutes ago.

294
00:17:18.867 --> 00:17:20.867
Something about she thought up a good plan

295
00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:22.867
to back up my car.

296
00:17:22.867 --> 00:17:24.467
She left with her car

297
00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:26.867
after telling me not to worry.

298
00:17:26.867 --> 00:17:29.767
Hey... she did so without telling me?

299
00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:32.467
I'm sure she's worried too.

300
00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:34.267
Because after all, I'm the target car

301
00:17:34.267 --> 00:17:38.267
that Rena Mizunashi is riding in.

302
00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:41.367
It's come...

303
00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:43.667
A dark blue wagon.

304
00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.467
A second one.

305
00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:47.367
A third one.

306
00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:50.267
It seems there are three all together.

307
00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:54.567
Okay, Chianti, you keep your eyes on the first car.

308
00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:55.667
Okay.

309
00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.367
Korn, on the second.

310
00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:58.967
Okay.

311
00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:02.467
Vodka, you take care of the third.

312
00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:04.567
Roger.

313
00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:06.367
I'll stick around the vicinity of the hospital

314
00:18:06.367 --> 00:18:08.467
and keep an eye on the FBI agents here.

315
00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:11.767
It could be that all three are decoys too.

316
00:18:12.767 --> 00:18:15.067
When you each get hold of your cars in target,

317
00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:18.767
use that method and find out what's going on inside.

318
00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:22.567
I'll decide which car we'll narrow it down to.

319
00:18:22.567 --> 00:18:25.867
By the way, Boss, did you get contact?

320
00:18:25.867 --> 00:18:30.267
No, I got nothing from them.

321
00:18:30.267 --> 00:18:34.567
Well, it's a strategy to ensure that person's life.

322
00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:38.367
I'm not counting on it, to begin with.

323
00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:50.467
Camel, report your situation.

324
00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:55.767
Yes, sir. There is no suspicious moves of this car being pursued.

325
00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.967
No, not even one.

326
00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:05.067
Gin, I'm pursuing the first car.

327
00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:06.867
How does it look?

328
00:19:06.867 --> 00:19:08.467
The side windows are smoke

329
00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:10.367
and I can't see inside.

330
00:19:10.367 --> 00:19:11.767
Strip them naked.

331
00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:12.867
Okay.

332
00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.267
Projection completed.

333
00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:21.767
I'll send it over to you.

334
00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:30.167
The figures confirmable by thermograph are...

335
00:19:30.167 --> 00:19:32.067
Nine.

336
00:19:32.067 --> 00:19:34.267
It more or less matches the position

337
00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:36.467
of the communicators set on the bombs.

338
00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:40.367
Can you see the figure of the person lying down in the backseat?

339
00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:42.567
Isn't that Rena Mizunashi?

340
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:43.667
She's the only one that's not showing response

341
00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:45.867
from the communicator, right?

342
00:19:47.367 --> 00:19:48.667
I've taken the image too.

343
00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:49.767
I'll send it over.

344
00:19:53.467 --> 00:19:56.767
The second car that Korn is pursuing also shows nine silhouettes,

345
00:19:56.767 --> 00:19:58.767
but there are no signs of communicators.

346
00:19:58.767 --> 00:20:00.367
I took an image here too.

347
00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:07.667
The silhouette of people in the car that Vodka's pursuing is just two.

348
00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:11.267
It seems that the two have communicators too.

349
00:20:11.267 --> 00:20:13.567
Come on, hurry up and make up your mind, Gin.

350
00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:15.167
If you keep me in suspense too long,

351
00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:17.267
the rifle on my back is going to get impatient

352
00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:18.767
and go off on its own.

353
00:20:18.767 --> 00:20:20.167
Well, either way...

354
00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:23.667
I guess you can forget about the car that I'm pursuing.

355
00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:25.867
Judging from the position of the communicator

356
00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:27.867
and number of silhouetted figures, they're only two FBI agents.

357
00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:29.367
Moreover, if they go on as is,

358
00:20:29.367 --> 00:20:31.967
it'll take them right back to the hospital they came from.

359
00:20:31.967 --> 00:20:34.567
This car's unmistakably a decoy.

360
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:35.967
Thanks for waiting, Gin.

361
00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:41.867
I finally found him.

362
00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:45.067
Shuichi Akai's...

363
00:20:45.067 --> 00:20:48.667
Chevy.

364
00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.567
It must've been tough, Bellmot.

365
00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:54.367
It was an order directly from that person, wasn't it?

366
00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:56.767
Well, sorry.

367
00:20:56.767 --> 00:20:58.367
He foresaw beforehand that this would happen

368
00:20:58.367 --> 00:21:02.567
and had his car parked in a parking lot one kilometer away.

369
00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:05.167
And? What's Akai's position?

370
00:21:05.167 --> 00:21:08.667
Right through Haido Park leading into Beika-cho.

371
00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:12.667
The car nearest here is the second car that Korn is pursuing.

372
00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:17.167
It's about 200 meters behind.

373
00:21:17.167 --> 00:21:19.367
Then, it's the car that Korn's pursuing!

374
00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:21.167
Because Akai's guarding it!

375
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.367
Platinum Blonde long hair.

376
00:21:30.167 --> 00:21:31.367
It's Bellmot.

377
00:21:33.967 --> 00:21:35.167
They've finally appeared.

378
00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:47.367
Talk about burning the tires.

379
00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:48.967
At that rate, he'll catch up with the second car

380
00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:50.867
in less than a minute.

381
00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:54.367
He's probably realized that Korn is pursuing him.

382
00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:55.867
The second car's bingo.

383
00:21:55.867 --> 00:21:58.867
I'm changing course and joining Korn.

384
00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:01.567
I'll go over to Korn too.

385
00:22:01.567 --> 00:22:04.667
Pursuing the decoy's not going to get me anywhere.

386
00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:08.567
I'm going to shoot him when he comes.

387
00:22:08.567 --> 00:22:10.167
Hold it, Korn.

388
00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.067
Go into a side street and change course.

389
00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:13.867
Why? You mean you're scared of Akai,

390
00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:16.467
so you're going to give Kir up?

391
00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:20.167
No, the one that we've got to go after is...

392
00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:23.367
The third car that Vodka is pursuing.

393
00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:24.767
Kir is in there.

394
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:11.467
"Next Episode"

395
00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:15.067
The diversion tactics of moving Rena Mizunashi out of the hospital

396
00:24:15.067 --> 00:24:18.167
is seen through by Gin.

397
00:24:18.167 --> 00:24:21.667
But the strategy isn't over yet.

398
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:24.167
The entire picture of the plan that I set up is...

399
00:24:24.167 --> 00:24:27.767
And finally, the connection between Rena Mizunashi, Eisuke Hondo

400
00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:31.767
and Ethern of the Company is disclosed.

401
00:24:34.167 --> 00:24:36.667
Next on Detective Conan,

402
00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:40.267
"Red and Black Crash: Last Words"

403
00:24:56.167 --> 00:24:58.367
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:58.367 --> 00:25:00.367
Kir.

405
00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:02.467
In the next episode, Kir's secret is revealed.

406
00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:03.967
-What's it about? -Well...

407
00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:05.367
Find out next week.
