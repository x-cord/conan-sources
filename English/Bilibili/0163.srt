1
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,166
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,966
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,766
Today there's an autumn treasure hunt.

4
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,866
The Youth Detective Squad is challenged with a secret code.

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,366
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,666
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,104 --> 00:02:00,004
"Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun (Part 1)"

9
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:04,004
Dr. Agasa.

10
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:07,704
Is there really hidden treasure at the place we're heading for?

11
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:09,904
Yes, plenty of it.

12
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:14,604
But that's if you can use your brains to find it.

13
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,004
Yes!

14
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,304
If the Youth Detective Squad makes the scene...

15
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,904
We're sure to find a whole lot of treasure!

16
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,204
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

17
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,204
What is it?

18
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:25,904
The treasure you're talking about

19
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:29,604
wouldn't be all these toys you made me buy, right?

20
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:33,204
Keep it a secret from the children.

21
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:36,304
That's why Haibara didn't come along.

22
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,504
Feeling pretty rich, ain't you?

23
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:41,504
The car's new too.

24
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:44,704
Dr. Agasa. Have you made some sort of wild machine

25
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,204
and pulled a bank into the picture?

26
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:49,804
Idiot! I wouldn't do that!

27
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:53,304
Actually, I owe it all to this.

28
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:55,804
Huh?

29
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:57,804
The Masked Yaiba?

30
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:01,104
A person I know has a toy company

31
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:02,904
and I helped them develop this new product.

32
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:06,204
I got a nice bundle of contract money.

33
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:10,304
And? What is this suppose to be?

34
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,704
Yaiba Reco-changer!

35
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:14,904
Surprised?

36
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,604
We got one from Dr. Agasa this morning too.

37
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:19,904
This Yaiba Reco-changer.

38
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:21,804
Yaiba Reco-changer?

39
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:23,704
It records your voice

40
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,904
and transforms it in all sorts of ways.

41
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,704
It's the newest Masked Yaiba item!

42
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:33,204
It's no different from this Bowtie Voice Changer.

43
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:34,404
Well, what do you think?

44
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:38,204
The "junk" you're always accusing me of inventing

45
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:41,404
will be on the market nation-wide.

46
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:47,004
What a big house!

47
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:50,404
Dr. Agasa, is this really your uncle's second house?

48
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,104
Yes, that's right.

49
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:54,604
My Uncle, Kurisuke Agasa,

50
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:58,204
was a quite well known man around here.

51
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,204
50 years ago, that uncle hid

52
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:04,604
a great fortune somewhere and passed away.

53
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,304
And so, this time I called you out here

54
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:12,604
to see if we could use the brains of the Youth Detective Squad.

55
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:14,904
Then, it's really, really true!

56
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,604
Yes. Dr. Agasa didn't come up here ahead of time

57
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,304
to hide the treasure.

58
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:21,804
Didn't I tell you?

59
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:25,104
Dr. Agasa would pull a kiddy trick like that.

60
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:26,704
Isn't that right, Dr. Agasa?

61
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,804
Of course.

62
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,704
You can already see right through this.

63
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:37,004
Search this room first!

64
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,604
Yes!

65
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:48,104
Where?

66
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,304
Looks like it's not here.

67
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:52,104
Not here either.

68
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:57,004
Doctor. Is that man in the painting your uncle?

69
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,304
Huh?

70
00:04:58,304 --> 00:04:59,704
Yes, it is.

71
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,704
I see.

72
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:05,604
Looks like it's true that your uncle was really rich.

73
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,404
-What? -Look.

74
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,204
The fireplace painted in the background

75
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,204
is the same as the one in this room.

76
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:14,104
In other words, the artist was called out

77
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,604
to this house to do the painting.

78
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:20,104
To do something like that, you'd have to be rich.

79
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:23,804
Yes. That painting was supposed to have been done by a young artist

80
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:26,604
a year before my uncle passed away from illness.

81
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:28,204
Who is the woman with him?

82
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,404
That's Aunt Teiko,

83
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:33,404
his younger sister who lived here and took care of him.

84
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,404
Uncle hated people

85
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:37,704
and she was the only one he accepted.

86
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,404
I heard she was a teacher at an elementary school near here.

87
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:44,804
After my uncle died, she went back home

88
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,504
and no one has set foot in this house

89
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:50,504
for the past 50 years since then.

90
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:53,204
But there's a lot of things left here yet.

91
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:55,204
Books, dishes and things.

92
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,104
In his will,

93
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,904
my uncle said that he wanted this house left alone

94
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,804
for 50 years after his death.

95
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:06,004
Of course, there isn't any hidden wealth left here.

96
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,704
And the house is already set to be broken down next month.

97
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,404
I see.

98
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,404
And before it's broken down,

99
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,304
you thought of having a treasure hunt

100
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:18,504
with the kids in this dusty house.

101
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,204
Exactly.

102
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:22,704
Where's the treasure?

103
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:26,104
Hey! Don't make a mess of the place!

104
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:27,504
But...

105
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:30,504
If you make a more detailed observation of the surroundings,

106
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:33,204
you'll surely find a clue.

107
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:34,304
That's right.

108
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:36,904
For example, the strange looking letters nears my feet

109
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:39,504
that have been obviously carved.

110
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:43,204
What?

111
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:44,504
It's true!

112
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:49,904
Mo, za, ri, sa, wa, so, de, ru?

113
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,404
What's this?

114
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:52,804
Is it English?

115
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,604
No, it's not! It's probably Arabian.

116
00:06:56,804 --> 00:07:01,204
It's not that simple. No even Shinichi would...

117
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:05,204
Where has he gone?

118
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:07,104
Could he...

119
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,504
Oh, my!

120
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:20,904
Looks like even you weren't able to solve my puzzle.

121
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:23,204
-What? -Why, of course!

122
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:27,004
I thought about it for three days and three nights without sleeping.

123
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:29,404
If it's the wooden treasure box you hid, Dr. Agasa...

124
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:32,204
I found it under the bed in the bedroom beyond.

125
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:33,204
What?

126
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,704
I haven't peeked into the box yet,

127
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:38,104
but it seemed a bit obvious so I covered it with a cloth

128
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:41,104
and pushed it further under the bed.

129
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:44,404
Thanks.

130
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:45,904
You brat.

131
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:51,704
What bothers me is the other mystery about this house.

132
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,704
The other mystery?

133
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,904
Yes.

134
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,004
What do you think about this, Dr. Agasa?

135
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:00,104
Huh? What's this?

136
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:04,304
It looks like an ordinary 1 yen coin.

137
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,704
I picked that up beside the bed.

138
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,504
Then, it may be something I dropped.

139
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:11,504
No, you couldn't have.

140
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,604
There was a lot of dust on it

141
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:17,004
and there weren't any signs around it that showed that it rolled.

142
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:22,804
One yen coins were first made in 1955, 44 years ago.

143
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:26,804
Something like that covered with dust found in this house means...

144
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,404
That means...

145
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:30,104
someone came in without permission

146
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:32,804
when the house was left empty?

147
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,604
No. Entering the house wasn't all he did.

148
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,904
I think he lived here for a while.

149
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:41,104
An old person extremely skillful with his hands.

150
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,004
Lived here? Skillful? Old person?

151
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,104
Hey, hey. What does this all mean?

152
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,704
I don't get it at all.

153
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:54,904
Then, compare that 1 yen coin with one of yours.

154
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:56,204
What?

155
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,404
Compare it...

156
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,904
What are you saying is different?

157
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,704
It's definitely thinner than my 1 yen coin,

158
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:07,304
and a size smaller.

159
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:11,604
That 1 yen coin was probably shaved from an original coin

160
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:14,004
and perfectly reduced to size.

161
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,504
He is an extremely skilled person.

162
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:20,204
And the character "country" is in an old character, isn't it?

163
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:23,504
I don't know if it was done deliberately or by mistake,

164
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:26,604
but only an elderly person would use a character like that.

165
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:30,604
But how can you say the person living here made this?

166
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,404
There's no mistake that it was made here.

167
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:37,804
It was carved while reading.

168
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,204
While reading?

169
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,404
There's fragments of aluminum

170
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,404
from the 1 yen coin between the pages.

171
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:45,604
And white hair too.

172
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:48,004
Also, there isn't a person who could carve

173
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,404
a 1 yen coin like that in a short time.

174
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:54,504
That's proof he was living here for a long time.

175
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,104
I see.

176
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:59,104
Then, why a 1 yen coin?

177
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:02,504
Well, looks like just to pass the time,

178
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:04,204
but I can't really say yet.

179
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:08,304
And I still don't know if he was living here alone too.

180
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:11,304
-I think there was a child here too. -Huh?

181
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:12,904
I found this a while ago.

182
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,404
Proof that there was a child here.

183
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:18,304
Here. Take a look at the underside of this vase.

184
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,604
Underside?

185
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:24,904
This is...

186
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,504
A child's scribbling, isn't it?

187
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:30,304
If it's something like that, I found some too.

188
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,304
Me too!

189
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:33,904
What?

190
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:36,704
Look! There's some on the underside of this candle stand too.

191
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,404
On the back of this plate too.

192
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:49,204
He must've been a rascal.

193
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:52,504
Rather than that, let's hurry and solve the code on the floor.

194
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,104
But this is strange.

195
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,404
My uncle has no children.

196
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:01,804
The old person living here must've had a child with him.

197
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:03,204
Dr. Agasa.

198
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,104
Do you know "the dancing doll"?

199
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:08,104
Dancing doll?

200
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:11,604
Yes. It came out in the Sherlock Holmes novel.

201
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,704
You're talking about that strange picture of dolls lined up

202
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:16,204
and look like they're dancing, aren't you?

203
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:18,304
If I'm not mistaken, that's a secret code made

204
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,504
to look like a child's scribbling.

205
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:21,904
Could this also be...

206
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,604
Yes, no mistake about it.

207
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:26,604
The vase, the plate, and the candle stand.

208
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,304
If you compare the arrangements of each,

209
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:30,604
you can see that the three figures

210
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:33,404
on the right side of each are the same.

211
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:37,904
In other words, it's a secret code with rules.

212
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:41,004
Right, it's a secret code.

213
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,504
What is it? You seem happy.

214
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:49,504
That code... can you read it?

215
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:52,304
Nope, I don't know anything.

216
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:56,104
Not a thing about the old person or the 1 yen coin.

217
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,104
But I'm excited!

218
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:02,204
The more I don't know, the more it excites me!

219
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,804
That unsurpassable curiosity inside of me!

220
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,904
The blood of a detective is being aroused.

221
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:14,804
Come to think of it, I've seen this figure somewhere before.

222
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:16,504
Really, Dr. Agasa?

223
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,604
Where? Where have you seen it? Tell me!

224
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:20,804
Don't rush me.

225
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:23,404
Hey, Conan.

226
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:28,004
Think about that secret code on the floor with us.

227
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:32,304
You're the only one that's slacking off in this treasure hunt.

228
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:34,204
Right.

229
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:38,404
Mo, za, ri, sa, wa, so, de, ru.

230
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:40,404
You can't tell what it is with just this.

231
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:42,504
Codes like these

232
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:44,304
often use a 50 sound arrangement

233
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:47,704
with a letter shifted before or after.

234
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:51,404
Using that theory, if we slide the letters back one...

235
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:58,004
Ya, ji, ru, shi, wo, ta, do, re.

236
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:00,204
Follow the arrow!

237
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:03,604
All right! Find the arrow!

238
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,304
Yes!

239
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:07,304
Hey, wait a minute!

240
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,204
What, what?

241
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,904
When we entered this room,

242
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,804
wasn't there an arrow that caught your eye?

243
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:15,604
Not really.

244
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:18,004
I didn't see anything like that.

245
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,704
Look, that clock.

246
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:22,404
Clock?

247
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:24,304
Is something wrong with that clock?

248
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,004
It's unnaturally stopped at 6:30, isn't it?

249
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,204
What's wrong with that?

250
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:32,004
It's just stopped because it's broken, hasn't it?

251
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,704
Take a good look.

252
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:36,504
On a usual clock, at 6:30,

253
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:39,404
the hour hand and the minute hand would be slightly apart, wouldn't it?

254
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,304
The hands being one on top of the other

255
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:44,604
is proof that someone fiddled with it.

256
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,104
That someone who hid the treasure.

257
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,604
In other words, the hands of that clock

258
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:54,704
-is the beginning arrow. -Right.

259
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:58,204
Then, we'll have to search below the clock next.

260
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,104
There's cards scattered.

261
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:03,704
The ace of spades is in the center, isn't it?

262
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,704
For some reason, it's set in place with a thumbtack.

263
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:09,404
You're right.

264
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:12,804
I see! The ace of spades is the arrow!

265
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:16,504
Then, the next is that chess piece!

266
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,804
Look at how the pieces are arranged!

267
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,204
The arrangement of the pieces?

268
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:24,704
See! If you look good,

269
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:27,704
you can see that it's shaped like an arrow.

270
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,004
You're right.

271
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:32,804
It's stuck to the board with glue so it won't come off.

272
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,304
There's no mistake about it.

273
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,604
Then, the next is...

274
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,104
It's that room!

275
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:51,004
Hey, there isn't an arrow anywhere in sight.

276
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:54,404
This is where the person who hid the treasure

277
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,804
really racked his brains.

278
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:57,804
Huh?

279
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:00,404
See. On the desk in front of the door,

280
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:02,904
dust has been swept away in three places, right?

281
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,904
That proves that something was there.

282
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,504
Something...

283
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,704
Could it be...

284
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:12,704
about this airplane on the floor?

285
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,804
Yes. Match it with where the dust has been swept away

286
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,404
and put it on the desk.

287
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:19,704
Okay.

288
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,004
The bed!

289
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,604
This airplane is facing the bed.

290
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:29,904
The treasure is definitely hidden in this bed!

291
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,804
There's a box under the bed!

292
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:37,504
That's probably a treasure box.

293
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,804
But that strange.

294
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,204
I definitely put the airplane there

295
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:45,404
-but I don't remember dropping it. -What?

296
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,904
Hurry up and open it! Hurry!

297
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:50,904
What?

298
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:05,593
This is terrible.

299
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:07,893
Cutting it up like this with a knife.

300
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:08,893
Yeah.

301
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:12,593
The person who hid this wanted to startle us.

302
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:13,693
You're wrong.

303
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,793
Dr. Agasa wouldn't do a thing like that.

304
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,293
Dr. Agasa?

305
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:21,693
Then, the one who hid this toy is Dr. Agasa?

306
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:25,093
To play a treasure hunt game here with you.

307
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:31,493
Then, from the time Dr. Agasa hid them until today...

308
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:33,393
Someone came here.

309
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:37,693
Yes. He probably saw the secret code Dr. Agasa left

310
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,393
and found the treasure box in the bedroom.

311
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:42,893
He looked inside got angry

312
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:45,793
and cut them up with a knife.

313
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:48,093
That's probably when the airplane

314
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,793
Dr. Agasa left on the desk fell to the floor.

315
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,793
But, why was he here?

316
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,193
Beats me.

317
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,593
He accidentally passed by and came in out of curiosity.

318
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:00,393
Or maybe...

319
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:04,293
he came in looking for something from the very beginning.

320
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,393
Looking for something? What?

321
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,893
Maybe it has something to do with that figure.

322
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:11,193
Figure?

323
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,293
You knows the ones you guys found

324
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:16,893
that strange code with the sun, moon, and stars lined up.

325
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,993
That scribbling was a secret code?

326
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,693
Probably.

327
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,593
Just maybe there really is

328
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:27,693
an unbelievable treasure hidden somewhere in this house.

329
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:29,893
Yes!

330
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,993
Dr. Agasa. What did the police say?

331
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:37,293
They said it's probably a bad petty thief.

332
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:40,893
They'll be here to check it out tomorrow.

333
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,793
Anyway, looks like it'd be best for us

334
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:45,493
to pull out without touching anything.

335
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:49,393
You're right. That secret code bugs me,

336
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,993
but we wouldn't want to mess up the scene more than this.

337
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:57,093
Hey! What're you doing?

338
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:58,693
What do you think?

339
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:01,993
We're looking for more secret codes to find the treasure.

340
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:06,293
Idiots! The criminal might still be in the area!

341
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,893
I found it, Conan!

342
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:11,793
On the back of this card, that secret code!

343
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:12,893
Really?

344
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,193
Look.

345
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,593
All right. Ayumi and I will take the first floor.

346
00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:20,093
Genta and Mitsuhiko take the second floor.

347
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:23,193
-Let's split up and find it! -Yes!

348
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:24,893
Gosh.

349
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,393
Is it my imagination?

350
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,293
Conan, there's another one!

351
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:52,593
-Nothing here. -Nothing here either.

352
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:57,893
In total, we've found 7 more secret codes.

353
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:02,893
Cards, French dictionary, record,

354
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,793
airplane, wine glass, portrait,

355
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,993
and this gadget doll.

356
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:12,393
Come to think of it,

357
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:16,693
my aunt used to say that my uncle liked gadget dolls.

358
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:19,693
And the first three we found.

359
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:23,793
Plate, candle stand, and vase.

360
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,993
Total of 10.

361
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:29,593
But you can't tell what it's all about with just this.

362
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:34,693
Right. If only there were something longer like a sentence.

363
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,993
A diary or a letter.

364
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,593
Letter?

365
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,493
That's right! I remember!

366
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,993
-Letter, the letter! -Huh?

367
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:48,493
Remember, I said that I'd seen that figure somewhere before.

368
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:52,693
I had completely forgotten that my aunt had shown it to me.

369
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,493
When you say "aunt", you mean the woman in this painting?

370
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:56,493
If I'm not mistaken,

371
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,693
you said she was an elementary school teacher.

372
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:03,793
That's right. It was about 5 or 6 years ago.

373
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,093
My aunt consulted me about an eerie letter

374
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,793
she'd been receiving once a year

375
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:12,693
from an unknown sender for the past 10 years.

376
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:13,793
If I remember right,

377
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:15,293
the contents of the letter were all in "hiragana"

378
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:17,493
and it said things like "Hello, teacher"

379
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:20,093
and "Please take care of yourself".

380
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,893
Isn't it just a letter from a student?

381
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:26,693
Maybe, but it was written in "hiragana" for a period of 10 years.

382
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,493
-What? -That's definitely strange.

383
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,993
And? The secret code and those letters...

384
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,893
What connections do they have?

385
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,893
It was on the letter.

386
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:39,693
That figure was drawn around the letter,

387
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,893
Iike a design.

388
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:46,593
What happened to the letters?

389
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:50,793
I didn't know what to make of it, so I had your father...

390
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,393
No! I mean I had a friend who lived in the neighborhood look at them.

391
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:55,293
He was a detective story novelist.

392
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:57,493
He showed them to Father?

393
00:20:57,493 --> 00:21:00,893
It seemed that that novelist was busy with work,

394
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:04,193
and at first, he look like he was in a bad mood.

395
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,193
But as he looked at the letters,

396
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:08,093
his expression turned to one with excitement.

397
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:11,993
He took the letters and hid himself in the room.

398
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:16,393
It wasn't a few minutes before he came out and told me this.

399
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,493
Give this envelope to your aunt.

400
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:23,193
I really enjoyed it.

401
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:25,993
Dr. Agasa, you're like the sun.

402
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,693
Thanks to you, the gloominess in me has been blown away!

403
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,193
What was that envelope?

404
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,493
I haven't any idea.

405
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,893
The contents of the envelope

406
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,793
is probably how to decode the secret code.

407
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:38,793
What?

408
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:42,693
That novelist knew too.

409
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:46,693
This secret code was all in "hiragana".

410
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:47,893
Hiragana?

411
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:50,393
-Conan, is it true? -Yes.

412
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,993
The letter was written entirely in "hiragana" as a key

413
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:57,693
telling the reader to read the figures in "hiragana".

414
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,793
I see.

415
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:02,693
It's best to think that the sender of those letters

416
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:05,093
and the person who wrote this secret code

417
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:08,193
are both the same person.

418
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:12,393
But why did he send the secret code to my aunt?

419
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:15,593
He didn't want anybody but your aunt to know.

420
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:18,293
For example, someone was after him.

421
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:21,193
Come to think of it, my aunt said this.

422
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:24,493
A strange guy often peeks into the mailbox.

423
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:29,293
That's probably the guy who slashed up the toys.

424
00:22:30,593 --> 00:22:34,993
Something is going on in this house.

425
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:04,893
"Next Episode" -Hey.

426
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:08,393
Is the treasure really hidden here?

427
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:11,393
What's this? There's nothing here.

428
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:15,793
A secret code! There's a secret code carved!

429
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:18,693
Wait a minute. If you connect these with a line...

430
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,093
Skeleton!

431
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:26,993
Take this!

432
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:29,993
Next Conan,

433
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:33,493
"Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun (Part 2)"

434
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:36,695
Next Conan Hint:

435
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:38,495
"20 dollar bill"

436
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:39,895
On the next episode, the secret code is finally decoded.

437
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,295
-I've got it! -Huh?

438
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:43,295
Well... I've got it!
