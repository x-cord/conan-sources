1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,540
Just as flowing water has no form.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,440
A Venus is born of a shell.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,540
But, behind the beauty lies a horrible trick.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,740
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,876 --> 00:02:02,976
"The Kiss of Venus"

10
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:06,876
"Beika-cho Aquarium"

11
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:14,476
Wow! Take a look at all of this!

12
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:17,376
Yeah, true.

13
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,076
Look, Dad!

14
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:21,076
Over there, see.

15
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:23,276
I'll bet a show is going to be performed there.

16
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:27,776
Wow!

17
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:37,376
Isn't it just wonderful?

18
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:40,776
A woman's going to coming out of that shell.

19
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:43,476
My God.

20
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,276
Look at all the people.

21
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:47,976
Let's go home.

22
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,676
What a thing to say. How rude.

23
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:53,276
After all we invited here by a fan of yours.

24
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:54,676
Mr. Mouri.

25
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,276
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

26
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:02,776
I'm Masato Hayashi, director of performance techniques.

27
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:06,476
Oh, hello, thank you for inviting us over.

28
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:08,376
And, who is she may be?

29
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:10,876
She is the star performer of our show.

30
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,076
Michiko Osawa.

31
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:16,276
I've been a fan of yours for some time now,

32
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:19,776
and have been hoping that you would drop by to watch my show.

33
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:26,276
Oh, well, I've always been hoping to watch your show too.

34
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:29,376
Hey, come on. I thought you said you wanted to go home.

35
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:34,076
Uh, how long can you hold your breath under water?

36
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:37,276
Gosh, how straightforward can you get?

37
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,576
Oh, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:45,776
Well, she's really been looking forward seeing the show.

39
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,876
Oh, is that right?

40
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,976
Well, let me see.

41
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:51,376
Maybe about 4 minutes.

42
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,376
If you're that interested,

43
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,376
would you like me to show you around backstage?

44
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:57,676
Yes.

45
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:59,976
Come this way, please.

46
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:12,476
This is the control room.

47
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,476
All the lights and music used for the show

48
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:18,676
as well as the operation of machines are all done here.

49
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,576
This is the employees' locker room.

50
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:24,176
And, this is the make-up room.

51
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,176
This is the room where performers like Ms. Osawa

52
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:28,476
change outfits and such.

53
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,576
And that door that you see at the end of corridor.

54
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,276
There, you will find the hatch that is connected

55
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:40,476
to the inside of the shell in aquarium, that you just saw.

56
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:43,576
-Oh. -Hey, Mr. Hayashi.

57
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,476
I wish you wouldn't tell them so much

58
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:47,276
about what we have backstage.

59
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:50,176
You're spoiling my show.

60
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:52,976
Oh, well, I didn't mean to do so.

61
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,476
Oh, Murakawa.

62
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:57,576
Let me introduce you all.

63
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:01,276
Uh, he is the chief of staff, Mr. Murakawa.

64
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:03,576
He's a veteran of 20 years in this line work.

65
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,176
How do you do?

66
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:07,976
She is Yuriko Minegishi.

67
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,576
Nice to meet you.

68
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,476
I guess you could say she is our second Venus.

69
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,076
-Oh. -Ms. Minegishi.

70
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,976
You mean you haven't changed outfits yet?

71
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:19,576
You're performing before me, you know.

72
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,376
I know.

73
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:24,076
Can't you see that I just came to get changed?

74
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:32,976
Gosh, she doesn't even have a tinge of professionalism in her.

75
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:35,476
What a way to act in front of customers.

76
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:37,076
Besides...

77
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,176
The only Venus we need here is me,

78
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:42,476
don't you think, Mr. Mouri?

79
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,176
Yes, well...

80
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,276
Well, then, it's about time for me to start getting ready too.

81
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:51,176
Please enjoy the show.

82
00:05:55,976 --> 00:06:00,476
Well, well, she sure is some woman.

83
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:04,876
Her father is the president of the Osawa Construction Company.

84
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,876
You mean the one that is famous

85
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:09,676
for being run by a tyrannical president?

86
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,976
He was also involved in the construction of this aquarium,

87
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,876
but he started pushing himself into the management as well.

88
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,276
That's why his daughter acts the way she does too.

89
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,976
I see.

90
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:24,576
Uh, it's about time I go to check out the devices, so...

91
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,776
Oh, I'm sorry to have stopped you.

92
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:29,176
Oh, no problem. Bye.

93
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,776
Shall we start heading back to our seats then?

94
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,176
You go ahead.

95
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:45,676
That man dropped his towel, so I'll go give it to him.

96
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:47,176
Oh, Conan.

97
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,176
Excuse me, sir.

98
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,876
You dropped this.

99
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:53,476
Oh, thank you.

100
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,776
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied just yet.

101
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:58,176
Can you put in on the shelf over there for me?

102
00:06:58,176 --> 00:06:59,476
Okay.

103
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:06,076
Do you always check things out like this?

104
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:09,176
Yeah, because people's lives are at stake.

105
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:11,676
Wow, an important job.

106
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:14,476
What's this switch?

107
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,876
The red switch at the top

108
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,976
stops the water was from gushing in.

109
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:21,576
And the blue switch lets the water that accumulates out.

110
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:25,676
Oh, so the water is let in and out from here.

111
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:28,776
The water is let in from the control room,

112
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:30,076
but if something happens inside,

113
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,876
and the water can't be stopped, the person will drown, right?

114
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,476
Oh, I see.

115
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,276
Okay, all done.

116
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:39,676
Go on back to your seat.

117
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,176
The show will begin soon.

118
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:42,276
Okay.

119
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:48,576
This place is packed with people.

120
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,276
The show's going to start.

121
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,976
Wow, how beautiful.

122
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:20,576
I wonder how they trained the fish.

123
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:22,776
A smelling bag.

124
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:25,676
See, she's holding something in her right hand.

125
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:28,976
The fish are following the smell from her hand.

126
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,076
Wow.

127
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:44,576
Next, it's time for Ms. Osawa to come on.

128
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:02,176
What the...

129
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,076
That's...

130
00:09:07,576 --> 00:09:09,876
The victim is Michiko Osawa.

131
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,676
25 years old.

132
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:16,876
She is the star actress of the water show being performed here.

133
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:20,376
And, you just happened to be here, Mr. Mouri.

134
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:24,176
Well, yes, I was invited over.

135
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,776
She seems to have drowned to death.

136
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,776
Drowned?

137
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,476
Which means that she was trapped in shell

138
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:35,776
and unable to escape, eh?

139
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:40,576
Maybe the machine didn't work. We need to investigate on this.

140
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:42,776
Her make-up is rubbed off.

141
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:47,676
Inspector Megure, her make-up is scrape off.

142
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:48,876
Hey, you!

143
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:51,876
Will you please stay put for a change?

144
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,776
True.

145
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,876
She probably scraped it off somewhere when she drowned.

146
00:09:56,876 --> 00:10:00,076
Then, she probably drowned because her leg hurt.

147
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:03,276
Why do you think so, Conan?

148
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:08,276
Because there is Band Aid on behind her left knee.

149
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:11,076
-What? -Oh, he's right.

150
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:14,376
Let's see.

151
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,176
This is wet compress.

152
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,676
Wet compress?

153
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:25,176
When the performer stand by and circle the hatch,

154
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:27,376
the light will be turned on.

155
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,076
After confirming that the light is lit,

156
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:30,876
I send water into the shell.

157
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:35,576
When the shell is about 80% filled, the diagram of the glows blue,

158
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,776
and the water stops automatically.

159
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:41,476
Was it working as usual today?

160
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:45,476
Yes, staff other than myself were operate it in this room too.

161
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,076
So, there's no doubt about it.

162
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:51,076
Does that lady often use wet compresses when she swims?

163
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,776
Not you again. How'd you get in here?

164
00:10:55,776 --> 00:11:00,076
Was Ms. Osawa using cold compress?

165
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,476
Yes, in the back of her left knee.

166
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:03,976
What is it?

167
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:08,976
She once hurt her left leg and almost drowned back then.

168
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:12,176
Did she mention anything on it today?

169
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:14,976
No, because if she had said her leg hurt,

170
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,376
the show would've been canceled.

171
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:22,376
She may have been hiding the fact that her leg hurt.

172
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,276
Which means...

173
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:28,076
Her leg started aching while she was standing by

174
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,376
and she drowned.

175
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:32,776
It's hard to believe since she was a professional swimmer,

176
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,576
but it's not impossible.

177
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,176
Yes.

178
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:37,976
If there was nothing wrong with the shell,

179
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:41,076
that's very likely.

180
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,276
It is completely water-proof

181
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,576
and nothing abnormal has been detected.

182
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:48,176
Which means that it would work fine so long

183
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:49,976
as it is operated correctly?

184
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,576
Yes, even if there were to be a mistake,

185
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:54,876
as long as this button is pushed,

186
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,076
the water flows out and you can swim on.

187
00:11:57,076 --> 00:12:03,176
Then, maybe the button couldn't be for some reason.

188
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:04,376
What is that?

189
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,176
Officer Takagi.

190
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:12,176
Conan, you shouldn't be in here.

191
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,576
What is that?

192
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:15,876
Huh? I wonder.

193
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:19,176
This is...

194
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:21,076
foundation.

195
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:23,376
Why would some like this be here?

196
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:28,276
So, Ms. Osawa was putting on make-up

197
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:31,476
until just before she went out to perform?

198
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:33,776
Yes, probably.

199
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:37,776
She was always concerned about what the audience thought of her.

200
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:41,576
She used to check her outfit and make until just before standby.

201
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:45,576
Ms. Minegishi, did you come out of the shell

202
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:47,576
after going in there once?

203
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,576
Just what do you mean by that?

204
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:52,376
I thought it was concluded that she died is an accident.

205
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:54,376
After Ms. Minegishi stood by,

206
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:57,276
water was poured in from the control room,

207
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,776
so I'm sure she couldn't come out to see.

208
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,676
I see.

209
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,376
How about you two?

210
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:06,376
We were both working in the control room.

211
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:09,176
Well, maybe I left to go to the rest room.

212
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,576
Hey, Conan.

213
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,976
Just what do you think you're doing there?

214
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:37,176
Excuse me, whose lipstick is this?

215
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:40,676
Oh, that's Ms. Osawa's.

216
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,976
She must've been in a super rush to have stood by

217
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,676
leaving it out like this.

218
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:47,776
She was such a tidy person that it sure.

219
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,276
It's very unusual that she would leave it on without putting it away.

220
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:54,376
Hey, something dropped.

221
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,976
It's the vinyl that's been peeled of the wet compress.

222
00:13:57,976 --> 00:14:01,676
Her leg probably started to ache suddenly that she panicked.

223
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:05,276
All she had to do was come and tell me about it.

224
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:06,276
That's...

225
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,576
I see, I get it.

226
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:13,476
This is not an accident after all. It's planned murder.

227
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:17,276
And the killer...

228
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,066
Oh, Inspector Megure.

229
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,566
Oh, Officer Takagi, how was it?

230
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:34,866
Yes, nothing seems to have gone wrong,

231
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,966
be it the operation of the shell or the room.

232
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:43,566
Just to be sure, I am thinking of having him test run it.

233
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,666
And, on the floor of the shell device,

234
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,266
there was one place that was stained foundation.

235
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:52,266
It matched with the part of Ms. Osawa's cheek

236
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,566
-that had scraped off. -I see.

237
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:57,766
It probably rubbed off while she was struggling

238
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,666
with the pain in her leg.

239
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:04,766
There seems to be no doubt that this was an unexpected accident.

240
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:12,466
Ready here. Anytime you're ready.

241
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,066
Please start.

242
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,766
Okay, please start.

243
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:16,966
Roger.

244
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,166
It's locked.

245
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,266
Okay, I'm letting the water in.

246
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,466
Okay.

247
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:32,966
The water is coming in. Everything's fine for now.

248
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:37,066
Okay, then will you check the emergency drainage device

249
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,166
when you're ready?

250
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,466
Roger.

251
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:41,866
What's wrong?

252
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:43,166
The alarm went off

253
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,766
because the water being stopped when inside

254
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:47,366
means that something is wrong.

255
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:48,866
I see.

256
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,966
Anything?

257
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:53,166
No problem. The water has stopped.

258
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,266
The water is being drained now.

259
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:58,466
Okay, then I'll continue pouring water in.

260
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,166
Everything seems to be working fine.

261
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,766
All we have to do next is shell when it fills up.

262
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,066
Show time, Pops.

263
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,566
The water has stopped in.

264
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:13,666
The amount of water poured in is also as usual.

265
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,666
Okay. I'm opening the shell now, so finish up.

266
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,666
Good work.

267
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,866
Roger!

268
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,366
We're done.

269
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:22,566
Everything is fine.

270
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,466
Thank you.

271
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,166
So, this was an unexpected accident after all.

272
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,666
Please wait, Inspector Megure.

273
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,466
That pose is?

274
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,866
This is no accident.

275
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:38,766
It is none other than a planned murder.

276
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:41,766
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

277
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:44,166
I just figured it out.

278
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:48,266
I've figured out the well schemed trick, as well as who did it.

279
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,066
A trick? Who did it?

280
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,466
First, although it had been deduced

281
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:56,566
that Ms. Osawa went into the shell and felt pain in her leg,

282
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,266
so she struggled and drowned,

283
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,066
as it has been proven just now.

284
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,466
There is an emergency switch that drains the water out

285
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:04,966
within the shell.

286
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,866
It is hard to believe that Ms. Osawa

287
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:10,766
who was capable of staying underwater for 4 minutes drowned

288
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,966
because she didn't have the time to push the button.

289
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,366
Furthermore, why would a person like her

290
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:16,466
who had a strong sense of professionalism,

291
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,666
always concerned what the audience thought of her,

292
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,666
perform with a wet compress on her.

293
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,566
I thought something was a bit funny too.

294
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,166
What do you mean?

295
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,766
Some time ago when she hurt her hand,

296
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,866
although she used a wet compress during practice,

297
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:35,066
she took it off during her performance.

298
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:39,166
And besides, when I met her for the first time today,

299
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,066
she was wearing high-heeled shoes.

300
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,466
I don't think a person who has a painful leg

301
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:47,266
would wear shoes like that.

302
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,666
But, you saw the wet compress on her too, didn't you?

303
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,766
The killer is probably the one who stuck it on her.

304
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,666
Why would the killer do something like that?

305
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,666
Just as Mr. Hayashi had mentioned a while ago.

306
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:06,166
It seems that Ms. Osawa hurt her left leg in the past.

307
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,766
If the wet compress is on her leg,

308
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:12,766
we would naturally be led to believe that it caused her to drown.

309
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:15,766
You mean the killer was trying to distract us from the truth?

310
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,766
That's right.

311
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:21,266
Then when did the killer stick the wet compress on?

312
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,666
Before the show began.

313
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,266
After sticking the wet compress on her,

314
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:30,966
the killer carried her over to the shell.

315
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:34,166
Who on earth is the killer?

316
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,166
I was performing before the audience.

317
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,466
Hayashi and I were working in the control room.

318
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,166
We had no time to make her drown

319
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,266
then, carry her over to the shell.

320
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:47,766
It takes time to make a person drown to death.

321
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,266
But, if the person were to be put to sleep with medication beforehand,

322
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:52,866
then carried, it wouldn't require too much time.

323
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,866
So long as you say you're going to the room or something,

324
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,766
no one would be suspicious.

325
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,166
The restroom...

326
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,166
which means...

327
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,666
Yes. Mr. Murakawa.

328
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,566
You!

329
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,466
It can't be.

330
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,666
Mr. Murakawa.

331
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,866
Nonsense!

332
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,566
There is proof.

333
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,766
All of Ms. Osawa's cosmetics were out on the dresser

334
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:22,366
regardless of how tidy she was.

335
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,366
That's proof that she was put to sleep

336
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,766
while she was putting on her make-up.

337
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:30,266
Besides, foundation that is thought to Ms. Osawa's

338
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:34,966
was found on the floor of the shell device.

339
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,366
This was because in order to make sure that

340
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,866
Ms. Osawa who was unconscious, drowned to death,

341
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:43,866
you left her face down on the floor of the shell.

342
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:47,566
If the foundation had rubbed off when she struggled,

343
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:50,166
why would it rub off only in one place?

344
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,566
I see.

345
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,566
Then, all you had to do was pour water into the shell from here

346
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:58,766
for Ms. Osawa to drink the water and drown to death.

347
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,566
All only queer assumptions and circumstantial evidence.

348
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:05,966
No conclusive evidence at all.

349
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:11,166
Don't you already have the conclusive evidence on you?

350
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:18,266
On your back, right by the base of your neck.

351
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,166
Excuse me.

352
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,666
Lipstick.

353
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,966
That's Ms. Osawa's.

354
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:30,766
It probably rubbed off when he carried Ms. Osawa.

355
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:34,066
But, how on earth did you figure it all?

356
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,066
There seems to be have been some stains on the staff sweat shirts too,

357
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,866
but they seem to have been washed off.

358
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:42,966
I checked the one that was hung in the waiting room,

359
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:48,066
and found a slight lipstick stain left on it.

360
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:51,466
But, you can never tell when I got this on me.

361
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,966
Since the corridor is narrow, it may have rubbed off

362
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,266
when I passed by her.

363
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,566
No, that's not possible.

364
00:20:56,566 --> 00:21:00,966
Please take a good look at the lipstick stain.

365
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:03,566
The shape of the mark of her lips are upside down.

366
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:04,966
Right.

367
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:08,866
In other words, he could only have gotten that type of stain

368
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:12,066
when he let Ms. Osawa who he was carrying down.

369
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,566
Osawa.

370
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,966
It serves her right to die, that lady.

371
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,666
Two years ago,

372
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,466
my wife and child died because they were hit-and-run.

373
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:29,966
Don't tell me that she was the one who ran over them...

374
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:32,966
Yes, it was her.

375
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,466
When her father came here,

376
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,266
I heard talking to each other about it.

377
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:42,166
They were laughing saying that I wasn't aware of anything.

378
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:46,966
She didn't even feel a tinge of guilt!

379
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:49,266
Not a tinge.

380
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:21,966
It's so depressing, after were looking forward to seeing the show.

381
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:24,866
It can't be helped, after all it was homicide.

382
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:28,466
The show can't go on after murder is committed, I guess.

383
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,166
I've got to cooperate with the investigation too, besides.

384
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,966
True.

385
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:36,666
I'll take you some place else next time.

386
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,066
How about some place like this?

387
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,666
There are a lot of beautiful ladies in bathing suits too.

388
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,966
Dad.

389
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,166
Hey, watch it, the aquarium.

390
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:52,366
Come on, I wouldn't really kick you. Only a joke.

391
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,366
Let's go.

392
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,866
I've gone weak in my legs.

393
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:00,566
Give me a break.

394
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,966
Well, what an energetic elderly woman.

395
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,066
Oh no, a black out?

396
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,466
Next Conan,

397
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,387
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 1)"

398
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:34,484
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:36,284
"Short circuit breaker"

400
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:37,784
The next episode is about a doctor.

401
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:40,284
I hate injections and intravenous drips.
