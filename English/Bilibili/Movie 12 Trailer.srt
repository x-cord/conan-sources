(Theme Song: Spread My Wings by ZARD)
A huge case lurks within the dazzling world of classical music.

5
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:22,519
Why?

6
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:24,801
Why are the musicians being targeted one after another?

7
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:27,524
The culprit's devilish hands

8
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,126
have somehow reached us too.

9
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,613
To erase the beautiful melodies,

10
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,700
the case took a dramatic change.

11
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:49,021
Ran and a thousand in the audience are taken hostage.

12
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,074
The concert continues despite the explosion.

14
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,421
There are still many people in the concert hall!

15
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,607
Conan-kun, wait!

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,898
Everything is for that silent night.

17
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:07,158
Ran!

18
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:10,737
This sound... it can't be...

19
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:11,781
That's right.

20
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,946
It's our...

21
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,289
Kudo-kun, I trust you.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,788
I won't let it be eliminated.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,198
Not this singing voice.

24
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:20,782
The curtain rises on this magnificent opera full of suspense!

25
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:22,117
A new theatrical movie!
