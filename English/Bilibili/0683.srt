1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:04,324
Officer Takagi went off

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:07,324
"Meet with parents" -without telling anyone where he was going.

3
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:10,724
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

4
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,924
Yes, we do. But why?

5
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:14,924
I couldn't have asked for better.

6
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:19,924
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

7
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:22,824
Could you do so for me?

8
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,224
He said that it's perishable,

9
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,324
so open it as soon as you can.

10
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,224
He also said that it will be no good

11
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:31,124
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

12
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,224
We opened the package

13
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:36,024
and found a tablet computer inside it.

14
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,724
When we switched it on, the screen displayed...

15
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:43,124
Officer Takagi?

16
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,324
While continuing investigations

17
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,824
to identify the location where Officer Takagi is,

18
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:52,524
three people who are likely connected emerged.

19
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:55,624
The person thought to be the culprit was identified,

20
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:58,124
and the police headed over to where he might be hiding.

21
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:01,024
Finally.

22
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:04,424
You've finally found me.

23
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:06,724
While waiting for you, I was about to doze off

24
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:10,024
and accidentally push the switch of the bomb.

25
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:13,324
Okay, now talk.

26
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,024
Tell us where Officer Takagi is.

27
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:16,424
I see.

28
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:20,524
Just like he said, you're quite a beauty.

29
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:25,224
But it doesn't mean he's right for dumping Natalie...

30
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:31,024
Now, listen well before I knock you over!

31
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,624
The man you kidnapped is Wataru Takagi,

32
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:36,024
and Natalie's boyfriend was Wataru Date!

33
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:38,424
Besides, she wasn't dumped!

34
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:41,124
But in a mail that she sent out, she said

35
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,824
that Wataru wouldn't come anymore!

36
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,524
Of course, he wouldn't!

37
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:46,424
It was because he was run over by a car

38
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:47,824
and passed away that day!

39
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:50,024
That... That can't be!

40
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:53,524
So, hurry up and tell us where Officer Takagi is.

41
00:01:58,424 --> 00:01:59,524
Don't tell me...

42
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:01,624
Don't tell me that there was poison in the wine?

43
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:02,824
Hang on!

44
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:04,324
He is...

45
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,124
Where? Where is he?

46
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:08,524
-Hurry up and tell me! -He...

47
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,624
Where is he?

48
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:17,324
In the meantime, Officer Takagi finally succeeded

49
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:19,624
in cutting the rope tied onto his feet,

50
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:22,124
and dropped the sheet that was near his feet

51
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:23,424
and finds...

52
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,024
That's...

53
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:28,724
Wait a second! What's that?

54
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,924
-A bomb? -What?

55
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,824
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

56
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,724
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

57
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,324
Officer Takagi's in a pinch!

58
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,324
His energy is running out, and so is time limit for the bomb!

59
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,024
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:48,924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:51,724
His name is Detective Conan!

62
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:42,546
"A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Raid)"

63
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:49,246
Something that looks like a timer is in view.

64
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,346
A time bomb?

65
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:53,646
Hey, Shiratori.

66
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:57,146
Do you know the time when Ms. Natalie committed suicide?

67
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:59,446
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death

68
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,446
was around 10.00 am.

69
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:05,846
Hey, tomorrow will be the same day she died a year ago.

70
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:10,246
If the timer is set to explode at that time...

71
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:14,046
So no matter what we do, Takagi will be blown up

72
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:16,446
in less than 18 hours from now?

73
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,346
-Oh, no... -Hey, wait!

74
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:22,546
The masking tape securing the bomb is about to peel off,

75
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:23,846
and it looks like it's about to fall off any minute now!

76
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,846
Darn it.

77
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,546
Officer Takagi!

78
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:33,746
Don't worry.

79
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,046
Officer Takagi has realized it,

80
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,646
and he's trying to drop it with his feet.

81
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,846
-Go for it, Takagi! -Just a bit more!

82
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,546
Drop it!

83
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,246
He put it on the board.

84
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,246
What are you doing, Takagi?

85
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,546
-Somebody's there. -Huh?

86
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,946
Officer Takagi heard somebody's voice from below,

87
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:56,146
so he didn't drop it.

88
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:59,146
The audio from the tablet has been disabled, hasn't it?

89
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:02,946
In spite of that, Officer Takagi's mouth is sealed with masking tape.

90
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,546
This means that he's in a place

91
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:07,846
where his voice could be heard by passersby.

92
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:14,246
So, Officer Takagi did what he did to protect the people there.

93
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:15,946
Takagi...

94
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,646
I wonder who will be number one tomorrow?

95
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,046
Of course, it's dad!

96
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:23,746
Because he's the strongest!

97
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:28,746
The strongest...

98
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:31,546
Officer Date, you are definitely strong to be able

99
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:35,246
to take such a huge suspect into custody just like that.

100
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:38,646
I heard that you were the top in the police school too, right?

101
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:42,146
Oh, come on. That rumor is rubbish.

102
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,246
I always placed second.

103
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:45,846
I could never outdo him,

104
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:49,346
be it physically or mentally.

105
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:50,446
"Him"?

106
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:53,646
He was a kind and lanky guy like you.

107
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,646
I wonder where he is and what he's doing now.

108
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:59,046
Maybe he's dropped dead somewhere

109
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,846
because he was overconfident about himself.

110
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,746
You'd better be careful, too.

111
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:08,046
Although we're officers, we've only got one life.

112
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:11,446
Don't risk your life on something unworthy.

113
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,546
Officer Date.

114
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,946
We should narrow down the place

115
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:22,846
where Officer Takagi is to Hokkaido?

116
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:24,746
Why is that, Conan?

117
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:27,446
Because the crow in the image with Officer Takagi

118
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,946
is probably a Western jackdaw.

119
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:33,746
Western jackdaws are usually found in Europe,

120
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:36,846
but they were found twice in Japan in the past.

121
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:40,046
And both times, they were found in Hokkaido!

122
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:43,846
But that's not enough to conclude that his location is in Hokkaido.

123
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,246
-Hey. -What?

124
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,646
What is that light?

125
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,846
I wonder, too.

126
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,246
What is it?

127
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,646
Over here.

128
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,546
There is a thin pillar of light

129
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:56,346
in the sky behind Officer Takagi.

130
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:58,446
The sun pillar phenomenon.

131
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,246
At dawn and sundown,

132
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,846
if sunlight is reflected in the diamond dust in the air,

133
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,846
it will look like a shining pillar.

134
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:11,046
It is written on the internet that it is only seen

135
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,546
in cold places like Hokkaido.

136
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:16,346
Hey, do you mean Takagi is in such a cold place?

137
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,846
We've got to rescue him quickly, then!

138
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,946
He'll freeze to death!

139
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:24,446
Hey. Do you know what temperature

140
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:25,646
causes the diamond dust to form?

141
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,346
If I remember correctly,

142
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,646
it's 20 degrees Celcius below the freezing point.

143
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:32,146
Minus 20 degrees Celcius?

144
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,246
It looks to be a quite a distance away,

145
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,146
so there's no guarantee that Officer Takagi

146
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:37,746
is right where it happened.

147
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:40,546
It's certain that he's somewhere nearby though.

148
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,046
Superintendent...

149
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,146
It's Hokkaido!

150
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:50,646
I've confirmed that Hokkaido is where Takagi is being confined!

151
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:53,546
Ask for help from the Hokkaido police

152
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,446
and contact all the construction companies

153
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:58,046
as well as the demolishers!

154
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:00,246
Ask them to re-investigate!

155
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,646
Yes, sir...

156
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:02,946
Let's go.

157
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:06,746
Megure! You shall fly to Hokkaido with Sato!

158
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,746
Judging from the word "friend" that was written in the mail,

159
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,946
an accomplice of the suspect may be at the site.

160
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,846
Don't forget to bring your gun and cell phone!

161
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,146
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

162
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,346
Hold on, Takagi.

163
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,946
Just hang on a little while more.

164
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,346
Thank you.

165
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,546
But something's strange.

166
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,846
They said they were checking all buildings

167
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,846
that have over four stories in Hokkaido,

168
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:54,346
so why haven't they found it yet?

169
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,146
If the culprit had a lot of friends,

170
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,746
and they set the place up on their own,

171
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,546
then it would be a different story.

172
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,246
If they asked a construction company to do it,

173
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:02,546
a building with four or more stories

174
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:05,346
shouldn't be that difficult to find.

175
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,446
Besides, it also bothers me

176
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,746
that Officer Takagi dropped the sheet below.

177
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:13,246
It's true that someone who passed by the site

178
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,946
could've heard the sound of the sheet that fell.

179
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:19,746
But if the police memo book that he dropped the night before

180
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,646
is covered by the sheet, everything would go to waste.

181
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,546
Maybe...

182
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,046
he had another reason for doing so.

183
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,846
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

184
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:33,846
You were recording Officer Takagi's image

185
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,046
with your cell phone, weren't you?

186
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,346
Yes, I did.

187
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,046
Show it to me!

188
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:45,946
Don't tell me that the place where Officer Takagi is being confined...

189
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:49,646
Don't tell me that...

190
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,496
Hey, Megure. Haven't you found Takagi yet?

191
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,696
No, sir.

192
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,196
The prefectural headquarter choppers are helping us search for him, too.

193
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:12,496
But we've got to narrow down the location a bit more,

194
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:13,796
or it'll be difficult...

195
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,596
Have you received any report on your side?

196
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:17,896
No.

197
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,896
We had them re-investigate after dawn,

198
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:25,096
but no four-storey building as the one seen on the tablet

199
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:27,496
where Takagi could be has been found yet.

200
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:29,996
Is... Is Takagi all right?

201
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:31,196
Yeah.

202
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:34,196
It looks as if he's about to die any minute though.

203
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:39,296
Maybe we should consider places other than Hokkaido at this point.

204
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,896
What is it? What happened?

205
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,796
Snow... It just started to snow!

206
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:46,296
Superintendent! How is it over there?

207
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,996
Is there any snow on Officer Takagi's image?

208
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:50,396
There's snow here, too!

209
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,896
Confirm with the meteorological agency! Hurry!

210
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,096
Yes, sir!

211
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,796
Superintendent!

212
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,896
We've only got less than an hour

213
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,796
until the expected time of explosion of the place of confinement!

214
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,796
I know that!

215
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:04,696
Superintendent! It's only snowing in Hokkaido!

216
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:08,396
They said it started to snow in most areas in Hokkaido.

217
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,796
So, Takagi's being confined somewhere in Hokkaido after all.

218
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,296
But how?

219
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:15,396
We already checked all buildings which are four stories or taller

220
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,596
in the entire prefecture, and yet...

221
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:18,996
why can't we find him?

222
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:21,196
That's because it's less than four stories tall.

223
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:22,296
What?

224
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,596
The culprit used a trick

225
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:27,696
to make the site of confinement appear to be more than four stories tall.

226
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:30,496
I came here because Conan said that he realized something

227
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:33,296
after looking at the image of Takagi yesterday.

228
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:38,696
I stayed up all night analyzing that image,

229
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:41,596
and finally found the evidence.

230
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,696
But we also watched that image

231
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,496
until there was nothing else to check,

232
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:47,596
and couldn't find anything.

233
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:50,696
I wonder if the shaky image was checked?

234
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:52,096
The image that was shaking?

235
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,496
The one where the crow perched on the stick

236
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:56,596
or whatever the camera was attached to.

237
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:58,396
This is the image.

238
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:01,096
Since the camera swayed and moved a bit out of place,

239
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,796
we fast forwarded it and checked.

240
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:06,096
See. Take a good look at this image.

241
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:09,096
Near Officer Takagi's left shoulder.

242
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,996
Something's here, right?

243
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:12,896
Something that looks like a hook.

244
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,396
That... That's true.

245
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,996
But what on earth is it?

246
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:21,796
A hook that is on the tip of the string of the police memo book.

247
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:25,396
So, this is the police memo book that Takagi dropped.

248
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,896
But isn't it in a weird position?

249
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:31,296
Yeah. It looks as if it's floating in the air or something.

250
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:34,896
It's not afloat. It's sitting on something.

251
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,596
It's on a mirror.

252
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:40,196
A mirror?

253
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:44,096
That's why Officer Takagi dropped the police memo book.

254
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,796
He wanted us to see through this mirror trick.

255
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:50,896
Unfortunately, it got hidden under the board.

256
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,996
He dropped the sheet that was covering the board

257
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,896
for the same reason.

258
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:56,996
In other words,

259
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:00,296
the bottom part of the front view of the image was a mirrored image.

260
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:03,396
Which means the place is only about two stories high.

261
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:06,496
Yeah. The fact that Officer Takagi is still alive

262
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,996
proves that, too.

263
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:10,396
The fact that he's alive is the proof?

264
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,796
Don't you get it?

265
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:13,196
The sun pillar phenomenon only occurs

266
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:16,296
at a temperature of 20 degrees Celcius below freezing point.

267
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,896
If a person wearing only a suit top is left in a place

268
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:22,196
where such a phenomenon can be seen,

269
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,196
it won't take him even a day to freeze to death.

270
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:28,396
Then, why is Officer Takagi still...

271
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:31,596
An electrically heated wire is placed behind the mirror.

272
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:35,496
It's to melt the snow so that it doesn't accumulate.

273
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,096
Right, Doc?

274
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:38,296
Yeah.

275
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,496
If the snow accumulates,

276
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:42,096
it'll give away the fact that there's a mirror.

277
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:44,796
Well, thanks to the heat, the temperature rose slightly,

278
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,996
and it was a blessing for Officer Takagi.

279
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:49,296
Okay!

280
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:52,596
Change the investigation area to two-storey buildings!

281
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:53,696
If it's two stories,

282
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:56,196
it's highly probable that it could be a house, too!

283
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,796
Notify the Prefectural police headquarters

284
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:00,796
to check on renovators, too!

285
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:01,896
Yes, sir...

286
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:05,796
Megure, the site is probably a house where the roof's been blown off!

287
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,996
It'll be easier to find from the sky!

288
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:10,596
There's probably only 40 minutes left before the explosion.

289
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:14,096
Find Takagi at all costs before that!

290
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,796
Copy, sir!

291
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:19,396
Where... Where are you, Officer Takagi?

292
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:25,696
Superintendent!

293
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,696
Officer Takagi is sticking the edge of the masking tape on his mouth

294
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,796
onto the steel pole beside him.

295
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,696
Did he peel it off?

296
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,896
-Well done. -He can call for help now!

297
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:42,996
Hey, what's the matter, Takagi?

298
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,696
Why isn't he calling out?

299
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:47,396
He probably can't call out.

300
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:50,196
He's so weak that he has lost his voice.

301
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,496
He hasn't had anything to drink for more than two days,

302
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:54,396
so his throat is probably parched.

303
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,196
Oh, no.

304
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:58,696
Takagi.

305
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,896
Wait a second!

306
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:05,196
Aren't those kites flying behind Officer Takagi?

307
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:08,196
But it's not only one or two!

308
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,196
It... It's a kite-flying contest!

309
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,496
Shiratori, can you identify the place?

310
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:13,696
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:19,296
Kite-flying contests are being held at three places today in Hokkaido.

312
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:23,896
Ikeguchi Town, Komamae Town and Hibai City.

313
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,696
Inform the Hokkaido Police HQ of this immediately!

314
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,296
Yes, sir!

315
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:30,996
But isn't there any way we can narrow it down to one place?

316
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:32,796
There's only less than five minutes until the bomb explodes!

317
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:34,396
Superintendent!

318
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,196
He's... His mouth...

319
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,896
Officer Takagi is moving his mouth

320
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,696
and trying to say something.

321
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:43,296
-What? -But the image isn't straight on.

322
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,096
And with snow blocking the view,

323
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:47,496
it's hard to read his lips.

324
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,996
It's Komamae.

325
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,596
The only three consonants you can't pronounce unless you close your lips

326
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:57,996
are "m", "b", and "p"!

327
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,896
If he was trying to tell us where he is,

328
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:00,896
it would have to be the three places mentioned earlier.

329
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,196
And the only place he would need to close his lips twice to pronounce

330
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,496
would be "Komamae"!

331
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,696
Megure! Go to Komamae Town!

332
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:08,996
Go there on the double! Takagi's there!

333
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:13,496
We're flying right over Komamae Town now!

334
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:16,296
There he is!

335
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:19,296
To the right of the chopper! Right below!

336
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,296
Officer Takagi...

337
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,696
We've found Takagi!

338
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:25,396
He's in the vicinity of Komamae 3rd Street!

339
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,996
There doesn't seem to be any accomplices!

340
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,596
Hurry! There's only less than two minutes left!

341
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:36,296
Not good! If we go any closer,

342
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,896
Takagi's body will fall from the impact of the wind!

343
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,096
Inspector! Please use the loudspeaker

344
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,496
and ask the passersby and town people to evacuate!

345
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:49,496
Hey, Sato?

346
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,396
Sato! Just what are you...

347
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:52,796
Sato!

348
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:56,396
Officer Sato...

349
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:05,796
I felt like Officer Sato came flying down from the sky just now

350
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,896
with her panty and everything showing.

351
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:14,796
I think I'm done for. I don't think I'll make it.

352
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:16,996
Takagi!

353
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:21,496
Move your head to the left, then stay still!

354
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,396
Sato!

355
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,596
Takagi!

356
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,996
Are you alive, Wataru?

357
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,796
Oh, yes... Somehow...

358
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:56,896
I'm so glad!

359
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:59,196
We'd better get out of here quickly!

360
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,296
What... What happened to Takagi?

361
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,896
The image went static.

362
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,796
-Don't die! -Takagi!

363
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,996
Off... Officer Sato! We're on duty, you know?

364
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:23,796
Who cares? Nobody's watching anyway.

365
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:29,396
He seems okay.

366
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:31,596
Takagi...

367
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:34,996
You should've just died.

368
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:38,996
According to the information we just got from the Hokkaido Police HQ,

369
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:41,896
the suspect, Fuemoto was suffering from terminal cancer,

370
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:43,496
and the house where he confined Takagi in

371
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,796
was bought under a fake company name.

372
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,296
It seems that he placed an order with the renovators

373
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:51,296
saying that he wanted to put a skylight above the entrance,

374
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:54,196
but he asked them to stop the construction

375
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:55,796
for three days.

376
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:59,696
Nobody's listening.

377
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:03,096
Shiratori, I'll leave the rest to you.

378
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,796
-Yes, sir. -Megure.

379
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,196
The two of them are fine.

380
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,696
You go on and join the Hokkaido Police HQ right away.

381
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,496
It ran out of battery.

382
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:50,896
We're a month late to visit Officer Date's grave.

383
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,796
Well, Officer Takagi...

384
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:55,596
You had to go through a lot, like frostbite and such.

385
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:57,196
It can't be helped.

386
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:59,496
If only I had relayed to her

387
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:02,996
that Officer Date had died of a traffic accident that day,

388
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:04,296
this wouldn't have happened.

389
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:05,696
Don't be silly.

390
00:22:05,696 --> 00:22:07,496
Ms. Natalie knew about it.

391
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:10,396
She knew that Officer Date had passed away.

392
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:14,096
Officer Date's parents remembered her.

393
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:17,096
When they went to the hospital to confirm his body,

394
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,596
they saw a Japanese-American girl

395
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:22,796
standing outside the room with tears in her eyes.

396
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:27,396
It seems that Officer Date had planned to see

397
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,296
and talk to her parents that night.

398
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,796
It also seems he wanted to bring his parents along

399
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:35,596
and introduce her to them.

400
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:37,096
Is that so?

401
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:40,496
That's why it wasn't your fault, Officer Takagi.

402
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:44,896
"Date"

403
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:48,296
But...

404
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:53,096
I wanted to give her this after all.

405
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,196
This ring.

406
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:58,196
Because the last words of Officer Date

407
00:22:58,196 --> 00:23:00,696
probably meant this.

408
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:04,496
I'm leaving this...

409
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:08,196
to you...

410
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:22,396
A toothpick.

411
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:26,596
Why is it in a place like this?

412
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,296
Come to think of it, Officer Date

413
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,796
used to always hold a toothpick in his mouth.

414
00:23:30,796 --> 00:23:31,896
Yes.

415
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,896
Somebody who came to pay a visit here before us

416
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,996
probably left it here as an offering.

417
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:39,396
I wonder who it was though.

418
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:41,496
"What have you been up to? Call me every now and again! Date."

419
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:49,296
"Delete, Cancel"

420
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,596
May you rest in peace...

421
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,196
my friend.

422
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,196
I always make it a point to tell myself.

423
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:13,096
Don't worry. You haven't fallen. You haven't fallen.

424
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:14,696
He fell!

425
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:16,096
Let's go to the site.

426
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:18,396
Come on, hurry.

427
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,496
Yes.

428
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:21,996
I'm the one who took the picture.

429
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:24,196
I'm the one who wrote the article.

430
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,696
And I'm supposedly the one who edited it

431
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:29,996
and put it in the Weekly Magazine Great.

432
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:31,696
Supposedly?

433
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:37,196
Next Conan, "Foams, Steam, and Smoke (Part 1)"

434
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,696
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,196
"Beer, coffee and cigarettes"

436
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,396
You did it, Officer Takagi!

437
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,196
-A live broadcast about your love. -What?

438
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,292
-We were all watching it. -What?
