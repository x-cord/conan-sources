1
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:07,324
I'm not letting you through!

2
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:10,124
There...

3
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:12,424
I'm not letting you overtake me!

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:13,724
There...

5
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,024
Oh no!

6
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Go after him!

7
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:18,924
Okay, come!

8
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:20,024
There!

9
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:24,624
All right! Fourth point!

10
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,324
Conan, you're fantastic!

11
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,824
Yes!

12
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,524
No fair.

13
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:32,624
Maybe there's something wrong with the rule.

14
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,324
What about it is wrong?

15
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:35,724
We're playing two against one,

16
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:38,224
and you've got more players on your side!

17
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:42,024
Besides, I only get to kick with my left leg too.

18
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:44,424
Then, I guess you'll have to not use your left leg.

19
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:47,624
Hey... then, all I get to use is my head.

20
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,824
But, if Conan uses his head,

21
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:51,524
I think we'll be in more trouble.

22
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:53,424
Then, don't use your head either!

23
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:57,524
Hey... what're you getting all worked up about?

24
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,424
We're just playing to empty our stomach

25
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,624
until the Christmas cake arrives at Doc's house, right?

26
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:06,124
So, all we have to do is kill time for the next two hours, right?

27
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:07,124
Go for it!

28
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:08,624
Huh?

29
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:09,624
Hey, no fair!

30
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:11,624
-Haibara! -Okay!

31
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:12,724
Huh?

32
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:13,924
Here goes!

33
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:16,324
Mr. Higo's special play, non-spin!

34
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:22,024
Lucky.

35
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,524
What do you think you're doing, Haibara?

36
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:28,124
I'm sorry, I should've made a better pass...

37
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:29,224
That's not it.

38
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:30,224
Huh?

39
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,424
I couldn't kick the ball

40
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:36,624
because this little one came out in front of the ball.

41
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:40,324
Yes, come here.

42
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:42,324
Oh my, how cute!

43
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,424
A cat.

44
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,324
Huh? It's Tai!

45
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:47,324
Tai?

46
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,624
You know that cat?

47
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:52,124
Yeah! He's a stray that has a territory

48
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:55,424
around the fifth district where the Mouri Detective Agency is.

49
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,224
He likes Azusa of coffee shop Poirot

50
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:01,424
and comes to beg for food around sundown.

51
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:04,324
So, the manager of the coffee shop named him

52
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,924
after the great Detective Poirot's friend, Captain Hasting

53
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:10,524
because he always hangs around Poirot.

54
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:13,424
So, that's why his name is Tai!

55
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,924
But, is he really a stray?

56
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:17,524
He's wearing a collar.

57
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:20,124
It seems that he belonged to someone before, though.

58
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,124
Your sweater got caught

59
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,824
on the cat's nail and unraveled.

60
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:33,824
This is handmade, you see.

61
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:37,824
Nevermind that but I wonder where it's going?

62
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,224
It may go out into the road

63
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,424
and get run over!

64
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:43,024
Let's go after it!

65
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,924
We'd better hurry.

66
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,424
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

67
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:04,424
are slashed by the light of deduction.

68
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:06,024
The members of the detective squad are locked

69
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:08,124
in a surprising case inside a refrigerated vehicle compartment.

70
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:09,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,224
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:52,004
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 1)"

74
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:55,404
Where'd it go?

75
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,004
It's nowhere in sight.

76
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,104
Oh, there it is!

77
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:01,204
Behind the car!

78
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:04,204
Oh, yeah!

79
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,204
It's in a place like that.

80
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:11,604
It went inside!

81
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,704
Oh no!

82
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:14,804
I wonder if it smelt fish or things like that,

83
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:18,004
that are in the back of the truck.

84
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:20,804
Let's hurry and go get it.

85
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,904
"Cheeta Courier"

86
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:26,404
The driver's nowhere in sight.

87
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,504
Then, we'll just have to go inside and bring it back out.

88
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:33,604
It's cold.

89
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:36,204
This seems to be a refrigerated car.

90
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,404
Tai, where are you?

91
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,104
Tai!

92
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:46,604
There it is.

93
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:47,704
Tai.

94
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:53,004
What a troublesome cat.

95
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,304
You can say that again.

96
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,104
Okay, let's go, Tai.

97
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:59,004
Not again. You left the door open again!

98
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:00,104
Huh?

99
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,404
Oh, sorry.

100
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,704
Be careful!

101
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,104
Yeah.

102
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:07,804
Oh, wait...

103
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:10,304
Excuse me!

104
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,504
I think I heard the voice of a child or something.

105
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:18,004
I guess you would, because there's a park nearby.

106
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,804
Oh, I guess so.

107
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,804
They started off without being aware of us!

108
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,204
We're in trouble!

109
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:32,004
Are we going to freeze too?

110
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,204
Don't worry!

111
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:34,504
Huh...

112
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:36,804
There are so many undelivered boxes

113
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,904
that are specified to be delivered today, you see.

114
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,104
Let's have the delivery men let us out

115
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:42,604
when they open the door during the next delivery.

116
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:02,804
Hey, wait...

117
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:16,304
It stopped.

118
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,804
They'll probably be surprised out of their wits

119
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,104
if we come out from inside.

120
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:23,004
But, they'll scold us too.

121
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:25,104
Well, we did it for a reason,

122
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:26,904
so if we tell them honestly...

123
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,504
No.

124
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:30,704
If you go out now, I'll never forgive you!

125
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,604
Just what are you doing?

126
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,504
In just your underwear?

127
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,904
The yarn of my sweater got caught onto something

128
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:40,304
and my sweater unraveled.

129
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,304
So, it's gone.

130
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,204
Don't shine the light on me.

131
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,404
Oh, sorry.

132
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:48,804
Oh, here they come.

133
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:50,904
Let's hide!

134
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,104
Hey! Just what're you doing?

135
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:58,104
Hurry up and make the delivery.

136
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:01,604
I still think I hear voices from inside.

137
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,704
You idiot, why would you?

138
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:05,404
That's true.

139
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,604
Hurry it up, will you?

140
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,004
Yeah.

141
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:12,604
The next delivery is...

142
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:16,004
The Sasagawa residence, at Beika condominium room 205!

143
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:19,204
Yes... the Sasagawa residence.

144
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:21,204
Oh, here it is...

145
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:25,004
This is the one. Assorted fruits.

146
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,304
Hurry and delivery it then.

147
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:29,604
Drop the delivery at the entrance,

148
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:33,004
so that the resident will remember your face and name.

149
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:36,104
The resident is an important witness, you see.

150
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:39,404
-Witness? -Yeah, I know.

151
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:42,404
In the mean time, I'll go borrow the men's room again

152
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:45,204
at a nearby convenience store.

153
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:48,004
Hey, don't you think we should check inside

154
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,704
the back of the truck just in case?

155
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,304
I'm concerned about the voices I hear.

156
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:54,704
I'm telling you to not worry about it.

157
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,404
But...

158
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,504
Don't get chicken!

159
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,004
He could never let out a sound.

160
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,704
Can't make a sound?

161
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,804
Come on, hurry it up, will you?

162
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,404
Yeah.

163
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,704
The two just now...

164
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,404
Don't tell me that they...

165
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:27,604
Please wear my jacket for the time being.

166
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:29,604
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

167
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:30,604
You're welcome.

168
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,704
We'd better hurry on out of here,

169
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,004
or we'll all catch cold.

170
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,704
Don't worry.

171
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,804
I can go out now since I'm wearing this.

172
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,004
True!

173
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:43,104
But, all you're wearing is a jacket,

174
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,504
so would you like to carry Tai?

175
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,004
He's warm.

176
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,904
Yes, I guess so.

177
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:50,604
So, the next time the men open the door,

178
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,404
let's have them let us out!

179
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:53,404
Yeah...

180
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:56,204
No, I don't think we should.

181
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,104
Huh...

182
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,104
It seems somebody else...

183
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,404
was already on this truck before us.

184
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:12,104
Just what do you mean?

185
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:13,704
I wonder...

186
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,704
I don't know who or where he came from,

187
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:18,904
nor do I know why he was killed,

188
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:23,804
but I'm sure that the ones who did it are the two delivery men.

189
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,204
What...

190
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,004
Are you serious?

191
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:30,504
But why is he in the back of the truck like this?

192
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,904
Because this truck is equipped with a refrigeration device.

193
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,604
Leaving him in here

194
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,504
would delay the decaying process of the corpse,

195
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,304
thus, also delay the estimated time of death.

196
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:42,204
Even if they were to drop him off somewhere later

197
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:44,104
and he's found,

198
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:45,204
the two would've been working busily

199
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:49,204
during the time of the crime.

200
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:51,704
They deliberately wanted to take the delivery to the front door

201
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,104
so that they could leave an impression

202
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:55,804
of their face and name to the resident,

203
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:58,804
because so that later when questioned by the police,

204
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:00,404
the resident would testify

205
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:02,604
that they certainly made the delivery at that time.

206
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:05,104
Borrowing the men's room frequently,

207
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,604
his face would show up on the surveillance camera

208
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:08,004
and serve as an alibi.

209
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:09,604
No one would suspect him

210
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:12,904
if he says that he had an upset stomach or something.

211
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,104
Besides, look.

212
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:19,104
The cardboard box that the corpse is inside.

213
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:20,304
The corners are squashed

214
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,604
and the sides are dirty too, right?

215
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:26,004
They deliberately rolled the box with the corpse inside,

216
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:28,204
so that livor mortis won't be conspicuous.

217
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,204
Hey, wait a minute.

218
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:33,204
Are you saying that if the two men find us here...

219
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,404
Yeah.

220
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:38,504
All five of us will probably be locked in here.

221
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,604
So that they can freeze us to death.

222
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:43,304
No way...

223
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,404
Isn't there anything we can do?

224
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,104
Why don't we burst through the door

225
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:49,404
as soon as it opens?

226
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,504
It won't work.

227
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:54,404
If under normal circumstances, maybe,

228
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,004
but with this stiff body,

229
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,004
I don't think it's possible

230
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,804
for all of us to make it outside.

231
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,504
Well, don't worry.

232
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:07,404
Let us deliver those two men...

233
00:12:07,404 --> 00:12:10,404
To prison.

234
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:26,838
And...

235
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,138
What're we going to do?

236
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,938
Just how do you intend

237
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,838
to nab the two delivery men?

238
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,938
Please tell us, Conan!

239
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:37,038
We're not going to nab them.

240
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:39,238
We're going to have an outsider nab them.

241
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:40,538
Huh...

242
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:42,438
The cell phone.

243
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:45,938
We'll use it to call Officer Takagi at MPD.

244
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:50,138
We'll tell him that the delivery men of the Cheeta Courier are evil

245
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,638
and that they have a corpse

246
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,438
in the refrigerated compartment of their truck.

247
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,338
We'll tell him that we're locked in the compartment too,

248
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:57,738
so to set up a checkpoint

249
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:01,838
and check the compartment of the delivery truck.

250
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:04,338
I memorized then license plate of the truck,

251
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:05,838
so everything should work out fine.

252
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,038
What...

253
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:08,238
You're going to make a call?

254
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:10,838
I thought you had a more far out idea.

255
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,238
Well, in this situation,

256
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:17,238
I guess there's nothing more that can be done, is there?

257
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,338
That's right...

258
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:21,138
So, will one of you lend me your cell phone?

259
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:24,238
I'm charging my cell at Doc's place.

260
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,838
I left mine at Doc's house too.

261
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:30,038
I didn't want to drop mine when playing soccer so...

262
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:32,438
I did bring mine along,

263
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,538
but just a little while ago, the charge buzzer sounded,

264
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,238
so I don't know if it'd be of any use.

265
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:39,038
Lend it to me, will you?

266
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,438
I'll revive the battery.

267
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:44,238
-Huh? -Revive the battery?

268
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,938
Can you do something like that?

269
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:49,838
Yeah, you take the battery out like this

270
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:53,338
The voltage rises a bit

271
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,338
and you can use it for a little while move.

272
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:59,038
Well, I'm sure that it'll be enough

273
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,738
to explain this situation to Officer Takagi.

274
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,738
Oh, it the sound of brakes!

275
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,138
Those guys are going to come back in.

276
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,438
-Let's hide. -Okay...

277
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,038
We've gotta watch out.

278
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:25,438
The only delivery we have for the fourth district

279
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:28,138
are the Yamada and Nishino residence?

280
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:29,438
Yeah.

281
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,438
But, before that,

282
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,938
it's about time we move the box with the corpse inside.

283
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:37,738
I guess so.

284
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:40,038
It's already been about two hours.

285
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:45,038
Here goes...

286
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:48,038
Okay, now it'll keep for another two hours

287
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,838
without livor mortis appearing.

288
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,338
What's wrong?

289
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:56,238
It looks like the masking tape had been pulled off once.

290
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,338
Huh?

291
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:00,138
You idiot! Just who are you saying pulled it off.

292
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,238
-Oh, no. -What...

293
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:05,538
I thought I just heard a cat...

294
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:09,038
Heck, what's with you anyway?

295
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,738
First, you say you hear the voices of kids,

296
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:13,238
then now you say you hear a cat?

297
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:14,938
But...

298
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:17,338
Well, you did kill a person,

299
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,838
so I can understand you feeling uncomfortable.

300
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,638
I'm really sorry

301
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,538
that things had to turn out this way just because of me.

302
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,038
It can't be helped.

303
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:28,038
It coincidentally turned out that the house you made a delivery to

304
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:30,738
was the of the husband of the woman you were having an affair with,

305
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:33,638
and he snapped and attacked you

306
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:36,238
saying that you were to blame for him getting a divorce.

307
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,538
I had no intention of killing him.

308
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,438
I tried to pull free from his grasp and knocked him down.

309
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,138
He hit his head somewhere

310
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:45,338
and stopped moving completely.

311
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:48,538
Well, you did then right thing

312
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,738
to call me before contacting the police.

313
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,838
We did get a hold of the wallet

314
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:55,038
with a lot of cash in it too, besides.

315
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,538
But, are you sure nobody's going to find out?

316
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:00,238
Don't worry.

317
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:01,438
After a while, we'll take the corpse back

318
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:05,038
to his house where he previously was and leave him there.

319
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:08,238
After some time, we'll go back to his place

320
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,838
and contact the police telling them

321
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,638
that we just found the body.

322
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,538
Then, everything will be okay.

323
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,938
I guess so.

324
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:19,138
Well, we could crack a window glass

325
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:21,938
to make them think that he was robbed and attacked.

326
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:26,638
After all, we've got loads of people

327
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,438
to prove our alibi.

328
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:29,438
Yeah.

329
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,438
I see.

330
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:37,638
So, it turned out to be a homicide.

331
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,038
At any rate, let's report this to Officer Takagi.

332
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:46,138
We will be taking off soon.

333
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,138
Please switch off your cell phones,

334
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:53,638
laptops game and electronic devices etc.

335
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,738
I am sorry.

336
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,038
I was trying to confirm the vicinity

337
00:16:57,038 --> 00:16:58,738
of the Kyoto Prefectural Police area

338
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,738
where we're supposed to go pick up the suspect,

339
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:02,138
but how am I supposed to switch this off?

340
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:05,438
Push the power switch down for a while!

341
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:11,538
All because you bought a smartphone trying to look edgy.

342
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,638
Did you switch yours off already?

343
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:16,138
Yes! For some time already!

344
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,338
The number you have called

345
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,238
is out of service range or switched off.

346
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:26,438
So, your call cannot be completed.

347
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:28,338
No good, I can't get through.

348
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,638
No.

349
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,038
I've got no choice.

350
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,938
I'll call Doc and explain our situation.

351
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:40,438
Oh, yes, this is Agasa.

352
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:42,438
Doc? It's me.

353
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,238
Jot down what I'm about to tell you.

354
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:45,738
Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:48,138
My hands are tied just yet.

356
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:49,638
Hold on a minute.

357
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,638
-Hey! -Hot!

358
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,038
What's cooking?

359
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:56,438
Okay.

360
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,038
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

361
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,038
I though just cake wouldn't be enough,

362
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,238
so I was deep frying doughnuts.

363
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:05,138
Well, it won't be as good

364
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:08,438
as the exclusive Christmas cake from the famous shop, but...

365
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,338
Huh? He hung up.

366
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:13,738
Well, if it's anything important,

367
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:16,338
I guess he'll call back.

368
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:19,238
Darn, the battery's run out.

369
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,538
Then, maybe if you warm it up again...

370
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:23,538
Once the battery's completely used up,

371
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,938
warming it up is not going to revive it.

372
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,438
So, what now?

373
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:32,338
You guys, put out what you have in front of me.

374
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,938
I'll try thinking whether I can do something using them.

375
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,738
Okay...

376
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,438
I have a handkerchief, pocket tissue,

377
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,738
candy and a cotton swab.

378
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:47,938
The cotton swab is what was left

379
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:51,238
after mommy cleaned my ears for me this morning.

380
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:54,738
It's not used, so don't worry.

381
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:56,538
-How about you, Genta? -I...

382
00:18:56,538 --> 00:19:00,138
I have a band-aid, chocolate bar,

383
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,238
and anti-itching ointment for frost bites.

384
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:04,438
Anti-itching ointment?

385
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:07,838
Oh, I never got frost bites,

386
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:11,138
but mom kept nagging me to keep it with me.

387
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:12,238
And, what about you, Mitsuhiko?

388
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,538
I...

389
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,838
A memo pad, a bal point pen to go with it,

390
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:21,938
handkerchief, a wallet, and a taxi receipt.

391
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:23,838
A taxi receipt?

392
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:27,038
Yes. When I woke up and was washing my face,

393
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:29,938
I found it on the floor near the washing machine.

394
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:33,038
Mother probably wanting to wash father's clothes,

395
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,638
checked the pocket and it dropped out.

396
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:40,038
I forgot to give it back to mother.

397
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,038
Next the only thing I have left is the jacket I lent Haibara.

398
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,238
I wore it right after it came back from the cleaners

399
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:49,438
that I don't think there's anything inside.

400
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,138
How about you, Haibara? Do you have anything?

401
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:53,338
Huh?

402
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,538
Oh, that's right.

403
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,738
You only have underwear on you.

404
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,738
Shut up.

405
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:06,638
But, I don't think you can do with these things.

406
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,338
How about writing help on a paper

407
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,838
from Mitsuhiko's memo pad,

408
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:14,738
tearing it off and dropping out of the car?

409
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:17,138
Oh, that sounds good.

410
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,538
With that much space under the door,

411
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:20,638
it looks like we can push a paper through.

412
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:24,838
But even if someone were to pick it up,

413
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:28,138
there's no guarantee that they'll call the police right away.

414
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:31,638
Besides, if we can get the paper outside, it'll be okay,

415
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:32,938
but if it gets stuck and we can't get it outside,

416
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:34,438
that's it for us.

417
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:38,038
The next time the delivery men open the back door of the truck

418
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,838
and find the paper stuck to the door,

419
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:44,638
they'll find out that someone is inside.

420
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:45,938
I see.

421
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:47,638
Then, what're we going to do?

422
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:50,338
-Beats me. -What do you mean, beats me?

423
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:56,138
You sure are easygoing, aren't you?

424
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:57,438
If only you didn't jump into

425
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:00,938
the back of this truck to begin with...

426
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:06,538
If I remember correctly, this cat...

427
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:11,338
I get it! There's a way.

428
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:15,338
No, but I guess that's too far-fetched.

429
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,638
What? If you came up with something,

430
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:19,038
tell us about it.

431
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,638
Huh?

432
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:24,738
The stop that this delivery truck made just before now

433
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:26,938
was at Beika Condo in the third district.

434
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:29,938
The two houses that they stopped at now was in the fourth district.

435
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,538
So, the next stop would be?

436
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:34,438
The fifth district?

437
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:35,538
Right.

438
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:37,938
The territory of this cat, Tai.

439
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,738
The fifth district where he goes to beg for food

440
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:44,038
at coffee shop Poirot.

441
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:45,238
I see!

442
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,438
You're going to make Tai go

443
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,838
and deliver a note that asks help for us!

444
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:50,538
If we stick it in between its collar,

445
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:53,138
I'm sure Azusa will notice it!

446
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:54,938
Let's do it!

447
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,238
Yeah.

448
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,938
But...

449
00:21:57,938 --> 00:22:00,238
If those two men catch Tai

450
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:03,838
and see the paper attached to its collar...

451
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:06,238
I've already figured that part out too.

452
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,938
Huh?

453
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:10,238
I'll think up a code that they won't figure out

454
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:13,038
even if they were to see it.

455
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:14,838
A code?

456
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,338
-"Next Episode" -A code?

457
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:56,638
"Poirot Coffee"

458
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:58,038
Oh, Tai.

459
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,938
You're late today.

460
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,038
It's been a while since we let the cat go,

461
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:05,238
but nobody's coming to help us.

462
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:08,438
I wonder is that code was too difficult after all.

463
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:11,338
Or maybe the piece of paper with the code

464
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,838
came off from the collar partway.

465
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,338
No way.

466
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,738
Next Conan,

467
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:21,738
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 2)"

468
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,238
Next Conan's Hint:

469
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,138
"Christmas Cake"

470
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,638
I'd like chocolate.

471
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:44,938
Cake doesn't seem to go well with you.

472
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:46,638
Do you want to be hit again?
