1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,990
Welcome.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,490
This is the only place
that can grant your wish.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh, yeah?

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:13,700
Wada Tatsumi (39)
Unemployed

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,040
My wish, huh?
Wada Tatsumi (39)
Unemployed

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,490
Surely you came here because you knew that.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,720
You simply have to believe.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,300
As long as you follow my instructions...

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,430
I'll commit the perfect crime, right?

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,230
Exactly. I'm like a modern
day Professor Moriarty.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,440
Providing people like you with
the perfect crime is my job.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,190
I see...

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,600
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,290
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,420
A world-famous planned crime!

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,180
The old man is selected for
an undercover operation!

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,790
Always determining the one truth

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,640
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,010
his name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,801
An Encouragement of the Perfect Crime

21
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,371
"An Encouragement of the Perfect Crime!"
An Encouragement of the Perfect Crime

22
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,981
An Encouragement of the Perfect Crime

23
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:54,971
Yes, that's correct.

24
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:56,971
Mori Detective Agency
Yes, that's correct.

25
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:01,471
Several strange cases have
occurred in the city recently.

26
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,521
I see. What's this?

27
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:08,311
Marriage fraud, bank robbery, and burglary.

28
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:14,011
Though they seem unrelated at first,
these cases have something in common.

29
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,111
Take a look at these notes.

30
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,511
What's this?

31
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,621
They look like instruction
manuals for crimes.

32
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:24,671
According to the arrested culprits,

33
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,881
they purchased the plans from a man
calling himself a criminal adviser.

34
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:34,511
That's what's thriving in the underworld now?

35
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:40,101
Said criminal adviser is a vigilant man.

36
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:43,621
We only recently determined his location.

37
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:47,271
So we have a request for you.

38
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,261
What is it? Spit it out.

39
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,351
An undercover operation, huh?

40
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:56,531
You'd be more like an adviser.

41
00:03:56,841 --> 00:04:02,541
Since it's a special case, we'd
appreciate it if you joined us.

42
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:04,391
I see.

43
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,461
It takes a talented adviser
to take down an adviser.

44
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,501
I hope he's got some decent advice to give.

45
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,701
What are you doing here?

46
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:20,351
Since it's an undercover case, I thought
we'd seem less like cops with me around.

47
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:24,021
What kind of criminal
brings a child with him?

48
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:26,571
Why not let him come, Mori-san?

49
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:30,021
When Conan-kun's around, the investigation
always seems to go mysteriously well.

50
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:36,281
His office is in there?

51
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:39,071
Yes, definitely.

52
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,241
Let's go.

53
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,151
Yes, ma'am. Mori-san,
we appreciate your help.

54
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:44,871
Hamanaka Planning

55
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,291
My name is Sato. I made an
appointment the other day.
Hamanaka Planning

56
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:49,491
Welcome.

57
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,801
This is the only place
that can grant your wish.

58
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,801
You're the one we've heard about?

59
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:57,131
Yes.

60
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:03,371
I am the modern day Professor James Moriarty.

61
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,431
I am Hamanaka Misao, criminal adviser.

62
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:07,061
Hamanaka Misao (57)
Criminal Adviser
I am Hamanaka Misao, criminal adviser.

63
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:11,061
What does a criminal adviser do?

64
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,841
You're asking that now?

65
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,071
Isn't that what you're looking for?

66
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:17,581
Perfect Crime Manual - Showa Criminal History - Heisei Criminal History - Criminal Chronology - Japan's Unsolved Cases

67
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,571
In this office are all
documents related to crime,
Perfect Crime Manual - Showa Criminal History - Heisei Criminal History - Criminal Chronology - Japan's Unsolved Cases

68
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:24,821
and all the tools you need to carry one out.

69
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:29,421
In other words, as long as
you follow my instructions,

70
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:32,581
you will be able to commit the perfect crime.

71
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:33,871
What?

72
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:38,971
Aren't you the famous detective Mori Kogoro?

73
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,721
Which means yours companions must be,

74
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:47,221
judging by their appearance, police officers.

75
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,351
Of course he figured it out.

76
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:53,521
Hamanaka-san, could we speak with you?

77
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:55,901
Very well.

78
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,711
I've always wanted to speak
with a detective or the police.

79
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:05,981
You can start by taking a look
at these instruction manuals.

80
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,211
Let me see.

81
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:10,661
I did indeed write these.

82
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:13,171
What? You admit it?

83
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:16,201
What point is there in lying about that?

84
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,651
I produced all of these.

85
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:22,321
They are undeniably blueprints
for crimes written by me.

86
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:25,181
Plots for novels.

87
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:27,181
Plots for novels?

88
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:31,681
Plots are like the plan for
a novel or play, right?

89
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:37,351
Yeah. They're like a summary
or framework of a story.

90
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,361
You mean...

91
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,531
A plan for a crime.

92
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:45,411
Indeed. I sell those plots.

93
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,031
Primarily plots for crime novels.

94
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,401
What's this?

95
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,541
My price list.

96
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:52,961
Price list?

97
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:56,851
I've ranked them according
to the nature of the crime.

98
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,921
My selling point is the variety I offer.

99
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,961
I offer plots all kinds of crimes.

100
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,071
Murder, robbery, fraud...

101
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,051
There's even one called
"thumbtack in slipper."

102
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,061
Online Message
Prank Call
Thumbtack in Slipper
There's even one called
"thumbtack in slipper."

103
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:13,571
I offer an exhaustive list of crimes from
murder to light offenses in complete versions,

104
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:18,061
simple versions, abridged versions,
and first half only versions.

105
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,071
What's a first half only version?

106
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,361
I'm meeting the needs of my customers.

107
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:29,581
Some of them said they wanted my
plots but couldn't afford them.

108
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:33,581
So why did this person get caught?

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,501
This is a simple version
of a bank robbery plot.

110
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:44,881
Ah, he made the mistake of
not acquiring a plasma torch.

111
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,301
He was arrested because he cheaped out
and failed to break into the vault.

112
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,181
How about this one?

113
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:55,131
This is an abridged version
of a purse snatching plot.

114
00:07:56,271 --> 00:08:00,441
The culprit was simply too fat to run away.

115
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,691
Then what about this first half
only version of a burglary?

116
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,451
They were arrested easily.

117
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:10,111
I remember that case well.

118
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:15,221
I can't believe they committed a
burglary without wearing gloves.

119
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,461
That's it?

120
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:20,251
Sounds like everyone who follows
your plots gets arrested.

121
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:23,371
You were lying when you said
you sold perfect crimes.

122
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:25,391
Th-That's not true!

123
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:28,051
There are plenty of criminals
who haven't been arrested.

124
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:34,431
I sold a plot that's been
unsolved for several years.

125
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:38,441
Could you tell us more about that case?

126
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:42,511
Unfortunately, I cannot do that.

127
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:46,441
I can't just give away my
customers' information.

128
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,201
Maybe so, but we can't just let it go.

129
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:56,621
I wish I could help you, but trust
is essential in my business.

130
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,371
No hard feelings.

131
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:02,811
Hold it right there.

132
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:07,781
Don't forget that I'm just
a crime novel adviser.

133
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,641
I simply sell ideas for novels.

134
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,641
I'm not committing any crimes.

135
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,641
You understand that, don't you?

136
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:20,651
Furthermore, I don't encourage
my customers to commit crimes.

137
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:26,161
The plots laid out on the table
are all works of fiction.

138
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:29,081
The characters, organizations,

139
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:34,331
and names are products of my imagination and
bear no relation to actual persons or events.

140
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,331
Why, you...

141
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:41,581
In other words, the police
can't lay a finger on me.

142
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:53,301
What?

143
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:57,561
Hamanaka Misao, you're
under arrest for abetment.

144
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:05,171
No matter what you say, your
plots are causing actual crimes.

145
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,071
You're guilty of abetment.

146
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:08,941
B-But...

147
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:13,461
Were you working as a criminal
adviser without even knowing that?

148
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:14,871
Well, I...

149
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:16,491
Now confess.

150
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,121
What?

151
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,121
The crimes you're involved it.

152
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:21,751
Tell us about every last one.

153
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,751
Y-You can't be serious.

154
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,161
Are you sure?

155
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:28,631
If you don't cooperate now, you'll regret it.

156
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,611
How you're treated after incarceration,
testimony during the trial,

157
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,301
the impression made during bail hearings...

158
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:39,561
A lot of things that will shape your
life are about to happen to you.

159
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:46,191
Hey, Takagi. Are you sure
you needed an adviser?

160
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:47,821
Yeah...

161
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:50,821
Well? What's it going to be?

162
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,321
Transfer complete.

163
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:56,061
Roger that. Make a backup.

164
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:56,821
Got it.

165
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,221
We've obtained information on five cases.

166
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:05,081
Of those five, three are unsolved,
and two are currently in progress.

167
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:09,711
We found detailed information on
the suspects and their methods.

168
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,251
Takagi-kun just sent you the data.

169
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:14,601
Got it.

170
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:18,971
We've received strong information
relating to a number of unsolved cases!

171
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,381
This is a rare opportunity for us!

172
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,981
Call on all officers and
arrest all the suspects!

173
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,391
Have everyone head to the scene!

174
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:27,981
Yes, sir!

175
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:34,651
Don't move!

176
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,201

191
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,511
Only one case remains!

192
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,331
Project No. 980
Ishigami Takashi's Revenge Plan
Hamanaka Planning

193
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:05,021
Ishigami Takashi's Revenge Plan.
Project No. 980
Ishigami Takashi's Revenge Plan
Hamanaka Planning

194
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:09,521
The suspect's name is Wada Tatsumi,
forty-eight years old, single.

195
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:12,561
He has three previous offenses
and is currently unemployed.

196
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:15,151
He was just recently released from prison.

197
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:18,451
The scheduled time of his
crime is today at 4 PM.

198
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:22,031
Since it's just after three now,
we don't have much time left.

199
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,751
The plot is a complete version of a murder.

200
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:31,481
The method is to use an odorless
gas to blow up an entire building.

201
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:33,171
A gas explosion?

202
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:37,171
There's even a blueprint
showing a remote detonator.

203
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,371
Does he plan to blow up the evidence, too?

204
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:46,141
Ishigami Takashi was Wada's superior at
a company he worked for ten years ago.

205
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,941
Apparently he believed he was
responsible for Wada's firing.

206
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:55,191
The police are already heading to the
suspect's house and the target's office.

207
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:58,191
The case should be resolved soon.

208
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,071
Police!

209
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,901
What?!

210
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:09,151
Wada's apartment is empty.
The suspect isn't here.

211
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:12,131
Damn! Keep an eye on the area.

212
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:12,861
Ishigami Industries

213
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:13,881
How are things over there?
Ishigami Industries

214
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:17,351
We haven't seen the suspect.

215
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:22,801
We've secured the alleged target Ishigami-san,
but there hasn't been any unusual activity.

216
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:27,431
The suspect Wada is attempting
to cause a gas explosion.

217
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,251
Search every nook and cranny
for hidden gas cylinders.

218
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,191
Got it.

219
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:35,611
3:30 already.

220
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:40,611
According to the plot, a lot of people
will get caught up in the explosion.

221
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,581
We must do whatever it takes
to stop the explosion.

222
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,371
Got it.

223
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:51,371
Nothing was found at
Ishigami-san's workplace.

224
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,381
What's going on?

225
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,181
Maybe he's not carrying out his plan yet?

226
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:58,881
The scheduled date is today.

227
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,721
On top of that, we haven't
determined the suspect's location.

228
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,391
I don't think we should be optimistic.

229
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:10,641
Where is it? Where is the detonator?

230
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,991
Gas Density

231
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,468
We're running out of time.

232
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:38,718
We need to find clues from here quickly.

233
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:43,988
I told you, as long as my customers
follow my instructions,

234
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:46,598
they can commit the perfect crime.

235
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:50,668
Remember! What did you and Wada discuss?

236
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:51,948
What did we discuss?

237
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:54,878
Tell me every last word
that was said. Got it?

238
00:14:54,878 --> 00:15:00,788
A-All right, but I did most of the talking.

239
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,788
Was there anything about him that seemed odd?

240
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,688
Odd?

241
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,368
Come to think of it...

242
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,638
Surely you came here because you knew that.

243
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:12,218
You simply have to believe.

244
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:14,628
As long as you follow my instructions...

245
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:19,758
I'll commit the perfect crime, right?

246
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:23,698
For some reason he knew my catchphrase.

247
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:26,238
He came to buy one of your plots.

248
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:28,728
It's not that odd that he knew.

249
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,268
I suppose not.

250
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:37,638
Oh, right. He said he wanted the detonation
to be controlled remotely instead of automatic.

251
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:41,278
Perhaps he wants to deal
the killing blow himself.

252
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:44,788
Does he hate his target that much?

253
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,288
I believe so.

254
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,288
Gas Density

255
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:56,128
Wada clearly stated that his
target was Ishigami-san, right?

256
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,068
Yes.

257
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:01,428
I write my plots after listening
to my customers' requests.

258
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:05,768
Then Ishigami-san is definitely his target.

259
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:11,218
Isn't guarding the target and waiting for
the suspect to arrive our best option?

260
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:16,198
Detective Takagi is right,
but something's off...

261
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,018
Well, I guess I've got to do it.

262
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,708
No forewarning again...

263
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,208
Th-This is...

264
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:32,708
The Sleeping Kogoro.

265
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,458
I have a few questions for you.

266
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:40,468
Gas Density

267
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,468
Explosion Ready

268
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:47,978
First, why do you believe he came to see you?

269
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:51,498
Why? Because of my excellence, obviously.

270
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,598
What?

271
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,648
Fine.

272
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:57,478
Let's assume he heard of
your reputation somewhere.

273
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:02,878
When you spoke with him, did you think
there was anything strange about him?

274
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,238
I'm not sure.

275
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,218
I find it strange.

276
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,248
He may have been fired,

277
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:14,878
but why did he plan such
an elaborate assassination?

278
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:16,868
You're right.

279
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:22,008
You may hate someone for firing you, but
usually you wouldn't want to kill them.

280
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,968
He paid a lot of money for it, too.

281
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,058
Yeah.

282
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,938
Are you certain?

283
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:28,518
What?

284
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,138
I've been doing this job a long time.

285
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:37,148
The actions of a criminal hardly fall
within what's considered sensible.

286
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:41,388
A long time? How long
have you been doing this?

287
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:47,488
W-Well, at the very least, I
think it's been about ten years.

288
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:49,848
Hey!

289
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:50,748
Conan-kun?

290
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:52,498
What is it?

291
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,878
Did you figure something out?

292
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:54,998
That's definitely it.

293
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:55,658
9/13 Fired from Ishigami Industries
8/20 Purchased plot from Hamanaka Planning
9/5 Attack on Beika Finance

294
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,648
If my reasoning is correct...
9/13 Fired from Ishigami Industries
8/20 Purchased plot from Hamanaka Planning
9/5 Attack on Beika Finance

295
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:58,748
Conan-kun?
9/13 Fired from Ishigami Industries
8/20 Purchased plot from Hamanaka Planning
9/5 Attack on Beika Finance

296
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,018
I was wondering where the bathroom is.

297
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:04,088
The bathroom's at the end of the hallway.

298
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:05,258
Thanks.

299
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,478
There's no time.

300
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:08,508
Mori-san.

301
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:15,078
Do you recall the cases you
plotted seven years ago?

302
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,018
What?

303
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,898
Judging by your reaction, you've forgotten

304
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:22,398
about the robbery that took place
seven years ago on this day,

305
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:23,898
for which Wada Tatsumi was arrested.

306
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:24,838
What?

307
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:29,208
Does Hamanaka have something
to do with Wada's arrest?

308
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:31,678
I remember now!

309
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,728
He attacked some black market
lenders in Beika City!

310
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:35,908
That's right.

311
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:41,048
It's the plot for the robbery
you wrote seven years ago.

312
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,798
Y-You mean...

313
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,778
According to police documents,

314
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:47,548
after attacking the black market
lenders that were his target,

315
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:53,308
the high performance security
cameras of the shopping mall

316
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:56,058
along his escape route
captured his escape vehicle,

317
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,308
his license plate number,

318
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:03,308
and even the driver Wada's face.

319
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:09,198
It was your mistake for failing to
take into account the shopping mall.

320
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:15,958
Wada probably believed it was
your fault that he was arrested.

321
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:20,958
The fault of the sloppy plot you wrote.

322
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,958
Explosion Ready
Gas Density

323
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:26,968
You're right. That was my mistake.

324
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:28,848
In other words, this is what happened.

325
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:29,648
Haido Prison
In other words, this is what happened.

326
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:33,158
Wada Tatsumi recently finished his
sentence and was released from prison.
Haido Prison

327
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:33,428
Several days ago, he visited your office
for the first time in seven years.
Haido Prison

328
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:36,978
Several days ago, he visited your office
for the first time in seven years.

329
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:41,968
However, you didn't remember
the robbery or Wada himself.

330
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,488
What's why he chose to act.

331
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,988
He remembered your catchphrase.

332
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:54,058
He was that fixated on you.

333
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,118
In other words...

334
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:57,158
The target isn't Ishigami-san.

335
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:57,908
No.

336
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,718
His target is you!

337
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:00,838
What?

338
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:04,128
Th-Then the detonator is...

339
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,518
Yes.

340
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:08,668
The detonator is here!

341
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:21,838
H-Hello?

342
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:25,278
Hamanaka, you know who I am, don't you?

343
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:27,988
You're Wada Tatsumi-san.

344
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:31,158
Do you know why I called you?

345
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:32,778
N-No, I...

346
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:36,218
I wanted to hear your voice one last time.

347
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,288
What? W-Wait!

348
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:42,458
Farewell, you fraud.

349
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:48,998
Damn. Why isn't it exploding?

350
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:52,218
It won't explode, Wada-san.

351
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,008
Who are you?

352
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:57,318
We just shut off the gas,

353
00:20:57,318 --> 00:21:01,268
and the detonator you installed
in the air purifier was removed.

354
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:06,378
You were first arrested
for a burglary, right?

355
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,488
When I examined the entrance
to Hamasaki-san's office,

356
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:12,028
I found signs of lock picking.

357
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:17,288
Knowing the detonator was hidden in his
office narrowed down the hiding places.

358
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,948
In order to make a gas
heavier than air explode,

359
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,288
the detonator needed to be as
close to the ground as possible.

360
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,608
Damn.

361
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:29,298
But how did you know I was here?

362
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:35,598
Because you asked to make the detonator
remote controlled instead of automatic.

363
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,808
That's how you'd take your revenge.

364
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,888
So I thought you'd be someplace
you could see the explosion.

365
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:46,908
I lost.

366
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:51,038
Wada Tatsumi, you're under
arrest for attempted murder!

367
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:21,178
Nice work, Mori-san.

368
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:23,198
Oh, you know...

369
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:28,748
Thanks to you, we were able
to solve five cases at once.

370
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:35,338
Ultimately, Hamasaki's perfect crimes
turned out to be armchair theories.

371
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,398
I know.

372
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,758
If it means making people hate you enough
to want to kill you, it's not worth it.

373
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:44,268
I suppose it was unfortunate for him

374
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,928
that you had a great adviser like me.

375
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:52,708
Who do you think you are?
