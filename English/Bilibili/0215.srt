1
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,932
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,832
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:24,332
Today's episode is a true suspense story.

4
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:26,232
Two incidents happen in places that are far apart.

5
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,632
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:29,532
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:32,232
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:59,691
"Bay of Revenge (Part 1)"

9
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,691
What a nice sunset.

10
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:11,991
Just watching it, takes all of today's exhaustion away.

11
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,391
You're right.

12
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,591
I'm about to forget that

13
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:19,391
you got stingy about paying rental car charges,

14
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,691
so we end up being stalled in a place like this.

15
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,091
Am I right, Conan?

16
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,991
Is anything wrong?

17
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:29,791
This is the entrance to our villa.

18
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,891
"Private Area, No Entry" -It's not a parking lot.

19
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,991
Or did you want to talk to me?

20
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,991
I'm so sorry. We've come on a family trip,

21
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,991
but the car broke down.

22
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,091
My name is Kogoro Mouri.

23
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,391
Please don't worry, we're not suspicious people.

24
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:53,991
What? You're that renown detective Mr. Mouri?

25
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:57,891
So, you know me. Yes, I am Mouri!

26
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,391
Pardon me for my rudeness!

27
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:02,391
"Keisuke Tachibana (62), Lawyer" -I'm Keisuke Tachibana,

28
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,891
and I run a law firm in Tokyo.

29
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,191
You're the Mr. Tachibana that I hear of every time

30
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,691
there is trial for well-known cases?

31
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,991
He is the lawyer that'll do anything for money if I remember correctly.

32
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,091
Well, most of the cases that I handle are dangerous

33
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,591
that I'm always in a fix because of people coming after my life.

34
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,391
And he's my secretary, Mr. Sakuraba.

35
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,591
"Yuichi Sakuraba (29), Secretary" -I'm Yuichi Sakuraba.

36
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,591
Nice to meet you all.

37
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:35,291
Look up the number of a mechanic for them, will you?

38
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,491
Sure.

39
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,291
Well, please drop by at the villa for a while.

40
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,991
After all, it's not every day

41
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,591
that I get a chance to listen to your stories.

42
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,391
Thank you so very much!

43
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,591
Johan, we've got guests.

44
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,291
How cute!

45
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,591
"Johan"

46
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:01,891
Good boy. Your name's Johan?

47
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:05,891
He's got a very unique type of fur. What kind of dog is he?

48
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,691
Well, I don't know.

49
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:12,291
The maintenance man of this villa picked him up.

50
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,191
I'm just keeping him as a watch dog.

51
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,191
Is that right? Well, aren't you a lucky dog, Johan!

52
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:26,491
This is indeed a case of Buddha in Hell!

53
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:28,491
I thought that I'd have to give up eating fish for tonight,

54
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:31,291
but to think that I get to eat all this food!

55
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,291
This is really delicious.

56
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,291
We just caught all the fish,

57
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,391
and besides, Yaeko is really a good cook.

58
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,991
"Yaeko Kamei (50)" -It's all rural food, that's embarrassing.

59
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,291
Yaeko.

60
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,291
Yes?

61
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,091
Please bring me some red wine and a risotto to go with it.

62
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:50,091
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away.

63
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,291
"Yuki Tachibana (43)" -Welcome, everyone.

64
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,591
"Mr. Tachibana's Wife" -I am his wife, Yuki Tachibana.

65
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:57,491
I thought you were going to be asleep tonight?

66
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,291
After hearing that Mr. Mouri stopped by here tonight,

67
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,491
I regained my appetite.

68
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:05,191
Would you all like to have some wine too?

69
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:09,191
I don't think so, because we're having some local sake just yet.

70
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,891
Yes, hot Japanese white wine.

71
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,991
That's embarrassing.

72
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,191
Who could it be at this time of night?

73
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,491
It's Ms. Sugimura.

74
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,691
Yes, please come in.

75
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:32,991
Good evening.

76
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:35,291
What brings you here at this time of night?

77
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,491
I just had something I want to tell Mr. Tachibana.

78
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,991
Mr. Tachibana!

79
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,391
We got another one of those letters again at the office!

80
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,991
I didn't want anything to happen while you were on vacation,

81
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,791
so I figured that it'd be better to bring it over.

82
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:55,591
Mr. Mouri, he is the accountant of my office.

83
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,991
"Noriko Sugimura (48)" -Sugimura here!

84
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,691
"Accountant" -Mr. Mouri? Are you by chance...

85
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,291
Right. He's the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

86
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,491
Why don't you go ahead and join us all for dinner too, Ms. Sugimura?

87
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,391
Thank you very much.

88
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,991
What? You don't have the parts?

89
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,991
You mean you can't get it until tomorrow. Now, what'll we do?

90
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:19,691
Mr. Mouri! Why don't you spend the night here?

91
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:24,191
You were on a trip anyway, weren't you?

92
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,991
This is the Tachibana residence,

93
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:29,291
please repair the car so it works like new even if it takes time.

94
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,591
Yes, thank you.

95
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,391
So, Mr. Mouri, please take it easy to your heart's content.

96
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,791
Talk about rich.

97
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:45,291
A western style mansion made of stone and a hot spring white cedar bath!

98
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,591
Lawyers sure must make a lot of money!

99
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,991
It just goes to show that

100
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,091
Mr. Tachibana is the type of lawyer he is rumoured to be.

101
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,991
What's with these figures?

102
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:06,991
Don't tell me that you're embezzling money from the office?

103
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:09,891
This has been happening ever since I've left accounting up to you!

104
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:13,091
I wonder if a man who can't even control the way his wife wastes money,

105
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:16,391
has any right to say anything about accounting.

106
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:20,091
I hear that your wife is taking revenge on you.

107
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,291
Revenge?

108
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,291
Will you hurry up and divorce her,

109
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,191
make money under the table, circulate finances

110
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:31,891
or do something for the sake of the office?

111
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:35,391
You'd better do something before the person who named T.K kills you!

112
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,991
She's scary.

113
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,391
What does she mean by revenge?

114
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:46,891
And, the initials T.K...

115
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,691
Hey! Do you have anything on her yet?

116
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:50,991
No, not yet.

117
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:55,291
Gosh! That's why you can never pass the bar exam!

118
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,691
Pardon me, sir.

119
00:07:56,691 --> 00:08:00,091
You're the one who's not giving me time to study!

120
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:02,091
Why do I have to do things other than my own duties?

121
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:06,891
How dare you to talk back to me!

122
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:10,391
Your rudeness will not be accepted anywhere!

123
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,691
I can't eat anymore.

124
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,291
Johan, you sure can eat, can't you?

125
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,891
You're up already?

126
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,691
Good morning!

127
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:41,191
Did you sleep well last night?

128
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,291
Yes, thank you very much.

129
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,191
I'll go get big catch today too,

130
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,391
so you can expect a delicious dish today.

131
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,691
I'm sorry for us intruding on you like this.

132
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,291
Don't worry about it.

133
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,391
Take your time and relax here until your car is repaired.

134
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,391
I'm enjoying your company here too.

135
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,891
Mr. Tachibana, your lunch.

136
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:01,691
Take care of things for me then, will you?

137
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,391
Bye!

138
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,691
Johan is barking.

139
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,891
I wonder what's wrong?

140
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:27,691
I'm sorry, I think he wants to go for a walk.

141
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:33,991
I was busy in the morning since Mrs. Tachibana decided to go home.

142
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,991
God, I'm in a fix. I have to head back to Tokyo right now.

143
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,091
We could take Johan for a walk for you.

144
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,491
We must do something to repay you for all the hospitality we're receiving.

145
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,991
Right, dad?

146
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:51,591
I guess so. We've got to go to the repair shop anyway too.

147
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,591
Really?

148
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,391
That would really be a great help.

149
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:59,391
No problem, no big deal!

150
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,191
Hey, wait, Johan!

151
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,591
Cut out your running!

152
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,891
Hey!

153
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,891
I'm telling you to stop! I'm tried!

154
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:15,891
Hey, break time! Break time!

155
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,091
I'm not going to move an inch from here!

156
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,791
You two sure get along, don't you?

157
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,491
No way! I'm just trying to get along with him

158
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,891
because his master's been so nice to us!

159
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,891
What's up, Johan?

160
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,991
Johan, where are you going? Wait for me!

161
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,591
Do you like boats, Johan?

162
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:51,891
Maybe he knew someone on the boat.

163
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,691
Well, it sure looks delicious!

164
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,191
Thank you for your treat.

165
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:07,091
-Thank you for your treat. -Thank you for your treat.

166
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:10,291
The view is fantastic and it sure feels good.

167
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,691
What? Isn't something wrong with that boat?

168
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:16,991
It's tilted at such a sharp angle.

169
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:20,491
Don't tell me that's Mr. Tachibana's boat?

170
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:22,991
What?

171
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:25,991
Hey! It's capsizing!

172
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,291
Oh, no!

173
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:31,591
Yaeko, please call the police!

174
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,891
Yes, sir.

175
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,680
Well, everyone.

176
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,580
Are you sure that he is Mr. Keisuke Tachibana?

177
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,980
Yes.

178
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
There is no mistake.

179
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,280
"Officer Inoki (28)" -It just happened to be high tide,

180
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,180
"Officer Inoki (28)" -so we had a difficult time to rescuing him.

181
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,780
"Police Officer" -I'm sorry it turned out this way.

182
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,680
What?

183
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,880
Officer, wasn't Mr. Tachibana wearing a life jacket?

184
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,780
Yes, I'm sure he was wearing one when he left this morning!

185
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Are you sure?

186
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Then why isn't he wearing it now?

187
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,780
There are people who take their life jackets off when it gets hot.

188
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,780
Therefore, we have a lot of accidents like this happening!

189
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,280
But, it's winter now.

190
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,480
No matter how warm they say this part of the region is.

191
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,280
He could've stayed afloat if he was wearing his life jacket and yet.

192
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,980
My God, and I warned him to be careful because the waves were high.

193
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,280
What a thing to have happened.

194
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,580
The more so, it's hard to believe that he would take off his life jacket.

195
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,880
Excuse me, may I ask who you are?

196
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
"Hiroshi Inuyama (70)" -I'm Inuyama,

197
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,280
"Boat Rental Shop's Owner" -who rented the boat out to Mr. Tachibana.

198
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,380
I own that rental boat shop over there.

199
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,280
To tell the truth, a boat the same model as the one he rented was stolen.

200
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,480
I wonder if you could look for it while you're at it?

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
Are you sure?

202
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,280
Yes! The kids saw a guy wearing a red baseball cap sail away on it.

203
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,180
We saw that boat too! From the cape over there!

204
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,280
And, which way did it go?

205
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,380
Where would that direction be?

206
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,280
Since it was the road below the cliff,

207
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,980
the boat was blocked by it and sailed out of sight.

208
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,880
That is the direction where Mr. Tachibana had the accident.

209
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,580
Then, it could be that the boat rammed into Mr. Tachibana's boat!

210
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,280
But, we saw it about two hours before the accident.

211
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,880
There are something bothers me about that man.

212
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,780
It could be the man who came to the villa once before.

213
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,080
What?

214
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,880
A man who came to visit Mr. Tachibana about two months ago

215
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,280
was also wearing a red baseball cap.

216
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,180
He had an argument with Mr. Tachibana.

217
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,080
If he was the same man,

218
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,080
he probably stole the boat to get close to Mr. Tachibana.

219
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,480
We'll begin a search for the boat immediately!

220
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,780
That'll be a great help!

221
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,280
Officer.

222
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,580
What is it you want? I'm afraid no one is back yet.

223
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,780
We've got the results of the autopsy.

224
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,480
What shall we do, Officer Baba?

225
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,580
"Officer Baba (42), Police Officer" -Let's wait!

226
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,380
I'd like to watch Mr. Mouri make his deduction too.

227
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
Okay.

228
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,480
What do you mean you want to watch Pop's deduction?

229
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,280
Well, Mr. Mouri is pretty well-known around here too.

230
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,480
Besides, according to the rumour,

231
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,580
I hear he dances to Yoko Okino's music as he makes deductions!

232
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,280
The so-called, "Dancing Kogoro"!

233
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,980
Just what are they talking about anyway?

234
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,980
What? Sleeping pills?

235
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,680
That's what you found in him?

236
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,480
Yes, it seems that after taking the sleeping pills,

237
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,180
he fell in the water while asleep and drowned.

238
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,380
Did Mr. Tachibana show any signs of the possibility of committing suicide?

239
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,580
I wonder, suicide...

240
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,280
He could never have been thinking of suicide!

241
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,880
Because...

242
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
I'll go get big catch today too,

243
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,780
so you can expect a delicious dish today.

244
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,580
He also told us to relax and make ourselves at home

245
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,280
because he enjoyed our company.

246
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,080
I see.

247
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,580
Which means somebody must've made him drink it.

248
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,080
Yaeko, welcome back.

249
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,980
I just got back.

250
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting. I'll get dinner ready right away.

251
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,880
Ms. Kamei? Out shopping?

252
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,280
Yes, because the people from the office will also be gathering here.

253
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,180
I can see that you're busy,

254
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,980
but could we ask you a few questions?

255
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,080
Yes.

256
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,480
What kind of lunch did Mr. Tachibana take with him?

257
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,180
Sandwiches and hot coffee.

258
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
What kind of sandwiches were they?

259
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Hamburger, pickles, vegetable salad and onions.

260
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,380
Exactly what came out in the autopsy.

261
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,880
Which means that Mr. Tachibana ate his lunch.

262
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,380
And Mr. Sakuraba was the one who gave the lunch to Mr.Tachibana?

263
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,580
Mrs. Tachibana suddenly asked me to do something for her,

264
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,580
so Mr. Sakuraba gave the lunch to Mr. Tachibana for me.

265
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,580
So, that's makes it possible for three people

266
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,980
to have mixed in sleeping pills.

267
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,180
No way! Nobody would put something like that inside!

268
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,180
What's this about sleeping pills?

269
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,780
Mr. Sakuraba?

270
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,980
-Yes. -Do you know that Mr. Tachibana has passed away?

271
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes, I heard so from the officer in the parking lot just now.

272
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,880
By the way, where were you until this time of day?

273
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,380
I... I was at the Tokyo office

274
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,780
to do something for Mr. Tachibana!

275
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,380
I heard that the boat that Mr. Tachibana was in capsized and he drowned.

276
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,580
Now, what does this have to do with sleeping pills?

277
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,580
It seems that someone sneaked sleeping pills into his coffee.

278
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,980
I don't belive it.

279
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,880
The guy who was wearing the red baseball cap may have done it.

280
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,680
Right, that's another possibility!

281
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,980
It seems a strange letter was received too. Right, Mr. Sakuraba?

282
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,480
A strange letter? What is that?

283
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Mr. Tachibana had been receiving blackmails recently.

284
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,180
Blackmails? Why didn't you mention it earlier?

285
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,480
Here they are!

286
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,180
The same thing is written on all three of them!

287
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,780
"If you don't want your lawyer's license revoked,"

288
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,880
"get three million yen ready. T.K."

289
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,980
This is indeed blackmail!

290
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
In the diary it says,

291
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,680
"The guy is a hopeless devil,"

292
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,980
"blackmailing me after I win him an innocent verdict"

293
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,980
"despite the crime that he committed."

294
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,880
Mr. Sakuraba, do you have any idea who the initials T.K stand for?

295
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,480
No, that's...

296
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,680
You're not being very clear.

297
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,180
According to the diary it looks to be

298
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,480
that Mr. Tachibana won this person an innocent verdict

299
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
knowing that this T.K committed the crime,

300
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,980
and you knew nothing of it?

301
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,280
No, I just happened to come across the letter

302
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,780
when I was clearing the papers out.

303
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,480
Mr. Tachibana got angry and told me to forget about it.

304
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,580
Well, the people of the office have arrived.

305
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,880
We'll go over right now.

306
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,480
"Umio Fujisawa (45), Lawyer" -I came to get Mr. Tachibana's body,

307
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
but I was told I couldn't.

308
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Is there something suspicious about his death?

309
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,480
Well, there were some trivial things we wanted to check on.

310
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,380
Where is Mrs. Tachibana?

311
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,780
She waiting at her residence with the other members of the family.

312
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,880
Where is Ms. Sugi... who was it?

313
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,980
You mean Ms. Sugimura?

314
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,480
She's off on Saturdays and Sundays and seems to have gone out.

315
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,280
We can't get a hold of her.

316
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,280
There it is!

317
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,480
This is...

318
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
A red baseball cap!

319
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,180
We've got to report this immediately to Officer Baba!

320
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm sorry to be intruding on you so early in the morning,

321
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,680
but we found what looks to be evidence.

322
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Have any of you seen this red baseball cap before?

323
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,480
It's the same color as the one who was sailing the boat was wearing!

324
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
I see.

325
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,480
What about you, Ms. Kamei?

326
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,280
Yes, I'm sure it looked like that.

327
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,780
Actually, there is a name on this cap.

328
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,680
Please take a look.

329
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,280
Do you have any idea who this name Kumada refers to?

330
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,980
No, not at all.

331
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
How about you?

332
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,780
I have no idea.

333
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,480
Hey, Mr. Sakuraba, isn't Mr. Kumada the one that

334
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,380
Mr. Tachibana defended about five years ago?

335
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,580
The hearing that they had the same year you came to Mr.Tachibana's office.

336
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,580
Yes. Is it him?

337
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,680
Did that person get an innocent verdict?

338
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,980
Yes, although the circumstances seemed to be against him,

339
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,180
Mr. Tachibana won him an innocent verdict.

340
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,280
His name was Tatsuya...

341
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,680
I think it was Tatsuya Kumada!

342
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,980
Tatsuya Kumada?

343
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,380
The initials would be...

344
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,780
T.K!

345
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,480
So, we've got a connection here with the initials

346
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,880
that were on the letters of blackmail!

347
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,580
This could be!

348
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,980
Although the man called Kumada was blackmailing Mr. Tachibana,

349
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,980
but he was probably being ignored!

350
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,680
Or maybe Mr. Tachibana on the contrary told him that

351
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,580
he would press charges of blackmail against the guy!

352
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
So, he goes all the way to where Mr. Tachibana is fishing

353
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,080
and forced him to drink sleeping pills,

354
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,480
took off his life jacket and drowned him.

355
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
It fits in, Officer Baba!

356
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,080
Okay, Officer Inoki.

357
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,780
Let's go search for Kumada as a prime suspect!

358
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Yes, sir!

359
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,280
But, just think that he's living in a place

360
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,980
only 25 minutes from the villa!

361
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,080
That makes him even the more suspicious.

362
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,580
Yes, I guess we've got him!

363
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,080
How come you're tagging along?

364
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Because I witnessed the man wearing the red baseball cap!

365
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,580
It's strange,

366
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,280
I hear that he is a night owl who is asleep in the mornings.

367
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,780
The door's not locked.

368
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,180
What?

369
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,480
Mr. Kumada, we're coming in.

370
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,080
What... What is this?

371
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,080
The suspect Kumada...

372
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
has committed suicide.

373
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,880
"Next Episode" -Ms. Sugimura.

374
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,280
Why do you who has only come to the office three years ago,

375
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,380
know of the case that happened five years ago?

376
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,580
I hear that your father committed suicide because of your husband,

377
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,880
right, Mrs. Tachibana?

378
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,680
I hear you've embezzled quite a large sum of money.

379
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,080
Don't be ridiculous!

380
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,880
I get it!

381
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,580
So, that's what happened!

382
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,980
