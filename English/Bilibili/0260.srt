1
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:03,224
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:05,124
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,824
The stage of today's show is at a restaurant.

4
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:09,124
The table, foodstuff, and tricks of all kinds.

5
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,737
There's a lot of construction going on.

9
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:05,237
They're building a bypass.

10
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,837
Are you sure we're heading right direction?

11
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,937
Absolutely!

12
00:02:11,937 --> 00:02:14,537
We've been wandering around for the past 30 minutes.

13
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:17,837
That hurts on an empty stomach.

14
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,337
I'm starved.

15
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:23,437
I know! Just keep on walking!

16
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:26,637
Gosh. You're not the only one who's starving.

17
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:27,937
Mr. Hanaoka!

18
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:29,337
Mr. Mouri.

19
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:31,937
Hello! I'm here again!

20
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:34,637
But I brought my family along tonight.

21
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:35,837
-Hello. -Hello!

22
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:37,237
"Shigeru Hanaoka (40)" -Well, well.

23
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,437
Welcome to my restaurant.

24
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,237
Please, come inside.

25
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:45,037
Oh, welcome.

26
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:47,837
Where have you been?

27
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:51,337
Well, just to get cigarettes.

28
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,337
Anway, we're having customers now.

29
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,837
"Reiko Hanaoka (30)" -Welcome, Mr. Mouri.

30
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:58,937
I'm sorry, I was changing the water for the flowers.

31
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,637
You changed the water just this morning.

32
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:04,837
The flowers last longer this way.

33
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:09,137
Mr. Mouri, this way please.

34
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,637
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,537
Oh, no. I can't get it off:

36
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,937
Please take the table at the middle.

37
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,237
Saki!

38
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,537
Yes, coming!

39
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:24,737
"The Shaking Restaurant"

40
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:28,937
Welcome.

41
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:30,637
Huh? I haven't seen you before.

42
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:33,137
"Saki Yoshizawa (20)" -I'm the new waitress here.

43
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:35,937
I'm Saki Yoshizawa. Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,337
I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,237
That's all right.

46
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,437
I'll get a towel right away!

47
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,137
Here!

48
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,437
Let me do it for you.

49
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,737
Thanks, Ran.

50
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:53,637
Show me the back side.

51
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:56,537
Good grief. You demand so much attention.

52
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,237
Sorry about that, Mr. Mouri.

53
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:02,237
"Minoru Wada (35)" -I'm sorry about the tremors

54
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:04,537
from the construction next door.

55
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,637
Well, the places really are shaking.

56
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:11,537
But we've been told that the tremors will stop soon.

57
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:14,537
We have to wait until 10pm tonight, and it will all be over.

58
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,937
I'm starved!

59
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:21,637
We have a big, fat sea bream today, sonny.

60
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,737
But I prefer fried prawn.

61
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:24,837
Okay, coming up!

62
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:35,037
Mr. Hanaoka.

63
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,337
You're closed tomorrow.

64
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,637
Are you going fishing for spearfish as usual?

65
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:40,937
Oh, yes! I'm planning to prepare the tackle and the bait tonight

66
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,837
and leave the first thing in the morning.

67
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:46,237
Spearfish fishing in the ocean breeze.

68
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,937
I envy you.

69
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:52,037
Thanks to his hobby, I'm left all alone on holidays.

70
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,037
Alone?

71
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:56,137
I'm no fool.

72
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:59,037
What do you mean by that?

73
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,437
What is it, dear?

74
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:02,937
Stop that! Were having customers!

75
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,837
Mr. Hanaoka, look.

76
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,637
Here, this picture.

77
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,337
This big fish. Is this spearfish?

78
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,937
Yes, that's right.

79
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:18,937
A fishing buddy who's also a photographer took that picture.

80
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:22,037
Mr. Hanaoka, how long have you been fishing?

81
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,637
Well, I think it has been 25 years maybe.

82
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:27,237
You know, I used to live in Hachijo Island.

83
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:30,037
Look! Is that you?

84
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,537
You're so young!

85
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:36,437
But this picture looks a little different from others.

86
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:40,337
Probably it was taken by an amateur.

87
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:42,137
If you look close enough,

88
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:45,337
the camera is focused on the chef and not the fish.

89
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:49,837
Usually, a photo like this is focused on the fish.

90
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:51,737
You know a lot about pictures.

91
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:54,637
Actually, I wanted to become a photographer once.

92
00:05:56,737 --> 00:05:58,937
What's this?

93
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:00,637
One?

94
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,437
Conan!

95
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:10,337
Oh, Ms. Saki. Are you off work?

96
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,837
Yes.

97
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,837
You're here, too?

98
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:16,937
Oh, hello. Aren't you with your father?

99
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:20,437
He said he hasn't had enough yet and went drinking alone.

100
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:23,437
He's a dud of a father!

101
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:26,137
But you've still got one.

102
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:32,237
"The Last Super Detective"! I wanted to see this!

103
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:35,737
This is about a playboy detective, right?

104
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:38,037
Mr. Mouri must be having a good time

105
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:41,537
surrounded by young girl fans right now!

106
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:43,037
You must be kidding.

107
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,537
Freezing!

108
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:52,237
What luck! The bar closed!

109
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,637
This one's closed, too.

110
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:59,437
It's Hanaoka alone.

111
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:00,737
Right.

112
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:03,837
He must be working on the tackle and bait for tomorrow.

113
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,737
I'd rather not interrupt.

114
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,537
That's Mr. Wada, right?

115
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:23,937
Yes, Mouri here.

116
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:26,237
Hi, Ito!

117
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,837
Mahjong? Now? Where?

118
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:31,537
Next to Karantei? What coincidence!

119
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:33,437
Of course, I'm going. You bet I will!

120
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:41,037
Oh, I forgot!

121
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,237
What is it?

122
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,537
I need to buy bread for breakfast.

123
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:46,137
You can go ahead and go home!

124
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,437
But it's already late.

125
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:50,637
Let's go home together.

126
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,837
I'll wait for you here with Conan.

127
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:56,837
Right. You're safe with her since she knows karate.

128
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,237
Conan, that's embarrassing!

129
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:00,737
All right, I'll be back as soon as I can.

130
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:07,237
I told you you can go drinking,

131
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,537
but why do you have to drink until morning?

132
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:14,237
Stop yelling at me! It's ringing in my head!

133
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,137
You only get what you deserve.

134
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:19,437
I'd really love a hot cup of coffee here.

135
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,437
Did something happened?

136
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,537
What in the...

137
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,037
This... this is...

138
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:40,737
Sorry to tell you...

139
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:43,837
but he's been dead for quite some time.

140
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,037
Ran, call the police!

141
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:47,337
Okay!

142
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:52,337
Mrs. Hanaoka, where do you usually put this vase?

143
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:54,437
On the top of the stairs...

144
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:00,637
Could it be that the vase fell with the tremors?

145
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:04,537
Probably by some unfortunate coincidence,

146
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:08,437
it hit your husband's head.

147
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,337
By the way, who are you?

148
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:15,537
My name is Yamamoto, Mr. Hanaoka's friend.

149
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,337
"Koichi Yamamoto (40)" -We were planning to go spearfish fishing

150
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:21,237
at Hachijo Island today.

151
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:23,937
I had to wait for a long time for him.

152
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:25,437
Since I was told he's not home either,

153
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:28,337
I came here with his wife.

154
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:32,837
He was looking forward to go to Hachijo every year around this time.

155
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:40,837
There's a trace of blood forming straight lines.

156
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:46,237
-It hurts! -Don't touch the evidence!

157
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:50,937
I was just wondering whether the vase really hit Mr. Hanaoka.

158
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,537
There's blood on the inside of the hat.

159
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,937
It's proof that the vase hit his head!

160
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:59,437
But look. The flowers from the vase that fell.

161
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:02,537
They're withered compared to others.

162
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:05,137
I was just about to get to that.

163
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:13,037
True. The flowers here still look fresh.

164
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,137
Hey, Pops.

165
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,737
Dad!

166
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:25,637
See, there's a white fragment something on the floor...

167
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,637
It probably came from the ceiling.

168
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,837
If it's not to salt or sugar,

169
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:35,137
it's highly likely it's white paint from the ceiling.

170
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,537
We need to look into whether it has something to do

171
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,937
with the cause of Mr Hanaoka's death.

172
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:44,137
There's a fine scratch on the beam.

173
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:47,137
The paint must have peeled ff from here.

174
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,137
Okay! Let's check the other side!

175
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:53,337
And the window is open.

176
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:57,037
I knew it!

177
00:10:57,037 --> 00:11:00,937
The same scratch I found on the beam!

178
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,837
The construction site is just outside.

179
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:09,337
This may not be an accident.

180
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,237
Huh?

181
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,137
Mr. Hanaoka may have been killed,

182
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,937
and it was set up to look like an accident.

183
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:17,237
No way...

184
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:32,645
Mrs. Hanaoka.

185
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,945
Mr. Wada, Saki...

186
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,445
A flower vase fell on my husband.

187
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:39,945
What?

188
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:46,745
And then? What happened to him?

189
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,745
He's been taken to the hospital for autopsy.

190
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,845
Autopsy?

191
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,245
That means...

192
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,645
Excuse me, but who are you two?

193
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,445
I'm Wada. I work here as a cook.

194
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,545
I'm Saki Yoshizawa, a waitress here.

195
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:07,445
Inspector, wasn't it an accident caused by a falling vase?

196
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:13,545
Mr. Hanaoka indeed died due to a falling vase.

197
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:17,045
However, it appears that the vase was dropped deliberately.

198
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,245
Deliberately?

199
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,845
Right!

200
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:23,145
I thought it was an accident at first,

201
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,245
but my investigation turned up a lot of things.

202
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:36,345
The autopsy showed he died between 11pm and 1am today.

203
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,045
However, we found that construction work

204
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:44,245
ended at 10:30 pm last night due to machine failure.

205
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:46,645
That means...

206
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,245
tremors from the construction site

207
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:51,845
couldn't have caused the vase to falls.

208
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,445
I'd like you to see something.

209
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:00,645
It was found at the construction site.

210
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:04,145
The line on the fork is used for spearfish fishing

211
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:07,945
and the line was tied to a steel frame.

212
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:10,745
The culprit used this line and the steel frame,

213
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:13,745
positioned the vase right above Mr. Hanaoka's head,

214
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,345
and made it fall.

215
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:20,645
I had Officer Takagi check the freezer in the back of the kitchen.

216
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,345
He found sea bream

217
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,945
and a few flower petals inside.

218
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:29,545
Which means the culprit

219
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:33,945
placed the fork with the fishing line into the vase with flowers

220
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:37,445
and placed the vase in the freezer.

221
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:42,245
Later, the frozen vase was placed instead of the other

222
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,145
right above Mr. Hanaoka's head as he was preparing his baits.

223
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,645
Moved on the pretense of changing water for the flowers.

224
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:51,045
And the line running along the beam

225
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:53,645
was tied to the line to the vase.

226
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:57,145
Later, the culprit went out to go to the construction site

227
00:13:57,145 --> 00:14:01,745
and tied the line to the steel frame there

228
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:05,145
and slowly dropping it into the trench.

229
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,845
This way, the frame pulled the vase

230
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,345
and moved the vase right above his head.

231
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:15,745
As time passed, the ice inside the vase melted.

232
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,745
That's what really happened.

233
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:26,745
Amazing! He's done it again and he's awake this time!

234
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:29,245
By the way, it's your job

235
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,645
to take care of the flowers, isn't it?

236
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,745
Don't tell me you think I did it?

237
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:41,545
Why would I want to kill my husband?

238
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:46,945
This was found inside Mr. Hanaoka's locker.

239
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:50,445
What's this?

240
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:53,045
A report written by a private investigation firm.

241
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,845
This is a report on Mrs. Hanaoka's activities

242
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,545
that her husband requested.

243
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:01,545
This is a photo of her with...

244
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:04,245
Mr. Wada.

245
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:08,045
Yes, there is an accomplice in this case.

246
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,845
The one who created the contraption in the construction site

247
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,545
must be Mr. Wada.

248
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,845
By coincidence,

249
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:20,845
I saw Mr. Wada last night coming out of the construction site.

250
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:22,445
Extramarital affair.

251
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:26,445
So that is why you wanted to get rid off your husband.

252
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,045
Is that right?

253
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,745
I'm sorry!

254
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:41,045
Everything is true!

255
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,845
I'm very sorry.

256
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:47,845
Mr. Mouri! You're splendid as always!

257
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,645
Well, this is a piece of cake.

258
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:55,645
Get your foot off that chair!

259
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,045
What's that?

260
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:02,145
I didn't see that yesterday.

261
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,545
What's with you?

262
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:08,845
Pops, the shape of the scratch on the chair and the vase...

263
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,245
Hello, this is Megure.

264
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:18,045
Okay.

265
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,945
It was from Officer Chiba at the autopsy.

266
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,345
He says sea bream scales

267
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,945
were found in the collar and around the neck of the victim.

268
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:26,345
Seabream scales?

269
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:30,145
Fishing was his hobby.

270
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:34,145
So maybe they stuck there in an earlier fishing trap.

271
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,245
This is...

272
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:44,145
So, that's it!

273
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:49,145
Anyway, we need you both to come with us for further questioning.

274
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,445
Wait, Inspector.

275
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,045
Mr. Mouri?

276
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:58,645
The two are not the killers.

277
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,145
What?

278
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,245
Then, who is it?

279
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:07,345
Certainly, the two built that device.

280
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:10,245
But when the vase fell,

281
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:13,845
Mr. Hanaoka was already dead.

282
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,445
What?

283
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:17,645
The real culprit learned of the scheme to kill Mr. Hanaoka

284
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,645
and took advantage of it.

285
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:23,845
The trick will not work

286
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:27,045
unless Mr. Hanaoka sits exactly under the vase.

287
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,845
But it was totally unreliable.

288
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:34,545
That is why the culprit chose the most reliable way.

289
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:36,945
Which is by approaching Mr. Hanaoka from behind

290
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:39,445
and with the frozen sea bream...

291
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,245
hitting him on the head.

292
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:47,845
The simplest and sure-fire solution.

293
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:50,345
So, that's how the scales got there.

294
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:53,145
After killing Mr. Hanaoka, the culprit rushed to return

295
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,345
the sea bream to the freezer

296
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:58,345
and had a problem taking off the glove.

297
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,845
Because this person

298
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,945
had to go to a certain location as soon as possible.

299
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:07,845
To the video shop where Ran and Conan are waiting.

300
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:09,345
Isn't that right,

301
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,945
Saki?

302
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:15,345
Conan, show that to the Inspector.

303
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,545
Okay!

304
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,045
Here you are.

305
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:23,245
This is a rubber glove.

306
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:26,945
This was used during the murder.

307
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:30,145
I see a faint trace of lipstick.

308
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:34,945
Yes, the same color of lipstick Saki was using yesterday.

309
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:36,245
No.

310
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:40,745
Don't make me a killer just because I wear the same color.

311
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,345
You tried to take off the glove in a hurry

312
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:46,745
because you had to get to where they were waiting.

313
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:50,445
But the glove sticks and is hard to take off,

314
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:54,445
so you bit the tip

315
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:56,545
to remove it.

316
00:18:56,545 --> 00:19:01,645
There is a bite mark believed to belong to a woman.

317
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:05,345
You can check and prove whose it is.

318
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,945
Is that true?

319
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:14,245
He deserved to be killed.

320
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:20,245
21 years ago, he was a fisherman in Hachijo Island.

321
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:23,545
There was a girl named Aiko Morimura

322
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:27,145
whom he promised to marry in the future.

323
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:31,045
But Hanaoka said he wanted to study cooking

324
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,045
and left the island and Aiko.

325
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:37,145
Aiko let him go without a complaint.

326
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:40,945
She didn't even tell him she was carrying his baby.

327
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,045
Aiko waited.

328
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:46,245
She had the baby by herself and waits for him to return

329
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:48,645
while raising her child.

330
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,745
She waited and waited

331
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:56,345
until she lost hope and died this spring.

332
00:19:56,345 --> 00:20:00,545
Then, Aiko's child is...

333
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,945
I could not forgive him.

334
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:07,145
I could never forgive him!

335
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,445
Saki.

336
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,645
That photo...

337
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:14,845
That photo at table where Mr. Hanaoka sat all the time...

338
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:20,645
Isn't it most likely was taken by your mother?

339
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:22,345
What?

340
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:28,045
The focus is not on the fish but on Mr. Hanaoka.

341
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:31,645
It looks like a picture taken by somebody who loves him.

342
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:39,945
Look!

343
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:47,145
Mr. Hanaoka had the photo placed in the shop

344
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,545
and probably was looking at it all the time.

345
00:20:58,745 --> 00:20:59,745
There is something that looks like the numeral 1

346
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,945
at the corner of the photo.

347
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:06,645
That probably stands for Aiko.

348
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,745
Aiko Morimura.

349
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:11,345
So what? What's that supposed to mean?

350
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:12,545
Are you telling me he should be forgiven

351
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,145
because he kept the photo and looked at it?

352
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:17,245
My mother is already dead! She worked hard,

353
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:19,445
led a hard life, and died alone!

354
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,945
If he really did think of her that much,

355
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,745
why didn't he contact her?

356
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:25,445
Why didn't he write her even once?

357
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:28,945
If he did, if he ever did...

358
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:30,645
my mother would still...

359
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:36,345
Saki.

360
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:42,745
I don't know why Mr. Hanaoka never contacted her,

361
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:47,845
but regardless of what he did in the past,

362
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:52,445
there must have been ways for you to tell him how you feel.

363
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:56,845
Ways other than committing something abominable like murder.

364
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,245
Amazing!

365
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,745
It's pulling, pulling hard. It must be a big one.

366
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,945
Hold on to it tight!

367
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:41,045
I'm ready to take it!

368
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,445
Ran, move back a little. I can't get the fish in the frame.

369
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:46,145
I can't move any more.

370
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:47,445
You move back, Dad.

371
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:48,645
Okay.

372
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:50,145
A bit more.

373
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,445
Just a bit more.

374
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:56,145
Dad, are you all right?

375
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,245
You're better off in front of the camera,

376
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:03,645
rather than behind it, Pops!

377
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:08,245
"Next Episode"

378
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:10,245
This is...

379
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:12,645
Is that the legendary...

380
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,745
Pops, look there!

381
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,945
The armor is gone!

382
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,445
Next Conan,

383
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:35,266
"Frightening Legend On A Snowy Night (Part 1)"

384
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:38,463
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:40,163
"Footprints"
