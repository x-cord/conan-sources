1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.440
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.540
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.340
The conspiracy of the Black Organization is about to be confirmed.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.840
The truth becomes clearer after one incident and another.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.267
Dr. Agasa and I got a hint of coming in contact with

9
00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:45.067
the Black Organization from the diary of Mr. Itakura who had been killed.

10
00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:48.967
Therefore, we came over to Mr. Itakura's villa.

11
00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:51.467
Then...

12
00:01:58.267 --> 00:01:59.767
Hey, what's going on?

13
00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:03.067
Vodka?

14
00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:05.767
You're there, aren't you?

15
00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:07.467
They've found out.

16
00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.867
They've found out that we failed to open the e-mail.

17
00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:11.967
Yes.

18
00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:15.067
Hey, answer me.

19
00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:18.367
I know you're at that villa.

20
00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:19.967
Shinichi?

21
00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:23.367
Hurry up and answer me,

22
00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:24.767
Mr. Itakura.

23
00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:26.767
Hey!

24
00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:37.267
"Contact with the Black Organization (Pursuit Edition)"

25
00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:41.967
Hey, answer me.

26
00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:45.267
I know you're at that villa.

27
00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:47.167
Hurry up and answer me,

28
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.967
Mr. Itakura.

29
00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:53.567
I guess we've no choice

30
00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.467
but to make it out the back door

31
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.767
and hide in the blizzard.

32
00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.767
Oh, sorry. It's so dark in here

33
00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:04.567
that I was having trouble picking up the phone.

34
00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:09.067
It seems that the electrical circuit went out

35
00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:10.767
because of this blizzard,

36
00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:14.667
I couldn't open the mail because of this, too.

37
00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.467
That's what you get for trying to receive mail

38
00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:18.667
in a mountain villa like that.

39
00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.267
Hey, wait a minute.

40
00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:24.367
How come your answer phone's working despite the blackout?

41
00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:28.667
Well, blackouts are frequent in this area because it snows a lot.

42
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:32.267
That's why I'm using a phone equipped with a built-in battery.

43
00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:35.567
I see.

44
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:41.867
It's amazing how you found out I was here.

45
00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:48.167
"Please turn on the light" -We know all about you.

46
00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:53.167
Don't tell me you were keeping watch over this villa, were you?

47
00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.867
We weren't, don't worry.

48
00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:57.267
Just as promised,

49
00:03:57.267 --> 00:04:00.067
we're nowhere near you.

50
00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:04.867
You're finished with that system software in question, I hope.

51
00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:06.867
Yes, somehow.

52
00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:10.267
Is there anyone with you?

53
00:04:10.267 --> 00:04:11.767
Hey, answer me!

54
00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.667
What is that sound just now?

55
00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.567
Sound?

56
00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.867
It's the wind.

57
00:04:17.867 --> 00:04:20.367
The sound of the wind tapping on the window.

58
00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:23.967
That's right, it's snowing heavily over there, too.

59
00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:27.267
So, I can't use the computer.

60
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.367
I hate to say this, but would you give me the info directly?

61
00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:33.367
The time and place of where I should hand this software over to you.

62
00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.367
All right, fine.

63
00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.467
I'll say it just once, so listen well.

64
00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:43.167
You know the station that's under construction called "Kenbashi"?

65
00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.867
The fashionable station that's going to be added to the Toto Subway Line.

66
00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:48.967
Tomorrow morning at midnight,

67
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:50.867
come and wait in front of coin locker number 0032

68
00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:54.367
located on the basement floor of the station.

69
00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:58.367
Don't forget to bring the system software, got that?

70
00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:02.267
No. Tomorrow's a bad day.

71
00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:03.867
What?

72
00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:07.767
I'm going to have to be hospitalized from this evening for a health check.

73
00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.267
You know about it, don't you?

74
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.967
About my bad heart condition.

75
00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:15.667
Don't tell me that you're trying to buy time

76
00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.467
because you still haven't completed that software?

77
00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:20.567
No, of course not.

78
00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:22.967
The software is complete.

79
00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.967
Then, when is it convenient for you?

80
00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:26.567
After I'm discharged from the hospital,

81
00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:28.167
so about three to four days later.

82
00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.867
No, give me five days.

83
00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:34.267
Nonsense. We can't wait that long.

84
00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.167
Postpone your hospitalization appointment.

85
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:39.767
I finally got an appointment with a famous heart surgeon,

86
00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.767
so I can't change the date.

87
00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.467
If I were to hand it over to you before I enter the hospital,

88
00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:48.267
it has to be today, but the construction workers will be there at daybreak.

89
00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:51.967
It's not convenient for you guys then, isn't it?

90
00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:53.767
At 4 am, then.

91
00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.867
Four hours from now at 4 am.

92
00:05:56.867 --> 00:05:59.167
Bring the software to the place I told you.

93
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:01.267
Four hours from now?

94
00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:03.767
From Gunma to Tokyo?

95
00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:04.967
What's the problem?

96
00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:05.967
If it's completed,

97
00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.367
you should be able to bring it with you, shouldn't you?

98
00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.967
Okay.

99
00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:12.767
Four hours from now, I'll take it there.

100
00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:17.167
But don't ambush me.

101
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:21.667
If I spot any of your people, this entire deal is off.

102
00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:24.267
Even if you were to force this software away from me,

103
00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:25.667
keep in mind that doing so may throw the method

104
00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.967
of using this software into the pits of darkness forever.

105
00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:33.967
You're sure a cautious fellow, just like rumor has it.

106
00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:35.667
Okay. Four hours from now,

107
00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:37.567
in front of locker number 0032

108
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:39.967
at the basement of Kenbashi Station.

109
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:42.967
-Don't be late. -Yes.

110
00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:49.167
All right, I got them.

111
00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:50.967
Hey, just what do you intend to do?

112
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:53.067
Don't tell me that you're going to listen to them

113
00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.867
and take that software over?

114
00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:58.167
I'm not listening to them.

115
00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:00.967
I lead the conversation so that the handover time of the software

116
00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.367
would be rushed to 4 this morning,

117
00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:05.667
by sounding flustered.

118
00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:07.767
What?

119
00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:10.967
The news of Mr. Itakura's death

120
00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:12.967
may be aired when morning comes, right?

121
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:14.867
If they find out,

122
00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:18.067
this deal as well as clues about them will go down the drain.

123
00:07:18.067 --> 00:07:19.867
Now, the jewelry robber who is at large...

124
00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:21.367
Fortunately, it seems

125
00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.067
that none of the news stations are covering news about his case yet.

126
00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:26.867
Which means this is what you intended to do, to begin with?

127
00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:30.167
Yes, I was planning to tell them

128
00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:32.467
to rush the hand over time to an earlier time

129
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:34.767
when I receive the e-mail from them.

130
00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:39.067
So, let's erase all traces of us having been here

131
00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:42.167
and get out of here with your beetle.

132
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.067
Out of here?

133
00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:48.467
They may be watching us from somewhere around this villa, right?

134
00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:51.067
If we carelessly go out just like that to the car that's parked outside,

135
00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:54.167
they may spot us.

136
00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:55.867
Don't worry.

137
00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:59.267
If Vodka or any of his people were around,

138
00:07:59.267 --> 00:08:00.967
they would've easily seen through my lie

139
00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:02.267
that I couldn't use the computer

140
00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:04.867
because the circuit was cut off by the blizzard.

141
00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:06.767
I see.

142
00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:09.867
That's why you asked me to turn on the lights to this villa?

143
00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:11.067
Yes.

144
00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:14.367
We know at the least that none of his people is at a distance

145
00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:17.767
where they can see the lights of the villa.

146
00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:20.467
They probably tracked this place,

147
00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.267
using some alarm system that would warn them

148
00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:25.367
and specify the computer of the one they're sending the mail to,

149
00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:27.067
just in case the mail that they sent

150
00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:29.567
isn't opened by the receiver of the mail.

151
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:32.767
Either way, part of the members of the group will be arrested.

152
00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:35.267
I'll confirm the contents of this software

153
00:08:35.267 --> 00:08:38.167
with the laptop computer in the beetle,

154
00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:40.567
and if it's some outrageous software

155
00:08:40.567 --> 00:08:43.167
that could be used for a hideous crime or something.

156
00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.867
You're going to report it to the police,

157
00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:46.767
and specify the place of the deal,

158
00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:51.467
so they can ambush the culprits and arrest whoever shows up, right?

159
00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:52.867
Yes.

160
00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:57.867
Darn. No good.

161
00:08:57.867 --> 00:09:01.267
We need to enter a password for this software, too.

162
00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:02.667
Just like the e-mail,

163
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:07.167
a password is been set between Mr. Itakura and those guys.

164
00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:09.767
Then, just make a copy of it for now.

165
00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:11.267
I can't do that either.

166
00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:14.467
It's protected with a copy guard.

167
00:09:14.467 --> 00:09:17.267
Under this condition, the police won't move.

168
00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:21.567
Aren't they always secretly armed with guns?

169
00:09:21.567 --> 00:09:24.267
If you report that there will be a deal involving guns,

170
00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:26.567
maybe at least two or three officers will come.

171
00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.767
We don't even know how many those guys have on their side.

172
00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:30.967
So, with only a small number on our side,

173
00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:33.467
we're more likely to be biting off our heads.

174
00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:35.567
Unless we find out what their purpose is,

175
00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:38.067
and present evidence to the police as to how dangerous they are,

176
00:09:38.067 --> 00:09:39.867
as well as how large their organization is,

177
00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:42.767
and have the police come equipped with sufficient men,

178
00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:44.467
it'll be difficult to lay our hands on them.

179
00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:48.467
How frustrating.

180
00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:50.167
We know that they're coming

181
00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:51.867
and yet we can't do a thing about it.

182
00:09:51.867 --> 00:09:54.467
Not really. There's still one way.

183
00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:58.467
It's a bit dangerous, though.

184
00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:01.867
Hey, don't tell me that you're planning to meet them directly?

185
00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:05.267
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

186
00:10:05.267 --> 00:10:06.867
Don't tell me that...

187
00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:08.667
Yes, you're most probably right.

188
00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:14.467
It's a flat after all.

189
00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:17.367
We've got to call a nearby service station

190
00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.567
and have them bring us over a spare tire.

191
00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:22.167
Is it going to work?

192
00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:23.867
I don't think there's any service station

193
00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:25.867
that'll come at this time of night.

194
00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:29.567
Well, we may as well relax and wait in the car then.

195
00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:33.567
We won't make it in time for meeting those guys if we do that!

196
00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.767
I'm sure that this is God's way of telling you

197
00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:38.567
to keep from taking dangerous action, Shinichi.

198
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.867
Darn.

199
00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:46.567
A car?

200
00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:50.767
Hey!

201
00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:56.267
What's up?

202
00:10:56.267 --> 00:11:00.067
Oh, well. We got a flat.

203
00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:02.667
We want to go back to Tokyo,

204
00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.467
but won't you give us a lift?

205
00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:05.967
Tokyo?

206
00:11:05.967 --> 00:11:08.267
What do you say?

207
00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:11.467
Why not? We're going in that direction anyway.

208
00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:14.167
Gramps, are you familiar with the roads around here?

209
00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:15.967
Well, yes, sort of.

210
00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.767
Okay, you get in the front seat, gramps.

211
00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:19.567
And the kid in the backseat.

212
00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:21.367
Thanks.

213
00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:31.567
I'm sorry to intrude on you when you were sleeping, miss.

214
00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:35.367
It's okay, I was just kind of dozing.

215
00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:47.667
Cool! This is a foreign car, isn't it?

216
00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:50.067
Is this car yours, sir?

217
00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:52.267
Yes, I've gotten tired of it

218
00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:55.267
and was just thinking of getting myself another car, though.

219
00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:58.167
You must be rich,

220
00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:00.567
because this car is really expensive.

221
00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:01.967
Sort of.

222
00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:03.467
Although he may not look it,

223
00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:05.867
he's the heir to a big company, you know.

224
00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:12.967
Goodness!

225
00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:21.267
That sure was close.

226
00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:23.767
Snowy roads are dangerous after all.

227
00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:26.867
Well, let's not rush and drive safely.

228
00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:33.567
Hey, didn't you hear something funny just now?

229
00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:36.967
Really? I didn't hear anything.

230
00:12:36.967 --> 00:12:40.467
The stuff that we have in the trunk probably moved.

231
00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:42.667
It's nothing to sweat about.

232
00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:45.167
Hey, don't smoke!

233
00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:48.767
Did you forget that I hate cigarettes?

234
00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.467
Oh, sorry. That's right.

235
00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:55.967
Oh, to go to Tokyo turn left there.

236
00:12:55.967 --> 00:12:57.567
All right.

237
00:12:57.567 --> 00:12:58.767
It's stopped snowing

238
00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:01.267
so I guess we can get there before 3 am.

239
00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:07.767
But why were you guys in Gunma?

240
00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:10.167
Were you skiing with your grandson?

241
00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:12.267
I guess you could say so.

242
00:13:12.267 --> 00:13:13.667
Sounds great.

243
00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:25.267
Hey. Watch where you're going.

244
00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:26.767
Sorry, sorry.

245
00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:29.767
I shouldn't have driven in the snow after all.

246
00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:39.567
Strange.

247
00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:42.867
There's something fishy about them.

248
00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:45.067
Don't tell me that...

249
00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:48.767
Don't tell me that they're...

250
00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:04.689
What's with you anyway?

251
00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:08.489
How many times do you think you got honked at already?

252
00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:12.389
Didn't I tell you that I'm not good at driving on snowy roads?

253
00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:17.789
You're right! This car needs a tune-up

254
00:14:17.789 --> 00:14:18.989
and hasn't got its safety check yet,

255
00:14:18.989 --> 00:14:21.089
so you've got to drive more carefully!

256
00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:25.689
You're going to get a safety check for this car soon, aren't you?

257
00:14:25.689 --> 00:14:28.989
Yes, I guess so.

258
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:32.389
You don't remember?

259
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:36.989
The number 2 is written on the sticker on the windshield.

260
00:14:37.989 --> 00:14:41.189
That's the inspection certificate

261
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:42.689
and depending on the number and the color of the sticker.

262
00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:43.689
It tells you

263
00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:46.289
when you're supposed to be getting your next safety check, right?

264
00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:49.589
The color is this year's color,

265
00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:51.589
so it's obvious that you have to get your safety check

266
00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:53.489
by February this year.

267
00:14:53.489 --> 00:14:55.789
Oh, that's right. I remember now.

268
00:14:55.789 --> 00:14:58.089
Come to think of it, I got a postcard saying

269
00:14:58.089 --> 00:15:00.189
for me to go get my safety check within this month.

270
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:02.189
But, sonny, when did you see it?

271
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:04.689
The sticker was covered with snow.

272
00:15:04.689 --> 00:15:09.289
See. I saw it when the on-coming car passed us.

273
00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:11.489
When the headlights shined on it,

274
00:15:11.489 --> 00:15:14.089
the number outside could be seen transparent from the back.

275
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:24.189
Oh, I see! I thought it was "2"

276
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:27.689
because I saw it transparent from behind but it was actually "5"!

277
00:15:27.689 --> 00:15:29.289
But, that's strange.

278
00:15:29.289 --> 00:15:31.289
You got a postcard saying that you

279
00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:33.889
had to go get a safety check within the month of February, right?

280
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.589
I wonder why?

281
00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:38.889
Oh, well, you see... That's...

282
00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:41.289
Didn't I just tell you a while ago,

283
00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:43.689
that he's a Richie Rich, sonny?

284
00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:46.389
That's why he leaves all the details up to others to do it for him.

285
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:48.189
He answered you casually but the thing is,

286
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:51.089
he's not even bothered about the date of the safety check.

287
00:15:52.489 --> 00:15:54.389
You've got to turn right over there,

288
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:56.789
or we won't make it to Tokyo.

289
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:03.989
Gosh. The kid keeps blabbing on, so...

290
00:16:03.989 --> 00:16:07.989
I'm sorry, he's such a curious child.

291
00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:10.789
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

292
00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:12.189
Okay, there.

293
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:19.289
By the way,

294
00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:21.489
what are you listening to, sonny?

295
00:16:21.489 --> 00:16:22.989
Oh, this?

296
00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:25.689
I'm listening to the news.

297
00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:26.989
News?

298
00:16:26.989 --> 00:16:29.989
Yes. There are all kinds of news.

299
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:35.589
About economy picking up and the new coach of Big Osaka.

300
00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:39.389
Or about the jewelry robber who is on the run.

301
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:43.189
You're still so little, yet you like news.

302
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:44.889
Yes.

303
00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:48.989
And? Was the robber caught?

304
00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:50.489
No.

305
00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:53.589
They're still escaping somewhere in the Gunma area.

306
00:16:53.589 --> 00:16:55.789
But I'm sure they'll be arrested soon.

307
00:16:55.789 --> 00:16:56.789
Because... Look.

308
00:16:56.789 --> 00:16:58.189
They seem to have checkpoints here there

309
00:16:58.189 --> 00:17:00.389
and everywhere like over there.

310
00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:11.989
License, please.

311
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.289
Yes.

312
00:17:14.389 --> 00:17:17.689
Excuse me, but where did you come from?

313
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:19.689
Well...

314
00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:22.389
Officer Yamamura!

315
00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.689
You're... you're Conan if I remember correctly.

316
00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:28.489
Officer Yamamura, this is a checkpoint

317
00:17:28.489 --> 00:17:31.989
to arrest the jewelry shop robbers, right?

318
00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:33.589
Yes.

319
00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:37.289
There are a group of three wearing baseball caps.

320
00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.989
After robbing a jewelry shop in Gunma,

321
00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:44.389
they abandoned the car they made their getaway with in the mountains

322
00:17:44.389 --> 00:17:46.389
and vanished.

323
00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:51.189
But one of the three is hurt,

324
00:17:51.189 --> 00:17:54.189
so I don't think they got too far away yet.

325
00:17:54.189 --> 00:17:55.589
Hurt?

326
00:17:55.589 --> 00:17:56.989
Right.

327
00:17:56.989 --> 00:17:58.489
When we got the report,

328
00:17:58.489 --> 00:18:02.389
I just happened to be nearby doing some questioning.

329
00:18:02.389 --> 00:18:03.489
When I got to the scene of the crime,

330
00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:05.589
I happened to run into the robbers

331
00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:08.089
who fled out of the shop.

332
00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:11.889
So I pulled out my gun and said,

333
00:18:11.889 --> 00:18:15.789
"Freeze. Freeze or I'll shoot".

334
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:17.989
Cool!

335
00:18:17.989 --> 00:18:20.889
But the robbers refused to stop

336
00:18:20.889 --> 00:18:23.089
so I fired a warning shot towards them.

337
00:18:23.089 --> 00:18:24.089
Hey.

338
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:29.989
And, I hit one of the robbers in the thigh!

339
00:18:32.489 --> 00:18:33.689
Well, anyway,

340
00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:38.389
either they had another car stashed away in the mountains beforehand,

341
00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:40.889
or they stole a car that coincidentally passed through

342
00:18:40.889 --> 00:18:43.489
and are on the run.

343
00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.989
Didn't you see some suspicious-looking people?

344
00:18:45.989 --> 00:18:47.989
Yes, I did.

345
00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:50.689
You mean people who are riding in a car that is not theirs, right?

346
00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:54.589
That's us!

347
00:18:55.589 --> 00:18:58.989
My car tire went flat in the mountains,

348
00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:02.189
so we had them give us a lift.

349
00:19:02.189 --> 00:19:04.889
Right.

350
00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:08.089
Dr. Agasa, where is your car, then?

351
00:19:08.089 --> 00:19:10.089
I called the car dealer

352
00:19:10.089 --> 00:19:11.989
and they said they'd come get it in the morning,

353
00:19:11.989 --> 00:19:15.089
so I left it in the mountains with the key inside.

354
00:19:15.089 --> 00:19:17.889
Then, isn't your car in trouble?

355
00:19:18.989 --> 00:19:20.989
Maybe the robbers got a hold of it

356
00:19:20.989 --> 00:19:22.989
and are riding it around.

357
00:19:22.989 --> 00:19:25.589
That's possible.

358
00:19:25.589 --> 00:19:27.889
Then, maybe you shouldn't be bothering with us

359
00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:31.189
and keeping watch over that car.

360
00:19:31.189 --> 00:19:34.389
It's a yellow beetle, so it's easy to spot.

361
00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:39.489
How strange. Your voices sound familiar.

362
00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:40.689
I don't think so.

363
00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:44.089
So, may we go now, officer?

364
00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:51.589
Will you take that jacket you have over your lap, just in case?

365
00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:55.089
Hey! Don't tell me you suspect us?

366
00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:58.489
See, I haven't been shot or anything!

367
00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.389
I guess not.

368
00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:02.189
Be careful, then.

369
00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:18.289
Hello? This is the Agasa residence.

370
00:20:19.889 --> 00:20:21.489
The Gunma Prefectural police?

371
00:20:21.489 --> 00:20:25.289
According to Dr. Agasa, he said that the dealers

372
00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:27.789
would be picking his car up in the morning.

373
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:30.289
But, leaving the car as is in the mountains

374
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:33.789
may give the robbers a chance to use it,

375
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:38.089
so we have decided to tow it away for now.

376
00:20:38.089 --> 00:20:43.889
So, please tell him to come and pick his car up at the station.

377
00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:44.989
Yes, I will.

378
00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:47.189
Goodbye, then.

379
00:20:47.189 --> 00:20:48.489
Thank you.

380
00:20:50.089 --> 00:20:53.889
I wonder what they're doing in Gunma at this time of day?

381
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:57.889
I'll bet he was talked into by Shinichi again

382
00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:00.889
and went sticking their noses into a criminal case or something.

383
00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:03.389
Seriously.

384
00:21:03.389 --> 00:21:04.489
I don't see what thrill they find in

385
00:21:04.489 --> 00:21:06.189
looking for faults in others at the cost of losing sleep.

386
00:21:06.189 --> 00:21:09.189
I see no fun at all in playing detective.

387
00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:21.689
A spare pair of pursuit glasses.

388
00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:36.889
Yes, we're going to pick up the stuff earlier than scheduled.

389
00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:39.689
An hour from now, at 4 am.

390
00:21:39.689 --> 00:21:41.289
The place remains unchanged.

391
00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:44.389
It's in front of the locker in the basement of Kenbashi Subway Station.

392
00:21:44.389 --> 00:21:47.289
Tell Gin about this too, will you?

393
00:21:48.889 --> 00:21:50.889
Yes, of course.

394
00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:55.089
Get the men ready armed with guns.

395
00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:59.089
He could've gone chicken and called the cops.

396
00:21:59.089 --> 00:22:03.589
Either way, after the deal, it's good riddance with him anyway.

397
00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:04.989
We were planning to get rid of him

398
00:22:04.989 --> 00:22:07.789
inside Kenbashi Station to begin with.

399
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:46.589
"Next Episode" -It's almost time.

400
00:23:46.589 --> 00:23:48.589
Is everyone in position?

401
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:52.689
Don't let one mouse get through.

402
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:59.189
Which means...

403
00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:04.089
Yes. He should still be hiding somewhere nearby.

404
00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:09.389
Next Conan,

405
00:24:09.389 --> 00:24:13.489
"Contact with the Black Organization (Desperate Battle Edition)"

406
00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:16.616
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:16.616 --> 00:24:18.516
