1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,700
A 60-minute Detective Conan Special!

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000
Today's case is a bit startling!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,840
An impossible and illogical murder
in a secluded mountain temple!

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,500
The eerie legend of the Kiri Tengu...

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,220
No matter how it's hidden,
there's always only one truth!

6
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:33,585
The Legendary Kiri Tengu Murders

7
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,495
Mountain cherry blossoms
are so pretty!

8
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,495
Look, there are some
on that mountain too!

9
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:45,205
The Someiyoshi cherry blossoms
they have in the city aren't bad,

10
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:50,535
but the cherry blossom's true beauty
is only found here in the wild,

11
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,085
secluded away from civilization.

12
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,325
What a wet blanket...

13
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,675
You say something?!

14
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,935
It was worth renting a car and
coming all the way here, huh?!

15
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:04,205
For sure.

16
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,495
What do you say we take a picture?

17
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:08,145
Here, you two stand over there!

18
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:09,915
Let's go, Conan-kun!

19
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:10,605
Yeah!

20
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,485
Use the timer so
you can get in the picture too!

21
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:18,945
Sure! Just a sec!

22
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:21,155
My name is Conan Edogawa.

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,705
This is the would-be famous
detective, Kogoro Mori.

24
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:28,705
And this is my childhood
friend and classmate, Ran Mori.

25
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:31,565
Eh? How can she be my classmate?

26
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:37,295
The truth is, I'm actually high
school detective Shinichi Kudo.

27
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:40,675
Yes. It all began on that day...

28
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,885
I went to Tropical Land with Ran,

29
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:47,555
and there I witnessed a mysterious
organization blackmailing someone.

30
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,435
I watched Vodka,
a man dressed in black,

31
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:57,455
while Gin, another man
in black, snuck up behind me.

32
00:02:57,455 --> 00:02:59,195
I was knocked to the ground

33
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:02,995
and forced to take a poison
the organization had developed.

34
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:15,095
M-My body's burning up!

35
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,995
It's like my bones are melting!

36
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,655
I can't hold on!

37
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,895
When a police officer woke me up--

38
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:31,225
my body had shrunk!

39
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,875
So all we need to
do is find those guys

40
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,315
and get some of those pills!

41
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,955
Listen, Shinichi!

42
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,745
If they find out you're still alive,

43
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,195
they'll come back to
take care of you for good!

44
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,125
This must stay a secret
between just the two of us!

45
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,875
You mustn't tell anyone at all!

46
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,995
That means not even Ran-kun!

47
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,665
This old man is Professor
Agasa, an inventor.

48
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:57,335
In my shrunken state,
I became Conan Edogawa

49
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:00,755
and wound up living with
Ran and her detective father,

50
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:04,015
in the hopes of obtaining
information about the men in black.

51
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,185
But he's a horrible detective,

52
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:12,975
so I used the Professor's Anesthetic
Watch Gun to put him to sleep

53
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:16,855
and my Voice-Altering Bow Tie
to solve all sorts of difficult cases.

54
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:23,195
And that's my life as Conan so far.

55
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,495
When will I be able
to turn back to normal?

56
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:30,455
Oh well. It'll happen when it happens!

57
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,245
Cheese!

58
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,505
Well, we should head back.

59
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,715
It looks like there's a shortcut
up ahead, so let's take it.

60
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,955
Are you sure about this, Dad?
We're not going to get lost, are we?

61
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,825
We'll be fine, don't worry!

62
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,245
Let's get going.

63
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:57,395
See, I told you!

64
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,535
Now we're not only lost,
but we have a flat tire too!

65
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:03,705
Our fun trip's ruined now!

66
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,745
Shut up!

67
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,365
Just what we need-- rain.

68
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:10,825
What now?!

69
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,495
It's twenty or thirty kilometers to
the bottom of the mountain!

70
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,205
We have no other choice.

71
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:18,325
It doesn't look like
anyone lives around here,

72
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,215
so we'll have to spend
the night in the car.

73
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:24,205
I don't want to camp out
in a place like this!

74
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,305
Can't you fix the flat tire?!

75
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,625
No spare.

76
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,265
Two flat tires in one day--
talk about bad luck...

77
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,575
Huh? Where'd he go?

78
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,225
Eh?

79
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,325
Conan-kun?

80
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,065
Where are you, Conan-kun?

81
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,415
What're you so worked up about?

82
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,415
It was just a bird.

83
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,575
What is it, Ran?
What was that scream?

84
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,325
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:59,455
Anyway, where were you?!

86
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,545
You shouldn't wander
off on your own like that!

87
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:04,955
I found a temple up ahead.

88
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:06,795
I bet someone lives there!

89
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:19,035
You're right,
there is a temple there.

90
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,525
We're saved!

91
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,245
Okay! Let's go check it out!

92
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:23,855
Yeah!

93
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:31,035
That's a really impressive place.

94
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,825
Sandei Temple...

95
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:39,125
It looks like our only option is
to ask to stay the night...

96
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:43,715
Hello? Pardon the intrusion!

97
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:45,565
Is anyone here?

98
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:48,845
What do you want?

99
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,345
I asked you what you want here!

100
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:01,395
I take it you're from a
newspaper or television station?

101
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:02,955
Leave!

102
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,025
This place is not meant for
uncouth vermin such as yourselves!

103
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:10,535
No, we were just passing by
when we got a flat tire.

104
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:14,205
We were wondering if we could
stay here for the night...

105
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:17,625
What? You want to stay here?!

106
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,205
Yes...

107
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,955
But if that's a problem,
we'll leave right away--

108
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:27,165
Oh! Why didn't you say so sooner?!

109
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:30,925
I had you pegged as reporters
who came here about the incident...

110
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:33,385
"The incident"?

111
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,125
Oh, nothing of importance.

112
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:40,825
One night plus vegetarian
meals is 10,000 yen per adult

113
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,745
and 8,000 yen per child.

114
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:46,735
This temple also
serves as a small inn...

115
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,825
10,000 yen?!

116
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:50,625
Take it or leave it.

117
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,875
It's six hours to the
bottom of the mountain.

118
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,785
Walk if you'd like.

119
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:57,205
I haven't said no yet...

120
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:57,915
I see.

121
00:07:57,915 --> 00:08:01,375
Hey, we have our
first guests in a long time!

122
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:02,955
Wait!

123
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:05,255
I haven't said yes yet, either...

124
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:09,375
Take my advice. Stay the night.

125
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,375
On rainy nights such as tonight,

126
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,215
there's no way to know
where it may be lurking...

127
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,705
"It"?

128
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,185
Is there a bear out there?

129
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,535
A bear?

130
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:22,395
It's not nearly as
adorable, I'm afraid...

131
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:26,895
No, I refer to an ancient beast
that prefers rain and darkness

132
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,295
and devours people's souls...

133
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,325
The Kiri Tengu!

134
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:34,325
The Kiri Tengu?!

135
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,455
What am I thinking?!
That name is taboo here!

136
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,495
Forget what I just said!

137
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:46,455
Huh?

138
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:50,045
Oh, here you are.

139
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:56,015
Allow me to introduce you to the
four priests-in-training at this temple.

140
00:08:56,015 --> 00:09:03,245
This is Kannen. He has been here the longest
and is like an older brother to the others.

141
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,225
Pleased to meet you!

142
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:09,195
This is Tonnen. He may eat a lot,
but he's a great cook and strong, too.

143
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:14,495
This is Mokunen. We leave all the carpentry
work to him and his dexterous fingers.

144
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,655
It's nice to meet you!

145
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,825
This here is Shunen.
He came to our temple just this year

146
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,325
and although he's a bit timid,
his passion for studying is unrivaled.

147
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,125
Hello.

148
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:28,045
And I'm Tenei--
the head priest of this temple.

149
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:32,125
Tonnen and Mokunen,
prepare our dinner.

150
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:37,185
Kannen and Shunen,
show our guests around the temple.

151
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:37,765
Understood!

152
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:41,165
Looks like we're staying.

153
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,375
Darn it!

154
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,705
With the late fee on the rental
car and the cost to stay here,

155
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:46,975
I won't have any
money for booze this month!

156
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:50,445
This is Sandei Temple's main hall.

157
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,985
It certainly is impressive.

158
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,875
What do you say to having
your own funeral services here?

159
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,575
Just kidding!

160
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,205
Lousy priest...

161
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,035
This way, if you would...

162
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:14,745
Huh? Why does
that room have a lock on it?

163
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,215
Empty...

164
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:21,845
Wait, little boy! That's--

165
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,415
It's just a small room...

166
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,565
Little boy!

167
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,605
That's one tall ceiling!

168
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,485
What is this room?

169
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,445
What is it?

170
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,785
Our meditation room.

171
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:43,375
They used to lock priests in
here who broke religious precepts

172
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,165
to make them
reflect on their mistakes.

173
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:48,205
No wonder it's built so solidly...

174
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:52,335
And they covered the room
with lacquer to prevent climbing out...

175
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:56,705
Say, why does this part
of the wall have a different color?

176
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:02,345
Mokunen-san fixed that after
it was broken during the incident.

177
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:05,995
Isn't that right, Kannen-san?

178
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:07,355
What incident?

179
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,205
It happened before
I came to this temple,

180
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,065
so I don't know the details.

181
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,545
But apparently the Kiri Tengu--

182
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,875
That's enough, Shunen!

183
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,525
Our visitors don't
need to hear about it!

184
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:20,985
Sorry...

185
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:24,075
Huh? What's that sound?

186
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,415
The waterfall.

187
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:27,035
Would you like to see it?

188
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:30,495
It's right next to this room!

189
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,745
Conan-kun! Hurry up!

190
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:35,795
Okay!

191
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:42,055
Wow! The waterfall's so close!

192
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,385
Amazing!

193
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,805
Look! Some of the water's
even flowing over the handrail!

194
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,535
Careful, now.

195
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,705
While there is a drainboard there,

196
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,525
you don't want to slip and fall.

197
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,985
Oh! Cherry blossom petals!

198
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:04,875
Yes. They fall down
from the cherry trees above.

199
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,205
Elegant, isn't it?

200
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:08,205
Let's go back.

201
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,785
Dinner should be ready by now.

202
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:18,375
Priests have an image of being stiff,

203
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,425
but you actually
have lots of time to have fun!

204
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:25,415
Yeah! Sometimes we even
go to the beach during our breaks!

205
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:29,145
We take out the temple's
inflatable boat and beach ball...

206
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:33,325
And the head priest is
quite fond of girls in bikinis!

207
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,105
That's enough.

208
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,285
Say, I've been wondering
about it for a while,

209
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:40,695
but what's the Kiri Tengu?

210
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,445
Where did you hear that name?!

211
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,785
Forgive me. I allowed my
mouth to get ahead of myself.

212
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,165
Head Priest!

213
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:52,995
It's just an absurd old tale.

214
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:57,625
On rainy nights, the ancient
Tengu creeps into the village

215
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,125
and uses its tremendous
strength to smash into houses

216
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,285
and kidnap their inhabitants.

217
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:05,825
It soars to the top of tall trees,

218
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:11,585
hangs the corpses,
and devours their flesh!

219
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:16,725
He kidnaps only young
girls who have tender meat!

220
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:23,125
Yes, girls just like you...

221
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:29,285
But it's just a legend,
don't take it seriously!

222
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,575
You heard him.

223
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:31,665
But...

224
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:35,335
But it's not just a story...

225
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:41,165
There was an eerie incident
just like that, two years ago...

226
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:41,755
Mokunen!

227
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:47,535
Say, why don't you ask them
the details about that incident!

228
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,125
After all, you are
Kogoro Mori, Great Detective!

229
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,475
You might find something out!

230
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:54,805
The great detective?!

231
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:55,895
Mori?!
Mori?!

232
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,355
Kogoro?!
Kogoro?!

233
00:13:57,355 --> 00:13:59,035
You're famous!

234
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,315
Only you could ever solve
that difficult case!

235
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:04,325
Please listen, Detective!

236
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,905
Two years ago, a young priest--

237
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,575
Silence!

238
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:14,535
Have you forgotten our promise to
never speak of that incident again?!

239
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:16,375
But Head Priest!

240
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,375
Dinner is over!

241
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,165
Return to your rooms
and get ready to sleep!

242
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:30,075
Detective.
I will let you stay the night,

243
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:32,825
but I want you to leave the
temple early tomorrow morning.

244
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,055
Don't take it personally.

245
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,765
Okay...

246
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,471
Dad.

247
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:58,261
Tengus aren't real, are they?

248
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,801
Obviously not.

249
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,881
Do you really think
kappa and oni really exist?

250
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:09,731
Tengus are the same--
imaginary creatures invented by people.

251
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:11,421
I guess you're right...

252
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:13,221
Actually, the ancient Chinese

253
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:16,941
referred to shooting stars that
made loud, thunder-like sounds

254
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:23,091
as "Heavenly Dogs,"
or Tengu, thus the name.

255
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:27,881
In China, such shooting stars
were considered unlucky omens.

256
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,671
Those beliefs came to Japan,

257
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:36,631
and Tengus changed from strange
phenomenon to strange monsters!

258
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:41,551
For a little runt you sure
know lots of weird things.

259
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:46,341
I, uh, saw it on a
TV show the other day...

260
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:51,341
So there's nothing to be afraid of, Ran!

261
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:56,761
Don't be silly,
I'm not afraid of anything!

262
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:57,941
Well, let's get some sleep.

263
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:05,841
Conan-kun.

264
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,081
If you get scared during the night,
you can come sleep with me!

265
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,291
Nighty night!

266
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:14,211
Hey, now.

267
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,551
Listen, Conan-kun.

268
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:20,421
If you get scared during the night,
you can come sleep with me!

269
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:50,661
He kidnaps only young
girls who have tender meat!

270
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:55,001
Yes, girls just like you...

271
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:08,051
Stupid Ran, waking us up in
the middle of the night!

272
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:11,551
What's the big deal?! I can't
help that I'm a scaredy-cat!

273
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:14,221
Hey, what do you
think that incident was?

274
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,511
Heck if I know.

275
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:18,071
He doesn't want to talk about
it, so it's best not to ask.

276
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:22,621
As if the Kiri Tengu
would actually appear...

277
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:23,321
Oh?

278
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:26,321
What is this about me?

279
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,631
See! You're a scaredy-cat too!

280
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:36,551
Ran! Where'd you get that mask?!

281
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,631
It was hanging in the bathroom.

282
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:41,221
Why you...

283
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,091
What happened?!

284
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:45,341
Nothing...

285
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,091
Good night, Kannen-san!

286
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,181
Pleasant dreams!

287
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,511
I shouldn't have brought this!
Now what do I do?

288
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,191
You shouldn't have
put it on in the first place!

289
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,881
Now I'm wide awake.

290
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:09,341
Breakfast is ready.

291
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:10,781
Okay! We'll be there soon!

292
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,711
You look pretty tired, Shunen-san...

293
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:20,051
Yes. I was up late last night reading...

294
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:22,341
Please excuse me.

295
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:31,141
You didn't get much
sleep either, Mokunen-san?

296
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,221
No thanks to your screaming!

297
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,881
I couldn't get any sleep after that!

298
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:37,981
Sorry...

299
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:43,591
But that's nothing compared
to Tonnen, he hasn't slept at all.

300
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,411
Where are the head
priest and Kannen-san?

301
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:54,471
We haven't seen the head priest,
so Kannen went to look for him...

302
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:57,051
He's probably in a room
somewhere downing some sake--

303
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:03,551
That was Kannen's voice!

304
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,261
It sounded like it came
from the meditation room!

305
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,341
What is it?!

306
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:13,561
Up there!

307
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:19,691
Head Priest Tenei!

308
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:31,261
The victim was this
temple's head priest, Tenei.

309
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:35,551
He died approximately between
10:00 pm and 12:00 am last night.

310
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,011
And you were the
one who found his body.

311
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:41,381
Correct, Kannen-san?

312
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,971
Yes.

313
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:46,971
We didn't see him this morning,
so I went to look for him.

314
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:50,511
And then I found him
in this meditation room...

315
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,761
And by yet another
strange coincidence,

316
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:56,561
the person who rushed
here after the scream was--

317
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:00,631
I, Kogoro Mori, Inspector Megure!

318
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:06,801
But that was one extraordinary
scream, Kannen-san!

319
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,531
Not nearly as extraordinary as yours!

320
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:12,671
You have really keen senses,
don't you, Kannen-san?

321
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,541
After all, the head priest
was hanging all the way up there.

322
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:21,001
If it were me, I probably wouldn't
have seen him right away...

323
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,341
That is strange, Kannen-san.

324
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,841
You didn't happen to already know

325
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,931
that he was hanging
from the roof, did you?

326
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:36,511
Nothing of the sort! I just--

327
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,881
It was only natural for him to find it.

328
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,021
Mokunen...

329
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:44,981
The exact same thing happened
in this room two years ago...

330
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,051
Two years ago?!

331
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:49,941
Yes. I was in charge of that case too.

332
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,861
I believe the one who died was
a priest-in-training named Chunen.

333
00:20:54,551 --> 00:21:00,721
And it was Kannen-san and
Mokunen-san who found the body, right?

334
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,331
Yes.

335
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:06,301
It happened during
the rainy season...

336
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:10,221
After coming into
this room to meditate,

337
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,971
Chunen tore a big hole
in the wall and disappeared.

338
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,801
We looked for three days
and three nights,

339
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,171
but he was nowhere to be found.

340
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,761
We assumed he had fled the temple,

341
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,431
and on the morning of the 4th day,

342
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:24,141
I came into this room
with Kannen to fix the wall.

343
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:28,321
When we happened to glance upward...

344
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,831
...there was Chunen-san,
hanging from the ceiling!

345
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:43,761
Is this hole the same
place that was broken last time?

346
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,841
Yes.

347
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:49,041
At first, we thought that
Chunen-san made it to escape,

348
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:52,381
but the door to
this room wasn't locked,

349
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:58,591
and a local carpenter
who came to fix the outer wall

350
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:03,601
said it would take an entire day
for a person to make a hole that big!

351
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,171
He said the only
thing that could have done it
