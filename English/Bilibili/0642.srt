1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,740
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,540
"Detective Conan" celebrates

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,140
its seventeenth year of serialization.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,540
So far we have managed to solve numerous tough cases.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,940
This year we shall present even more...

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,640
Suspenseful...

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,940
Actively...

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,840
Powerfully...

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,740
And mysteriously...

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,740
Upgraded contents with your support.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,740
So please continue your support!

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,140
All right, viewers.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,740
I shall enumerate the 108 bagfuls of attributes you will need

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,340
to sail through the entire year.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,540
The first bag being "patience".

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,340
The second, a "sleeping bag"...

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,940
Pops, keep sleeping until the end of the year.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
If all cases were men,

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,140
The cry of a boy who cries wolf.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,040
The code-like secret of karuta cards.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,640
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,152
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 1)"

26
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:45,452
"Mouri Detective Agency"

27
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:50,152
Conan, don't.

28
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,252
Don't move.

29
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:02,252
Wait.

30
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:04,752
It's all right.

31
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,452
Just stay still.

32
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,352
It sure feels like a fever.

33
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:27,252
Did you catch a cold? Your face is all red too.

34
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:31,852
No, my face is red for a different reason.

35
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:32,952
Wait here.

36
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:35,852
I'm going to take your temperature with a thermometer.

37
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,252
I'm fine.

38
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:40,052
It'll completely go away, even if I leave it alone.

39
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:43,352
See, you're coughing.

40
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,252
It really is a cold.

41
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:52,652
You hear me?

42
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,852
Stay put until I'm back, okay?

43
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,252
Yes.

44
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,252
Are you going somewhere?

45
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,652
That's right.

46
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,452
To buy a thermometer since you stepped on it last night

47
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:10,352
and broke it.

48
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:28,252
Geez, to think I'd catch a cold so early in the year...

49
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,552
My precious winter vacation is ruined.

50
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,552
My phone?

51
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:40,752
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya" -It's from Mitsuhiko.

52
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:44,652
A video call at a time like this?

53
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,752
What's wrong, Conan?

54
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,552
We made plans to meet at Ayumi's place

55
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,852
to play karuta cards, didn't we?

56
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,952
We already ate the mochi.

57
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:56,452
Are you still sleeping?

58
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,352
A cold, I have a cold.

59
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,652
Well, I'm only coughing a little,

60
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,752
so it's no big deal.

61
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:05,352
Then, let me see the back of your throat.

62
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,652
I'm going to examine you.

63
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:08,952
Like this?

64
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:14,252
No way, what's going on there?

65
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:16,952
The lateral pharyngeal bonds medical to your palatine tonsils

66
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,352
are inflamed and swollen?

67
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,852
Isn't it an acute upper respiratory tract infection?

68
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:22,952
What?

69
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:24,152
Idiot.

70
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,752
"Acute upper respiratory tract infection"

71
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:27,152
simply means a cold.

72
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,352
And to begin with,

73
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,852
you can't possibly see the back of my throat via a video call.

74
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,052
Bingo.

75
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:33,952
Well, if it's a cold,

76
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:36,452
you'd better warm yourself and rest quietly for today.

77
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,352
In that case, why not go check on him?

78
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:40,852
-You're right. -Let's go visit.

79
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,252
Hey, you guys can't come.

80
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,352
I might pass it to you.

81
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:52,352
Damn, I really do have a fever.

82
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:56,952
Looks like someone's here.

83
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,852
Hey, anybody home?

84
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:07,852
What's wrong?

85
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,452
Bad guys.

86
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,452
Guys I don't know suddenly came to my home.

87
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,352
Hey, Masao.

88
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:18,052
If you don't behave, I'm going to get angry.

89
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,652
Excuse us.

90
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,652
My child loves to play pranks just like my husband.

91
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,152
Well, his tendency to over exaggerate

92
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,052
comes from his mother.

93
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,552
Wrong.

94
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,852
These guys really are people I don't know.

95
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:31,252
It's not a lie.

96
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:35,452
We're truly sorry for the intrusion.

97
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:37,752
Help me!

98
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,252
Cut it out with that "help me".

99
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:41,852
Saying nonsense like that in front of your parents.

100
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:44,352
-Let me go! Let me go! -You really are mommy's child,

101
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,152
-Let me go! -born from my aching belly.

102
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:49,452
And your slanted eyes came from daddy.

103
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:53,352
Who was that kid?

104
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,252
Ayumi, do you know him?

105
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:58,552
I don't, but if their place is on this floor,

106
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,952
then I think he's the child of Urafune,

107
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:04,552
who just moved into Room 2806 recently.

108
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:09,152
Well then, have you already met his dad and mom?

109
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,952
No, because our rooms are far apart.

110
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:16,352
You only socialize with your close neighbors if you live in a condo.

111
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,752
At any rate,

112
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:22,452
he sure looks like an infamous little prankster has moved in.

113
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:23,752
No.

114
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,352
Call the police.

115
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:28,452
I think it's highly possible

116
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:32,452
that he's in some kind of trouble.

117
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,352
-What? -Police?

118
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,052
How do you know such a thing?

119
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:38,852
They weren't even blood-related,

120
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,252
yet they acted like they were his biological parents.

121
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,352
Well then,

122
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,552
call Officer Takagi and have him come.

123
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,152
Hold it.

124
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,852
This is bad.

125
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:02,652
It sure seems to be a real cold.

126
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,252
Should we call the police?

127
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:10,252
Let's call, let's call. Conan said so too.

128
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:15,452
But, how did Conan know those guys weren't his parents?

129
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:19,652
Could it be that Conan is an acquaintance of that child?

130
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:20,852
In that case,

131
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:24,052
he wouldn't refer to him as "the boy just now", would he?

132
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:25,552
The source of his deduction was the voices

133
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:29,152
of those three and their conversations.

134
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:31,252
And the footage of those three captured

135
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:34,352
behind my back by this phone.

136
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:37,852
Can he really be certain that they're not parent and child just that?

137
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,052
He can't, can he?

138
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,652
Perhaps he's talking nonsense

139
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,152
since his cold clouded his judgment.

140
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:48,152
But Conan is a great detective.

141
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:52,952
At any rate,

142
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:55,352
let's go ask the neighbor

143
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:59,452
about the Urafune family who live in Room 2806.

144
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:03,152
Our call to Officer Takagi can wait until after that.

145
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,452
You're right.

146
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:06,552
Let's do that.

147
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:16,152
What? Urafune, of Room 2806?

148
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:20,752
So they're my neighbors who just moved in two days ago.

149
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:23,652
But they haven't dropped by to say hi,

150
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,352
so I don't know them well.

151
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:30,852
I do remember Uemura who lived in Room 2806 before, though.

152
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,952
The prior resident?

153
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:35,552
Yes, it seems he was an employee of Isobe Corporation

154
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:38,052
that was in the news recently.

155
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:41,752
But he said he's moving out because he quit his job

156
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:44,152
and is going to another company.

157
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:46,152
Isobe Corporation?

158
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,452
The treacherous company that's under suspicion of tax evasion.

159
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,552
By "suspicion",

160
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:53,652
it means they're probably doing something bad, right?

161
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:57,352
So were those people just now really bad guys?

162
00:09:57,352 --> 00:10:00,952
But she was talking about the person who lived there before.

163
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,452
It had nothing to do with that Masao just now.

164
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,052
Masao?

165
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:09,552
You mean the boy about your age with slanted eyes and glasses?

166
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,552
Yes.

167
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:12,452
If it's that kid, I know him.

168
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,352
So you mean only Masao came by to say hi?

169
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,952
What a courteous child.

170
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:21,452
Courteous? Far from it.

171
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:25,052
Yesterday, when I returned from shopping

172
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,552
and was about to ride the elevator,

173
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:30,152
that child came out and said...

174
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:34,752
Miss, you have so many things.

175
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:37,752
What floor? I'll press it for you.

176
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:39,952
Twenty-eighth, please.

177
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,252
You're really helpful.

178
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:44,652
If it's the 28th floor, it's the same as my place.

179
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:47,152
Oh, is that so?

180
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,552
Could it be you're with the family who moved in yesterday?

181
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,352
Yes. I'm Masao Urafune.

182
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,652
Nice to meet you.

183
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:56,552
Isn't he a great kid?

184
00:10:56,552 --> 00:11:01,052
Right. If only the elevator didn't stop at every floor.

185
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,152
What?

186
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:06,552
I see. He pressed all the floor buttons and fled.

187
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:08,252
Indeed. What's more,

188
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,352
he purposely left out the 28th floor.

189
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:11,852
Really now?

190
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:15,052
We just saw Masao taken away

191
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:17,952
by people he claimed weren't his parents.

192
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:21,152
If that kid said they weren't his parents?

193
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:23,252
They must truly be his parents, no?

194
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,352
What?

195
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:33,452
You want to know about the Urafune's who moved in next door?

196
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:34,952
Beats me...

197
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:37,952
I'm not the type of person who socializes with neighbors.

198
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:42,452
Then, did you see anyone weird around the condo?

199
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,552
I can't say he's weird,

200
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:49,452
but I saw this Hida guy, a producer at Nichiuri TV.

201
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:52,952
That guy's on TV sometimes.

202
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,652
Come to think of it,

203
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:59,252
I did see that producer entering Room 2806.

204
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,752
Was this some kind of a case?

205
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,052
No way.

206
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:06,052
When did it happen?

207
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,552
It was about two weeks ago.

208
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,352
It has nothing to do with Masao,

209
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,652
if it's two weeks ago.

210
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:16,452
I was pretty intrigued by it,

211
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:20,352
so I asked the boy with slanted eyes

212
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:23,452
who came out of Room 2806 yesterday around noon.

213
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,252
I asked him,

214
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,352
"The producer from Nichiuri TV went to your home the other day,

215
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:29,852
so what happened?"

216
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,952
Wasn't he Masao?

217
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,852
Was the kid wearing glasses?

218
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,052
Yes.

219
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:39,252
And, what did the kid say?

220
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:40,952
He said...

221
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:43,452
It's about a program airing Saturday nights on Nichiuri TV called

222
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:46,752
"Sudden Visit Dinner Time Next Door".

223
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:49,852
I heard that they're making a sudden visit to your place tonight.

224
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,952
Really now?

225
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:55,252
That's what he said, so...

226
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,552
My wife and I cleaned our place in a big hurry

227
00:12:57,552 --> 00:12:59,752
and even prepared a feast,

228
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:03,052
but no one came no matter how long we waited.

229
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:07,752
We didn't realize the kid was lying

230
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:11,352
until after 8 pm when the live show ended.

231
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:14,652
I was so embarrassed since I even called my friends

232
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,852
to watch me on the show.

233
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:21,852
So you guys are that kid's friends?

234
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,252
-No. -Just leave already.

235
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:26,752
I won't be fooled again!

236
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:32,252
-What a wolf crier he was. -Yes.

237
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:35,152
Then, what he said earlier must be a lie too.

238
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:39,652
Is that so? Understood.

239
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,652
Ai, who were you calling?

240
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,652
Nichiuri TV.

241
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:48,252
I thought they may have something to do with this.

242
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:50,852
But I couldn't get a hold of that producer.

243
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:54,952
Well, producers at the TV stations are all pretty busy.

244
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:59,252
No. They said he had a traffic accident two weeks ago,

245
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,852
and was unconscious until yesterday.

246
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,252
Traffic accident?

247
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:08,352
Could it be that there's some sort of secret in Room 2806,

248
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:11,452
and somebody assaulted him because he knew about it?

249
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,252
Under the guise of a traffic accident.

250
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,552
Then, maybe Masao also found out about the secret...

251
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:19,352
But that kid kept crying wolf, didn't he?

252
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:23,952
However, despise the wolf crier telling the truth in the end,

253
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:27,652
he was eaten by the wolf because no one believed him, right?

254
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,852
That's true,

255
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,852
but we don't know whether he's telling the truth or not.

256
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,752
But Conan told us to call the police.

257
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:38,152
In that case, we have no other options,

258
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,852
but to confirm it directly.

259
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:41,752
Directly?

260
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:47,752
Indeed. By letting ourselves in the Room 2806.

261
00:14:49,352 --> 00:14:52,752
"Urafune"

262
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:58,952
Oh, shoot. It's the children from before.

263
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,652
Why?

264
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:03,652
Because this kid said those things.

265
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,552
It can't be helped, let them in.

266
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:13,252
In exchange, if you try anything funny...

267
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,252
You understand, right?

268
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:24,152
What will happen to your mother?

269
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,699
"Mouri Detective Agency"

270
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,699
37.8��C?

271
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,299
Your fever isn't going away.

272
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:52,199
Idiot, how could a fever go away in a mere hour?

273
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,899
You already gave the brat medicine, so just leave him alone.

274
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,099
And fix me some lunch.

275
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,199
Then, Conan, I'll make you some Japanese porridge.

276
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,999
Can I ask you something...

277
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,399
Did Mitsuhiko or the others call?

278
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,799
No, they didn't.

279
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,399
Did you make plans with them?

280
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,799
I... I made plans to play karuta cards with them.

281
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,899
Well, you'll have to pass that up today.

282
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,299
I'll bring you some delicious porridge right now.

283
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,499
Well, I guess they didn't call back

284
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,599
because they don't want to disturb knowing I have a cold.

285
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,499
And this case can be easily resolved once they call the police.

286
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,099
It can't be that they're trying something risky

287
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,999
like entering the place where the weird folks

288
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,299
claiming to be his real parents are.

289
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,599
Haibara would never allow it, would she?

290
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,399
Maybe no one's home?

291
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,199
Like Conan said, it'd be best if we called Officer Takagi.

292
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,599
But if he's wrong, we're the ones that'll get scolded.

293
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,399
Well, if it isn't the children from earlier.

294
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,799
What's wrong?

295
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,299
Is Masao here?

296
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,599
Could it be that my child...

297
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,599
These guys really are people I don't know.

298
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,699
Said things like that earlier and made you feel uneasy?

299
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,999
Hey, you need to apologize.

300
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,399
These children took you seriously, see?

301
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,899
I am sorry for telling a lie.

302
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,899
Well, it seems my child is sorry about lying.

303
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:32,799
Please forgive him.

304
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,899
Well, good-bye until next time.

305
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:42,899
Hold on.

306
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,999
We actually want to play with Masao,

307
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,499
do you mind?

308
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,099
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,099
My child and I will be going out this evening.

310
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,999
Then, how about karuta-grabbing?

311
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,999
I happened to bring along karuta cards.

312
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,699
If it's karuta, we can play at home.

313
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,399
Let's play together

314
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,299
until it's time for you to head out.

315
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,999
But, my child is not good at karuta.

316
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:08,999
I'm... I'm very good at grabbing karuta cards.

317
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,799
I haven't lost to anyone yet!

318
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,699
Masao.

319
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,199
Then, if you'll excuse us...

320
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,299
Excuse us!

321
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,199
Wait... what are you guys?

322
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,099
Although it's the same condo as my place...

323
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,199
It looks like a completely different room

324
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:30,599
when you have different furniture.

325
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,099
So true.

326
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,299
All right.

327
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,899
Let's play karuta over there.

328
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:40,599
Then, please go home after you've played one round.

329
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,599
All right!

330
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,499
Then let's get ready.

331
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,599
Who has the cards?

332
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,099
Ayumi, right?

333
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,199
Here.

334
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,599
Thanks.

335
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,599
Well, who's reading the proverbs?

336
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,899
There isn't a single trace of the room being ruffled though.

337
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:02,699
So it looks like they didn't come to his home to search for something.

338
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:07,699
However, why did Kudo tell us to call the police?

339
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:11,099
What could he possibly discern from that video call?

340
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:16,099
This door is locked.

341
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,699
Isn't this the restroom?

342
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:22,399
My husband is inside.

343
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:23,999
His stomach has been acting up,

344
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,999
so he's been inside, for a while.

345
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,199
There's another restroom in the back.

346
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,599
Use that one instead.

347
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,999
Yes.

348
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,699
Pops. Sorry, I didn't mean to rush you.

349
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,599
Yes, don't worry about it.

350
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:43,599
If I were to shoo those brats off,

351
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,599
they'd probably go and call the police.

352
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,299
So I'll just be patient

353
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,099
and let them play one round of karuta.

354
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,699
However, if you try to make so much as a peep,

355
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:57,599
instead of grabbing karuta cards, I'll be grabbing your life.

356
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,299
Well, let's move on.

357
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,999
The dog that trots about finds a bone.

358
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,499
Got it.

359
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,499
Ayumi did it again.

360
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,199
That's awesome.

361
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,299
You've grabbed six cards already.

362
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:28,699
Last night I had my parents help me practice.

363
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:32,799
On the other hand, you still have zero cards.

364
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
I just haven't gotten going yet.

365
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,499
Now, let's keep the ball rolling.

366
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:40,299
All right, I'm gonna grab the next one.

367
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:44,899
Haste makes waste.

368
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,699
Yes, this one.

369
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,699
Evidence speaks louder than words.

370
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,099
Add insult to injury.

371
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,299
Got it.

372
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,899
On to the next one.

373
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,099
A hated child thrives better in the world.

374
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,199
I was the first to take this.

375
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,399
Liar, I was faster than you.

376
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,699
No way. I was faster.

377
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,399
Well, why don't you guys sort it out by rock-paper-scissors?

378
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,099
No way. I'll never let you have it.

379
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,499
Because this card "ni" is my card.

380
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,199
You mean, "A hated child thrives better in the world"

381
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,799
is your card?

382
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,199
Since this is Masao's first card,

383
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,899
why don't you let him have it?

384
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,199
Fine.

385
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:07,099
A card he'd never let go...

386
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,299
Is he trying to form a message

387
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,599
with the characters on the karuta cards?

388
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,899
Mommy, restroom.

389
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:50,399
You can't go to the restroom on your own?

390
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:51,799
Take out that towel.

391
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,199
The towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa.

392
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:58,199
I see. So that's what he meant.

393
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:01,199
Hey, if we don't decide on a strategy soon,

394
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,999
they'll be back before we know it.

395
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,999
Whose cell phone is that?

396
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:09,799
Don't tell me...

397
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,099
Next Conan,

398
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,199
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 2)"

399
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,168
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,168
"Horsehair Crab".

401
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,668
Conan, since crabs are hard to eat.

402
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,968
Here, open your mouth.

403
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,968
No, no, I'll eat it myself.
