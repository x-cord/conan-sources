1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,840
Natsuko Shibuya, agent Jodie's friend is attacked by someone,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,540
rendered unconscious and is in critical condition.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,740
Therefore, we rush over to see her.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,340
Three suspects are summoned.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,440
Furthermore...

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,140
It couldn't be helped.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,740
She asked me to solve a stalker problem for her you see.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,440
Bourbon?

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,340
After that, Bourbon and I through our deductions succeeded

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,740
in specifying the perpetrator. However...

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,740
Excuse me!

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,740
The hospital just called.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,840
Ms. Shibuya took a turn for the worse

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,840
and she's in critical condition.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Natsuko?

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,740
Natsuko!

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,640
Oh, Jodie. You came all the way out here to see me.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,840
Yes...

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,340
But, it's amazing you knew that I regained consciousness.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,440
Huh?

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,240
As to what happened this time, I'm to blame too,

22
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,940
so I feel quite uncomfortable.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,240
I told them not to let the school know about it yet.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,740
This is bad.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,140
Ms. Jodie!

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,640
Where's Agent Camel now?

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,140
I think he's by the car?

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,540
"Haido Central Hospital"

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,640
Rikumichi Kusuda?

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,940
I don't know a guy like that.

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,240
He's a guy who used to be hospitalized here,

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,740
stopped his car nearby and went missing.

33
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,440
I hear that there was a gun involved or something.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,940
Haven't you heard anything about it from your buddies?

35
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,140
Nope.

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,840
Oh, I see!

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,140
I guess it's information that's not passed down

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,240
to a low-ranking agent like you.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,840
Just what are you talking about?

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,240
We always share common information...

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,540
Camel!

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,340
Just what're you doing?

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,540
Stay with me, will you?

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,240
I hope you didn't tell him about Kusuda?

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,940
Of course not.

46
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,440
I wouldn't dare say that the guy shot himself to death in the car.

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,040
My lips are sealed.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,640
I see. Thank you.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,540
Well, it's an incident that occurred before I was dispatched to Japan,

50
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,740
so I just heard about it from Mr. Akai.

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,940
Jodie?

52
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,340
Where are you?

53
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,740
Jodie?

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,340
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,440
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,940
What happened then?

57
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,940
The dangerous conversation between two mysterious people.

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,740
His name is Detective Conan!

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,200
"The Scarlet Interplay"

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
"Haido Central Hospital" "The Day Before"

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
What?

64
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
Jodie?

65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,900
Camel!

66
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,200
Jodie!

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,900
Is everything okay?

68
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,800
What do you mean?

69
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,500
That guy who is a member of the Organization, Amuro.

70
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,300
I saw his car drive out of this hospital.

71
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,700
I hope you didn't leak any information out taken in by his glib talk?

72
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,600
No.

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Rather, you said the same thing just a while ago too, didn't you?

74
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,200
What? A while ago?

75
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,300
Well, just a while ago, the exact same thing.

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,000
What're you talking about?

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,500
I just got back here from Natsuko's room just now.

78
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,800
What?

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,500
Then what about the Jodie I saw a while ago?

80
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,400
The skill to change the tone of voice and amazing disguising technique.

81
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
A woman posses a combination of both.

82
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,700
There's just one person.

83
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,200
It took you longer than I expected.

84
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,000
I was worried that you wouldn't show up.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I couldn't find a scarf that was similar to the kind she was wearing.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
I see.

87
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
And how did it go?

88
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,000
That guy called Kusuda.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
Just as you assumed...

90
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
He seems to have shot himself to death.

91
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,600
In his own car.

92
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,400
So, it was just as I thought.

93
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
What? Vermouth did?

94
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,700
Are you saying that the Jodie I saw a while ago

95
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,900
was Vermouth in disguise?

96
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,500
Yes.

97
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,800
Bourbon asked you something, didn't he?

98
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, but I didn't answer him at all.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,500
He tried to provoke me by saying that

100
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,700
information isn't handed down to a low-ranking agent like me though.

101
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,900
He tries to provoke you mentally that way and pressure you.

102
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,200
Then, when your comrade, Jodie, comes around,

103
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,000
you feel comfortable and your tongue slips.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,400
He uses that kind of psychology!

105
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,300
Wait up!

106
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,500
You mean that Vermouth knew I was coming to this hospital

107
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,700
and waiting for us here?

108
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,700
We're just moving in accordance to how Bourbon and Vermouth want us to.

110
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,200
Just what do you mean?

111
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,900
It all started when you received the text mail from Ms. Shibuya, right?

112
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,500
That's when Bourbon and Vermouth's strategy began!

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,400
You mean that text mail she sent asking me to go drinking with her?

114
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
Yes.

115
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,900
Ms. Shibuya said that she didn't remember sending out such a mail, right?

116
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,000
Right.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,400
That is why I think that is the mail

118
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,800
that Bourbon had texted out from Ms. Shibuya's cell phone!

119
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
What?

120
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,300
I think it's pretty difficult

121
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,400
to steal the cell phone of an FBI like you.

122
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,300
But to secretly steal one of an ordinary elementary school teacher is easy.

123
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,600
If Bourbon met Ms. Shibuya many times as a detective,

124
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,200
he would've had more than enough chances to do so.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,500
But, why would he go that far to text out a mail like that?

126
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,600
That's to make you call Ms. Shibuya

127
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,500
using agent Camel's cell phone!

128
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,600
What?

129
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,700
If it's to go drinking, the time would be night.

130
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,200
He knew that at around that time

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,400
your cell phone would be out of battery.

132
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,100
He was watching us.

133
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
But why my cell phone?

134
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,600
Any FBI agent would've been fine.

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
So long as some sort of accident happened to Ms. Shibuya that night,

136
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,900
the agent whose call history was left on her cell phone,

137
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,600
would be called to come along with you.

138
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,100
I see.

139
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,400
So in other words

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,400
his target was the FBI agent that came along with me to begin with.

141
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,500
But Natsuko was pushed off the stairs of the park by Mr. Kandachi

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,000
and seriously injured,

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
what if that never occurred?

144
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,400
Maybe he was planning to run her over and seriously injure her.

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,000
After all, Bourbon said he was riding a car.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
No matter what method he used,

147
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,500
I think he was planning to get her into an accident outside.

148
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Outside?

149
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
Right.

150
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,300
In order to confirm the clothes that you were wearing, Jodie.

151
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,800
My clothes?

152
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Your face can be disguised with the pictures of you that had been taken

153
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
but it doesn't work out with the clothes that you're wearing today.

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,300
Rather than have you stay in the car or inside a room,

155
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,100
it would be easier to get a full view of you

156
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,600
or take sneak photos of you outside.

157
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,700
And once the disguise is ready,

158
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,200
he lures you, Jodie, over to the hospital by saying that

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,100
Ms. Shibuya's condition had worsened or something.

160
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,000
He distracted agent Camel to get you away from him.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Which means that Vermouth, who disguised herself as me,

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,500
successfully got you to give out information?

163
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,200
But Conan, from about when did you realize all this?

165
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,900
When we got the call from the hospital.

166
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Because if it's about the patient, who's involved in a case,

167
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,200
the police would be contacted,

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,300
but as to anything other than that, only the family is contacted.

169
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,400
Conan, then why didn't you tell me about it?

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
I wasn't sure yet.

171
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,500
There's a possibility that she could've been disguised as Ms. Shibuya too.

172
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,100
Really?

173
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,000
But what on earth was Bourbon after?

174
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,800
And? What information did you leak?

175
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh, yes.

176
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,300
About their spy who was hospitalized at this hospital, Rikumichi Kusuda.

177
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,300
The one who shot himself in his own car!

178
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,300
Is that all?

179
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
Yes.

180
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,000
Since Conan had warned me about it in the car on our way here,

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
my tongue slipped.

182
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,300
But what kind of merit is it them getting such information out of you?

183
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Well...

184
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,700
If Kusuda, who they thought was nabbed by the FBI, is dead,

185
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,700
there's no worry of him leaking anything out, I guess?

186
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,200
I wonder if there's some other meaning to this?

187
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,800
How about it, Conan?

188
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,300
Conan?

189
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,476
Conan?

190
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:44,776
Hey, Conan.

191
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:46,376
What's the matter?

192
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,576
Conan?

193
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:58,776
What's this Rikumichi Kusuda about?

194
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:02,276
I hear he was a member of the Organization.

195
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:07,176
What's the big deal about a man, who wasn't even given a code name,

196
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:08,576
shooting himself to death?

197
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,376
If you were to commit suicide using a gun,

198
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,376
what would you do?

199
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,276
Well...

200
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:26,076
I would point the muzzle of the gun to the temple.

201
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:27,476
That's right.

202
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:31,376
And the mark of the bullet would clearly remain in the skull

203
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,276
even if the corpse were to be burned.

204
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:35,376
What?

205
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,076
There was such an incident.

206
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:47,176
About the time the whereabouts of Kusuda became unknown.

207
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:54,276
Just about the same time,

208
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:58,276
there was a man who was shot in the head and burned.

209
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:03,076
That's...

210
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,076
Right.

211
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,176
FBI agent,

212
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,376
Shuichi Akai.

213
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,676
Don't tell me...

214
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,276
That he's alive?

215
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:29,976
Yes. If my deduction is correct.

216
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,776
Too bad, but your deduction's way off.

217
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:45,276
Because his death was confirmed.

218
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:48,976
Furthermore, the people who confirmed it are the Japanese police

219
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:53,276
and the people who made them confirm that was the FBI.

220
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,276
I mentioned before, didn't I?

221
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:58,476
That the fingerprints of Akai's corpse that Kir shot the head of

222
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:02,376
at Raiha Pass and burned together with his car,

223
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,876
and the fingerprints of Akai

224
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:08,376
found on that detective boy's cell phone matched.

225
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,776
I see.

226
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,276
But, how were you able to get the fingerprints from a corpse?

227
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:17,376
That's because he was burned with one hand inside the pocket

228
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,976
of his fireproof slacks.

229
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,276
That's the kind of guy he is...

230
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:24,676
Even back when he shot me with his shotgun,

231
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:27,276
he had one hand in his pocket too.

232
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:33,076
Using a shotgun with one hand?

233
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:34,876
Just like him to do so.

234
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:38,376
But it's also thinkable that one hand was put in the pocket

235
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:42,776
so that fingerprints could be taken later.

236
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,876
If you're that suspicious,

237
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:48,276
would you like to see the image of when Akai was shot?

238
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:53,076
You mean the video that Kir took with the hidden camera

239
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,976
he was wearing around his neck back then.

240
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,176
Right.

241
00:15:56,176 --> 00:15:59,676
The video in which that guy was definitely killed

242
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,476
was clearly taken on that camera.

243
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,676
What's the matter, Kir?

244
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,476
Hurry and finish him off.

245
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,776
But since I already shot through his lung,

246
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:18,576
he'll be dead in about 30 minutes even if I leave him as is.

247
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,476
His head.

248
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:24,576
Blast a bullet into his head

249
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:28,276
That'll kill him off for sure.

250
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:29,576
Roger.

251
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:50,776
And before he was shot in the head, he mumbled...

252
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:56,676
I didn't think you'd go this far.

253
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,976
I'm surprised too.

254
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:12,176
I'd like to comment from the standpoint of an actress,

255
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:14,476
it was no preset dialogue.

256
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:17,176
Those were words that came from the bottom of the heart.

257
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,376
It was no act.

258
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,476
I'm disappointed though,

259
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:25,076
that I had to play along with such a farce.

260
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:34,376
"I didn't think you'd go this far..."

261
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:38,276
"I didn't think you'd go this far."

262
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,376
I didn't think you'd go this far.

263
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,776
I see, that's the story.

264
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:59,876
Well, I'll prove whether my deduction is correct or not.

265
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:00,876
After cornering him into a circumstance

266
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:03,176
where he can't say a word or find his way out of.

267
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:08,976
So I guess you know the whereabouts of that ghost, then.

268
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:11,576
No, not yet.

269
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:16,976
As long as I know the trick,

270
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,776
for me to check up on it is more than easy.

271
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:23,976
I can do it in less than a day.

272
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:52,376
Is Conan going to be absent today?

273
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,576
Yes, it seems he caught a cold and is in bed.

274
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:59,476
What? And today's school lunch is curry rice!

275
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,076
Is that what you're worried about?

276
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,876
Well, it's curry, you know, curry!

277
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,676
It even comes with pudding!

278
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:08,576
Well, since he was secretly doing things with Dr. Agasa yesterday,

279
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:11,676
I'm not sure if he really has a cold or not.

280
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:28,676
"Mouri Detective Agency"

281
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:31,476
Conan!

282
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:34,076
What time was the Macademy Awards?

283
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,876
What?

284
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:39,876
Dad, isn't Conan back from school yet?

285
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:43,976
That brat called to say that he's staying over at Dr. Agasa's place

286
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,376
so he wouldn't be eating dinner here.

287
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:47,476
No!

288
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:51,576
I was looking forward to watching the Macademy Awards with him.

289
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:56,876
What's so good about a foreign movie award program?

290
00:19:56,876 --> 00:20:03,176
Well, Shinichi's father has been nominated for the best script award.

291
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:04,876
That's something to look forward to, isn't it?

292
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,276
Okay, I can see why you would be,

293
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:12,476
but why would that brat also be looking forward to it?

294
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,976
I guess so.

295
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:18,076
Come on. Never mind that already. Hurry and make dinner.

296
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,876
I'm starving.

297
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:29,376
Then, first for the best supporting actor award.

298
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:33,276
This year's presenter is last year's award winner,

299
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,376
Mr. Johnny Bip!

300
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:40,176
"Kudo"

301
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:49,676
Yes.

302
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,376
Delivery.

303
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,376
Good evening.

304
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:57,976
How do you do?

305
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,176
I'm Tohru Amuro.

306
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,076
I see...

307
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:07,676
But, this is not our first meeting, is it?

308
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,076
I'd like to talk to you a bit.

309
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:37,276
Would it be okay for me to go inside?

310
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:40,276
Yes, if it's just you.

311
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,476
I'm sorry,

312
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:47,676
but the others that are waiting outside are not invited in.

313
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:51,776
Because I don't think I have enough teacups to serve them tea with.

314
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,976
Please don't worry about them.

315
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,276
They love to wait outside.

316
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,976
But depending on how you answer me.

317
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:06,676
We may all have to barge in here.

318
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:12,176
Raiha Pass?

319
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:15,076
You mean we're going to the place

320
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:16,976
where Mr. Akai was killed by them from now?

321
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,376
Yes.

322
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,276
I feel as if I can get a hold of something if we go.

323
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,576
Right.

324
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:26,576
The time I was informed that Kusuda shot himself...

325
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,576
That facial expression.

326
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:33,076
And the total confusion during the flower viewing season.

327
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:35,076
There's definitely something.

328
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:36,376
There's something!

329
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:38,576
"Raiha Pass"

330
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,676
"Next Episode" -Do you like mysteries?

331
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,976
Then, shall we start there?

332
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:57,376
But the skinny man who came after the man in question who was killed,

333
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,976
was also holding the same cell phone, wasn't he?

334
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:05,976
But Mr. Akai touched that cell phone

335
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:09,576
only before he let them recapture Rena Mizunashi, right?

336
00:24:12,176 --> 00:24:17,676
Next Conan, "The Scarlet Return"

337
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:35,076
Next Conan's Hint:

338
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:37,576
"Raiha Pass"

339
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,076
I wonder if Mr. Okiya is capable of winning the Macademy Award?

340
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:42,576
He probably wouldn't have thought he was this capable.
