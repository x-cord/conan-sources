1
00:00:01.691 --> 00:00:03.491
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.591
After the tears, comes the knife of the mountain crone.

3
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:07.291
The members of the Youth Detective Squad get lost.

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:08.591
In the mountains where a mountain crone is said to live.

5
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.191
Something's bound to happen tonight!

6
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:11.691
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.591
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:10.843 --> 00:02:12.343
"Road Closed"

10
00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:13.643
It's a dead end.

11
00:02:13.643 --> 00:02:16.643
What? Not again...

12
00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:18.743
The 17th time.

13
00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:21.643
The roads around here are really difficult to make out.

14
00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:26.143
There are many forked and dead end roads that aren't on the map...

15
00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:28.443
I told you not to, didn't I?

16
00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:29.743
When you said that you wanted to avoid traffic

17
00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:32.643
and take a side road, Doc.

18
00:02:32.643 --> 00:02:34.043
Traffic jams and heat

19
00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:37.243
are the two worst conditions for aircooling engines.

20
00:02:37.243 --> 00:02:40.443
Besides, I figured that even if we did get lost

21
00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:42.843
using the navigation system of the cell phone would suffice.

22
00:02:42.843 --> 00:02:44.043
You're saying that you didn't think

23
00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:46.843
this area would be out of range?

24
00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:49.543
Why don't you have a navigator equipped in your car?

25
00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:51.043
If you had a navigator in your car,

26
00:02:51.043 --> 00:02:53.643
it would tell us where to go and all.

27
00:02:53.643 --> 00:02:55.843
I'm hungry.

28
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.843
My navigator is still in the developmental stage.

29
00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:01.443
Once it's completed, it'll really be something.

30
00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:04.743
It'll be one of the best around, full of functions.

31
00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:06.743
If it's ever completed.

32
00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:10.343
Either way, let's go back.

33
00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:11.543
If we keep on going,

34
00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:14.243
we may be able to get out of the out of service range

35
00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:16.743
and meet cars or people on the way too.

36
00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:19.043
Okay.

37
00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:21.743
It's so hard to figure these places out.

38
00:03:25.743 --> 00:03:30.243
Shoots, it's completely flat.

39
00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.543
You didn't bring the spare tire, did you?

40
00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:35.943
I just changed all the tires to new ones,

41
00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:38.143
so I didn't think I'd end up with a flat.

42
00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:40.943
More than that, I had to leave the spare tire behind

43
00:03:40.943 --> 00:03:43.743
in order to load all the bags.

44
00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:46.043
The sun's gone down and it's dark.

45
00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:48.643
We don't even know where we are.

46
00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:50.743
I guess we've got no choice but to sleep out here.

47
00:03:50.743 --> 00:03:52.043
What...

48
00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:53.943
What do you mean what?

49
00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.443
We were planning to camp to begin with anyway.

50
00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.443
We've got everything we need to camp outside.

51
00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:04.043
But, isn't this mountain? Kind of creepy.

52
00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.143
Like a ghost appearing, right?

53
00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:10.143
Oh, yeah... the kind that comes out in the folklores of Japan.

54
00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:13.643
Like cannibal witches and mountain crones...

55
00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:14.643
Mountain crones...

56
00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:15.943
Hey, come off it...

57
00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.843
There are no such things in real life.

58
00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:22.843
Huh? But, a house that fits the image is in view over there.

59
00:04:27.843 --> 00:04:30.143
Hey, don't tell me that it's...

60
00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:32.343
The house of a mountain crone.

61
00:04:32.343 --> 00:04:33.543
No joke!

62
00:04:33.543 --> 00:04:36.043
Oh, come on, no way.

63
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:39.043
That's right. It looks pretty big too,

64
00:04:39.043 --> 00:04:41.843
so let's go ask if they'll let us spend the night there.

65
00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:44.543
Huh...

66
00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:46.543
At that house...

67
00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:48.143
But, it's strange.

68
00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:49.443
Since no other light is in view elsewhere,

69
00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:52.343
that house is the only one around here.

70
00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:54.443
To think that there's only one big house like that

71
00:04:54.443 --> 00:04:56.943
deep in the mountains like this...

72
00:04:56.943 --> 00:04:59.143
True.

73
00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:02.543
It's just as if the house is beckoning us to come.

74
00:05:02.543 --> 00:05:04.243
Telling us to come over...

75
00:05:04.243 --> 00:05:05.643
What...

76
00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:08.043
At any rate, we've got to decide

77
00:05:08.043 --> 00:05:09.543
whether we want to spend the night out here

78
00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.743
or ask whether we'll be able to spend the night over at the house.

79
00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:12.843
What shall we do?

80
00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:14.343
I'm scared.

81
00:05:14.343 --> 00:05:17.743
But to sleep out here is dangerous too.

82
00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:22.143
Let's go! To the mountain crone's house!

83
00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:23.743
Huh?

84
00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:25.443
Haibara and Ayumi!

85
00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:27.943
I'll protect both of you with my life!

86
00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:30.143
Thank you.

87
00:05:30.143 --> 00:05:33.143
I guess you're going to give yourself if she decides to eat me then?

88
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:36.143
I don't think so.

89
00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:38.643
Besides, I think the mountain crone would prefer Genta than me

90
00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:40.743
for he has more fat on him and looks more delicious.

91
00:05:40.743 --> 00:05:44.143
You'll make good soup stock yourself.

92
00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.143
Really stupid.

93
00:05:45.143 --> 00:05:46.743
So everyone!

94
00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:49.843
Each of you hold your own bags, all right?

95
00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:51.343
Okay...

96
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:58.443
"The Sword of The Mountain Crone Part One"

97
00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:04.543
Well, the house sure has a fine thatched roof.

98
00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:07.443
It doesn't seem to be the house of a mountain crone, does it?

99
00:06:07.443 --> 00:06:08.843
-Let's go. -See.

100
00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:12.743
They say that mountain crones usually live in small shabby huts.

101
00:06:12.743 --> 00:06:16.043
Yes, right, and they're always holding kitchen knives, right?

102
00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:19.043
Yeah, a really big knife, right?

103
00:06:21.143 --> 00:06:23.243
Well, is it...

104
00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:25.943
this kind of knife?

105
00:06:25.943 --> 00:06:27.443
There she is...

106
00:06:27.443 --> 00:06:28.643
A mountain crone!

107
00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:31.943
Do you live here, granny?

108
00:06:31.943 --> 00:06:33.643
Yeah, I do. Who are you people?

109
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.243
Could you put us up for the night?

110
00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:38.443
Our car tire went flat.

111
00:06:38.443 --> 00:06:40.643
A flat? In a place like this?

112
00:06:40.643 --> 00:06:43.843
We're sorry to have to ask you something like this out of the blue,

113
00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:47.743
but we got lost on the way to the camping site.

114
00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:51.443
We were at a loss what to do, when your house came into view.

115
00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:54.343
Is that so? You should have said so earlier?

116
00:06:54.343 --> 00:06:56.643
What's with that knife of yours?

117
00:06:56.643 --> 00:07:00.243
I was cutting pickled vegetables in that hut

118
00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:02.643
when I heard your voices.

119
00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:05.843
So, I came out to see who would come to a place like this.

120
00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:09.143
Then, I heard you talking of a mountain crone.

121
00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:12.043
There are no other lights in view elsewhere

122
00:07:12.043 --> 00:07:14.543
except for your house, granny.

123
00:07:14.543 --> 00:07:17.843
This is the only house in this area.

124
00:07:17.843 --> 00:07:20.443
All those who used to live here

125
00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:23.143
have left for town already.

126
00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:25.743
Well, I can't give you a decent welcome,

127
00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:28.443
but if that's okay with you, come on inside.

128
00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:29.943
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:36.143
Huh?

130
00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:39.743
Is there somebody else living here with you?

131
00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:42.143
No. I live here alone.

132
00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:45.543
But, there is another pair of slippers out.

133
00:07:45.543 --> 00:07:48.143
"Tanaka Iwae, age 74" -Those slippers are my grandson Shota's.

134
00:07:48.143 --> 00:07:52.243
He left ten years ago saying that he wants to become a cook.

135
00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:56.843
It's just been left as is, since he left.

136
00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:59.243
You can go ahead and use them if you want.

137
00:07:59.243 --> 00:08:03.043
There are a lot of slippers in this shoe cabinet too.

138
00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:06.243
Oh, no, I didn't mean to make it sound that way...

139
00:08:06.243 --> 00:08:08.943
-Huh? -Here you go, Ayumi and Haibara.

140
00:08:08.943 --> 00:08:10.343
There's a pair for you too, Conan.

141
00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:11.643
Thanks.

142
00:08:11.643 --> 00:08:13.043
Huh?

143
00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:15.143
I wonder who this person is?

144
00:08:15.143 --> 00:08:16.143
I wonder...

145
00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:18.043
That's Shota.

146
00:08:18.043 --> 00:08:20.943
He's a heartless character that never once came to visit

147
00:08:20.943 --> 00:08:24.243
nor sent any letters after leaving here ten years ago.

148
00:08:24.243 --> 00:08:27.343
He seems to have become a skilled chef now

149
00:08:27.343 --> 00:08:30.643
and sends me a lot of money every month.

150
00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:33.543
But I haven't touched

151
00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:35.943
a cent of that heartless guy's money.

152
00:08:36.943 --> 00:08:39.143
Oh, goldfish!

153
00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:40.943
It's my grandson's goldfish too.

154
00:08:40.943 --> 00:08:44.043
The nerve of him to leave something so bothersome behind.

155
00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:47.043
The goldfish is pretty big, isn't it?

156
00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:49.943
It's been alive for more than ten years already, you see.

157
00:08:49.943 --> 00:08:51.643
Are you going to make it fat, then eat it?

158
00:08:51.643 --> 00:08:53.543
Genta, what's with you, all stuck on eating stuff?

159
00:08:53.543 --> 00:08:55.643
You're no different from a mountain crone.

160
00:08:55.643 --> 00:08:57.243
Right, Conan?

161
00:08:59.743 --> 00:09:01.843
What's the matter, Tsuburaya?

162
00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:03.843
Just now, someone was looking this way

163
00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.143
from the gap in that door!

164
00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:06.443
What?

165
00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:10.043
Huh? Now, who would come to a place like this?

166
00:09:10.043 --> 00:09:11.643
Hey, Conan!

167
00:09:13.943 --> 00:09:15.343
Who are you?

168
00:09:15.343 --> 00:09:17.043
What are you doing there?

169
00:09:19.843 --> 00:09:22.043
Boy, do you live here?

170
00:09:23.543 --> 00:09:25.043
Yes, they are...

171
00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:27.143
Would you go call the person then?

172
00:09:27.143 --> 00:09:29.243
What do you want?

173
00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:31.543
We hate to trouble you.

174
00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:32.743
"Akane Ouba, age 25" -We came to this mountains

175
00:09:32.743 --> 00:09:35.943
to go on a forest retreat.

176
00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.043
"Raito Adachi, age 29" -But, we got lost

177
00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:39.943
and on top of that we ran out of gas.

178
00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:41.243
"Fuga Kahara, age 28" -If it's okay with you,

179
00:09:41.243 --> 00:09:44.143
could you let us spend the night here just tonight?

180
00:09:47.043 --> 00:09:50.143
We're not bad people or anything like that.

181
00:09:50.143 --> 00:09:52.043
I'm Fuga Kahara.

182
00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:54.543
I'm Akane Ouba.

183
00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:56.743
I'm Raito Adachi.

184
00:09:56.743 --> 00:09:59.243
I work in the service industry in Tokyo.

185
00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:02.843
And I'm his customer.

186
00:10:02.843 --> 00:10:06.143
Please do let us stay for just one night, please?

187
00:10:07.943 --> 00:10:09.443
I'll let you stay tonight.

188
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.943
Thanks.

189
00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:15.043
However, don't you ever come back here again.

190
00:10:15.043 --> 00:10:16.643
What a snob.

191
00:10:16.643 --> 00:10:18.843
She seems to be in a bad mood.

192
00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:19.843
I tell you...

193
00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:23.243
I wouldn't spend the night here, if she begged me to.

194
00:10:23.243 --> 00:10:25.543
-Come on... -Don't just stand there, you guys.

195
00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:26.843
But sit down where you can!

196
00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:28.343
Yes, madam.

197
00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:30.943
Don't irk her any further. We really can't afford that to happen.

198
00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:34.243
I tell you, it's all because you got lost, Fuga.

199
00:10:34.243 --> 00:10:36.743
I'm so sorry, my lady.

200
00:10:36.743 --> 00:10:38.943
Well, let's go inside.

201
00:10:41.043 --> 00:10:42.043
Host?

202
00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:44.443
Both of you are hosts?

203
00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:48.043
Yeah. I'm Number two at the shop,

204
00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:50.443
while Raito is Number One.

205
00:10:50.443 --> 00:10:54.743
Thanks to our lady here who patronizes us.

206
00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:56.743
Look...

207
00:10:56.743 --> 00:10:58.043
Goldfish...

208
00:10:58.043 --> 00:10:59.443
Don't you think they're really cute?

209
00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:01.343
There're quite a lot of them.

210
00:11:01.343 --> 00:11:02.843
Oh, it's a Tamasaba!

211
00:11:02.843 --> 00:11:03.843
Tamasaba?

212
00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:05.543
See, this one!

213
00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:09.443
It has a body like goldfish, but the tail of a mackerel.

214
00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:11.143
Out of all the 12,

215
00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:13.843
this one's a goldfish you don't get to see very often.

216
00:11:13.843 --> 00:11:16.343
Fuga, you're knowledgeable!

217
00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.043
I used to have them before, that's why...

218
00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:19.843
You erudite king.

219
00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:21.743
I know about stones, you know.

220
00:11:21.743 --> 00:11:24.343
The transparent one at the right end is a quartz

221
00:11:24.343 --> 00:11:27.143
and the one beside it, the mottled one is isinglass.

222
00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:30.343
The one on the front left, that shiny black one

223
00:11:30.343 --> 00:11:33.243
is an obsidian that was used in the Jomon Period.

224
00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:34.843
Amazing...

225
00:11:34.843 --> 00:11:36.543
You're both super geniuses!

226
00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:37.543
I think it's call knowledgeable

227
00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:40.443
and not genius in this case.

228
00:11:40.443 --> 00:11:41.943
She's got it all thought out.

229
00:11:41.943 --> 00:11:45.443
She acts dumb like that and makes men feel good,

230
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:47.943
and as a result she gets pampered.

231
00:11:47.943 --> 00:11:50.143
She's the type that drives men down the drain.

232
00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:52.043
What? Are you serious?

233
00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:53.643
Yes, I'm serious, dead serious.

234
00:11:53.643 --> 00:11:55.843
Excuse me.

235
00:11:55.843 --> 00:11:57.043
If it's okay with you,

236
00:11:57.043 --> 00:11:59.443
would it be all right to use your kitchen?

237
00:11:59.443 --> 00:12:01.443
The kitchen?

238
00:12:01.443 --> 00:12:03.743
Well, since I was planning to cook curry with the children

239
00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:05.643
at the camp site,

240
00:12:05.643 --> 00:12:08.543
I brought the ingredients to make it along.

241
00:12:08.543 --> 00:12:10.343
I'm hungry.

242
00:12:10.343 --> 00:12:11.943
Since it's easy to make,

243
00:12:11.943 --> 00:12:15.043
I thought I'd make it for them.

244
00:12:15.043 --> 00:12:16.943
Men shouldn't stand in the kitchen!

245
00:12:17.943 --> 00:12:19.343
Huh?

246
00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:20.543
If you've got the ingredients,

247
00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:22.743
I'll make the curry for you.

248
00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:24.643
Thank you.

249
00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:26.643
I'll help you!

250
00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:29.143
Kids shouldn't worry about things like that.

251
00:12:29.143 --> 00:12:30.343
Just stay put.

252
00:12:30.343 --> 00:12:31.843
Okay.

253
00:12:31.843 --> 00:12:34.843
I never cooked before.

254
00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:37.843
Fine. I can make curry without anyone's help.

255
00:12:37.843 --> 00:12:41.043
I used to make it a lot for my grandson before.

256
00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:42.443
Where are the ingredients?

257
00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:44.943
In that bag over there.

258
00:12:44.943 --> 00:12:47.143
What a big bag.

259
00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:50.543
I was wondering what he'd brought along also.

260
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:02.751
Granny's curry was good.

261
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:05.851
As long as you get to eat, anything's delicious right, Genta?

262
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.351
It sure was good, though.

263
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:08.951
Yes.

264
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:10.951
The children use the room to the right

265
00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:13.151
at the end of the hall.

266
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:15.151
Okay...

267
00:13:15.151 --> 00:13:16.751
Thank you very much.

268
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:20.751
And you men use the room at the end of the hall to the left.

269
00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:22.451
You use this room!

270
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.451
What?

271
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:25.751
I want to stay in the same room as the two of them.

272
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.551
Men and women should not share the same room

273
00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:28.951
after the age of seven!

274
00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:31.451
Huh? Just what kind of a spell is that?

275
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:34.151
What a thing for a young unmarried woman to say!

276
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:36.151
What loose conduct!

277
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:38.151
What does loose conduct mean?

278
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.751
We're seven years old,

279
00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:41.451
but is it alright for us to be in the same room?

280
00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:43.151
I'm not married either.

281
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.051
Huh?

282
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:22.651
What's this sound?

283
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:32.351
The sound's coming from here.

284
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:35.051
I'm sure that this was the kitchen.

285
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:43.551
Huh?

286
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:51.551
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?

287
00:14:51.551 --> 00:14:54.151
It still before 4am.

288
00:14:54.151 --> 00:14:56.251
Please run away.

289
00:14:56.251 --> 00:14:57.251
Huh?

290
00:14:57.251 --> 00:14:59.651
Hurry... get out of here.

291
00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:02.251
Or else, we'll be killed.

292
00:15:05.051 --> 00:15:06.551
The voice just now...

293
00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:08.351
It... it's that lady, right?

294
00:15:08.351 --> 00:15:09.951
It came from outside.

295
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:18.951
Hey, my lady...

296
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.651
What's the matter, Akane?

297
00:15:20.651 --> 00:15:22.251
-Akane! -What's the matter?

298
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:23.251
What's up?

299
00:15:24.251 --> 00:15:26.551
Akane...

300
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.551
Call the ambulance and the police.

301
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:31.551
-Okay, I got it. -Quick!

302
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:34.151
Akane. Raito.

303
00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:36.651
-Fuga? -Let's take her inside.

304
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:38.651
Oh... okay.

305
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.751
It's no use.

306
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:47.951
Her artery's been stabbed with a sharp weapon,

307
00:15:47.951 --> 00:15:49.351
and there's too much bleeding.

308
00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:50.651
It's too late already.

309
00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:52.151
Hey, kid,

310
00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.251
don't say something you're not sure of...

311
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.351
Fuga.

312
00:15:57.651 --> 00:15:59.351
I can't believe it.

313
00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:08.551
A sharp weapon?

314
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:12.851
Normally a dagger or a kitchen knife.

315
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:16.851
The problem is... who would want to kill her at this hour of the day,

316
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.951
and with what kind of sharp weapon.

317
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:20.551
Moreover, in a remote mountains like this.

318
00:16:20.551 --> 00:16:23.051
A knife in the remote mountains.

319
00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:24.151
Don't tell me that...

320
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.551
Mountain crone...

321
00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:28.151
The police as well as the ambulance

322
00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:30.151
should be here in an hour or so.

323
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:32.251
Hey...

324
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:34.551
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?

325
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:36.051
Nothing...

326
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:37.451
I hope you're not thinking

327
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:40.751
that I'm the mountain crone.

328
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.451
Oh, granny.

329
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:44.751
Would you lend me your bathroom?

330
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:46.651
Yeah, go ahead.

331
00:16:46.651 --> 00:16:49.151
I really want to wash the blood off.

332
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:50.151
That...

333
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:53.251
Oh, go out the sliding paper door, turn right at the stairs

334
00:16:53.251 --> 00:16:55.851
and go all the way to the end of the hall to go to the bathroom.

335
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:58.251
See, just beyond the kitchen.

336
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.351
Kitchen...

337
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:06.351
So putting your story together.

338
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:10.151
This morning at about 3.58am, you went out

339
00:17:10.151 --> 00:17:13.251
because you suddenly heard a scream from outside the house

340
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:16.851
and found this woman with her neck slashed, is that right?

341
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:18.551
Yes.

342
00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:23.751
The name of the victim is Ms. Akane Ouba, age 25.

343
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.251
She's the daughter of the president of a financial company?

344
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:28.851
Yes, that's right.

345
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:31.151
And according to what I hear...

346
00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:33.651
When you all got here,

347
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:37.351
there was another person who was already right beside her.

348
00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:38.651
Oh, that's me.

349
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:40.751
Huh? Are you the one who killed her?

350
00:17:40.751 --> 00:17:42.351
Oh, no.

351
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.651
I was on the first floor to go to the restroom

352
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:47.151
when I heard her scream.

353
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:51.451
That's why I got to her before everyone else did.

354
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:52.851
And when you got to her,

355
00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:55.251
did you see any suspicious person around?

356
00:17:55.251 --> 00:17:56.951
No, not that I recall.

357
00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.051
It was sort of dark yet besides,

358
00:17:59.051 --> 00:18:01.251
and above all, I was more concerned about her lying on the ground.

359
00:18:03.551 --> 00:18:05.151
By the way, what's your name?

360
00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:08.851
Huh... Raito Adachi.

361
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:11.251
Mr. Raito Adachi.

362
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:12.851
And, you?

363
00:18:12.851 --> 00:18:14.351
Fuga Kahara.

364
00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:16.951
Mr. Fuga Kahara.

365
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:20.351
Huh? This house is the Yamada residence, isn't it?

366
00:18:20.351 --> 00:18:21.851
It's Tanaka!

367
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.751
This is the Tanaka residence.

368
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:27.451
I'm Iwae Tanaka, the one who called you.

369
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:28.951
Oh, I'm sorry.

370
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:30.351
Right...

371
00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:31.451
I've got your name down

372
00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:34.851
as the one who reported the incident, right here.

373
00:18:34.851 --> 00:18:37.051
Is he really all right?

374
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:41.551
I'm just wondering why a Mr. Adachi and Mr. Kahara

375
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:43.751
is at the Tanaka residence?

376
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:48.351
Also, how is everyone connected with the woman victim?

377
00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:51.951
She's a customer of the shop where Fuga and I work at.

378
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:55.851
We're hosts who brought Akane

379
00:18:55.851 --> 00:18:57.551
who said she wanted to forest bathe

380
00:18:57.551 --> 00:18:59.251
to the mountains here by car.

381
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.551
You're hosts?

382
00:19:00.551 --> 00:19:03.351
Yes, he got lost yesterday

383
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.751
and the car ran out of gas.

384
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:08.451
So, we spent the night here last night

385
00:19:08.451 --> 00:19:10.851
at Mrs. Tanaka's house.

386
00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:14.751
Where are the members of your family Mrs. Tanaka?

387
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:16.751
They're not here.

388
00:19:16.751 --> 00:19:19.851
Ten years ago after my grandson left,

389
00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:22.351
I've been living here alone.

390
00:19:23.951 --> 00:19:26.251
And you folks just happened to be here...

391
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:28.451
Just like those men there.

392
00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:31.451
We got lost on the way to the camping site,

393
00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:33.651
and on top of that, we ended up with a flat tire.

394
00:19:33.651 --> 00:19:36.151
We asked granny to put us up for the night.

395
00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:39.051
A little before they did.

396
00:19:39.051 --> 00:19:40.851
Then it's the same as usual,

397
00:19:40.851 --> 00:19:43.451
you've found yourself involved in a case?

398
00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:45.551
Well, I guess so.

399
00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:49.251
Ran out of gas and a flat tire.

400
00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:55.251
Let's see, Conan, was it?

401
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:56.351
I'll be honest with you,

402
00:19:56.351 --> 00:19:58.351
but I'm sure that you should go and have yourself blessed.

403
00:19:58.351 --> 00:20:01.351
I just know that you're possessed by something that's not too good.

404
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:04.951
Do you have any idea who the culprit may be?

405
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:07.051
Well, not really.

406
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:09.751
Although it was raining at the time of the murder,

407
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.351
there are no footprints around the house,

408
00:20:11.351 --> 00:20:13.051
except for the front entrance area,

409
00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:15.051
and no murder weapon has been found either.

410
00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:18.951
On top of that, no suspicious person has been witnessed.

411
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:21.251
In other words, the killer, as well as the murder weapon

412
00:20:21.251 --> 00:20:24.751
are probably in this house.

413
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:25.851
Huh?

414
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:28.651
Hey...

415
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:31.651
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

416
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:32.751
It can't be helped.

417
00:20:32.751 --> 00:20:33.851
Huh?

418
00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:36.951
Because we're the ones who brought her here.

419
00:20:36.951 --> 00:20:38.651
-But... -Of course,

420
00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:41.651
it's not that I suspect just you two.

421
00:20:41.651 --> 00:20:44.051
I will have to interrogate everyone here.

422
00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:46.951
One by one, about the incident.

423
00:20:46.951 --> 00:20:49.451
Let me start with the one who first found her, Mr. Raito Adachi?

424
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:51.851
Yeah. That's the name that I use at the shop and...

425
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.651
You gotta be kidding!

426
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:54.951
Interrogation without any proof,

427
00:20:54.951 --> 00:20:57.051
and you're treating us like we're the killer?

428
00:20:57.051 --> 00:21:01.051
It's not that I'm treating you like the killer.

429
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.851
Hey... Fuga.

430
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:05.851
I'm not going to say a word unless you come up

431
00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:08.751
with some evidence or the murder weapon!

432
00:21:08.751 --> 00:21:11.751
That's fine but taking that kind of an attitude,

433
00:21:11.751 --> 00:21:14.351
will give you a bad impression.

434
00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:21.251
A saw, a knife, chopper and two kitchen knives.

435
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:23.151
Dr. Agasa...

436
00:21:23.151 --> 00:21:24.651
Why do you have so many things

437
00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:26.851
that could be potential weapons?

438
00:21:26.851 --> 00:21:31.051
Most naturally because we came here to camp.

439
00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:32.551
You two...

440
00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:35.351
really have nothing on you?

441
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:38.751
No, you already checked our body a while ago too, didn't you?

442
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.051
And in this house there are...

443
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:45.851
three kitchen knives, a hoe, a sickle,

444
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:47.951
an ax and a scissors.

445
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:49.751
Is this really everything?

446
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:51.451
The only other thing left

447
00:21:51.451 --> 00:21:53.951
is my grandson's tool box in the shed.

448
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:56.651
I'm sure it's already rusty though.

449
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:57.951
That... that's a lie!

450
00:21:57.951 --> 00:22:00.451
Huh? What did you just say?

451
00:22:00.451 --> 00:22:02.951
I... I saw her this morning.

452
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:05.351
I noticed a strange sound when going back

453
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:07.651
to my room from the restroom.

454
00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:13.951
I heard the sound coming from the kitchen,

455
00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:15.051
so I took a peek...

456
00:22:17.151 --> 00:22:19.951
And saw granny...

457
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:25.151
here...

458
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:27.151
sharpening a knife!

459
00:22:27.151 --> 00:22:29.251
Her hair was dishevelled!

460
00:22:29.251 --> 00:22:31.951
It was a kitchen knife with a bright red handle!

461
00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:33.751
She looked like an ogre!

462
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:07.651
"Next Episode" -But I saw for sure with my own eyes.

463
00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:09.651
Maybe you were just flustered at seeing me

464
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:11.651
who resembles a mountain crone

465
00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:15.251
and saw an illusion of some kind?

466
00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:19.051
There's an inscription under the name of the maker of the knife...

467
00:24:19.051 --> 00:24:20.051
Shota?

468
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:21.951
Last night the water of this aquarium

469
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:23.351
was filled to this water stain here,

470
00:24:23.351 --> 00:24:25.351
but the water's decreased quite a lot!

471
00:24:25.351 --> 00:24:28.651
I see, that's why the culprit used a hammer.

472
00:24:28.651 --> 00:24:29.851
Next Conan!

473
00:24:29.851 --> 00:24:34.051
"The Knife of the Mountain Crone Part Two"

474
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:52.051
Next Conan's Hint:

475
00:24:52.051 --> 00:24:53.951
Goldfish Aquarium.

476
00:24:53.951 --> 00:24:55.151
We encounter an incident involving a mountain crone in the mountains.

477
00:24:55.151 --> 00:24:56.151
Officer Yamamura appears and the case reaches a climax,

478
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:57.151
just a step to being solved!

479
00:24:57.151 --> 00:24:58.951
This story is certainly full of mountain, heights and climax.
