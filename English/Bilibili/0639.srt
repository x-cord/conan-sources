1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.540
The person we saved from a rampaging car

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.540
was Kaede Nakakita, adopted child of a rich man

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.040
called Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.540
In response to her invitation,

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.840
we visited Mr. Ouzaburo's Mansion

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.540
that bear the name "Red Leaf Palace"

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.040
and were surprised by the numerous trick art employed here and there.

8
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.840
Mr. Ouzaburo's two children,

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.640
"Ogito Katayose (35), eldest son" -son Ogito...

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.740
"Nobue Katayose (32), eldest daughter" -and daughter Nobue,

11
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.540
had been feuding with each other.

12
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.440
Mr. Ouzaburo had become saddened...

13
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.640
"Ouzaburo Katayose (68)" -by the two children.

14
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.940
That Mr. Ouzaburo died by poison.

15
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.440
But neither I nor Ran witnessed

16
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.640
any suspects fleeing the scene.

17
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.840
Was this a sealed room murder?

18
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.240
Amidst the escalating alternation

19
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.940
between Ogito and Nobue over the inheritance...

20
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.240
"Eiko Suzaka (48), chauffer" -Ouzaburo's letter...

21
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.840
consigned to the chauffeur, Eiko Suzaka, was discovered.

22
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.040
Now, close the umbrella.

23
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.940
Gaze at the evening sun setting in the east.

24
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.340
Look at the two rods holding up the red leaves.

25
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.840
Search for a longer rod.

26
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.340
My dream of the red leaves shall lie dormant there.

27
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.040
Like the fog clears.

28
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.140
Let's see through love and crime as well.

29
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.340
A sealed room, a code, the real culprit...

30
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.340
Push through the red leaves and solve the mysteries.

31
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.140
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:03.781
"Solving Mysteries at the Red Maple Palace (Part 2)"

35
00:03:04.381 --> 00:03:06.381
Putting the puzzle-solving aside,

36
00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:08.681
we've got to protect Kaede.

37
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.881
We don't even know the culprit behind that car.

38
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:13.081
About that, I have a rough idea.

39
00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:18.381
Ogito did that to Kaede?

40
00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:20.781
See, when he heard Kaede almost

41
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:23.681
got into an accident with a freak car...

42
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.981
Accident?

43
00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:27.681
But it's because you were walking carelessly.

44
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.181
Even though the chauffer Eiko was with her,

45
00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:32.381
isn't it odd that he'd assume she was walking

46
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.981
instead of riding in a car?

47
00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:38.181
Then could the culprit behind Mr. Ouzaburo's murder also be...

48
00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:40.981
-Pardon me. -Yes?

49
00:03:43.281 --> 00:03:47.281
Since it seems it will take quite a while before meal time, feel free.

50
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:50.781
"Kaede Nakakita (8), adopted child of Katayose"

51
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.781
Smells good.

52
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.081
Black tea, right?

53
00:03:57.081 --> 00:03:59.081
I'll go fetch Grandpa.

54
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.581
Grandpa.

55
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.381
Kaede.

56
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:17.281
Was Ouzaburo well aware of his condition?

57
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:20.081
It did seem he was prepared for it?

58
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:23.781
Occasionally, he would mutter, "I can't die just yet."

59
00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.881
What does it mean?

60
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:27.381
It means that, once he passed away,

61
00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:30.781
Kaede may find herself in much more danger.

62
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:34.981
Grandpa...

63
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:39.181
He promised to drink black tea with me forever, but...

64
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:44.081
Is it true that Ouzaburo never put sugar in his tea?

65
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.681
Never. Strange, right?

66
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:49.481
Well, all of us have our own preferences.

67
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.681
But everyone else puts sugar inside.

68
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:54.681
I put five spoonfuls.

69
00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:55.981
That's too much.

70
00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:58.481
Our spoons are small!

71
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.581
I see. So that's what it was.

72
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:06.581
What?

73
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.681
Ogito Katayose and Nobue Katayose vanished from sight?

74
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:12.481
What were the guarding officers doing?

75
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:14.581
Yes. But, you see...

76
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.481
This mansion is virtually a maze.

77
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:20.781
Don't tell me they've fled into the mountains.

78
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:23.081
There's no escape route in the mountains.

79
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:24.681
Take a look.

80
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:27.481
This place is fenced off along the boundary line.

81
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:29.781
They say an electric current is running through it.

82
00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.481
Most likely for the purpose of preventing

83
00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:34.781
an invasion by large wild animals like boars.

84
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.481
It's probably just as dangerous for humans, too.

85
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:40.981
No. Normally only weak current is engaged.

86
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:43.681
But when something does make contact with the fence,

87
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.581
an alarm sounds from that shed.

88
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.981
I was informed that the alarm and the voltage adjustment

89
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.581
can be controlled from there.

90
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:57.181
Over there.

91
00:05:57.181 --> 00:06:00.481
That's the east end of our premises.

92
00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:02.781
Something's glowing.

93
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.981
That?

94
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:05.681
A mirror was erected on top.

95
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:07.081
Weird, right?

96
00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:09.581
A mirror?

97
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:11.381
Help me!

98
00:06:16.181 --> 00:06:20.181
Hey! Did you hear a woman screaming?

99
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.581
Aunt Nobue!

100
00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:24.681
-Over there! -Darn it! Let's hurry!

101
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:26.881
Darn it! Another victim?

102
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.181
Aunt Nobue...

103
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:41.481
Kaede, it's best you don't look.

104
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:48.281
We're too late.

105
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.681
Seems the murder weapon was the arrow on her back.

106
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:53.181
Huh? There's one more arrow.

107
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:55.881
What's the matter?

108
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.781
Eiko, Aunt Nobue is...

109
00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:03.381
I knew it.

110
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.781
Detective Mouri!

111
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:06.481
Inspector.

112
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:08.781
So it's Nobue this time.

113
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:11.281
The wound doesn't seem like a deep one.

114
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:13.681
So there may be poison on it.

115
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:15.681
It's not an ordinary arrow.

116
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.781
This is a bolt from crossbow.

117
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:19.681
Crossbow?

118
00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:21.881
Do you know something about it?

119
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.181
Yes. Well...

120
00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:26.881
It's one of Ogito's hobbies.

121
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.081
But amidst the grove of trees,

122
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:32.181
where could this have been shot from?

123
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.381
If the shooter had approached her,

124
00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:36.781
she would've taken notice and escaped into the woods.

125
00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:37.781
If shot from a distance,

126
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:40.381
the trees would in turn interfere with the line of sight.

127
00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:43.081
You can get a good view from there, right?

128
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:48.281
My tree house!

129
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.681
So, the culprit shot the bolt from up there?

130
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:56.181
All right!

131
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:58.781
-Be careful! -Idiot!

132
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:01.381
Don't you look down on my athletic skill!

133
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.681
Dad!

134
00:08:04.681 --> 00:08:06.681
Why?

135
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:15.381
Gotcha!

136
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.381
No mistake about it.

137
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.781
The owner is no doubt Ogito!

138
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.581
He climbed up to this terrace and shot Nobue.

139
00:08:23.581 --> 00:08:26.781
Without using the rope ladder, how did he climb up there?

140
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:28.581
He must have notched the ladder

141
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:30.981
after putting down his crossbow.

142
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:34.481
There was no crossbow there when you climbed up earlier, right?

143
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.581
No.

144
00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:38.081
Kaede climbed up the tree trunk earlier,

145
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:41.081
and the notch was already there!

146
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:42.681
What now?

147
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:44.681
In that case,

148
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:47.681
I bet Ogito also climbed up the tree.

149
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:51.681
But isn't it odd to leave the murder weapon crossbow there?

150
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:52.781
Who knows?

151
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:55.781
That Ogito guy must just be really forgetful!

152
00:08:57.981 --> 00:08:59.481
Yes.

153
00:08:59.481 --> 00:09:02.881
Is that so? Thank you.

154
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.981
Inspector, according to the forensic results,

155
00:09:05.981 --> 00:09:08.981
among the two bolts, the one piercing the victim

156
00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.881
tested positive for poison from aconitine derivatives,

157
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:15.281
but the other tested negative.

158
00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:18.181
It was cyanide in Ouzaburo's case,

159
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:20.581
and aconitine this time?

160
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.781
One more thing.

161
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.481
On Nobue's left sleeve,

162
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.881
they've found a tear as if it was cut by something.

163
00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:31.781
I'm certain that things went like this:

164
00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:34.181
The first bolt that Ogito shot from this tree house

165
00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:36.981
tore through Nobue's clothes.

166
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:39.381
Soon after Nobue noticed she was being targeted,

167
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:41.281
she let out a "Help me" scream

168
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:42.981
and fled into the woods.

169
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:45.881
However, the second bolt with poison hit her,

170
00:09:45.881 --> 00:09:48.581
and resulted in her death.

171
00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:52.381
Why wasn't the first bolt laced with poison, though?

172
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.781
That... that's because...

173
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.781
There was only enough poison for one bolt!

174
00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:02.081
What's this?

175
00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:03.581
Somebody must have come into contact with the fence

176
00:10:03.581 --> 00:10:05.681
and set off the alarm!

177
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:09.881
By fence, you mean the one with the electric current?

178
00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:11.081
Yes.

179
00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:13.481
Don't tell me it's Ogito?

180
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:18.281
What's the matter?

181
00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:21.481
Inspector! Our missing suspect, Ogito Katayose

182
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:22.881
was found to have fallen off a cliff!

183
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:25.781
What? What'd you say?

184
00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:35.328
Where is Ogito Katayose?

185
00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:38.628
Sir! In the mountain stream below us!

186
00:10:38.628 --> 00:10:41.228
So, he fell from here?

187
00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:47.628
It was a full-on jolt?

188
00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:51.728
I see! That must mean the culprit isn't Ogito!

189
00:10:51.728 --> 00:10:53.728
What? Why that?

190
00:10:53.728 --> 00:10:55.728
Every occupant of this domicile knows

191
00:10:55.728 --> 00:10:58.828
that the fence here is electric fired.

192
00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:02.128
I don't believe they would touch the fence by mistake.

193
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:05.228
In other words, someone pushed him off?

194
00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:07.528
Hey, look at that!

195
00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:11.728
What's that mounted on top of the pole?

196
00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:13.428
Looks like a mirror.

197
00:11:13.428 --> 00:11:15.928
It's true, but that mirror...

198
00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:19.028
Where is it facing?

199
00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:20.628
I've got it!

200
00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:21.728
As long as it doesn't rain,

201
00:11:21.728 --> 00:11:25.428
the mirror will directly reflect the setting sun!

202
00:11:25.428 --> 00:11:28.728
So that's why it tells us to "Close the umbrella"!

203
00:11:29.828 --> 00:11:32.228
With that said, the remaining puzzle is...

204
00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:35.628
Which is longer, the horizontal or the vertical one?

205
00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:40.028
The vertical pole looks longer to me.

206
00:11:40.028 --> 00:11:42.828
Looks like we need to investigate the inside of the poles.

207
00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:44.628
-Roger. -Inspector!

208
00:11:44.628 --> 00:11:45.828
Officers who descended into the valley

209
00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:48.028
have confirmed Ogito Katayose's death.

210
00:11:48.028 --> 00:11:52.128
We shall commence the transport of his body immediately.

211
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:55.728
Inspector! All the mysteries have thawed out!

212
00:11:55.728 --> 00:11:57.128
What?

213
00:11:57.128 --> 00:11:59.228
The culprit responsible for the murders

214
00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:02.428
of Mr. Ouzaburo, Nobue and Ogito...

215
00:12:02.428 --> 00:12:03.528
is you!

216
00:12:03.528 --> 00:12:06.328
Miss Eiko Suzaka!

217
00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:07.828
What?

218
00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.928
No... no way.

219
00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:11.428
I didn't do anything.

220
00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:16.828
Presumably, Mr. Ouzaburo had already prepared a will ante mortem.

221
00:12:16.828 --> 00:12:20.028
On the occasion of both Ogito's and Nobue's deaths,

222
00:12:20.028 --> 00:12:22.928
you would become the beneficiary of his inheritance

223
00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:25.828
or something along those lines, right?

224
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.428
Dazzled by the inheritance,

225
00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:28.828
you killed them one by one!

226
00:12:28.828 --> 00:12:31.128
Enough of the silliness already!

227
00:12:31.128 --> 00:12:33.428
No, that must be it!

228
00:12:33.428 --> 00:12:37.528
Inspector! Hurry up and investigate!

229
00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:38.528
Before I do,

230
00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:42.628
are you saying you can elucidate the sealed room mystery?

231
00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:45.528
Nah, I mean that...

232
00:12:45.528 --> 00:12:49.428
Well, sooner or later, I'll figure it out.

233
00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:52.328
That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?

234
00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:54.628
Pops, leave the rest to me!

235
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.128
Detective Mouri?

236
00:12:59.128 --> 00:13:00.828
Though the colorful something smells good...

237
00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:03.128
It will scatter eventually...

238
00:13:05.328 --> 00:13:06.728
Detective Mouri?

239
00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:09.328
My apologies, pardon me.

240
00:13:09.328 --> 00:13:12.828
Now, allow me to explain in a more responsible manner.

241
00:13:12.828 --> 00:13:15.528
Let's start from the sealed room mystery.

242
00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.528
Ran was in a position where she could monitor

243
00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:20.728
who was coming and going from Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose's annex.

244
00:13:20.728 --> 00:13:22.928
Beyond that, Conan and Kaede were also in a position

245
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:26.128
where the annex was in plain sight.

246
00:13:26.128 --> 00:13:28.428
The scene resembled a sealed room with iron walls

247
00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:30.828
under the surveillance of those three.

248
00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:34.728
Moreover, there isn't any secret underground tunnel, right?

249
00:13:34.728 --> 00:13:37.428
Of course not.

250
00:13:37.428 --> 00:13:39.628
In that case, there is only one answer.

251
00:13:39.628 --> 00:13:41.828
It would have been impossible

252
00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:44.228
for any perpetrator to depart the scene.

253
00:13:44.228 --> 00:13:46.228
What are you saying?

254
00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:50.528
There wasn't anyone else at the scene apart from the victim!

255
00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:53.828
I'm saying that's the true answer!

256
00:13:53.828 --> 00:13:55.228
What now?

257
00:13:55.228 --> 00:13:57.528
Then, Mr. Ouzaburo...

258
00:13:57.528 --> 00:13:58.828
Committed suicide?

259
00:13:58.828 --> 00:14:01.028
What in the world do you think you're saying?

260
00:14:01.028 --> 00:14:04.328
The black tea also belonging to the guest was inside that room!

261
00:14:04.328 --> 00:14:06.228
The cup was steaming, too.

262
00:14:06.228 --> 00:14:09.528
That black was a work of disguise from Mr. Ouzaburo.

263
00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:12.528
In order to make it seem as if a guest had been invited.

264
00:14:12.528 --> 00:14:14.828
How can you be so sure of that?

265
00:14:14.828 --> 00:14:17.628
-There was no spoon. -What?

266
00:14:17.628 --> 00:14:20.628
Mr. Ouzaburo, lacking the habit of adding sugar,

267
00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:24.428
had no need for spoons even for mixing milk.

268
00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:26.428
That's why he carelessly neglected

269
00:14:26.428 --> 00:14:28.228
to prepare a spoon for the "guest".

270
00:14:28.228 --> 00:14:30.328
To think he went as far as to prepare a sugar pot,

271
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.228
I can only say it was a gross oversight on his part.

272
00:14:33.228 --> 00:14:34.928
No way!

273
00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:37.928
The reason for suicide was inheritance trouble.

274
00:14:37.928 --> 00:14:39.928
Ogito and Nobue both

275
00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:43.928
seemed to be in extremely tight spots, financially.

276
00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:46.528
But that's precisely why Master was worried

277
00:14:46.528 --> 00:14:49.628
and thought he couldn't die just yet.

278
00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:51.728
So, why did he kill himself?

279
00:14:51.728 --> 00:14:55.428
Remind me again of the reason why he "couldn't die just yet"?

280
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:56.928
He thought that if he died,

281
00:14:56.928 --> 00:15:01.328
the two of them would endanger Kaede's life.

282
00:15:01.328 --> 00:15:03.328
But unfortunately,

283
00:15:03.328 --> 00:15:07.728
Mr. Ouzaburo took the fact that he won't last long to heart.

284
00:15:07.728 --> 00:15:09.028
"In that case,

285
00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:12.128
I shall expunge the two from Kaede once and for all."

286
00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:14.828
What might happen if we assume that?

287
00:15:14.828 --> 00:15:17.928
I see. That's why he committed suicide

288
00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:19.728
and disguised it as a murder by poison.

289
00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:22.528
But even so, why would he go as far as to invite Detective Mouri

290
00:15:22.528 --> 00:15:24.428
if he planned to commit suicide?

291
00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:26.928
No, on the contrary...

292
00:15:26.928 --> 00:15:29.528
Mr. Ouzaburo is fond of tricks.

293
00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:32.928
He likely intended to challenge me to the mysteries.

294
00:15:32.928 --> 00:15:34.628
I see.

295
00:15:34.628 --> 00:15:37.228
Then, what about Nobue?

296
00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:41.228
What we saw earlier was supposed to be Nobue's acting.

297
00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:42.928
Acting?

298
00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:44.928
She tore her own clothes with one of Ogito's arrow

299
00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:47.928
that she obtained somewhere, and let out a scream.

300
00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:51.428
By doing so, she made it appear as if Ogito was attacking her.

301
00:15:51.428 --> 00:15:56.428
But Nobue was shot in the back with an arrow and killed.

302
00:15:56.428 --> 00:15:58.128
According to Nobue's plan,

303
00:15:58.128 --> 00:15:59.928
she was supposed to feign unconsciousness

304
00:15:59.928 --> 00:16:02.728
and wait for our arrival.

305
00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:06.228
However, Ogito showed up before we did.

306
00:16:06.228 --> 00:16:07.228
What?

307
00:16:07.228 --> 00:16:10.828
Then, don't tell me he saw Nobue faking unconsciousness.

308
00:16:10.828 --> 00:16:12.328
Exactly.

309
00:16:12.328 --> 00:16:15.228
And he stabbed her with the poisonous bolt.

310
00:16:15.228 --> 00:16:16.628
Please hold on.

311
00:16:16.628 --> 00:16:19.828
Why would he conveniently be carrying a poisonous arrow?

312
00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:21.628
I think he prepared one beforehand.

313
00:16:21.628 --> 00:16:23.928
-What? -Mr. Ogito told me that

314
00:16:23.928 --> 00:16:25.828
when he went boar hunting,

315
00:16:25.828 --> 00:16:30.128
he would apply poison derived from wild plants to his arrow.

316
00:16:30.128 --> 00:16:31.728
I see.

317
00:16:31.728 --> 00:16:34.128
Nobue orchestrated an attempted murder

318
00:16:34.128 --> 00:16:36.928
all for the purpose of framing Ogito.

319
00:16:36.928 --> 00:16:39.828
Upon doing so, she would be able to gain all of the inheritance.

320
00:16:39.828 --> 00:16:42.228
However, Ogito took advantage of it,

321
00:16:42.228 --> 00:16:45.028
and killed her instead, right?

322
00:16:45.028 --> 00:16:48.128
In that case, the one who put the crossbow by the tree house was...

323
00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:49.728
It's Nobue.

324
00:16:49.728 --> 00:16:52.328
After presumably tossing it up there from below.

325
00:16:52.328 --> 00:16:54.228
Since she didn't use the rope ladder,

326
00:16:54.228 --> 00:16:56.628
she didn't notice the notch in it.

327
00:16:56.628 --> 00:17:00.528
In short, the one who made the notch was Ogito.

328
00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:03.528
Then, Ogito was following Nobue?

329
00:17:03.528 --> 00:17:05.828
In order to kill her when the opportunity arose?

330
00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:08.228
No. If that were the case,

331
00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.028
he would've carried the bow as well instead of just the bolt.

332
00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:13.128
Ogito brought only the bolt with him upon leaving the mansion.

333
00:17:13.128 --> 00:17:17.728
I gather that he already solved the code long before us.

334
00:17:17.728 --> 00:17:20.728
The bolt was probably for probing the inside of the pole,

335
00:17:20.728 --> 00:17:24.328
which is likely where the hidden fortune is located.

336
00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:25.828
I see.

337
00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:30.928
But, can you prove that he indeed stabbed Nobue on the spot?

338
00:17:30.928 --> 00:17:32.928
Good question.

339
00:17:32.928 --> 00:17:35.028
I believe Eiko could have.

340
00:17:35.028 --> 00:17:37.828
What?

341
00:17:37.828 --> 00:17:40.128
You had a slip of the tongue, right?

342
00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:41.828
After hearing about Nobue's death,

343
00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:43.228
you uttered "I knew it".

344
00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:45.628
What did you mean by that?

345
00:17:45.628 --> 00:17:48.028
That's...

346
00:17:48.028 --> 00:17:51.128
You were suspecting Ogito at first.

347
00:17:51.128 --> 00:17:52.928
That he was aiming for Kaede's life,

348
00:17:52.928 --> 00:17:56.028
and finally poisoned Mr. Ouzaburo to death today.

349
00:17:56.028 --> 00:17:57.428
With that thought in mind,

350
00:17:57.428 --> 00:18:00.328
you kept a watchful eye on his actions, didn't you?

351
00:18:00.328 --> 00:18:02.528
No, I would never.

352
00:18:02.528 --> 00:18:04.128
It follows that

353
00:18:04.128 --> 00:18:07.228
you also saw the scene in which Ogito stabbed Nobue.

354
00:18:07.228 --> 00:18:09.828
Since you couldn't ascertain the situation from a distant view,

355
00:18:09.828 --> 00:18:11.928
as soon as Nobue's death was confirmed,

356
00:18:11.928 --> 00:18:14.028
you uttered "I knew it".

357
00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:17.628
After finishing off Nobue, Ogito came here

358
00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:20.128
and climbed up the fence to check the poles,

359
00:18:20.128 --> 00:18:22.228
and fell to his death due to electric shock.

360
00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:25.128
I doubt that's the case.

361
00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:28.728
Eiko. When the alarm sounded,

362
00:18:28.728 --> 00:18:32.028
you said, "Somebody must have touched the fence".

363
00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.028
Why "somebody"?

364
00:18:34.028 --> 00:18:36.128
Why not "something" like animals?

365
00:18:37.828 --> 00:18:40.028
Monitoring Ogito's every move,

366
00:18:40.028 --> 00:18:42.128
you witnessed him coming out of the shed

367
00:18:42.128 --> 00:18:46.528
where the controls for the electrified fence and alarm were.

368
00:18:46.528 --> 00:18:48.628
You entered the shed after Ogito's departure,

369
00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.628
and found the electric current and alarm cut off.

370
00:18:53.228 --> 00:18:55.528
Perhaps you already knew the meaning

371
00:18:55.528 --> 00:18:58.228
behind the cipher from the very beginning?

372
00:18:58.228 --> 00:19:01.728
If Mr. Ouzaburo were to hide something inside the pole,

373
00:19:01.728 --> 00:19:05.128
he would have required someone else's help.

374
00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:08.328
Then, realizing Ogito must've also figured out the code

375
00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:10.328
by turning off the current,

376
00:19:10.328 --> 00:19:13.628
you turned the electric current back on.

377
00:19:13.628 --> 00:19:17.428
Not only that, you also made the current stronger than normal.

378
00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:19.328
What'd you say?

379
00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:21.928
Ogito, operating under a false sense of security

380
00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:23.628
that the current was turned off...

381
00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:27.628
He climbed up the fence in order to search the pole.

382
00:19:32.928 --> 00:19:34.928
I'm truly sorry!

383
00:19:34.928 --> 00:19:37.628
I confess that I did it!

384
00:19:37.628 --> 00:19:41.128
I mistook him for the murderer who poisoned Master.

385
00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.728
I'm truly sorry!

386
00:19:58.928 --> 00:20:01.728
What are you doing, Inspector?

387
00:20:01.728 --> 00:20:04.528
They're searching for the treasure!

388
00:20:04.528 --> 00:20:06.128
Hold on a minute!

389
00:20:06.128 --> 00:20:09.128
The code instructed us to "search for the longer rod!"

390
00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:12.328
That's why we've been searching like this.

391
00:20:12.328 --> 00:20:16.228
But as far as I can see, the vertical one looks longer.

392
00:20:16.228 --> 00:20:18.728
But it's the horizontal pole that's longer,

393
00:20:18.728 --> 00:20:20.628
they've already measured it.

394
00:20:20.628 --> 00:20:22.928
I think it's called "Fick illusion".

395
00:20:22.928 --> 00:20:26.328
One of Mr. Katayose's deceptions, which is his hobby.

396
00:20:26.328 --> 00:20:30.128
If you place two lines equal in length in a "T" shape,

397
00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.528
you'll think the vertical one looks longer.

398
00:20:32.528 --> 00:20:36.528
They say it's an illusion discovered in 1851.

399
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.628
The poles are based on that illusion,

400
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:41.928
so the horizontal one is deliberately a bit longer.

401
00:20:41.928 --> 00:20:45.028
Inspector, found it! The treasure!

402
00:20:45.028 --> 00:20:48.028
We police officers shouldn't call it a treasure.

403
00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:51.128
According to Mr. Katayose, it's his personal dream.

404
00:20:53.528 --> 00:20:55.028
This is...

405
00:20:55.028 --> 00:20:57.428
a ruby, isn't it?

406
00:20:57.428 --> 00:20:59.228
A treasure indeed!

407
00:20:59.228 --> 00:21:01.328
There's a letter that goes with it.

408
00:21:01.328 --> 00:21:04.328
It's signed by Mr. Katayose.

409
00:21:04.328 --> 00:21:06.428
"Eiko Suzaka.

410
00:21:06.428 --> 00:21:08.928
By the time you have read this letter,

411
00:21:08.928 --> 00:21:11.528
I believe I will have already ceased to exist.

412
00:21:11.528 --> 00:21:13.428
To you who have done so much for me,

413
00:21:13.428 --> 00:21:16.428
please hear out my one last request.

414
00:21:16.428 --> 00:21:19.328
I would like for you to take care of Kaede after my death,

415
00:21:19.328 --> 00:21:20.628
who shall be the beneficiary of my inheritance,

416
00:21:20.628 --> 00:21:22.528
until her adulthood.

417
00:21:22.528 --> 00:21:24.028
Please accept the enclosed ruby

418
00:21:24.028 --> 00:21:27.028
with this letter as my gratitude.

419
00:21:27.028 --> 00:21:30.528
As for the reason I fixated on that little girl so much...

420
00:21:30.528 --> 00:21:32.728
Instead of laughing at the unbecomingness of an old man,

421
00:21:32.728 --> 00:21:37.528
please surmise looking at the enclosed picture."

422
00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:39.428
These two people...

423
00:21:41.128 --> 00:21:43.028
Their names are written on it.

424
00:21:43.028 --> 00:21:44.828
Ouzaburo Katayose.

425
00:21:44.828 --> 00:21:47.528
Momiji Nakakita.

426
00:21:47.528 --> 00:21:50.628
And everyone was immediately convinced.

427
00:21:50.628 --> 00:21:53.428
The reason it was called the "Red Leaf Palace".

428
00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:56.228
Although they couldn't get married due to various circumstances,

429
00:21:56.228 --> 00:22:01.228
but Mr. Katayose had never forgotten Momiji, till the end.

430
00:23:22.628 --> 00:23:25.528
Kaede went back to Hokkaido.

431
00:23:25.528 --> 00:23:27.428
Without knowing what happened,

432
00:23:27.428 --> 00:23:30.828
she enthusiastically vowed to invite Eiko over for a visit someday.

433
00:23:32.528 --> 00:23:34.828
A postcard?

434
00:23:34.828 --> 00:23:37.228
Hey! Conan, how's it?

435
00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:40.328
Today, Kaede Nakakita is as energetic as always.

436
00:23:40.328 --> 00:23:42.228
Conan, come visit me some time.

437
00:23:42.228 --> 00:23:45.628
I shall make you my hubby!

438
00:23:45.628 --> 00:23:47.528
Your hubby...

439
00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:49.128
You wish...

440
00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:50.928
"Next Episode"

441
00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:53.528
Just as expected of Okayama that's famous for peaches!

442
00:23:53.528 --> 00:23:56.028
Even the ladies are nice and peachy.

443
00:23:56.028 --> 00:23:59.428
Please find out who I am and where I'm from!

444
00:23:59.428 --> 00:24:01.528
A jewelry shop robbery?

445
00:24:01.528 --> 00:24:04.628
My big brother clearly told me,

446
00:24:04.628 --> 00:24:06.628
that he's innocent.

447
00:24:06.628 --> 00:24:07.928
Nothing...

448
00:24:07.928 --> 00:24:10.028
I remember nothing.

449
00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:13.028
"If you want to learn about your past, be alone."

450
00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:14.228
That's a bad sign.

451
00:24:14.228 --> 00:24:15.528
Next Conan,

452
00:24:15.528 --> 00:24:19.791
"The Memory Trip of the Eight Sketches (Okayama Part)"

453
00:24:20.638 --> 00:24:23.038
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:23.038 --> 00:24:25.038
"Water zither cave (Suikinkutsu)"

455
00:24:25.038 --> 00:24:27.038
The next story is the Okayama and Kurashiki Mystery Tour.

456
00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:28.038
Even those of you who couldn't go,

457
00:24:28.038 --> 00:24:29.675
can still enjoy a real deduction experience.
