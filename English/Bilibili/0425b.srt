1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,982
I stake out in the condominium unit

2
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,782
where I can see the house across from the window.

3
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:06,782
The ex-fiancee of a crime suspect lives in that condominium

4
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:09,882
and since there is a possibility of that suspect making contact with her,

5
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:14,182
we got permission from the management company and were staking out.

6
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,582
Just as I thought.

7
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:17,682
Just as you thought?

8
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:23,282
In the end, the suspect was arrested in Toriya-cho.

9
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:26,082
The stake out was cancelled at around midnight.

10
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,582
But since we're still investigating on the case

11
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:31,582
so the management company was told not to say anything.

12
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:35,282
And yet, how did you know I was staking out?

13
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,882
Officer Takagi.

14
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:38,482
While you're staking out,

15
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,582
didn't you doodle on the glass door?

16
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:43,782
You wrote "Miwako Takagi".

17
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:47,782
What is it, Officer Takagi?

18
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:48,982
Officer Takagi.

19
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,182
What's with him?

20
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:55,382
-I'm sorry! -He sure is acting jittery.

21
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:58,982
Conan, please don't tell her about this.

22
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,182
Okay?

23
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:02,482
Okay. I understand.

24
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:06,982
But Ran and Pops are here too!

25
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,082
No way!

26
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:12,982
Takagi!

27
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,782
Which means that while Officer Takagi

28
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:18,282
were staking out the ex-fiance of the suspect,

29
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:21,282
he was reminded of Officer Sato.

30
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,982
And as he was fantasizing marrying her,

31
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:26,682
he wrote that name on the glass door.

32
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:31,482
Right after that, he got a call from Inspector Megure

33
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:35,582
telling him that the suspect was caught.

34
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,182
As he left in a hurry,

35
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:40,682
so he forgot to erase the name on the glass door.

36
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:41,882
I see!

37
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:44,582
So as three days went by, the first two words of his last name

38
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,982
and the last word of Officer Sato's first name disappeared.

39
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,682
Come on. What a nuisance!

40
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,182
I'm sorry!

41
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:54,882
But it's just like him and kind of nice.

42
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:59,682
Really. That's so much unlike an officer and sort of cute.

43
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,782
I know, right?

44
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:04,082
But now we're back to where we started.

45
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,782
Yes..

46
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:09,282
And tomorrow is already the Saturday in question.

47
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:16,682
The only thing we can do now is to arrest the culprit in the act.

48
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:19,382
Ms. Rena!

49
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:21,282
Yes?

50
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:24,282
Please let us spend the night here today!

51
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:30,582
I, Kogoro Mouri, will nab that lowly and dirty guy tomorrow!

52
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:43,982
Shall I help you clean up?

53
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:45,282
Don't worry about it.

54
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,482
Tomorrow is recyclable trash day.

55
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:50,782
So all I'm doing is getting together magazines and newspapers

56
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:52,982
and tying them together.

57
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:56,682
I'm required read a lot of newspapers and magazines on the job so...

58
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:00,282
You're cleaning up?

59
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,382
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

60
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,082
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

61
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,582
How nostalgic.

62
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:10,982
I read it during my junior high school days and was really scared.

63
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:14,682
Conan, do you know this story?

64
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:15,682
Yep...

65
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:18,882
Dr. Henry Jekyll, who has a peaceful personality,

66
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:22,382
drinks the drug that he invented

67
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:25,382
and becomes Mr. Edward Hyde, a man with an evil personality.

68
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:27,782
A story about dual personality, right?

69
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,582
You really know a lot.

70
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,382
You brat!

71
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:37,782
This brat knows a lot about weird things.

72
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:48,882
I'm really sorry.

73
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:49,982
Not at all.

74
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,182
Here.

75
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,082
Do you always leave it out here?

76
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:57,482
Yes.

77
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:58,982
If I leave it out here,

78
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:02,982
I can take them out as I go out in the morning.

79
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:04,982
I see.

80
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,382
Besides, this is a corner unit,

81
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,182
so it won't get in anyone's way if it's just for a night.

82
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,882
Is Tuesday also a trash day?

83
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:15,382
Yes. For combustible trash.

84
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:19,782
I leave the trash for Tuesday out here on the day before too.

85
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,282
I see.

86
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:23,482
So that's the story.

87
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:26,382
Hey. Even if we figure out who the culprit is,

88
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,882
will you promise not to get too angry?

89
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:32,882
I'm sure he's a great fan of yours!

90
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:36,482
I'm sure he is!

91
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,082
After all, he's a stalker.

92
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,229
Well, if you don't want to tell us about it, it can't be helped.

93
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,029
Let's go to the police, your parents and all

94
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,129
and get a good teaching there.

95
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,329
I think he rung the doorbell to wake her up.

96
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:10,329
So that Rena would make it in time for "Morning Live Seven".

97
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,829
I'm sure he thought that Ms. Rena isn't on "Morning Live Seven"

98
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,329
because she can't get up in the morning.

99
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:24,129
That's why he used to ring the doorbell at 6:30 am on Saturdays!

100
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,229
Since there's no school on Saturdays,

101
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,029
if he rushes home right after he rings the doorbell,

102
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,729
he can also confirm whether she's on the program or not!

103
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,529
But somebody pushed the doorbell on just one Tuesday too, right?

104
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:40,229
Don't tell me that you skipped school and...

105
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,329
I think there was no school.

106
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,829
There are consecutive days off in October, that is, the second Monday

107
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,129
because it's sports day.

108
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:50,029
If field day is held on that Monday,

109
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,129
usually, there is no school for grade school kids

110
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,829
on the following Tuesday.

111
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,629
Which means that he placed the sleeping pills there,

112
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:01,329
so Rena could sleep well and get up early in the morning.

113
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,429
Yep.

114
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,829
Because mother used to drink it saying she could sleep very well.

115
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,129
I see.

116
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,329
But why?

117
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,329
Why do you do so much for me?

118
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,329
Because you look like her.

119
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,829
You look like my mother.

120
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:32,029
My mother died last year of a traffic accident.

121
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,129
What?

122
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:39,229
That's why...

123
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:40,329
Sonny.

124
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,529
I understand that you're lonely because your mother's gone.

125
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,129
But if you keep clinging onto to your mother,

126
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,429
you'll only worry your mother who is in the heaven.

127
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,929
You're a boy,

128
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:56,229
so you got to be strong and let your mother rest in peace.

129
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:59,229
So, you shouldn't come here anymore.

130
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:01,229
For your mother's sake.

131
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,829
For your own sake too.

132
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:05,729
Understand?

133
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,529
Yep.

134
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,529
Bye, miss!

135
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:16,529
Bye.

136
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:25,729
It just...

137
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:29,529
I had a little brother about his age too back then.

138
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,029
Rather than that,

139
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,329
I have to pay you for detective fees.

140
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,829
Oh, no need for that!

141
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,529
We had dinner here too.

142
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,929
But...

143
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,629
Let me pay you at least as a token of my appreciation.

144
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,729
Oh, really?

145
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:51,829
Then I'll mail my bank account number to you later.

146
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,329
So can you give me your email address?

147
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,129
Hey...

148
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,529
Geez...

149
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,729
What a stale case it was...

150
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,529
But I'm glad that it turned out well.

151
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,829
It wasn't a weird stalker or anything.

152
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:10,929
Rain.

153
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,729
This is bad. I didn't retrieve the transmitter!

154
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,229
What's wrong, Conan?

155
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:46,429
I seem to have forgot something in Ms. Rena's house earlier.

156
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,429
What? Seriously.

157
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,029
Dad, you can go on ahead.

158
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,029
I'll go with Conan.

159
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:53,729
I'll go get it right away.

160
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,329
What? Conan.

161
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,629
Then we'll be waiting for you in the parking lot then!

162
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,029
Footsteps? Which means that...

163
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,829
Ms. Mizunashi stepped on it.

164
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,329
The sound of a cell phone being switched on.

165
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,729
"Seven Kids"!

166
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,129
Don't tell me...

167
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,929
Don't tell me that she...

168
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,629
Yes.

169
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,129
Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:49,029
I had a bit of a problem and had my cell phone switched off.

171
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,329
It's all right.

172
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,429
It was no big thing.

173
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:55,829
I reported it to the person concerned by e-mail just now.

174
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,729
Don't tell me...

175
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:01,329
Yes. No problem.

176
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,529
Let's meet as we were scheduled to at 10 am.

177
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:07,329
Gin.

178
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,329
What?

179
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:14,329
Why?
