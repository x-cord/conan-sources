1
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:06,748
"Ki-Bi-Wa".

2
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:09,050
What's this supposed to mean?

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,653
I wonder what "Ki-Bi-Wa" means?

4
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:12,654
"Bi"?

5
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:15,657
What? I wonder why I read the kanji character as "Mi"?

6
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:18,159
"Ki-Bi-Wa".

7
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,461
Thursday. (Same kanji character as Thursday)

8
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:20,562
Beauty. (Same kanji character as beauty)

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,763
Japanese cuisine. (Same kanji character as Japanese cuisine)

10
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:26,368
What is it?

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,469
Ms. Rena.

12
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:30,672
Haven't you done a TV program having key words like those?

13
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:31,940
No.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,844
Rather, maybe it's somebody's name?

15
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:36,845
Somebody's...

16
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:38,246
Somebody's name?

17
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:43,251
Yes, First Investigation Division.

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,053
Megure speaking...

19
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,355
Conan!

20
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,859
Yeah. I think he's here.

21
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,360
Hold on a second.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,463
Let's see, the hold button...

23
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,365
So, that's the story.

24
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:58,867
Takagi, your extension is ringing.

25
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,368
Yeah.

26
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,569
Yes! Takagi here.

27
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:02,570
Officer Takagi!

28
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,772
What?

29
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,341
Inspector, didn't I teach you already?

30
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:08,443
About extension number...

31
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,744
Well, no big deal!

32
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:13,648
Oh yeah. Never mind that. Officer Takagi, from Conan on number one.

33
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:16,251
What? From Conan?

34
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,253
I wonder what he wants.

35
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,954
From Conan?

36
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,856
Yes. This is Takagi.

37
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:23,858
Oh, Officer Takagi?

38
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:26,962
There's something I'd like to ask you.

39
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,563
Three nights ago,

40
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:32,367
didn't you go inside unit 305 of a condominium Haido-cho?

41
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,769
Yeah.

42
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,539
I did.

43
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,540
The reason?

44
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,842
So, this vehicle was under...

45
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:43,345
I can't really tell you why...

46
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:45,847
Were you by any chance, Officer Takagi,

47
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:48,750
on a stake out the house of the condominium the other side?

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,751
-What? -What?

49
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,954
What?

50
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:54,756
Is anything the matter?

51
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:58,059
No, not really. It's nothing.

52
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,261
I wonder what's going on.

53
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:03,565
To be honest with you, that's right.

54
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:04,966
I stake out in the condominium unit

55
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,768
where I can see the house across from the window.

56
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:10,772
The ex-fiancee of a crime suspect lives in that condominium

57
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:13,842
and since there is a possibility of that suspect making contact with her,

58
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:18,146
we got permission from the management company and were staking out.

59
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:20,548
Just as I thought.

60
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:21,649
Just as you thought?

61
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:27,255
In the end, the suspect was arrested in Toriya-cho.

62
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:30,058
The stake out was cancelled at around midnight.

63
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:31,559
But since we're still investigating on the case

64
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:35,563
so the management company was told not to say anything.

65
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:39,267
And yet, how did you know I was staking out?

66
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,869
Officer Takagi.

67
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,470
While you're staking out,

68
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,540
didn't you doodle on the glass door?

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,742
You wrote "Miwako Takagi".

70
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,746
What is it, Officer Takagi?

71
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:52,947
Officer Takagi.

72
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:55,150
What's with him?

73
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,354
-I'm sorry! -He sure is acting jittery.

74
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:02,957
Conan, please don't tell her about this.

75
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,159
Okay?

76
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,461
Okay. I understand.

77
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,965
But Ran and Pops are here too!

78
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,070
No way!

79
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,971
Takagi!

80
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,740
Which means that while Officer Takagi

81
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,243
were staking out the ex-fiance of the suspect,

82
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,246
he was reminded of Officer Sato.

83
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,949
And as he was fantasizing marrying her,

84
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,652
he wrote that name on the glass door.

85
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:35,457
Right after that, he got a call from Inspector Megure

86
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:39,561
telling him that the suspect was caught.

87
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,162
As he left in a hurry,

88
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:44,666
so he forgot to erase the name on the glass door.

89
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,867
I see!

90
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,570
So as three days went by, the first two words of his last name

91
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,939
and the last word of Officer Sato's first name disappeared.

92
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,642
Come on. What a nuisance!

93
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,144
I'm sorry!

94
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,847
But it's just like him and kind of nice.

95
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:03,651
Really. That's so much unlike an officer and sort of cute.

96
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,752
I know, right?

97
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:08,056
But now we're back to where we started.

98
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:10,758
Yes..

99
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,261
And tomorrow is already the Saturday in question.

100
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,668
The only thing we can do now is to arrest the culprit in the act.

101
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,371
Ms. Rena!

102
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:25,240
Yes?

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,243
Please let us spend the night here today!

104
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:34,549
I, Kogoro Mouri, will nab that lowly and dirty guy tomorrow!

105
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,962
Shall I help you clean up?

106
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:49,264
Don't worry about it.

107
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,466
Tomorrow is recyclable trash day.

108
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,769
So all I'm doing is getting together magazines and newspapers

109
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,971
and tying them together.

110
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,642
I'm required read a lot of newspapers and magazines on the job so...

111
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,245
You're cleaning up?

112
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,348
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

113
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,050
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

114
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,553
How nostalgic.

115
00:05:11,553 --> 00:05:14,956
I read it during my junior high school days and was really scared.

116
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,660
Conan, do you know this story?

117
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,661
Yep...

118
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,864
Dr. Henry Jekyll, who has a peaceful personality,

119
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,367
drinks the drug that he invented

120
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,370
and becomes Mr. Edward Hyde, a man with an evil personality.

121
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,739
A story about dual personality, right?

122
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,543
You really know a lot.

123
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,345
You brat!

124
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:41,749
This brat knows a lot about weird things.

125
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm really sorry.

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,962
Not at all.

127
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,165
Here.

128
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:59,067
Do you always leave it out here?

129
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,469
Yes.

130
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,971
If I leave it out here,

131
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:06,941
I can take them out as I go out in the morning.

132
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:08,943
I see.

133
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,346
Besides, this is a corner unit,

134
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:14,148
so it won't get in anyone's way if it's just for a night.

135
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:16,851
Is Tuesday also a trash day?

136
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,354
Yes. For combustible trash.

137
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:23,758
I leave the trash for Tuesday out here on the day before too.

138
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,259
I see.

139
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,462
So that's the story.

140
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:30,365
Hey. Even if we figure out who the culprit is,

141
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:33,868
will you promise not to get too angry?

142
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:36,871
I'm sure he's a great fan of yours!

143
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,441
I'm sure he is!

144
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,044
After all, he's a stalker.

145
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,503
Wake up, Pops.

146
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:09,704
Pops!

147
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:17,412
Pops. It's almost time.

148
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,517
Here it comes?

149
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,619
Please stay where you are, Ms. Rena!

150
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:26,087
Just you wait!

151
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:27,589
You rat.

152
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,591
I'm going to nab you right now.

153
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,094
And teach you a lesson!

154
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,295
What?

155
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,199
Dad?

156
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,302
Nobody's here.

157
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:44,906
No way!

158
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,007
You gotta be kidding?

159
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,509
How can it be?

160
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,510
I don't believe it!

161
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,912
It can't be! How?

162
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,413
How's it possible, Dad?

163
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,315
How should I know?

164
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,387
Right here.

165
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,889
He's here.

166
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,290
You said he's there?

167
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,092
Those are magazines!

168
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,793
Conan...

169
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,795
I mean, behind here.

170
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:13,001
Idiot! How can an adult be hiding in a place like that?

171
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,205
A...

172
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,506
A child?

173
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,009
You brat!

174
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,010
Was it you?

175
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,312
So you're the one who's been pushing the doorbell and running away!

176
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:29,817
I see! He wasn't found because he was a child.

177
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:33,888
I didn't think that someone would be hiding in a place like that.

178
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,590
I see.

179
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,793
You didn't do anything the Saturday the week before last week

180
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:42,697
because there were no stacks of magazines in front of the door, right?

181
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:45,600
That week Ms. Rena was out on a business trip and wasn't home,

182
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,803
and probably didn't have that many magazines to recycle!

183
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,805
Hey, what were you doing?

184
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,307
Why did you do what you did for?

185
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,109
You're an elementary school student, aren't you?

186
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:02,216
Well, if you don't want to tell us about it, it can't be helped.

187
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,018
Let's go to the police, your parents and all

188
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:05,086
and get a good teaching there.

189
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,290
I think he rung the doorbell to wake her up.

190
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:14,295
So that Rena would make it in time for "Morning Live Seven".

191
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:19,801
I'm sure he thought that Ms. Rena isn't on "Morning Live Seven"

192
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,304
because she can't get up in the morning.

193
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:28,109
That's why he used to ring the doorbell at 6:30 am on Saturdays!

194
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,211
Since there's no school on Saturdays,

195
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,014
if he rushes home right after he rings the doorbell,

196
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:36,718
he can also confirm whether she's on the program or not!

197
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:40,488
But somebody pushed the doorbell on just one Tuesday too, right?

198
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:44,192
Don't tell me that you skipped school and...

199
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,294
I think there was no school.

200
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:49,797
There are consecutive days off in October, that is, the second Monday

201
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,099
because it's sports day.

202
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:54,002
If field day is held on that Monday,

203
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,104
usually, there is no school for grade school kids

204
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:58,806
on the following Tuesday.

205
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,610
Which means that he placed the sleeping pills there,

206
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,313
so Rena could sleep well and get up early in the morning.

207
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,414
Yep.

208
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:09,817
Because mother used to drink it saying she could sleep very well.

209
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,119
I see.

210
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:21,295
But why?

211
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:23,297
Why do you do so much for me?

212
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:27,301
Because you look like her.

213
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,804
You look like my mother.

214
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:36,010
My mother died last year of a traffic accident.

215
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,111
What?

216
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:43,217
That's why...

217
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:44,318
Sonny.

218
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:49,490
I understand that you're lonely because your mother's gone.

219
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,093
But if you keep clinging onto to your mother,

220
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,396
you'll only worry your mother who is in the heaven.

221
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:56,898
You're a boy,

222
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:00,201
so you got to be strong and let your mother rest in peace.

223
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,204
So, you shouldn't come here anymore.

224
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,206
For your mother's sake.

225
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,808
For your own sake too.

226
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,710
Understand?

227
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,512
Yep.

228
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:16,517
Bye, miss!

229
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:20,488
Bye.

230
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,697
It just...

231
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:33,501
I had a little brother about his age too back then.

232
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,006
Rather than that,

233
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:42,310
I have to pay you for detective fees.

234
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,811
Oh, no need for that!

235
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:46,514
We had dinner here too.

236
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:47,915
But...

237
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,617
Let me pay you at least as a token of my appreciation.

238
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,686
Oh, really?

239
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:55,790
Then I'll mail my bank account number to you later.

240
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,292
So can you give me your email address?

241
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,096
Hey...

242
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,499
Geez...

243
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,701
What a stale case it was...

244
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,503
But I'm glad that it turned out well.

245
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:10,805
It wasn't a weird stalker or anything.

246
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,909
Rain.

247
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,701
This is bad. I didn't retrieve the transmitter!

248
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,206
What's wrong, Conan?

249
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:50,411
I seem to have forgot something in Ms. Rena's house earlier.

250
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,413
What? Seriously.

251
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,015
Dad, you can go on ahead.

252
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,017
I'll go with Conan.

253
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,718
I'll go get it right away.

254
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:00,288
What? Conan.

255
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,590
Then we'll be waiting for you in the parking lot then!

256
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:09,997
Footsteps? Which means that...

257
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,800
Ms. Mizunashi stepped on it.

258
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:18,306
The sound of a cell phone being switched on.

259
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,688
"Seven Kids"!

260
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:38,092
Don't tell me...

261
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,896
Don't tell me that she...

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,602
Yes.

263
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,103
Oh, I'm sorry.

264
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:53,007
I had a bit of a problem and had my cell phone switched off.

265
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:54,308
It's all right.

266
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:56,410
It was no big thing.

267
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,814
I reported it to the person concerned by e-mail just now.

268
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:02,717
Don't tell me...

269
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,286
Yes. No problem.

270
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:08,489
Let's meet as we were scheduled to at 10 am.

271
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:11,292
Gin.

272
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,295
What?

273
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,299
Why?
