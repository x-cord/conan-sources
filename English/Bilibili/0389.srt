1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,740
Deduction in Sakurajima!

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,640
Hand-made liquor brings about a sad result.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,740
Pops is drunk but the case is solved!

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,140
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,225 --> 00:02:00,225
We accompanied Pops and came to Kagoshima,

8
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:04,025
and visited the Takakuma Brewery, the maker of distilled spirits.

9
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,725
The crime occurred just as we were enjoying going sightseeing

10
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,725
guided by Fumiko, the wife of the president of the brewery.

11
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,825
The managing director Shinsuke Tatsumura

12
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:19,725
is taken away from his home by someone.

13
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,625
Two days later,

14
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,825
his dead body is found!

15
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:26,525
What? The killer is among us?

16
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:32,725
We can't find anybody who had a grudge against Mr. Tatsumura

17
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:36,125
other than the people of this brewery.

18
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,225
I'll bet Mrs. Shiraishi is in agony,

19
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,925
being that everyone close to her is being suspected.

20
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,625
But...

21
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,725
I'm sure the killer is among the people here.

22
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:57,925
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma (Part 2)"

23
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:05,225
How was it, after listening to each one's story?

24
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,725
Nothing gained.

25
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,725
Everyone has a motive and each person's alibi is not definite...

26
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,525
And yet, we don't have enough to go on to arrest anyone either.

27
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,025
Don't you? There are two things to go on...

28
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,425
Why did the killer go trough the trouble

29
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:21,525
of taking his corpse out of the house.

30
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,725
Moreover, why did the killer notify the police

31
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,825
of his whereabouts two days later?

32
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:28,425
If only both mysteries can be figured out...

33
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,925
Dad!

34
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:32,725
That's for being sassy saying something so obvious.

35
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,325
Why don't you hurry up and solve the mystery then?

36
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,625
Mr. Mouri, you're going to ask us questions again

37
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,925
"Satoshi Shiraishi (30)" -tomorrow, aren't you?

38
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,725
"Takakuma Brewery Owner" -Yes, from morning...

39
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,525
If it's okay with you, please spend the night at our home.

40
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:45,725
Ms. Maezono says she'll do so

41
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,725
because going back and forth is too much trouble.

42
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,025
That'll be a great help. I'd sure love to...

43
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,125
Okay.

44
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,125
He's not the killer.

45
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,525
If he were, he wouldn't let a detective spend the night at his house.

46
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,325
The ones who look most unsuspicious

47
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,425
are the ones who are most suspicious.

48
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:03,125
Talk about suspecting anything and everything.

49
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,025
This is no laughing matter,

50
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,925
I don't have the slightest idea either.

51
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:15,425
"Takakuma Brewery"

52
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,225
Two mysteries...

53
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:19,625
I'm sure there is an answer...

54
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,525
a reason why the killer had to do both.

55
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,425
Good morning!

56
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:27,825
Good morning.

57
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:30,925
It seems that everyone is already here and working.

58
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:35,425
I see. Making sake starts from early in the morning.

59
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,525
My husband gets up at 04:30 am

60
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,325
and goes into the storeroom at 05:00 am.

61
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,025
It sure is hard work.

62
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,725
Sake is a "living creature."

63
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,625
Once you start preparing it,

64
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,425
you cannot take your eyes off it.

65
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:50,925
"Fumiko Shiraishi (27)" -That's why you can't do something

66
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,625
"Satoshi's wife" -like leave the brewery to go kill someone.

67
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,325
You can't do something like that, can you?

68
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:58,125
I came to tell you that breakfast is ready.

69
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,925
-Thank you. -Thank you.

70
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,925
Anytime you're ready is fine.

71
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:06,425
"The workers who love sake making would never leave the brewery."

72
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,025
If that's true...

73
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,425
Dad, what're you laughing about?

74
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,525
I figured out the mystery, both of them.

75
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,425
Really?

76
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:22,825
The killer is Hitomi Maezono!

77
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,825
Why do you say it's her?

78
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,925
"Hitomi Maezono (25)" -Because she's the only woman among the suspects.

79
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,625
The first mystery,

80
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,325
why did she go through the trouble of carrying the corpse out of the house?

81
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:41,125
Mr. Tatsumura is has a stout physique,

82
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,325
so everybody would think that it is impossible for a woman to carry him.

83
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,525
That is, it would make people think

84
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,125
that a woman couldn't possibly be the killer.

85
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,425
It was a scheme to deceive others.

86
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,225
Then, what about the second mystery?

87
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:57,325
"Why did she notify the police of his whereabouts?"

88
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,825
Why else?

89
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,725
She wanted the dead to rest in peace as soon as possible.

90
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:04,325
Her kind womanly side took over.

91
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:08,325
Therefore, the killer is none other than and can only be Hitomi Maezono.

92
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,625
I wish Officer Shinfuku would hurry over here.

93
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,925
-I'll let him in on my perfect deduction... -But, Pops...

94
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:20,725
-What? -You said it's impossible for a woman to carry him,

95
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:23,225
and yet Ms. Maezono did so?

96
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:27,025
If it's impossible, I don't think she can.

97
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:33,125
Well, that's, you see, she may not look it but she's extremely strong.

98
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,825
I'm sure she's lifting weights or something.

99
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,125
Go take a peek in her room.

100
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:46,125
I'm sure she's got a super muscular body.

101
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,325
Don't worry, even if you take a peek,

102
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,225
since you're a child, she'll overlook it.

103
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:51,825
No darn way!

104
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,425
Help me out at work a little, kid!

105
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,925
Come on, how can you even think of making a child take a peek!

106
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:00,725
No, well, I'm talking in terms of pure detective work.

107
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,325
Give me a break.

108
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,125
"Seiichi Orita (60)" -No, it's not that I'm slacking off.

109
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,925
I'm taking a break, because we're changing shifts.

110
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:11,925
At this age we can't help but get exhausted.

111
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,325
How nostalgic thinking about times back then.

112
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,925
Is that you, sir?

113
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:22,725
20 years ago.

114
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,325
With Mr. Tatsumura,

115
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,825
and the person in the middle is the previous president,

116
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,725
who died last year.

117
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:29,825
And who are those children?

118
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,925
The current president.

119
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,325
He has a younger sister.

120
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:38,525
She's not his younger sister, but it's Fumiko, the president's wife.

121
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,325
They were childhood friends.

122
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,725
See, this guy next to me is her Dad.

123
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:46,725
We used to work here together.

124
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:56,125
The previous president only had one son.

125
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:00,125
So, he took care of her as if she were his own daughter.

126
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:05,125
Fumiko's father was also a very experienced worker

127
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,525
but poor thing, he died of an illness

128
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,625
soon after Fumiko entered junior high school.

129
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,725
But the previous president was not one to abandon the bereaved family.

130
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:19,025
He encouraged them and continued to help them out making a living.

131
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,525
He made sure Fumiko graduated from college.

132
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,225
He even helped her go through nursing school.

133
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,325
The previous president was a life-saver

134
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,025
for Fumiko and her mother, wasn't he?

135
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,725
Come to think of it...

136
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:36,625
Weren't you a nurse at the Chuo Hospital before?

137
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,525
Yes. I was, until 5 years ago when I got married.

138
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,825
She used to be a nurse before, right?

139
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,825
Yes. That's why she used her connections of the past

140
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:47,425
to get the managing director Tatsumura an appointment at Chuo Hospital.

141
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:48,625
An appointment?

142
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,125
For a physical exam.

143
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,425
He mentioned something like that the other day.

144
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:56,125
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

145
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:01,925
You see, the physical exam took longer than I expected...

146
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:04,425
If she knew the day before that something like that would happen to him,

147
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:07,325
I think Fumiko wouldn't have recommended him to get a physical.

148
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:08,625
You mean Mrs. Shiraishi is the one who recommended

149
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,925
the physical exam to Mr. Tatsumura?

150
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,625
There is a physical exam every year,

151
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,725
but the managing director never underwent one.

152
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,825
However, she kept insisting he get one because he was working too hard.

153
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,325
And, he was murdered the following day.

154
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:25,725
A physical exam?

155
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:26,825
Don't tell me that?

156
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,825
Is anything the matter?

157
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:29,825
No, not really.

158
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:32,125
Okay, I guess I'll go back to work then.

159
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,125
I need to get things done before the police come and questioning me again.

160
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,425
See you, sonny.

161
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,525
It's not impossible.

162
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,225
Rather, if that method was used,

163
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,925
the two mysteries will also be solved.

164
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:48,425
But, I have no proof.

165
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,825
Sakurajima.

166
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,625
If I remember correctly, back then...

167
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,625
That's right!

168
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,625
"Kagoshima North Police Station"

169
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,925
Mr. Mouri.

170
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,725
I was just thinking of heading that way...

171
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,725
I have a favor to ask you before you do...

172
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:07,625
Yes, I would like you to check Mr. Tatsumura's corpse for me.

173
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,325
No, what I want to know is whether on the clothes he was wearing...

174
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:18,625
Come on, show your super muscle physique!

175
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,225
Just what do you think you're looking at?

176
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:22,125
Officer Shinfuku and the others have arrived!

177
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,125
Yes, ma'am!

178
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,625
Goodness.

179
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,325
Getting right to the point,

180
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:31,025
the stuff was not found on his clothes at all.

181
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,125
What's this about?

182
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:35,725
All right. This is it...

183
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:38,325
You know, what you asked us to do a while ago...

184
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:41,725
Oh, no, Dad. You mean you asked a favor and forgot what you asked?

185
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:47,125
Oh, that stuff. Oh, so nothing was on at all...

186
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,625
He's really good at playing along.

187
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,025
And, who is it?

188
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,325
Who is what?

189
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,325
Didn't you say that you knew on the phone?

190
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:57,525
And you said you would reveal who the perpetrator when we are here.

191
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,325
Who is the killer?

192
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,225
Did you really say something like that?

193
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,525
I feel like I sort of did.

194
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,725
You see, the killer is...

195
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:07,025
a woman.

196
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,425
-Hitomi Maezono. -Hitomi Maezono.

197
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:09,625
Dad!

198
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,625
My reason for coming to that conclusion is...

199
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,825
Pops, this is your chance to show everyone your real ability.

200
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:15,925
I guess so.

201
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:29,825
This Managing Director Tatsumura's homicide case...

202
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:32,225
Who is the killer?

203
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,825
The real killer is...

204
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,425
Sakurajima?

205
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,025
Is something wrong with the mountain?

206
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,625
No, nothing in particular.

207
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,425
Officer Shinfuku!

208
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:57,925
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

209
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,047
What is it, Conan?

210
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,747
He's gone. Conan?

211
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:15,847
He probably went outside thinking that Sakurajima erupted or something.

212
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:19,447
Mr. Orita, this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

213
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,747
Excuse me, I'd like to take a picture.

214
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,047
Quiet!

215
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:25,647
In preparation for killing Mr. Tatsumura,

216
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,147
the killer also schemed an alibi trick.

217
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:33,947
-Alibi trick? -Alibi trick?

218
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:36,547
I had an idea of what the trick is,

219
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,047
but I needed proof.

220
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:41,747
And that's why I asked you to do me that favor.

221
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:43,847
The "ashes" of Sakurajima, you mean?

222
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,147
Yes, if there was any found on the clothes Mr. Tatsumura was wearing...

223
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,847
There was none whatsoever on his clothes.

224
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,047
However, I already checked

225
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:56,247
with the Kagoshima District Weather Station a while ago

226
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:57,647
and found that on the day of the incident,

227
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,947
in the Kagoshima city area where Mr. Tatsumura's house is,

228
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,347
ashes were falling all the way through,

229
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,447
from around noon to midnight.

230
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:11,347
Doesn't something feel sandy?

231
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:12,447
Now that you mentioned it...

232
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,747
It's probably the ashes.

233
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:18,147
Yes, ashes were falling back then.

234
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:19,847
Isn't it odd?

235
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:23,647
We arrived at his house at 6:00 in the evening.

236
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:29,247
If Mr. Tatsumura was killed and carried out just about that time,

237
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:33,647
it's only natural that ashes would have been on his clothes too.

238
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:40,247
But, there were no ashes on his clothes at all.

239
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:45,547
In other words, Mr. Tatsumura did not leave home at 6:00 sundown,

240
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,447
but before the ashes came falling

241
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,047
that is some time in the morning.

242
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,447
I see.

243
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,347
No, but then...

244
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,247
Yes, there's a discrepancy.

245
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,147
It's blood.

246
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:06,547
I wonder what that blood stain was, Mrs. Shiraishi.

247
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:15,247
I was mistaken about one thing.

248
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:20,647
The reason you went out of your way, that day to take us sightseeing...

249
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,547
I thought it was because Mr. Tatsumura asked me

250
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,447
to pose for advertisement of your product...

251
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:31,947
Mr. Mouri, please refuse what Mr. Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday.

252
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,147
I thought that you showed us around

253
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,747
because you wanted me to refuse his offer.

254
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:37,047
It wasn't?

255
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,147
You did so to establish your alibi

256
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:44,647
and to set us up as witnesses to testify that Mr. Tatsumura was killed

257
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:48,847
just before we arrived at his house.

258
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,547
Am I not right,

259
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,747
Mrs. Shiraishi.

260
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,447
No way...

261
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,547
Mr. Mouri.

262
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:01,647
I said a while ago that the real killer is a woman.

263
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:04,447
-A woman... -You're referring to Ms. Maezono?

264
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:09,147
I'm talking about Mrs. Fumiko Shiraishi.

265
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,647
You offered from your side to take us sightseeing.

266
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,447
That morning you...

267
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:20,947
made up some excuse and summoned Mr. Tatsumura out to the park.

268
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,047
Mrs. Shiraishi.

269
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,247
Mrs. Shiraishi.

270
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:32,447
She probably said something like, "I'd like to talk to you,"

271
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:35,247
and made him get in the car once more

272
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,047
and put him to sleep...

273
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,847
Getting anesthesia ready

274
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:43,647
and getting blood samples were easy for you to do

275
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,747
for you were a nurse before.

276
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,747
Then, after that you came to pick us up at the hotel.

277
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,347
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

278
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:53,347
-Good morning. -Good morning.

279
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,747
Good morning.

280
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,447
You spent the whole day with us

281
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,747
and cleverly lead us to Mr. Tatsumura's house.

282
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,547
It's open.

283
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,547
I'll go check inside.

284
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:10,047
Mr. Tatsumura, this is Fumiko.

285
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:15,447
And, you carried out what you schemed in the living room...

286
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,347
Mr. Mouri!

287
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,347
Mrs. Shiraishi!

288
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,647
What's the matter?

289
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,147
Out of the two mysteries one of them,

290
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:34,947
why did the killer go out of the way to carry the corpse out, rather...

291
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,347
you didn't carry him out.

292
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:41,647
There was no corpse in that house to begin.

293
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,947
But the lights in the house were on, weren't they?

294
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:49,247
Before you came to pick us up,

295
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:52,547
you borrowed the keys from Mr. Tatsumura who was asleep

296
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,747
went into his house, turned on the lights

297
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,447
as well as unlock the front entrance door at that time.

298
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,547
So, that's the story...

299
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:03,847
Hold on a second!

300
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,447
Now for the second mystery...

301
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,147
Wait, Wait a minute, I said.

302
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:14,247
What you're saying is strange. It's totally strange.

303
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,847
You seem to want to insist that Fumiko is the killer,

304
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:20,847
but she was with you all day that day.

305
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,547
There's no way she could've done it.

306
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:26,147
When on earth could she have done it?

307
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,947
Right, Dad, when?

308
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:33,847
Right after the you know what, right Mrs. Shiraishi?

309
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,947
I'm sorry to have gotten you involved in something bothersome like this.

310
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:44,947
After you dropped us off at the hotel...

311
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,947
That's when.

312
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,347
You got a bronze statue

313
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:05,147
just like the one at Mr. Tatsumura's house beforehand.

314
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:28,247
In other words, this case occurred after the police began investigation.

315
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,547
It was a blind spot.

316
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:32,747
It can't be helped.

317
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:37,147
No one ordinarily checks for alibis after the investigation starts.

318
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:42,047
You tried to make us think that the estimated time of the murder

319
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,947
was just before we arrived at Mr. Tatsumura's residence.

320
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:48,347
Doing so would give you a perfect alibi.

321
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:52,047
Because after all you were with us right through.

322
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:54,347
The second mystery...

323
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,447
Why did the killer notify the police

324
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:59,547
of the whereabouts of the corpse two days later?

325
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:01,347
Two days having past,

326
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,247
it's hard to determine an accurate estimate,

327
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,247
but there seems to be no doubt that the time of death

328
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,447
is between sundown to night that day.

329
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,447
If the corpse was discovered immediately,

330
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,647
the estimated time of death would come out accurately.

331
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,947
On the other hand, if the corpse is left as is for many days,

332
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:15,847
it would be impossible to figure it out.

333
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:19,547
Either way, would make meaningless the alibi that is perfect.

334
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:24,247
That's why it was best for the corpse to be found two days later.

335
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,847
Mr. Mouri, when and how did you figure out I committed the murder?

336
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,347
On the day before the incident,

337
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:34,047
you recommended Mr. Tatsumura to go get a physical exam, didn't you?

338
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,547
That...

339
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,047
What do you mean?

340
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:41,047
If you take a blood sample, the trace of the needle would be left behind,

341
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,147
and that would bring about suspicion during the autopsy.

342
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:48,147
But, if he gets a physical the day before,

343
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:51,347
blood samples would naturally be taken.

344
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:54,047
In other words, she injected him in the exact same place

345
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,747
that he was injected the day before.

346
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,247
I see.

347
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,347
But, why...

348
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:03,047
Why did you kill Mr. Tatsumura?

349
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,347
I was scared.

350
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:08,247
I thought that if he kept on staying at this brewery,

351
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:11,547
one day someone would be influenced by him

352
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:13,447
and stop making sake the old way,

353
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:16,147
as a result dropping the quality of our sake.

354
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,047
That someone who was concerned only about making money

355
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,447
would one day come along.

356
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:21,847
No way, Mrs. Shiraishi.

357
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,647
Not among anyone of us, never!

358
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,147
Maybe now...

359
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:29,647
But, people change when various things happen.

360
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:33,347
Mr. Tatsumura... changed too, didn't he?

361
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,047
I'm to blame. I'm... to blame for all this...

362
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:38,347
I should've fired him.

363
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:41,147
Not being able to get rid of somebody who saved the brewery

364
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:44,447
is one of your good points. It's okay.

365
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:47,447
But, why... why did you...

366
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,447
I just wanted to look good.

367
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:55,147
I wanted to say, I'm the one who saved this brewery.

368
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:59,547
Of course she is not be forgiven for killing someone.

369
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:06,047
But, she did what she did wanting to repay your father for his kindness.

370
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,347
To father...

371
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,647
One who never forgets a kindness received.

372
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:15,247
Your wife is just like you, a woman of Satsuma for sure.

373
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,447
Fumiko.

374
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,147
Of course we're alike.

375
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,847
We're husband and wife.

376
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,247
Don't bother seeing me off.

377
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:42,747
You have to hurry back to the brewery.

378
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:44,247
Mrs. Shiraishi...

379
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:45,847
Fumiko...

380
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,347
There are people throughout Japan

381
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:49,947
who are waiting for the sake that you make.

382
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:52,247
I'll wait for you too.

383
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:53,947
I'll wait till you come back

384
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,747
while continuing to make genuine sake.

385
00:21:56,847 --> 00:22:00,847
A case was thus, closed.

386
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,247
They don't have it here after all, the Takakuma.

387
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:39,747
Takakuma, Takakuma...

388
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:42,447
Who cares, I'll just get anything that's around!

389
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:46,947
You're still buying?

390
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:50,247
It's more quantity than quality after all...

391
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,847
Black vinegar is good for the health.

392
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,347
Like father like daughter, really...

393
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:02,447
"Next Episode"

394
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,447
Good morning.

395
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,347
Is there anything on my face?

396
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:19,147
We saw a suspicious looking person on our way to school.

397
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:23,847
Officer Sato.

398
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:25,347
Next Conan,

399
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:29,547
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 1)"

400
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,874
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:34,474
"The news"

402
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,974
The next episode is Love Story 6?

403
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,074
I think this will continue till the 100th episode.

404
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:39,474
I feel sorry for the two.
