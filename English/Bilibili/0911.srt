Raise your head, inspector.

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,370
It must be a pretty big case if Inspector Megure is this desperate.

He said he was Mr. Reigan's nephew.

Maihama purchased the knife that was the murder weapon.

"Yutaka Reigan Murder Investigation HQ" -On the night of the murder,

Maihama claims he was in his apartment in Sasago-cho,

00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,628
but no one can verify his alibi.

48
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:21,228
He also claims he purchased but lost the knife.

Maihama is Reigan's only living relative.

50
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,828
Apparently he was telling everyone that Reigan's fortune

51
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,928
would eventually become his.

His uncle's fortune was his motive

57
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:01,428
and he bought the knife the day before.

I didn't do it.

63
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:23,328
Even after his arrest, Maihama continued to deny that he did it,

64
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,728
but naturally, we could still prosecute.

65
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:30,628
However, yesterday, with two days remaining on his detention period,

66
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,228
he gave an unbelievable statement.

67
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:34,628
Which was?

68
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,428
At this rate, I'm going to be framed for murder,

70
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,928
I actually have an alibi.

71
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,628
An alibi?

The night my uncle was killed,

73
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:52,028

75
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,028
This is it.

"Sasago-cho Burglar"

77
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:02,328
Now that you mention it, I remember that case.

78
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,228
A burglar entered a home in Sasago-cho.

79
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,728
After staying there for over an hour,

80
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:11,428
he stole about 500 thousand yen in cash.

81
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:17,028
The burglar's face wasn't seen but Maihama claims it was him.

82
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:23,028
While I was there, I had something to drink and eat.

83
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,828
It's true that the burglar drank and ate.

84
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:30,728
The teeth marks we collected from the food matched Maihama's.

85
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:33,528
We even found the 500 thousand yen he hid.

86
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:40,928
Maihama was definitely the burglar.

87
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:46,028
But if that's true, then he has an alibi.

88
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:47,128
An alibi?

89
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,828
How?

90
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:53,328
The burglar entered the home in Sasago-cho at 7 pm.

91
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,328
Since he was there for over an hour,

92
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:59,028
he left after 8 pm.

93
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:03,228
Meanwhile, Reigan was murdered in his home in Yotsubadai

94
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,028
around 8 pm as well.

95
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:07,528
It takes over an hour by car to travel

96
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,028
between Sasago-cho and Yotsubadai.

97
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:13,528
So it was impossible for Maihama to murder Reigan.

98
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:18,228
But, Inspector... There's a witness who says

99
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:21,328
he saw Maihama at the crime scene at the time of the murder.

100
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:24,928
Yesterday, that witness said...

101
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:28,228
I actually lied about seeing him.

102
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,928
What?

103
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,028
He seemed like a bad guy when I saw him at the bar,

104
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,228
so I thought I'd frame him.

105
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,028
But I felt guilty about it.

106
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,228
I'm sorry for making it up.

107
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,028
-He made it up? -He made it up?

108
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,428
Furthermore, regarding the knife...

109
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:47,928
I bought it to use during the burglary.

110
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:51,828
I buried it behind my apartment building after I used it.

111
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,728
This is it.

112
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:58,528
It's the same as the one found in Reigan's body.

113
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,528
He must've planned all of it

114
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,928
so he wouldn't lose his inheritance

115
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:06,528
and to avoid being convicted of murder.

116
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,128
It's too convenient.

117
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:13,328
It's obvious he'd be a suspect if Reigan were murdered

118
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,728
so he allowed himself to be arrested

119
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,228
so he could overturn it.

120
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:21,928
The witness who went back on his testimony

121
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:24,428
is working with him, of course.

122
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:29,328
He probably just bought another one of these knives.

123
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:35,028
I know he committed the burglary to create an alibi.

124
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:40,428
The problem is how in two locations, separated by an hour's travel,

125
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:44,128
a single human committed a burglary in Sasago-cho

126
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,128
while murdering Reigan in Yotsubadai.

127
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,128
Unless we can solve that,

128
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,928
even if we can prosecute him for the burglary,

129
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:56,228
which was material evidence, we can't prosecute him for Reigan's murder.

130
00:08:56,228 --> 00:09:02,928
So we spent all day yesterday trying to solve the problem.

131
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:06,428
However, we ran into a dead end.

132
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:11,228
That's why I'm asking for your help!

133
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:16,628
Inspector, I, Kogoro Mouri, shall assist you!

134
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:20,128
Honestly, I have no faith in you.

135
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:25,028
But when you're asleep, your detective skills become mind-boggling.

136
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,828
Well, I'm not sure how to respond to that.

137
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:30,728
A burglary and a murder

138
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:33,428
in two different places at the same time.

139
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,128
I've got it, Inspector.

140
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:47,528
Immediately after committing the burglary in Sasago-cho,

141
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,728
he killed Reigan who he'd asked to meet him nearby.

142
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:53,728
Then he put the body in a car

143
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:57,128
and drove it to Reigan's home in Yotsubadai.

144
00:09:57,128 --> 00:10:00,228
Listen, Mouri.

145
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,628
Wouldn't the forensics team have noticed

146
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:06,728
if the body had been moved?

147
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:10,328
Reigan was murdered inside his own home.

148
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:14,328
There's no sign the murder was staged.

149
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:17,928
If anything was staged, it was the burglary.

150
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,728
Of course. Go away.

151
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:25,028
About the burglary.

152
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:29,628
It's strange that he stayed there for an entire hour.

153
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:35,428
We're certain that the burglar entered the home in Sasago-cho at 7 pm.

154
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,728
Hide Tenyama, who lives alone,

155
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:43,028
had just begun to watch the 7 pm news while eating dinner.

156
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:44,128
Don't move.

157
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:46,128
Move and I'll kill you.

158
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:52,028
"Hide Tenyama (73), Victim" -And I don't want you seeing my face.

159
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,028
Where's the money?

160
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:58,428
Don't underestimate me!

161
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:02,228
Though she tried to tell him where she kept her money,

162
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,428
Ms. Hide was suddenly struck and lost consciousness.

163
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:09,028
She awoke an hour later at 8 pm.

164
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:13,728
She heard the sounds of a TV show that starts at 8 pm.

165
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,528
You're finally awake.

166
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:18,628
I looked for your money,

167
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,028
but I couldn't find it, so I've been waiting.

168
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,628
Where's the money?

169
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:25,828
In the middle drawer of the dresser.

170
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:30,428
Thank you. I can't have you calling the police right away.

171
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:38,328
The second time Ms. Hide awoke was the next morning.

172
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,928
What is this?

173
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:51,128
The money! The money in the dresser!

174
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,628
Hello, police?

175
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:59,128
I've been...

176
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,228
I've been burglarized!

177
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:08,928
I see. So that's how it is.

178
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,628
Hey, Pops.

179
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,128
I've figured it out, Inspector.

180
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,228
Huh?

181
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:15,428
Really?

182
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:18,528
Maihama stepped out for a while.

183
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,528
There are two points to focus on.

184
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:23,228
First, that Maihama blindfolded Ms. Hide,

185
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:26,528
and second, that he knocked her out twice.

186
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,828
Don't underestimate me!

187
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:32,728
After entering at 7 pm and knocking Ms. Hide unconscious,

188
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:34,428
Maihama recorded the TV program.

189
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:40,328
He quickly drove to Yotsubadai and murdered Reigan.

190
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,328
It happened after 8 pm.

191
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:47,128
Then he returned to Sasago-cho,

192
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:50,128
replayed the video he recorded,

193
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:53,628
and woke Ms. Hide.

194
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,828
It was probably after 9 pm by then,

195
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:01,228
but because of the audio of the TV show Maihama recorded,

196
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,628
he made her believe it was 8 pm.

197
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:06,928
In the middle drawer of the dresser.

198
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:10,428
Then he knocked out Ms. Hide again,

199
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:15,128
and made it appear as though he'd been there for an hour.

200
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,528
In other words,

201
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:20,028
Maihama wasn't in Ms. Hide's home the whole time after he entered.

202
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:23,628
He left and traveled back and forth to Yotsubadai

203
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:26,928
while Ms. Hide was knocked out.

204
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:30,928
Amazing. That's perfect, Pops.

205
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:33,628
This is the first time the Inspector's asked for my help.

206
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:36,028
How could I disappoint him?

207
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,328
Mouri.

208
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:42,128
No, it was an honor to serve you.

209
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:46,428
Actually, we considered that possibility.

210
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:48,028
However, it's impossible.

211
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,028
Huh?

212
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:54,928
I forgot to mention that when Ms. Hide Tenyama awoke,

213
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,128
she heard not only the sounds of the TV show,

214
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,628
but also a fire truck siren.

215
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:06,528
Maihama demanded the location of the money while she could hear that.

216
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,228
We confirmed with the fire department

217
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:11,028
that 8 pm was the only time

218
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:13,328
a fire truck was dispatched in Sasago-cho that night.

219
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,728
Which means...

220
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:20,228
Yeah. Maihama never left.

221
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:21,928
No way.

222
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:28,528
If he didn't want his face to be seen, he only needed to wear a mask.

223
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:33,628
There must be some reason he blocked Ms. Hide's vision.

224
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:36,328
But why?

225
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,495
The question is at 8 pm that night,

226
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:53,795
Ryuji Maihama was threatening Ms. Hide Tenyama in Sasago-cho.

227
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:57,995
So how did he kill Reigan in Yotsubadai?

228
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:02,695
Is it not coming yet?

229
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,795
What? Who's coming?

230
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:10,295
Not who, but those weird exclamations you always make.

231
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:13,195
It's not that convenient.

232
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:16,295
But, Inspector,

233
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:21,395
are we sure Ms. Hide heard the fire truck siren?

234
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:25,295
Yeah. We checked with her, so I'm certain of it.

235
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:27,595
Yes. I know I heard it.

236
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:32,095
And I smelled something burning.

237
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,695
Smelled something burning?

238
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:38,595
It doesn't make sense that she smelled anything though.

239
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:42,295
Apparently it was a prank call.

240
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:46,495
In other words, there was no fire.

241
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:47,895
Yeah.

242
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:51,395
But a fire truck was still dispatched.

243
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:55,895
Maybe hearing the siren made her think she smelled something.

244
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:57,995
Probably.

245
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:01,695
She seemed to have it together but she's an old woman.

246
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,195
She was confused about all sorts of things.

247
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:06,895
Did she mention something else?

248
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:07,895
Yeah.

249
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,995
She claimed she didn't hear a sound she expected to hear.

250
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:13,695
I heard the TV and the siren,

251
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:17,495
but I didn't hear the bathtub notification.

252
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:20,595
I set it to be ready at 8 pm.

253
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:22,095
Strange, isn't it?

254
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,395
I see.

255
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:25,695
Maybe she just missed it.

256
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,395
Probably.

257
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:30,495
Anyway, is it still not coming, Mouri?

258
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:33,695
-What? -Get sleepy already.

259
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:37,995
But I got plenty of sleep last night.

260
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,795
You're unbelievable.

261
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:44,895
It reminds me of all the cases that were nearly unsolved because of you.

262
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:51,195
I'm not responsible for this case.

263
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:55,595
Today's the last day we have left, Mouri.

264
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:59,295
At this rate, we're going to have to drop the charges,

265
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:01,895
even though we know he's the culprit!

266
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:07,395
Yes, this is Megure.

267
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:09,295
I know that.

268
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,195
Mouri's doing his best right now.

269
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,395
Have some faith in your senior.

270
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:17,395
Darn it. If only I hadn't slept so deeply last night.

271
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:22,295
We're just wasting time.

272
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:26,095
Take me to the burglary investigation.

273
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:30,395
Personally, I wish I could admit to killing my uncle,

274
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:34,195
but I have an alibi.

275
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,395
If I drink...

276
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:47,095
and stuff myself, I should start to feel sleepy.

277
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:51,295
Gosh. Pops is confused.

278
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:53,495
Confused?

279
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,795
Was Ms. Hide really confused, too?

280
00:17:57,195 --> 00:18:01,595
If Ms. Hide's perception wasn't wrong, what then?

281
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,995
That's it. So that's how it is.

282
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,195
Hey, Pops.

283
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:11,295
What if everything Ms. Hide said is right?

284
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:15,995
And if you consider the culprit blindfolded Ms. Hide

285
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,495
and knocked her out twice,

286
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,795
does anything become clear?

287
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:23,195
It's here!

288
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:25,395
Is it?

289
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,795
The bathroom!

290
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:31,695
I was stupid to think I could count on him.

291
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,695
Don't go, Inspector.

292
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,395
But I can't stay here forever.

293
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,395
Just hold on.

294
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:45,095
Oh, I see.

295
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,695
He seems to have had an epiphany.

296
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,095
Really?

297
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,695
Anyway, he wants you to check

298
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:55,695
if any fire trucks were dispatched to Yotsubadai that night.

299
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:57,595
Got it.

300
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:06,095
Yes. I see.

301
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,695
Got it.

302
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:12,195
A truck responded to a small fire at 8 pm.

303
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:13,395
That's it.

304
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,795
Huh? What are you talking about?

305
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:21,595
Is this it, Mouri?

306
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,595
Yes. I feel refreshed after using the bathroom.

307
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,495
The mystery is clear to me now.

308
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:28,195
I'm glad I didn't leave.

309
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:32,895
Cutting to the chase, Inspector, Maihama did leave.

310
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,895
What? I told you, that's impossible.

311
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:38,295
Not alone.

312
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,795
He took Ms. Hide Tenyama with him.

313
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:43,995
What? What does that mean?

314
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:48,195
After entering Ms. Hide's home at 7 pm...

315
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,295
Don't underestimate me!

316
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:54,195
He knocked her out and headed to Yotsubadai

317
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:58,595
with the unconscious Ms. Hide in the car.

318
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,795
Then he murdered Reigan

319
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:03,695
and started a small fire nearby.

320
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,895
Then he called the fire department.

321
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:10,595
He also called in a false report to the Sasago-cho fire department.

322
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:16,695
As he heard the fire truck approaching,

323
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:23,395
Maihama turned on the TV in his car and woke Ms. Hide.

324
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:25,395
You're finally awake.

325
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:28,695
I looked for your money,

326
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,295
but I couldn't find it, so I've been waiting.

327
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,495
After getting the money's location out of her,

328
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,095
he knocked her out again.

329
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:39,695
He took Ms. Hide back to her home in Sasago-cho,

330
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,695
placed her in her original position,

331
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:44,695
and made it seem as though he was there the whole time.

332
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:49,095
In other words, Maihama blindfolded Ms. Hide

333
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:51,795
not to confuse her about the time,

334
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:54,595
but to make her believe she heard the TV and siren

335
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:57,395
in her home in Sasago-cho,

336
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,295
so she wouldn't realize

337
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:01,895
she was actually in a car parked in Yotsubadai.

338
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,295
I see.

339
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,895
Ms. Hide Tenyama believes

340
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,395
she was in her own home the whole time, but...

341
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:13,795
She was taken back and forth to Yotsubadai while she was unconscious

342
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,295
so she would confirm Maihama's alibi.

343
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:22,495
However, Maihama ended up leaving evidence of his scheme.

344
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:24,795
Ms. Hide's nose and ears.

345
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:28,095
She smelled the small fire,

346
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:33,595
"Bath is ready" -and she didn't hear her bathtub's notification.

347
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:37,895
If you examine Maihama's car again,

348
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:40,595
I'm sure you'll find evidence that Ms. Hide was inside.

349
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:49,095
Hello, it's me. We've destroyed Maihama's alibi.

350
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:51,695
Thoroughly investigate his car.

351
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:57,495
That's right. Your senior didn't let us down.

352
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:21,195
"Mouri Detective Agency"

353
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:23,695
Mouri, thanks for the help.

354
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,595
I should get going.

355
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:28,395
I solved the mystery, Inspector.

356
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:32,495
Maihama has a twin with identical teeth prints.

357
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,895
-While he was committing the burglary... -What?

358
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:39,295
-What are you doing? -I don't know what I was expecting.

359
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:42,695
This is the only time I'm asking him for help.

360
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:47,295
Inspector, what about Maihama's alibi?

361
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,195
Maihama is...

362
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,095
This was supposed to have a good ending.

363
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:58,195
"Next Episode" -What? Conan is a witness in a murder case?

364
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:03,795
We're also considering the possibility of theft as we investigate,

365
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:08,995
but to be on the safe side, we're checking everyone's alibi.

366
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:10,695
-Look. -So many mountains.

367
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,995
That's where we got the drawing done.

368
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,195
It's right here.

369
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:24,295
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad Become Models"

370
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,338
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:29,438
"Canvas"

372
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:31,438
We'll be in the next episode, too.

373
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,138
With the Youth Detective Squad again? Should we dive back in?
