1
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:11,457
Awesome!

2
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:13,157
We sure caught a lot.

3
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:16,757
All together there are probably about 20 fish.

4
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,857
I guess we're eating fish for dinner

5
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:21,557
at doctor's house today then.

6
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:24,157
Well, I'm a bit worried

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,957
because doctor's the one who's going to be preparing the fish.

8
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:28,757
You're really something, Genta.

9
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:31,157
You caught another black sea bream again?

10
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,157
You're really an expert fisherman already.

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:34,857
Well, sort of.

12
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:37,257
I was actually going after eels,

13
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:39,557
but I guess I didn't make it.

14
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:42,257
All you ever think about is...

15
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,957
eating eels.

16
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:45,657
Let's eat.

17
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:49,657
Okay, everybody, time to put your things away.

18
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:52,857
We'd better start getting ready to go home.

19
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:55,057
The ship's come to get us.

20
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,557
True.

21
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,657
-Doctor! -Doctor!

22
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:04,657
Thank you Mr. Ejiri, for looking after us.

23
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:05,657
No, no, no problem.

24
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:09,957
After all Dr. Agasa and you saved my life in the past, remember?

25
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:11,857
Looking after you all in his place

26
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:15,557
because he had to go home for a while is no problem for me.

27
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,457
We ran into Mr. Futoshi Ejiri

28
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:22,257
before when we came here to fish,

29
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:26,157
and got messed up in a case.

30
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:28,957
Thanks to the prompt treatment doctor and I gave him,

31
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,957
his life was saved.

32
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:35,057
What a relief to see him in good health.

33
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:37,157
Doctor!

34
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:39,957
We got big catch!

35
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,757
-Doctor? -Doctor?

36
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:42,857
Doctor?

37
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,257
That's not doctor.

38
00:01:56,257 --> 00:02:00,257
He's the man living next door to doctor, isn't he?

39
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,257
If I remember correctly,

40
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:02,557
he's an upper graduate at the university

41
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,257
named Mr. Subaru Okiya.

42
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:15,857
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

43
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,457
Saturday nights are for mystery.

44
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:22,357
Fish messages left behind on a Dragon legend rock.

45
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,957
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,857
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:27,857
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

48
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:15,668
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 1)"

49
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,868
Doctor's not able to come?

50
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:22,168
For real?

51
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:26,168
No, the ham and egg making device that he made

52
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,368
and passed out to the neighbors isn't working right...

53
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,068
and it seems he's being bombarded by complaints.

54
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,768
He thought that he could repair it right away

55
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:41,268
but he thinks it's going to take way longer than he expected,

56
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:42,968
so he asked me to come and pick you all up instead.

57
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:47,968
That device wasn't all that stable to begin with anyway.

58
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,268
Okay, you can continue talking after boarding the ship.

59
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,368
Hurry or the sun will go down.

60
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:54,868
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir...

61
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,468
Here, next.

62
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:00,968
It's your turn.

63
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,968
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,868
Be careful of your footsteps.

65
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:04,868
Yes.

66
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:11,068
What's wrong with you? From a while ago.

67
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,468
I sense something in him.

68
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:15,268
Him?

69
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,368
You mean Mr. Subaru Okiya?

70
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,468
Just what do you sense?

71
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:20,668
In your words,

72
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,768
I sense the smell of the Black Organization.

73
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,368
You mean you sense it even now?

74
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:31,268
No.

75
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:35,068
The only time I felt that way was the time I first saw him

76
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,868
during that fire incident, but...

77
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:04,768
That unique overpowering air about him.

78
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,768
No matter how I look at it, it's all around him.

79
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,768
No doubt it's the air of the organization

80
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,968
that shrunk your body.

81
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:16,068
Maybe you're just psyching yourself into thinking that way?

82
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:17,968
Come on, come on. What's keeping you?

83
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,368
Hurry and get on board you two.

84
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,368
Okay.

85
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:47,368
You should look where you're going.

86
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,568
Okay.

87
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:58,168
Okay, Ida, I'll see you later.

88
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,168
Yes.

89
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,468
But, how sad, that we don't get to eat this

90
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,268
when we caught so many.

91
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,568
Doctor sure seems to be busy.

92
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:15,268
If you like, would you like me to prepare the fish for you?

93
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,868
You mean, you can cook?

94
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,768
Yes. Just a bit.

95
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:23,768
Of course, I'm not a first class cook

96
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:26,068
but I can make home-made cooking.

97
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,568
So, I'll use the kitchen at doctor's house

98
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:30,968
and cook you guys dinner.

99
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,568
-All right. -All right.

100
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:33,868
A treat.

101
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,668
Hey, kids, watch.

102
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,568
A beautiful sunset, don't you think?

103
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:44,768
Awesome.

104
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:47,068
It almost looks like a picture postcard.

105
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,968
I wonder what that is?

106
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,768
The sharp looking thing below the sunset.

107
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:55,968
That's the Ikkaku Rock.

108
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,768
The Ikkaku Rock?

109
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,968
Long, long ago,

110
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,068
there was a sea dragon

111
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:04,268
that was said to have one big horn called one-horned dragon.

112
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:08,568
The legend goes that the one-horned dragon who was angered

113
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,968
because a fisherman had taken her child,

114
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:15,268
is watching over her habitat sticking one horn out of the sea.

115
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:19,368
Therefore, any fishing boat that approaches is sunk,

116
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:23,568
so the fishermen just look at the Ikkaku Rock from a distance.

117
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:26,968
Would you like to go take a look?

118
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:29,468
It's easy to anchor the ship by that rock.

119
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:34,368
But, won't our ship sink?

120
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:35,868
Don't worry.

121
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:38,368
The one-horned dragon loves children.

122
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,168
If children stop by there,

123
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,268
it is also said that they are giving the power of the sea,

124
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,868
and become good swimmers.

125
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,368
Really?

126
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:47,568
Let's go, let's go.

127
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,468
It's pretty big.

128
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:58,768
Yes. It's a bit eerie when you think that

129
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:00,868
the gigantic body of the dragon below this.

130
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,668
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

131
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:06,768
That's the Ikkaku Rock!

132
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,468
If you go near it, you'll be cursed by the dragon

133
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,268
and your ship will sink!

134
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:13,368
They'll be fine, besides they're children.

135
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,468
That's true.

136
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,568
Hey, Kaida.

137
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,568
She doesn't seem to be anywhere around here.

138
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:25,468
Rats. Let's try another point.

139
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:34,068
What're those people?

140
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:36,668
They seem to be looking for something.

141
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:38,268
They're divers who are going around

142
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:40,968
with the daughter of the president of some big company

143
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:43,268
that just started diving recently.

144
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,768
They sure get in the way of our fishing.

145
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,668
The sea is for everyone to use, or rather...

146
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:53,268
I'd sure like them to have a bit more consideration towards us fishermen.

147
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:57,368
Well, but this Ikkaku Rock is a rock for children.

148
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,368
Go enjoy to your heart's content.

149
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:00,568
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

150
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,968
Taking a close look at it,

151
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,668
it's more like an ordinary rock with a lot of holes in it,

152
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,368
rather than one-horned.

153
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:11,968
Yes. After all it's quite a bit eroded from seawater.

154
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:12,968
Look. Look.

155
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:15,368
The sunset.

156
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,668
Let's all take a picture together

157
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,668
before the sun sets completely.

158
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,268
Okay, if you don't mind me taking your pictures with my cell phone.

159
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:23,468
Okay, we're counting on you.

160
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:24,768
Yes!

161
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:27,168
Everybody, get in line.

162
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:40,968
The rock behind you...

163
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:42,768
something's written on it.

164
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,568
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish"

165
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:48,668
Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish?

166
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,668
I wonder if someone carved the names of the fish

167
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:52,568
he caught on the rock as a memento?

168
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,368
What a terrible thing to do.

169
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,968
Hey, come over here.

170
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,868
There's something stuck between the rocks.

171
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,368
What's this?

172
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:08,468
It's stuck so hard, that I can't pull it out.

173
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,668
It's a fin that you wear when going diving.

174
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:14,668
The fin is still brand new.

175
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:17,868
If a person leaves the fin behind as a prank,

176
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,968
he wouldn't be able to make it back.

177
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,368
And, besides, those words...

178
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:24,368
Don't tell me it's a message or something?

179
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,768
Is someone still here?

180
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,068
Conan.

181
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,268
A tank and regulator.

182
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:46,468
A diver?

183
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:50,168
What's with her?

184
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,568
Is she asleep?

185
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:55,368
No. She's already dead.

186
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:56,868
-What? -What?

187
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,968
Judging from postmortem rigor mortis,

188
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,668
she died several hours ago.

189
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:04,268
The inside of her mouth is completely dried,

190
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,468
and her skin's lost its elasticity.

191
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:07,968
So, she must've died of dehydration.

192
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:10,668
Lipstick.

193
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:13,968
Wait a second.

194
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,968
The regulator I saw a while ago.

195
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:21,168
I'm sure that she encountered trouble

196
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:23,368
while diving that incapacitated her ability to swim.

197
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,268
She somehow managed to get here,

198
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,268
but no one discovered her.

199
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:30,568
Yes, the Ikkaku Rock that sinks ships is here.

200
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:32,868
No one would dare come close.

201
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:36,468
At any rate, let's all carry her back to the ship.

202
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:38,668
Yes, we can't leave her here like this.

203
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,968
No.

204
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:44,268
It's better not to move the body until the police arrive.

205
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,168
Police?

206
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:48,168
Don't tell me that she...

207
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:53,068
Yes, it could be that she was deliberately left behind here.

208
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,268
Look.

209
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:58,668
The mouthpiece of the regulator from where air from the tank is provided.

210
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:00,768
It's clean, isn't it?

211
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:04,468
If the lady wearing lipstick was using it,

212
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:07,468
lipstick should also be found on the regulator.

213
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,568
Just what do you mean?

214
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,768
Somebody for some reason switched the regulator.

215
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,968
Most probably within these few hours.

216
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:23,468
That is, the killer who came back here again.

217
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,532
I see.

218
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,532
You stopped by at this Ikkaku Rock

219
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,132
wanting to take a picture of all of you

220
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,232
with the sunset in the background

221
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:44,032
and you found the body of this young lady.

222
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,132
So, the sunset and everything else went down the drain.

223
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:48,632
Yes.

224
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:50,532
I can't say anything for sure

225
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:53,032
until we get her back on land and investigate

226
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,132
but judging from postmortem rigor mortis and how smoky her cornea are,

227
00:13:57,132 --> 00:14:00,332
5-6 hours have passed since she died.

228
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:02,232
The inside of her mouth is dry

229
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,932
and her skin has lost its elasticity

230
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,732
which means she died of dehydration.

231
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,132
In other words, this lady has been here at the Ikkaku Rock

232
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,932
from more than three days ago,

233
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,432
with nothing to eat or drink.

234
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:15,532
Since she's wearing a wet suit

235
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,732
and carrying a tank with a regulator,

236
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,032
she must be a diver.

237
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,732
Something happened when she was diving,

238
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:24,532
and she somehow managed to make it to the Ikkaku Rock,

239
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:26,532
but nobody found her.

240
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,132
That's how most officers would deduce this case,

241
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,932
but not me.

242
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:34,432
As you can see, this lady is wearing lipstick

243
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:36,532
but, there's no lipstick on the regulator.

244
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:41,732
In other words, somebody calculated the time it would take for her to die

245
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:44,232
and returned to switch the regulator after she died,

246
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:47,632
and left the body behind.

247
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:51,232
I don't know for what reason yet,

248
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:54,032
but I'm sure this is a case of homicide.

249
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:56,032
Amazing.

250
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:59,132
No, any police officer will come to that conclusion.

251
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,532
No, I meant Conan.

252
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:06,732
Conan explain exactly what you said just now, officer.

253
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,132
You did exactly that, didn't you?

254
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:09,132
Yes.

255
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:16,032
Well, but you sure get yourself tangled in a lot of cases, don't you?

256
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:19,932
Don't tell me you came here knowing that the body was here?

257
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,932
No way.

258
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:25,932
Although I did think that when we came here somebody might just be here.

259
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:28,232
What made you think that?

260
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:30,032
Because of the fin that was poked in between the rocks.

261
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:33,432
In between the rocks on the opposite side,

262
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,732
fins that are worn when diving were stuck.

263
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:40,432
He probably thought so when he saw the fins a while ago.

264
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,532
Fins were stuck in between the space of the rocks?

265
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:45,832
Yes, there's practically no one

266
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,232
who would go out of his way to bring a pair of spare fins

267
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:49,432
to carry out a prank like that.

268
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:53,232
It's most natural to deduce that the owner of those fins

269
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:56,732
tried to leave a message saying that he's still here.

270
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,032
Then, maybe we'll find something written on them

271
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,632
if we pull them out.

272
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:03,032
No, the other pair was also stuck

273
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,732
between some other rocks too.

274
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,532
Although we pulled both fins out,

275
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,132
nothing was found on either one of them.

276
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,832
Talking about writing...

277
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,832
Something was written on the rock that was near the fin, wasn't there?

278
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,932
Yes. The names of fish.

279
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,132
Four names, I think it was.

280
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:20,832
The names of fish?

281
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,232
Yes.

282
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,332
If I'm not mistaken, Mackerel.

283
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,132
"Mackerel"

284
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:27,132
Carp.

285
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,432
"Carp"

286
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:29,432
Sea Bream.

287
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:30,932
"Sea Bream"

288
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:32,932
Flatfish. I think it was.

289
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:34,932
"Flatfish"

290
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,932
"Mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish"

291
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,932
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,232
All the more, maybe somebody who came to fish here

293
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,332
left those names back on the rock as a joke.

294
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,332
No way, Jugo.

295
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,032
Are you big brother Ida?

296
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:51,732
Mackerel, sea bream and flatfish maybe,

297
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,232
but you can't fish for carp at sea.

298
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:55,232
True.

299
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,632
Did you bring them here?

300
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:00,932
Yes.

301
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:04,032
Do you know each other?

302
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,732
We've been friends since childhood

303
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,132
when he said he wanted to become a good swimmer

304
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,332
and came here to the Ikkaku Rock on my father's boat.

305
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:14,932
Back then, he was so terrified and kept clinging onto me.

306
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,332
Talk about a nuisance.

307
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:18,432
Come to think of it,

308
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:21,432
what's with your older brother who came with you back then?

309
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:25,232
He was so scared that he didn't get off the boat at all.

310
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:29,032
Yes, that's why Sango still can't swim.

311
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,632
I guess minus blessings do exist.

312
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:36,532
But, what's with those writings, sea bream, flatfish and such?

313
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,332
I mean, it's not like we're at the Dragon Palace under the sea.

314
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,432
A dying message, maybe?

315
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:45,232
See, because look at this woman's left arm.

316
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,832
The part where her wristwatch used to be isn't tanned.

317
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:50,332
So, just to be sure,

318
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:54,732
before you came, I checked out the Ikkaku Rock area carefully

319
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,232
and found this.

320
00:17:57,232 --> 00:18:00,732
A diver's wristwatch that matches the part where she isn't tanned.

321
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:01,732
What?

322
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:07,932
The edges are quite badly eroded.

323
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:09,232
I see.

324
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:13,532
If the eroded part and the letters of the fish match

325
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:18,332
it's a dying message that this woman left behind.

326
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:19,732
That's what you think.

327
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:20,732
Yes.

328
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:24,832
But the culprit stopped by here once, right?

329
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:27,532
It could be that, that person wrote it down

330
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:29,932
to frame someone else up?

331
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:33,132
If so, I think that he would've left her wristwatch

332
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:35,032
on for everyone to see.

333
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:38,032
But, she took it off and hid it.

334
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:39,432
In other words, she didn't want the culprit

335
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,732
who she thought would be coming back again,

336
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:44,932
to realize that she had left a dying message behind.

337
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:48,632
No matter if this Ikkaku Rock is a place where people rarely approach,

338
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:51,232
there's always the possibility that someone is watching.

339
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:55,632
She probably figured that the culprit couldn't stay here for very long

340
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:57,432
and hid her watch.

341
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,532
She left the dying message behind for the police

342
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:01,932
who she figured could check the place out good

343
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,232
after her body is found.

344
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:08,032
See, her initials are carved on the back of the wristwatch,

345
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:10,132
so even if some time passes before they find her,

346
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:12,232
they would still know who the watch belonged to.

347
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:15,232
It's true that there are initials H and A on the back but...

348
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,932
Akamine Angel... club?

349
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:24,632
The word angel is eroded and illegible.

350
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:28,032
Gee, sonny, like always your deduction is the tops.

351
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:33,832
He's just an I know I'm a great detective type kid's

352
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,132
that's been trained by that measly Kogoro.

353
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,832
From here, it's work for the police.

354
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,132
I'm sure that even a kid as bright as you

355
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,932
wouldn't know who or where this woman is from anyway.

356
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:50,232
She's the only daughter of President Akamine of a financial company

357
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,632
that has recently moved into Kanagawa.

358
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:55,432
Right, pops?

359
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:56,532
Yes.

360
00:19:56,532 --> 00:20:02,232
She used to dive a lot around with here with some young men.

361
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:03,632
If I remember correctly...

362
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,032
Hikari?

363
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:16,032
Hey, doesn't that wet suit look like Hikari's?

364
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,432
Rather, who are they?

365
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,632
At any rate, anchor the boat near that rock.

366
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:23,332
If it's Hikari, we've got big trouble.

367
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,332
Yes.

368
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:27,832
What?

369
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:30,432
She's been missing for three days?

370
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,932
Is that true?

371
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,932
Yes. In the afternoon 3 days ago,

372
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,432
all four of us went diving together.

373
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:39,132
We were going dive again and go look for Hikari

374
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:40,832
because she didn't come back but...

375
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,632
"Rokusuke Oto (23)"

376
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:46,032
I got text mail from Hikari that said,

377
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,232
"I'll leave the rest up to you guys".

378
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:52,232
So, you all decided to come home

379
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:55,032
without even checking things out and looking for her first?

380
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,632
"Shuhei Aosato (25)" -It can't be helped,

381
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,532
because she did something like that before too.

382
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:01,932
Something like that?

383
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,332
Even when we went diving at the beginning of summer,

384
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:07,132
Hikari didn't come out.

385
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:11,132
So we all panicked back then and looked all over for her.

386
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:15,732
We even asked the police to search for her, right?

387
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,532
Yes. She eventually came back the next day.

388
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:20,932
We asked her what happened,

389
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:22,632
and she told us that a cruiser steered by a good looking man

390
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:24,132
happened to pass by and picked her up,

391
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:28,032
so she spent the night at his place.

392
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:31,532
I haven't heard of a search being set out for anybody

393
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:32,632
these two or three days though.

394
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:35,532
No, we haven't requested a search this time yet.

395
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:37,832
"Yasuji Kaida (24)" -Because she was really angry with us

396
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,432
last time we did so.

397
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,732
I sent you mail that said,

398
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,732
"I'll leave the rest up to you guys", didn't I?

399
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,732
So, don't make a big thing out of nothing!

400
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:45,932
So, you see.

401
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:50,732
That's why we waited without doing anything for a while.

402
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:54,232
I mean, after three days we still got no word from her,

403
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:57,232
so we came back looking for her and here we are.

404
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:00,332
All three of us took a dive

405
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:04,132
and checked near the point we went diving three days ago too.

406
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:08,032
We called out to every cruiser we ran into too.

407
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:10,632
We had no idea that she'd be found like this

408
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:12,532
at this Ikkaku Rock

409
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,732
where people don't usually even approach.

410
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:21,932
Ms. Hikari Akamine was left behind here at Ikkaku Rock...

411
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:25,432
and died from dehydration.

412
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:29,332
Who on earth could've done something like this?

413
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:33,032
And the names of the fish she carved on the rock

414
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:37,332
mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish.

415
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:40,032
What's implied in this message?

416
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:06,932
Hey, you guys.

417
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:09,332
What kind of fish do you like?

418
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:11,732
Please answer one by one.

419
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:14,132
Whether words are to be added or removed,

420
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:17,132
there's got to be a key-word indicating what to do.

421
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:22,432
The culprit was telling us who he was to begin with.

422
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:27,132
That he was the one who left Hikari back at Ikkaku Rock

423
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,932
and killed her.

424
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,332
Next Conan,

425
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:34,014
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 2)"

426
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:51,685
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:54,085
"Diver's watch".

428
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,185
All right I'm putting the mask on.

429
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:57,785
Masked Diver!

430
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:58,985
Not Yaiba, but diver.
