1
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:05,433
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:08,433
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,733
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,363
Today's case involves a
June bride dressed in white!

5
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:18,233
Even with her happiness about to crumble,
there's always only one truth!

6
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,641
The June Bride Murder Case.

7
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:04,061
Today, a middle school teacher
that Ran and I had is getting married.

8
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,731
But I'm definitely not here for her sake.

9
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:11,881
I just wanted to see the wacko
who's marrying her.

10
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:17,191
Matsumoto-sensei... I haven't
seen her since we graduated!

11
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,311
Maybe we'll get to hear her amazing
singing voice at the reception!

12
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:23,411
Oh yeah, what about you-know-who?

13
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:23,921
Eh?

14
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,941
You know, the kid who would
always get yelled at

15
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,671
for being off key in
Matsumoto-sensei's music class...

16
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,601
Oh, Shinichi?

17
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,131
I called him but he said wouldn't go
even if his life depended on it.

18
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:38,191
So you brought this kid
with you instead of Mr. Tone-Deaf?

19
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,931
Yep! He insisted on coming!

20
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:43,421
Excuse me for being tone-deaf!

21
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,731
That lousy woman did nothing
but torture me for three full years!

22
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,861
Oh! Mori-san and Suzuki-san!

23
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:00,791
Well? Does it look good on me?

24
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,241
Y-You look beautiful!

25
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:05,161
S-She does...

26
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,621
"Waiting Room"
Aw, Kudo-kun can't make it?

27
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,571
How I wanted to show off this dress
in front of that impertinent brat!

28
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,671
She hasn't changed at all on the inside...

29
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:15,721
Oh?

30
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,951
Have we met before, little boy?

31
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,931
N-No!

32
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:23,891
Okay! Look this way, you two!

33
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,191
We're in charge of the video for today!

34
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,351
Make sure the kiss scene
is a really great one!

35
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,311
Leave it to me!

36
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:35,781
I bought you your warm lemon tea, Sayuri!

37
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,091
Thank you!

38
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:41,521
Come to think of it, she was always
drinking lemon tea.

39
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,451
Even during class...

40
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:48,901
Wait! Your lipstick will come off
if you drink it like that.

41
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,751
There you go!

42
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,631
Thanks.

43
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:00,381
Kazumi... I'm sorry...

44
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,341
About Toshihiko-san...

45
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,301
What are you talking
about at a time like this?

46
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,141
You better be ready!

47
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:09,351
I'm gonna tell everyone at the reception

48
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,661
that your new hubby
used to be my boyfriend!

49
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,271
Kazumi...

50
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,061
Just kidding!

51
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:17,981
See you in a little bit!

52
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,291
She never stops teasing me...

53
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,951
Who was that?

54
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:23,411
A bad friend of mine from college.

55
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,291
I have another can,
would one of you like it?

56
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,081
I'll take it!

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,291
What do you think you're doing?!

58
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,461
Ran! Beat this gorilla's brains out!

59
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,991
Oh? If it isn't Ran-kun!

60
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,241
Inspector Megure!
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:48,261
Who in their right mind would miss
their boss's daughter's wedding?

62
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,951
Boss?

63
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:55,871
That's right. He's the police
superintendent and my father!

64
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,731
Your father...?

65
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:00,441
You can go now.

66
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:01,821
Yes, sir!

67
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:04,281
Please forgive us!
Please forgive us!

68
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:04,381
Please forgive us!

69
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,291
Don't worry about it, you two!

70
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,531
It's his fault for looking so scary!

71
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,201
Anyway, Sayuri, are you really sure
you want to marry him?

72
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,461
I have young men with plenty
of backbone working for me!

73
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,791
Dad! What are you saying
at a time like this?!

74
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,211
Very well.

75
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,701
Really now! You always have to
treat me like a child, don't you?!

76
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,241
You are a child.

77
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:30,541
You still drink this sugary rubbish...

78
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,061
So what?! I like it!

79
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,911
Anyway, how about saying something?!

80
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,561
Look at what your daughter is wearing!

81
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:44,531
You're beautiful. Though not nearly
as beautiful as your dead mother.

82
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:48,121
Can't you ever give a normal compliment?!

83
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,621
What beautiful roses!

84
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:56,081
Thank you, Umemiya-kun.

85
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:58,121
Who's he?

86
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:01,801
You don't remember? That's Umemiya-san--
he was one year ahead of us.

87
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:11,041
Lemon tea suits you well,
Matsumoto-sensei.

88
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:11,851
Thank you!

89
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,411
Today is a real disappointment for me.

90
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:19,651
I always believed that only I
could ever make you happy.

91
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:21,461
Umemiya-kun...

92
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:24,771
See you.

93
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,951
What a conceited jerk.

94
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:33,701
Oh no! The battery's almost out!

95
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:35,661
No way!

96
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,001
Wasn't there an
electronics store near here?

97
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:42,081
I'll be back soon!

98
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,381
Wait for me!

99
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:49,581
Jeez, you'd think to at least check
that before leaving the house...

100
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:55,791
You look exactly like Kudo Shinichi...

101
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,451
Eep!

102
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:59,911
Just looking at your face
makes me want to pinch you!

103
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,361
Hey now!

104
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:07,071
After all, Kudo-kun looked
just like my very first boyfriend...

105
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,871
His family ran the
neighborhood candy store,

106
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,991
and whenever someone was bullying me,
he'd always come to my rescue!

107
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:18,411
He would always secretly steal
my favorite drink from his own store

108
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,791
and give it to me...

109
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:24,951
Warm lemon tea!

110
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:31,121
Unable to forget those memories,
I still drink it all the time.

111
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,891
It's like it gives me courage.

112
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:38,241
So he was the reason I was
tormented for three long years?

113
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,351
So does he still live there?

114
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:46,741
No. One day, he suddenly moved away,
and I've never seen him since.

115
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:49,491
But there's more to this story...

116
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,661
Hey, what're you being so
shy about? You're the groom!

117
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,621
Toshihiko-san!

118
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,371
You look stunning, Sayuri!

119
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,081
This is just our little secret, okay?

120
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,331
Huh?

121
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:07,501
Are you still drinking this cheap filth?

122
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,461
Y-Yes...

123
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,701
You're the successor
to the Takasugi Group!

124
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,121
Oh! You're one of
those Suzuki plutocrats!

125
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,861
You know him?

126
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,121
I see him at parties all the time.

127
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,621
He's indecisive and undependable,

128
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,111
and people say that the Takasugi family's
going to end with him...

129
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:35,741
Where did that come from
all of a sudden?

130
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:39,701
But she's with him,
so I think he'll be all right...

131
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,291
Sorry to interrupt, but it's
almost time for the ceremony.

132
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,461
Right!

133
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,131
Go on ahead, Toshihiko-san.

134
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,681
Don't worry, I'll be there soon!

135
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,141
Oh, okay...

136
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,851
So, how's the bride?

137
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,561
Way to go!

138
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,441
What was that sound?!

139
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:16,671
It came from her room!

140
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,661
Matsumoto-sensei!

141
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:31,921
It would seem that sodium hydroxide
was mixed in with the lemon tea.

142
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,951
So she drank it and then--

143
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,551
Huh? There's something
floating in the lemon tea.

144
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,621
It's a capsule!

145
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:46,951
What?!

146
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:54,201
I see. So the perpetrator filled
this capsule with sodium hydroxide,

147
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:56,451
then slipped it into the lemon tea.

148
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:59,461
If so, then it would take time
for the poison to be released,

149
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,581
making it impossible to determine
when the crime was committed.

150
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:06,421
In other words, any one of you six
who entered her room

151
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,881
could have poisoned the tea!

152
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,591
You can't be serious!
Does that make me a suspect too?!

153
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:15,241
Of course.

154
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:18,431
There are capsules that dissolve in
hot water in only a few minutes' time.

155
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,621
Okay! Have the capsule analyzed at once!

156
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,451
Say. How come you're not counting him?

157
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:28,521
I'm pretty sure he entered the room too...

158
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:32,191
Come now, a police superintendent
would never poison his own daughter.

159
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:37,651
No, the boy's right. I'm a suspect
just as much as the others.

160
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,741
Y-You do have a point...

161
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:42,871
Come to think of it,
we were recording a video!

162
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:43,621
What?!

163
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:47,581
You're right! Did we
leave it on when we left?!

164
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,671
The crime might've been caught on film!

165
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:00,721
There you go!

166
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:04,651
You still drink this sugary rubbish...

167
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,981
...That only I could ever make you happy.

168
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:12,061
Are you still drinking this cheap filth?

169
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,581
It looks like the actual poisoning
wasn't caught on tape.

170
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:20,661
Though the video shows that nearly
everyone touched the can at least once.

171
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,741
Meaning that everyone had
the chance to poison the drink.

172
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:33,091
They're still watching it...

173
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,371
I wonder if Matsumoto-sensei's
surgery is over...

174
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:40,051
Poisoning her favorite lemon tea...
how horrible!

175
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,751
Lemon tea, huh...

176
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,851
Every time Sayuri drinks it,

177
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:50,241
I'm reminded of a little girl
I liked a lot a long time ago...

178
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,161
She always drank it with such happiness,

179
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,821
but I never even knew her name...

180
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:56,781
Wait, he couldn't be...

181
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,951
Inspector. The results of
the analysis have come back.

182
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:06,951
First, assuming the capsule
was added to the lemon tea,

183
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:09,621
it would apparently take 15
to 16 minutes for it to dissolve.

184
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:11,991
15 to 16 minutes...

185
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:14,991
In other words, the poison was added

186
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:17,991
at least 15 minutes
before she collapsed.

187
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:22,741
It was 1:46 when
Ran-kun called the police.

188
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,161
Assuming she collapsed to
the floor one minute earlier,

189
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,101
then that means the poison
was added before 1:30.

190
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,061
It was exactly 1:30 when
Superintendent Matsumoto left.

191
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:33,191
What?!

192
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,951
Which rules out both
the groom and myself.

193
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,651
We came to see
Matsumoto-sensei after he did.

194
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,071
We found something strange
about the poisoned can...

195
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:50,041
The superintendent's fingerprints
aren't anywhere on it!

196
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,411
You fool! What are you talking about?!

197
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,701
As you can clearly see...

198
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,911
...I had the can in my hand!

199
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,721
Did you make a thorough check?

200
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:00,611
Yes...

201
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,301
That's strange...

202
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:09,791
Oh no! The battery's almost out!

203
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,241
No way!

204
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:16,041
Really strange...

205
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,771
Wait a minute! When Sonoko left...

206
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,571
...she didn't have her can with her!

207
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,191
Where in the world did it go?

208
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:25,701
What?!

209
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:31,371
Don't tell me that she drank from...

210
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,741
Say, mister. Were the superintendent's
fingerprints the only ones missing?

211
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:39,461
No, that Umemiya person's
weren't on it either.

212
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:41,421
I figured as much!

213
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,121
In that case, where did
that capsule come from?

214
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,741
That's it! I've figured out
the culprit's intention!

215
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:49,391
I know the truth behind that capsule!

216
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,851
Inspector. I found this in
a trash can in the hallway.

217
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,991
A glass jar...

218
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,911
That looks like sodium hydroxide inside it.

219
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,291
Sodium hydroxide?!

220
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,571
This could be the container the perpetrator
used when poisoning the tea!

221
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:05,411
There's no doubt about it.

222
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,371
Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical

223
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:10,951
that absorbs water in the air and
turns into a liquid in mere minutes!

224
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:14,291
Okay. Send this for analysis too.

225
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,621
I've figured it out!

226
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,981
It was that bastard
who smeared her dress with blood!

227
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,740
Inspector Megure!

228
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,790
We want to see Matsumoto-sensei
at the hospital right away!

229
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,470
Hold on a little longer! We're not
finished with our investigation!

230
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,190
Old man Mori isn't around today,
so I'll need a pinch hitter!

231
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,780
Now to match this voice changer
to Sonoko's voice...

232
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,740
Sonoko? What's the matter?

233
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,120
I figured out who poisoned
Matsumoto-sensei's lemon tea.

234
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,080
You have, Sonoko-kun?!

235
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,830
You said that the perpetrator
put the poison capsule in her tea

236
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,050
15 minutes before she collapsed, right?

237
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,010
Yes, because it would take 15
to 16 minutes for the capsule to dissolve.

238
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,910
That's assuming the poison
was really in that capsule.

239
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,020
All we're sure of is that the capsule
was floating in the poisoned lemon tea.

240
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,980
So you're saying that the culprit--

241
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,440
Yes. The poison and the capsule
were added in separately

242
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,530
to fool us into thinking that the poison
was added at least 15 minutes prior.

243
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:42,410
If that's true, then you two
could have done it as well!

244
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,460
Hold on. Everything she's
saying is pure conjecture.

245
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
It really might have
been a poison capsule.

246
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,020
No.

247
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,370
There is proof!

248
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,880
In the video that Ran taped.

249
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,160
Inspector. Take a close look at
the can of lemon tea on the screen.

250
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,720
No way!

251
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,230
The labels are facing
different directions!

252
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,910
Ran. Do you remember where I put
my lemon tea when this happened?

253
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,420
Yeah...

254
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,160
You were in a hurry
so you put it on the table...

255
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,340
It couldn't be!

256
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,680
Was that your can?!

257
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,040
That's right.

258
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,540
The reason it looks
like there's only one can

259
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,720
is because the two cans
are perfectly lined up!

260
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,190
She took my can, which just
happened to be in front!

261
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,460
As proof of this,

262
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,910
the poisoned can was devoid of
the fingerprints of the superintendent

263
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,410
and Umemiya-san,

264
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,490
even though they clearly
had held the can earlier.

265
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,620
I'd bet that my fingerprints
are on it, though.

266
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,680
She's exactly right!

267
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,580
Which means...

268
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,370
...That some time between her taking
the wrong can and collapsing,

269
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,500
someone put the poison
and the capsule in separately.

270
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,080
Yes. And the only ones with her
at the time were Conan-kun

271
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,720
and Takasugi-san,

272
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,450
not to mention me and Ran.

273
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,470
Excluding Conan-kun,

274
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,950
when Ran and I returned
from buying batteries,

275
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,410
Takasugi-san was holding the can
and then she took it from him,

276
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,850
so it would've been impossible
for me or Ran to poison it!

277
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,320
So he's the only one left?!

278
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,040
No. There's one other person.

279
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,780
Matsumoto-sensei, herself!

280
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,700
Suicide?!

281
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,160
But if she did mix the poison in
to kill herself,

282
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,490
she would've added it shortly
before collapsing to the floor.

283
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,920
And to do that,
she would need two things.

284
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,880
An airtight container and a desiccant!

285
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,490
It takes only a few minutes for
sodium hydroxide to turn to liquid

286
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,490
when exposed to the air.

287
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,870
She was in this room the entire time,

288
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,100
so she would have needed a
container to safely store it in.

289
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,080
But the container was found...

290
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,910
...In a trash can in the hallway.

291
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,400
Which is proof that someone
other than Matsumoto-sensei

292
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,040
brought the poison into this room.

293
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,070
In other words,

294
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,910
the only one who could've slipped
the poison into the lemon tea...

295
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,080
...was you, Takasugi-san!

296
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Toshihiko! How could you?!

297
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,410
Why? Why'd you do that to my daughter?!

298
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,050
If you wanna know so badly,
then I'll tell you!

299
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,660
It all started 20 years ago!

300
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,200
When a car that you were
chasing ran over my mother!

301
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,410
Mom! Mom!

302
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,810
My mother was still alive at the time...
Mom! Mom!

303
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,770
She could've survived if you had
rushed her to the hospital in your car!

304
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,660
But instead...

305
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,730
You're in the way! Get out of here!

306
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,240
15 minutes later, my mother died,
lying on the street.

307
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,040
From that day forth, I never once
forgot your cruel, heartless face!

308
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,990
Is he telling the truth, superintendent?

309
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,990
Yes. I didn't see her--she was
obscured by the car's shadow.

310
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,910
Later on, I learned of the accident
and rushed to his house,

311
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,510
but he had already moved out.

312
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,580
My mother was the only family I had.

313
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,450
I was adopted by the Takasugi family
as they had no children of their own.

314
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,690
Then seven years ago,
Kazumi brought a girl with her!

315
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,120
Yes! The instant I learned
that she was your daughter,

316
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,660
my nearly-forgotten flames of
revenge roared back to life!

317
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,120
Then why didn't you kill me?!

318
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,330
If you died, you wouldn't get to
experience how heartbreaking it is

319
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,000
to lose someone dear to you!

320
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,370
She was one stupid girl, though!

321
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,220
She had no clue I was getting
close to her to get revenge!

322
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,120
Though I'm sure being the heir
to the Takasugi fortune was--

323
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,660
You're the one who doesn't
have a clue, Toshihiko!

324
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,700
Kazumi...

325
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,040
Sayuri knew everything!

326
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,860
Even about the accident
20 years ago and your lineage!

327
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,290
No, you're lying!

328
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,370
She'd never marry me
if she knew who I really was!

329
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,410
You still don't get it, even after
seeing all that lemon tea she drinks?!

330
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,290
You're the first boyfriend that
she's always been thinking about

331
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,250
for the past 20 years!

332
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,620
Sayuri kept talking about
how much you looked like him,

333
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,050
so I did some investigating
and found out.

334
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,790
She was really worried,
even after she accepted your proposal...

335
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,110
She didn't know what to do
to earn your forgiveness...

336
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,480
Even so, you went and...

337
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,850
Don't tell me she saw him
poison the drink?!

338
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,940
She knew it was poisoned?!

339
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,870
Don't worry, I'll be there soon!

340
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,750
Matsumoto-sensei...

341
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,700
Superintendent! We just
received word from the hospital!

342
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,920
She's been upgraded to stable condition!

343
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,920
This is great!

344
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,580
Hurray!

345
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,270
Two months later, Matsumoto-sensei
checked out of the hospital.

346
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,560
It's great that you got to leave
the hospital earlier than expected!

347
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,030
And I hear that Toshihiko-san's
sentence was reduced...

348
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,330
Well, I did drink the poison
of my own free will...

349
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,580
But in the end, it looks like I only
succeeded in getting him in trouble...

350
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,550
I bet he hates me now...

351
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,800
Cheer up!

352
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,800
In celebration of leaving the hospital,
I'll buy a drink for you!

353
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,380
Really?!

354
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,470
In that case...

355
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,940
...lemon tea, it is!

356
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,020
It's important to
cherish memories of the past!

357
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,670
Really now! If you keep this up,
you'll never get married!

358
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,530
But she was married three years later...

359
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,630
Married to the one she had thought
about for 20 long years, of course.

360
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,420
Nothing of the sort!

361
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,410
There's no way you could
possibly be the murderer!

362
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,000
Why not?

363
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,210
You were the one who just explained
why she couldn't have done it!

364
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,750
That's it! Now I get it!

365
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,180
This is an alibi trick
involving elevators!

366
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,840
On the next Conan--

367
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,340
The Elevator Murder Case.

368
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,300
Next Conan's Hint:

369
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,301
Next Conan's Hint:
Bouquet.

370
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,271
Bouquet.
