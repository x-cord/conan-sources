1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.340
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.640
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.540
The mystery of the Fuurinkazan.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.640
Conan and Heiji come to the conclusion!

5
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.440
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:54.034
The feuding Torada and Tatsuo families

9
00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:56.434
are involved in a case of serial murders.

10
00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.034
The crimes are being patterned after

11
00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:02.034
Takeda Shingen's military strategy, the "Fuurinkazan".

12
00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:07.234
Why is this culprit so obsessed with Shingen?

13
00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:09.034
And what is the connection

14
00:02:09.034 --> 00:02:12.534
with the falling death of Police Officer Kuroto Kai six years ago?

15
00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:15.934
As the mystery deepens, another victim is found.

16
00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:24.534
"Fuurinkazan: The Conclusion in Lightning and Shadow"

17
00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:28.034
The body is badly burnt,

18
00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:29.234
but judging from the body shape,

19
00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:31.934
I'm certain this is Shigetsugu Torada.

20
00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.934
The Tatsuo family's to blame!

21
00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:35.934
What nonsense.

22
00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:39.134
By the way, where is the fishing pole?

23
00:02:39.134 --> 00:02:40.134
Fishing pole?

24
00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:42.634
Yes. He had it in a case.

25
00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:44.834
But I'm sure it was a fishing pole.

26
00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:48.134
Are you saying that...

27
00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.734
That's right!

28
00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:55.534
Shigetsugu touched the railway cables and got electrocuted!

29
00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:57.934
Where did you find that?

30
00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:00.434
Just there in the forest!

31
00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:04.534
The case of the pole was near the crossing.

32
00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:07.434
So I think he got electrocuted there,

33
00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:11.834
and got hit by the train and ended up here

34
00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:16.334
and there was a dead centipede near the case too.

35
00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.634
This is another serial murder!

36
00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:22.034
Yoshirou Torada who was killed in a tornado,

37
00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:23.434
"wind."

38
00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:26.834
Koji Tatsuo who was buried in the ground and beaten to death,

39
00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.634
"mountain."

40
00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:30.934
Ayaka Tatsuo who was hanged in the forest,

41
00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:32.334
"forest"

42
00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:34.634
And Shigetsugu Torada

43
00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:37.634
who was burned completely with electrical shock,

44
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.134
"fire."

45
00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:43.334
The "Fuurinkazan" message has been completed!

46
00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:46.134
But why did my wife and my friends

47
00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.334
have to be killed in such a way?

48
00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:50.934
Mr. Yamato! I found a strange memo.

49
00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:54.134
This is...

50
00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:55.234
It seems like the progress they made

51
00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.534
in finding the buried gold is written here.

52
00:03:57.534 --> 00:04:02.234
Isn't that the memo that Shigetsugu was looking for?

53
00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:07.334
Yes and it was also used to exchange notes among themselves.

54
00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:10.034
In short, the notebook says that...

55
00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:14.334
Six years ago, they accidentally caused someone's death

56
00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:17.334
and they were talking about whether to go to the police or not.

57
00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:19.534
But decided not to in the end.

58
00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:22.734
And they've remained silent ever since.

59
00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:26.034
Mr. Akira Tatsuo, they did it for your sake.

60
00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:28.534
-What? -Wait!

61
00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.334
You mean the person who died six years ago is...

62
00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:32.634
Yes.

63
00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:35.034
It was Kai Kuroto.

64
00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:39.234
They did it so that you could win in the preliminaries

65
00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:41.334
and be chosen as the horseback archer.

66
00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:44.334
They wanted Kai Kuroto to be injured.

67
00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.234
They used fireworks to frighten his horse while he was practicing,

68
00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:49.234
hoping he would be thrown off the horse.

69
00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:51.034
But the horse became more frightened than they thought,

70
00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:52.534
and it started to run.

71
00:04:52.534 --> 00:04:53.934
It says that

72
00:04:53.934 --> 00:04:57.634
they found Kai Kuroto along with his horse, under the cliff.

73
00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:00.234
No...

74
00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:01.734
Judging by the handwritings in this memo,

75
00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.934
there were four people involved.

76
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:08.334
I believe they are Yoshiro and Shigetsugu from the Torada family.

77
00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:09.934
And Koji and Ayaka from the Tatsuo family.

78
00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.334
The four victims of this serial murder case.

79
00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:15.734
But why would the memo end up here?

80
00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:19.134
To hide the evidence they had.

81
00:05:19.134 --> 00:05:21.934
Shigetsugu was pretending to look for this memo,

82
00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:23.934
when he already had it.

83
00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.034
And intended to burn himself

84
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.934
with the memo to apologize to Kai Kuroto.

85
00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:32.134
Then, you're saying this string of murders was...

86
00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:34.934
Yes. After taking care of his partners in crime

87
00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.034
in the incident six years ago,

88
00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:43.034
he took his life in order to conceal the truth forever.

89
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:46.234
Shigetsugu Torada is the serial killer!

90
00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:48.334
And he tried to burn the memo, too,

91
00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:51.934
to hide the truth from Akira Tatsuo!

92
00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:55.934
Well, the memo wasn't burnt after all.

93
00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:58.934
But even if it was for Akira...

94
00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:02.834
I know Kai Kuroto would straightened them out on the other side.

95
00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:05.634
I know he will.

96
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:09.434
Well, this case is closed!

97
00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:13.134
I would like to tell you all to go home,

98
00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:14.534
but I have to search your houses

99
00:06:14.534 --> 00:06:16.034
to gather up some proof for this case.

100
00:06:16.034 --> 00:06:18.234
I would have to ask you to stay here.

101
00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:25.634
Hey, do you really think that Shigetsugu found the memo?

102
00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:29.634
I don't know. He didn't seem like he had it.

103
00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:31.534
But he stopped looking for it

104
00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:33.734
and started to check his emails.

105
00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.734
So maybe he did.

106
00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:37.134
Email?

107
00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:40.334
Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:42.534
Just when we were about to leave.

109
00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:43.734
Email...

110
00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:45.034
Heiji!

111
00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:49.134
What's up? Did you find something?

112
00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:52.434
Look at this.

113
00:06:53.634 --> 00:06:56.034
A rock with a piece of string.

114
00:06:56.034 --> 00:07:00.234
The memo had the same kind of string on it too.

115
00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:02.434
Hey! We are all done here!

116
00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:04.834
The case is closed!

117
00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:07.534
With the "fire" that burned Shigetsugu!

118
00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:08.934
It's "lightning".

119
00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:16.234
You hear that? I think it might start to rain.

120
00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.534
Lightning?

121
00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:19.834
Lightning.

122
00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:24.034
Oh my, how long do we have to wait here in the rain?

123
00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:29.534
Do you remember the weather the day that Kai Kuroto died?

124
00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:32.134
My husband had bad dreams.

125
00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:34.634
He said "The sound. the light."

126
00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:36.834
Do you think it's about thunder?

127
00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:39.334
No. I think it was sunny that day.

128
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.734
All day long.

129
00:07:41.734 --> 00:07:44.934
My poor Shigetsugu will be in the rain.

130
00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:48.134
Heiji, can't we do anything?

131
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.534
And he's gone!

132
00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:51.034
Conan, too!

133
00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:53.234
There they go again.

134
00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:56.834
Where Ayaka was hanged,

135
00:07:56.834 --> 00:07:58.934
there were no footprints.

136
00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:03.034
All that was left were the footprints of

137
00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:07.734
police detective Yamato and the marks of his cane.

138
00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:11.134
I wonder when they hanged Ayaka?

139
00:08:11.134 --> 00:08:13.634
The Torada family was with us

140
00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:17.034
until Ayaka disappeared from the bathroom.

141
00:08:17.034 --> 00:08:20.734
The Tatsuo family was in the car,

142
00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.534
with Tamefumi Tatsuo driving.

143
00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:24.334
Hey, you two!

144
00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:26.634
What are you doing here?

145
00:08:26.634 --> 00:08:28.834
Oh, you're the detective we saw earlier.

146
00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:30.234
What's going on?

147
00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:32.934
Mr. Yamato ordered us to preserve the murder scene

148
00:08:32.934 --> 00:08:35.034
since it might start raining soon!

149
00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:36.934
What is that coat?

150
00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:37.934
Oh, this?

151
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.934
I found it caught in the branch of a tree!

152
00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:42.634
Is that coat...

153
00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:44.034
Wet by any chance?

154
00:08:44.034 --> 00:08:46.634
No. Mr. Yamato asked me the same thing.

155
00:08:46.634 --> 00:08:47.934
But it's not.

156
00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:52.334
Well, we have to move quickly!

157
00:08:52.334 --> 00:08:54.334
Since he's back to work,

158
00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:56.934
we have no time to rest at all!

159
00:08:56.934 --> 00:08:59.434
Where was he until now?

160
00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:03.034
He was after a man who escaped during parole

161
00:09:03.034 --> 00:09:05.534
and got caught in an avalanche.

162
00:09:05.534 --> 00:09:09.334
The man was arrested by Kai Kuroto

163
00:09:09.334 --> 00:09:12.334
and disappeared six years ago,

164
00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:13.334
so Mr. Yamato thought

165
00:09:13.334 --> 00:09:16.534
he might be linked to the death of Kai Kuroto.

166
00:09:16.534 --> 00:09:20.334
In the accident, he lost his left eye and left leg,

167
00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:24.034
and was unconscious in the hospital for a long time.

168
00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:27.634
So was the man connected to Kai Kuroto's death?

169
00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.434
Unfortunately, he wasn't.

170
00:09:31.134 --> 00:09:33.834
But fate is definitely cruel.

171
00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:37.134
He had to meet Yui Uehara as the victim's wife,

172
00:09:37.134 --> 00:09:38.334
when she used to work under Mr. Yamato

173
00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:40.434
before he was hospitalized.

174
00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:42.734
Yui and he were determined

175
00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:46.634
to find the truth behind Kai Kuroto's death.

176
00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:49.534
But she quit the force and got married.

177
00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:52.534
Those two became police officers

178
00:09:52.534 --> 00:09:55.034
to follow in the path of Kai Kuroto.

179
00:09:55.034 --> 00:09:59.034
Then, six years ago when Kai Kuroto died,

180
00:09:59.034 --> 00:10:01.134
-was she still in the force? -Yes, she was.

181
00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.334
She had just joined the force,

182
00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:06.434
and she was in such shock, crying a lot.

183
00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:10.434
Speaking of tears, there was something odd.

184
00:10:10.434 --> 00:10:11.434
What is it?

185
00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:14.234
There should have been tear marks on Ayala Tatsuo's face

186
00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:15.834
before she died,

187
00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:17.834
but we couldn't find any.

188
00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:20.734
How could you tell that she wiped her tears?

189
00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:22.834
Her eye shadow had rubbed off,

190
00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:25.634
and her right index finger had eye shadow on it.

191
00:10:25.634 --> 00:10:28.234
She must have wiped her tears.

192
00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:30.034
What color was it?

193
00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:32.734
-Tell us! -Well,

194
00:10:32.734 --> 00:10:35.634
it was ordinary blue eye shadow.

195
00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:41.734
Then take that horse and go home to the Torada family!

196
00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:43.134
I see.

197
00:10:43.134 --> 00:10:44.534
It must be.

198
00:10:47.034 --> 00:10:49.334
It seems like this battle...

199
00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:51.534
Isn't over yet.

200
00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:07.987
"Torada Residence" -What? The police

201
00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:10.187
"Torada Residence" -will come to this house again?

202
00:11:10.187 --> 00:11:13.487
Yes. Mr. Yamato will bring some people

203
00:11:13.487 --> 00:11:15.487
and will search the house.

204
00:11:15.487 --> 00:11:18.787
They plan a house search on the Tatsuo family house as well!

205
00:11:18.787 --> 00:11:20.787
How long will it take?

206
00:11:20.787 --> 00:11:23.087
He said about three to four days.

207
00:11:23.087 --> 00:11:25.187
Three to four days?

208
00:11:25.187 --> 00:11:28.687
I think the festival starts in three days.

209
00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:31.387
Yeah, I know.

210
00:11:31.387 --> 00:11:32.787
I see now.

211
00:11:32.787 --> 00:11:34.287
The festival?

212
00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:36.587
"Tatsuo Residence"

213
00:11:38.987 --> 00:11:40.787
Yoshiro.

214
00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:42.387
Koji.

215
00:11:42.387 --> 00:11:45.387
Ayaka. Shigetsugu.

216
00:11:45.387 --> 00:11:48.987
Why did you do such a thing to Mr. Kuroto

217
00:11:48.987 --> 00:11:50.187
just because of me?

218
00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:58.687
It was you.

219
00:11:58.687 --> 00:12:01.587
Yui Torada.

220
00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:05.587
So you knew that I was coming?

221
00:12:05.587 --> 00:12:09.287
Yes. When Shigetsugu died, you said "lightning".

222
00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:11.387
That's how I knew.

223
00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:15.987
Although his body was burnt, it was from the electricity.

224
00:12:15.987 --> 00:12:21.187
It was the "thunderbolt" from "Move like thunderbolt".

225
00:12:21.187 --> 00:12:22.387
That's right.

226
00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:25.287
There's more to the "Fuurinkazan" strategy

227
00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:27.187
that Sun Tzu wrote about.

228
00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:30.787
There is "Move like thunderbolt" which you just said,

229
00:12:30.787 --> 00:12:35.187
and there also is "be impenetratable as shadow"

230
00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:36.887
The "thunderbolt" suggests that

231
00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:40.587
you must "appear like thunderbolt, in a surprise."

232
00:12:40.587 --> 00:12:44.887
"Shadow" suggests you must "hide as still as shadow.".

233
00:12:44.887 --> 00:12:46.287
That's right.

234
00:12:46.287 --> 00:12:49.087
Just like Kai Kuroto, beneath the cliff

235
00:12:49.087 --> 00:12:53.087
where the sun didn't reach and still breathing and alive.

236
00:12:53.087 --> 00:12:56.787
To those four who caused Kuroto Kai's death six years ago,

237
00:12:56.787 --> 00:13:00.087
his blood soaked undershirt must have looked deep red.

238
00:13:00.087 --> 00:13:05.487
Just like the armor of Takeda's Akazonae cavalry.

239
00:13:05.487 --> 00:13:07.987
That's why this was all patterned after Shingen!

240
00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.087
Yes.

241
00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:10.787
It was to make the four who brought Kuroto Kai's death

242
00:13:10.787 --> 00:13:12.787
come to the light.

243
00:13:12.787 --> 00:13:16.087
Just as expected, Koji reacted to it almost instantly.

244
00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:20.687
But Ayaka and Shigetsugu weren't that interested in Shingen.

245
00:13:20.687 --> 00:13:23.887
So they didn't respond to the dead centipedes.

246
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:27.087
And so, it was the uproar over the Suwa Hossyo helmet

247
00:13:27.087 --> 00:13:30.287
that finally got Ayaka.

248
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:32.787
And then, Ayaka was forced to reveal Shigetsugu's name!

249
00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:34.887
Have you come to deal with me

250
00:13:34.887 --> 00:13:37.187
just like you did those four?

251
00:13:37.187 --> 00:13:39.687
To wipe out Kai Kuroto's enemy?

252
00:13:39.687 --> 00:13:42.287
To wipe you out?

253
00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:43.987
No, Akira.

254
00:13:43.987 --> 00:13:46.787
I am here to protect you.

255
00:13:46.787 --> 00:13:49.387
From the true killer...

256
00:13:49.387 --> 00:13:51.387
standing right over there.

257
00:13:54.287 --> 00:13:56.087
You!

258
00:13:56.087 --> 00:13:58.787
I should have expected it from a former policewoman.

259
00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:00.887
How did you figure it out?

260
00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:04.387
It was the blue eye shadow on Ayaka's hand.

261
00:14:04.387 --> 00:14:07.687
"Ao" from "Aokage" meaning black horse.

262
00:14:07.687 --> 00:14:09.087
In other words,

263
00:14:09.087 --> 00:14:14.087
the person riding a black horse at that time, was you.

264
00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:16.187
What a clever girl.

265
00:14:16.187 --> 00:14:19.687
Then, you forced Shigetsugu's name out of Ayaka,

266
00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:21.187
and dealt with him.

267
00:14:21.187 --> 00:14:25.087
Yes, Shigetsugu was the child of my husband's first wife.

268
00:14:25.087 --> 00:14:27.687
He wasn't related to me by blood.

269
00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:30.187
But why, Tatsue?

270
00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:34.487
It's because she is the one who really killed Kuroto Kai.

271
00:14:34.487 --> 00:14:35.587
I told you that

272
00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:37.287
my husband would say "the sound, the light"

273
00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:39.387
in his nightmares.

274
00:14:39.387 --> 00:14:41.787
That's what lead me to realize there was another person

275
00:14:41.787 --> 00:14:43.887
at the crime scene six years ago.

276
00:14:44.987 --> 00:14:46.987
Tatsue, it was you, wasn't it?

277
00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:50.387
Yes, I wanted him injured as well.

278
00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:53.987
So I fired one shot from this gun at his horse's legs.

279
00:14:53.987 --> 00:14:57.187
That's when he fell off the cliff.

280
00:14:57.187 --> 00:15:01.587
But, some people came and started making a big fuss.

281
00:15:01.587 --> 00:15:05.187
As if they were the ones who caused his death.

282
00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:07.187
That made me laugh.

283
00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:08.887
It would have been best if they continued to think that

284
00:15:08.887 --> 00:15:10.087
and kept their mouth shut.

285
00:15:10.087 --> 00:15:12.687
But later on, Yoshiro started talking about going to the police

286
00:15:12.687 --> 00:15:15.987
to tell about the gunshot he heard and the flash he's seen.

287
00:15:15.987 --> 00:15:20.787
But then the Gods punished him by sending him that tornado.

288
00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:24.287
And you left my injured husband there to die.

289
00:15:24.287 --> 00:15:26.987
Leaving the centipeds that you had ready.

290
00:15:26.987 --> 00:15:30.387
Yes, by that time I'd already come up with

291
00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:33.387
the idea of patterning everything after the "Fuurinkazan-inrai".

292
00:15:33.387 --> 00:15:39.387
That means one of your targets right from the start was Akira.

293
00:15:39.387 --> 00:15:40.387
What?

294
00:15:40.387 --> 00:15:43.387
Yes, the final element was for Akira, "fire".

295
00:15:43.387 --> 00:15:45.687
Since you've come in the way of the gambling operation we run,

296
00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:48.487
you'll be burned into ashes.

297
00:15:50.387 --> 00:15:52.987
These flames you eat you up!

298
00:15:52.987 --> 00:15:54.387
Gambling?

299
00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.987
They gamble on the festival horseback archery contest,

300
00:15:56.987 --> 00:15:59.687
betting how many of misses there'll be in the ten shots.

301
00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:02.887
But Kai Kuroto never missed a single one.

302
00:16:02.887 --> 00:16:04.987
Until you moved one of the targets.

303
00:16:04.987 --> 00:16:08.287
There's no point in gambling if he never misses.

304
00:16:08.287 --> 00:16:10.387
And since you've hit them all for five years straight as well,

305
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.187
you'll need to die too.

306
00:16:12.187 --> 00:16:13.487
The story will be that

307
00:16:13.487 --> 00:16:15.487
you took revenge for Kai Kuroto, whom you loved dearly.

308
00:16:15.487 --> 00:16:17.287
And then to atone for those crimes,

309
00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:21.087
you took your own life.

310
00:16:21.087 --> 00:16:22.887
But considering the present circumstances,

311
00:16:22.887 --> 00:16:25.387
having this stupid woman,

312
00:16:25.387 --> 00:16:27.087
to solve the mystery of Officer Kai Kuroto's death,

313
00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:30.087
went so far as to marry Yoshiro, a man she didn't love.

314
00:16:30.087 --> 00:16:32.387
It might look better if we changed out story to one

315
00:16:32.387 --> 00:16:35.087
where she kills you out of resentment.

316
00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:38.487
Well, will you tell this stupid woman something?

317
00:16:38.487 --> 00:16:40.787
Why were there no marks

318
00:16:40.787 --> 00:16:43.987
beneath the tree where Ayaka was hanged?

319
00:16:43.987 --> 00:16:46.787
There is nothing to tell to one who will die!

320
00:16:46.787 --> 00:16:48.087
It's the horse!

321
00:16:51.587 --> 00:16:54.787
Back then, you put Ayaka on your horse, didn't you?

322
00:16:54.787 --> 00:16:57.887
You used a rope already attached to the branch beforehand.

323
00:16:57.887 --> 00:16:59.687
Allowing you to hook it to her neck

324
00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:01.387
from the other side of the tree.

325
00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:04.887
Afterwards, you rode your horse up behind the tree.

326
00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:06.687
So no one would know

327
00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:09.187
when the hoof marks had gotten there.

328
00:17:09.187 --> 00:17:11.087
How long have you been there?

329
00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:13.787
"Be as swift as the wind"

330
00:17:13.787 --> 00:17:17.487
I've been waiting here for two hours before you came.

331
00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:20.487
Incidentally, the reason no one noticed that

332
00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:23.687
Ayaka was on your horse was...

333
00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:26.687
You had a black coat on her.

334
00:17:26.687 --> 00:17:28.587
When Ayaka was secluded in the toilet,

335
00:17:28.587 --> 00:17:29.587
you called her on her cell phone

336
00:17:29.587 --> 00:17:31.687
and secretly lured her out to the stables.

337
00:17:31.687 --> 00:17:34.187
After Akira and the others left on the horse...

338
00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:35.887
You placed her, with that black coat on her,

339
00:17:35.887 --> 00:17:38.687
on your black horse and went into the forest.

340
00:17:38.687 --> 00:17:41.687
You! How did you!

341
00:17:41.687 --> 00:17:44.587
"Be quiet as the forest."

342
00:17:44.587 --> 00:17:46.887
I've been waiting here. Holding my breath.

343
00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:49.887
Well, it looks like there was an earlier visitor here before us.

344
00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:52.387
An early visitor?

345
00:17:52.387 --> 00:17:54.687
If you know your target,

346
00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:57.487
be cool and level.

347
00:17:58.487 --> 00:18:02.287
Sit yourself down and observe.

348
00:18:04.887 --> 00:18:08.487
"Be immovable like the mountain"

349
00:18:10.987 --> 00:18:13.387
You planned this, didn't you?

350
00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:16.887
Yeah, with the police sticking around here until the festival,

351
00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.487
tonight was your only chance.

352
00:18:19.487 --> 00:18:22.487
Compared to your plan of swiping that notebook,

353
00:18:22.487 --> 00:18:25.887
hanging it from the electric wires as bait.

354
00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:29.187
And electrocuting Shigetsugu, my plan was no big deal.

355
00:18:29.887 --> 00:18:33.287
The way you used a string to tie the notebook to a rock.

356
00:18:33.287 --> 00:18:36.787
Making it easy to throw it up to get it caught on the train cable.

357
00:18:36.787 --> 00:18:40.187
Shigetsugu learned where it was from an email you sent to him.

358
00:18:40.187 --> 00:18:43.687
And when he used the pole to get it, he was electrocuted.

359
00:18:45.187 --> 00:18:47.587
Well, if you want to light a fire, go ahead.

360
00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:48.887
I've already called the fire department

361
00:18:48.887 --> 00:18:50.887
and have them waiting on standby.

362
00:18:52.887 --> 00:18:54.387
Get them!

363
00:19:04.587 --> 00:19:06.987
Don't worry, I'm striking with the blunt side!

364
00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:13.187
You brat!

365
00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:17.387
-Kansuke! -Take this!

366
00:19:23.887 --> 00:19:27.587
Saving the best for you again, huh?

367
00:19:27.587 --> 00:19:29.787
And that's how the final murder

368
00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:31.587
was prevented before it happened.

369
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:34.187
As for the war that had lasted for six years,

370
00:19:34.187 --> 00:19:38.087
it was over at last, leaving a bruise on the eye of the enemy.

371
00:19:41.187 --> 00:19:42.287
What?

372
00:19:42.287 --> 00:19:45.787
You fought against the culprits last night?

373
00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:47.987
Why didn't you ask us to help?

374
00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:50.187
We could have helped!

375
00:19:50.187 --> 00:19:54.387
Hey, I can't let you guys do such a dangerous thing like that!

376
00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:57.887
Then, I will have you come in for an interview.

377
00:19:57.887 --> 00:20:00.087
I see. Good day.

378
00:20:01.087 --> 00:20:04.587
You too! You better come to the police!

379
00:20:04.587 --> 00:20:05.987
Yes. I will.

380
00:20:05.987 --> 00:20:07.787
See ya.

381
00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:15.387
"Be swift as the wind."

382
00:20:18.487 --> 00:20:20.087
I...

383
00:20:20.087 --> 00:20:21.287
Pardon?

384
00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:25.787
It was because I thought you were dead, Kansuke!

385
00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:29.287
That's why I thought I had to do something.

386
00:20:29.287 --> 00:20:32.787
That's why I married Yoshiro...

387
00:20:32.787 --> 00:20:37.487
But, when I say that, it makes me feel sorry for my husband.

388
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.687
Idiot, didn't I just say it?

389
00:20:39.687 --> 00:20:42.787
"Come to the police."

390
00:20:42.787 --> 00:20:44.787
When you free yourself from your obligations,

391
00:20:44.787 --> 00:20:48.087
and when you're ready. Come back.

392
00:20:48.087 --> 00:20:50.087
The chief detective has been waiting, too.

393
00:20:50.087 --> 00:20:53.387
For that awful coffee that you make.

394
00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:03.187
Hey, those two...

395
00:21:03.187 --> 00:21:04.987
Are getting along!

396
00:21:05.987 --> 00:21:08.887
Hey, what were they saying?

397
00:21:08.887 --> 00:21:10.687
You were near them, right?

398
00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:14.787
She said "Be swift as the wind" or something.

399
00:21:14.787 --> 00:21:17.087
This should be the strategy of love!

400
00:21:17.087 --> 00:21:18.487
"Fuurinkazan"!

401
00:22:40.087 --> 00:22:41.087
Heiji!

402
00:22:42.787 --> 00:22:45.187
-What is it, Kazuha? -Just come with me!

403
00:22:45.187 --> 00:22:46.487
What's going on?

404
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.587
Oh no, it's Ran.

405
00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:54.887
Hello? Shinichi?

406
00:22:54.887 --> 00:22:57.887
Oh, hey Ran, what's going on?

407
00:22:57.887 --> 00:22:59.587
What is it?

408
00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:02.687
Today, I am going to make myself clear!

409
00:23:02.687 --> 00:23:06.387
-Couldn't we talk later? -No! It has to be now!

410
00:23:06.387 --> 00:23:08.687
"Be swift as the wind."

411
00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:11.087
Hey, let me go to the bathroom.

412
00:23:11.087 --> 00:23:13.787
Nope! You are not going anywhere, Heiji!

413
00:23:13.787 --> 00:23:15.987
"Attack as fiercely as the fire."

414
00:23:23.687 --> 00:23:27.387
"Be as quiet as the forest."

415
00:23:28.387 --> 00:23:31.387
Well... yeah, we can talk later...

416
00:23:32.687 --> 00:23:36.387
Well... I'll let you go for today.

417
00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:38.087
Hey, wait a second!

418
00:23:43.187 --> 00:23:44.687
What's up with them?

419
00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:45.987
I don't know.

420
00:23:45.987 --> 00:23:48.587
You think they're getting irritated because they're hungry?

421
00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:54.887
"Be immovable like the mountain."

422
00:23:57.487 --> 00:24:00.087
On November 30th,

423
00:24:00.087 --> 00:24:04.087
only then the treasure will be revealed in the sunset.

424
00:24:04.087 --> 00:24:05.787
Treasure?

425
00:24:05.787 --> 00:24:09.287
Ms. Kimiko, do you know anything about this?

426
00:24:09.287 --> 00:24:12.587
But what is the puzzle of the fox?

427
00:24:12.587 --> 00:24:15.287
There's a picture of a fox right here.

428
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:18.387
November 30th is tomorrow!

429
00:24:18.387 --> 00:24:21.287
We cannot let this chance go by!

430
00:24:21.287 --> 00:24:22.887
Next Conan,

431
00:24:22.887 --> 00:24:26.887
"Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Investigation Edition"

432
00:24:37.787 --> 00:24:39.387
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:39.387 --> 00:24:41.987
"Fox"

434
00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:43.187
The location of the next episode is Yamaguchi.

435
00:24:43.187 --> 00:24:44.787
-I wanna go. -You're not needed.

436
00:24:44.787 --> 00:24:46.887
On December 1st!
