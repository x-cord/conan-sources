1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,340
"Karuizawa"

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,940
"Saturday Bowl"

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,440
I did it! Strike!

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,840
As expected of you, Ran!

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,140
You're good!

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,740
Too bad about tennis, but bowling is fun, too!

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,440
Well, there's a guy who's pissed for not being able

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,340
to view tennis girls with mini skirts and also drink himself away.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,240
Hey! It's your turn next, Conan.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,640
-Okay! -Give it your best shot, Conan.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,740
You can do it, brat.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,740
So? Who is it that you want me to meet?

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,340
It's someone who's been waiting for 4 hours

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,240
at the tennis court in the pouring rain.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,840
I think he'll be showing up soon

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,740
after he changes into dry clothes.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,440
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,240
I came all the way here in this rain on my motorbike, you know?

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,240
Who are you?

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,740
Do you want to fight?

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
Jeet Kune Do?

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,940
He dodged me?

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,940
Very interesting.

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,340
I'll beat you to a pulp!

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,740
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,440
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,340
The person that Sonoko favors makes his appearance.

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,640
A hair-trigger situation at the bowling alley.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,440
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:33,294
"Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 1)"

33
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,794
Very interesting.

34
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:41,794
I'll beat you to a pulp!

35
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,794
No, Masumi!

36
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,094
He's the one!

37
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,594
The one whom Sonoko wanted you to meet!

38
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:53,594
He's my boyfriend, Makoto Kyogoku.

39
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:57,194
She's my classmate, Masumi Sera.

40
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,794
A... A woman?

41
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,194
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:04,894
I thought you were some womanizer who was hassling Sonoko.

43
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,694
No problem.

44
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,794
I'm always mistaken for a man anyway.

45
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:12,794
Geez. Why didn't you stop them right away, Sonoko?

46
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,494
Well. I wanted to see them have it out.

47
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:19,194
-Mr. Kyogoku. -What if they...

48
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,194
-get hurt? -Here are your glasses.

49
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,594
-I'm sorry... -Thank you.

50
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,594
Well, it's no big deal.

51
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:28,894
I wanted to have it out a bit more with him.

52
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,994
Jeet Kune Do... Who taught you that?

53
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:32,994
My big brother did.

54
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:36,894
He was three times stronger than me, though.

55
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,794
But...

56
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:42,094
I thought you said your big brother had passed away?

57
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,194
Yeah, that's what I heard.

58
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:47,194
But weren't you talking on the phone

59
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,694
with your big brother the other day?

60
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:50,894
Yeah.

61
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:53,694
So you were listening to our phone conversation?

62
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,394
I have another brother.

63
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,794
The middle child who's super smart.

64
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:01,094
Unlike my eldest brother who passed away and me,

65
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,294
he took after my dad.

66
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,694
He doesn't look like me, though.

67
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:08,394
He seems to be in the middle of an important job right now,

68
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:11,294
and he won't tell me his whereabouts or anything.

69
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:12,994
But at times, he helps me make deductions on cases

70
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:15,494
on the phone or by text mails.

71
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:16,794
He told me during the last case

72
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:20,994
that there was something wrong with my deduction.

73
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:22,894
But I figured since you were also there,

74
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:26,294
you'd be able to revise it if something came up.

75
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:29,694
I wouldn't, but Shinichi would be able to.

76
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:36,994
Don't tell me that she knows that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

77
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,294
By the way, Sonoko...

78
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:44,594
Did you goof when laundering those clothes?

79
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,394
Goof?

80
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,094
Your collar's stretched out,

81
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,994
and your underwear is showing.

82
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:56,094
This is called off-shoulder, and I'm showing it on purpose!

83
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,094
Besides, the brassiere is being shown deliberately, too!

84
00:05:58,094 --> 00:05:59,994
Deliberately showing brassieres?

85
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:03,994
You mean that underwear is something you wear to show people?

86
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:06,094
That... That's right.

87
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:10,194
Sonoko came all dressed up for you, Mr. Kyogoku.

88
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:13,194
By the way, Mr. Kyogoku,

89
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,694
you're bleeding from the back of your right hand.

90
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:18,294
Did you get hurt when you were having it out with Masumi just now?

91
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,194
No, I got hurt outside a while ago.

92
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:21,694
Excuse me.

93
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:22,894
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

94
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,994
"Michiko Monna (30), Jr. High Maths Teacher" -Are you okay?

95
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,394
Yes. All I got was a scratch.

96
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,294
How about your friend?

97
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:34,094
He's fine. He asked for it.

98
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,694
My friend is taking him to the car right now.

99
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,094
-Did something happen? -No.

100
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,494
When I went out to buy a change of clothes,

101
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,994
her male friend hassled me.

102
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,894
So I punched him in the abdomen.

103
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,794
He may not look it,

104
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,294
"Masaki Sunami (29)" -but he works as a PE teacher for Jr. High School.

105
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,794
"Jr. High Science Teacher" -He's normally a serious teacher,

106
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:58,094
but Mr. Tanba changes whenever he gets drunk.

107
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,594
So, how is he now?

108
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,794
He's asleep in the car.

109
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:05,694
He was mumbling "I'll kill him"

110
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:08,594
in his sleep though.

111
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,694
By the way, what shall we do after this?

112
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,194
That's right.

113
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:15,594
Well, I was actually going to have him teach me how to bowl, but...

114
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,894
Teachers!

115
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:21,494
You seem to be in a fix.

116
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:26,694
If you like, I could show you how to do it.

117
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:33,594
It's your hips! Your hips!

118
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:36,294
Bring your hips a little bit more towards this way!

119
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,494
-I see... -When you're holding the ball,

120
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:40,494
make sure your leg that is the axis, the ball and your head

121
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,994
are in a straight line, understand?

122
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:46,094
-Yes... -Okay! Try it!

123
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:55,194
-Fantastic! -Right! That's the way!

124
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:57,494
You did great! Just perfect!

125
00:07:57,494 --> 00:08:00,894
Well, it's really my honor

126
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,594
to be able to coach you beauties!

127
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:04,994
Thank you.

128
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,794
That old man

129
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:12,494
is really going to be arrested for sexual harassment one day.

130
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:21,794
Makoto, give it your best shot!

131
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:29,694
And this guy will probably be arrested

132
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:33,394
for damaging properties one of these days.

133
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,194
I think I'm not cut out

134
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:37,794
for dainty competitions like this after all.

135
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:40,294
I... I guess so.

136
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:42,594
Besides, I just got back today,

137
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:44,894
and I'm sort of groggy from jet lag.

138
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:48,594
Then, would you like to take a quick nap in dad's rental car?

139
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,394
I'm holding the keys for him.

140
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:54,094
I guess I'll do that, then.

141
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,694
Just when I'm supposed to be on a date with Makoto...

142
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:00,994
Well, no big deal.

143
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:04,394
We're eating with him later anyway!

144
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,694
Michiko, where are you going?

145
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:09,394
I'll go check on Mr. Tanba.

146
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:11,694
-I'm a bit worried about him. -I see.

147
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:14,394
I'll bring him with me after he sobers up.

148
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:18,094
What? He's gone?

149
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,794
Mr. Tanba wasn't in the car?

150
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,594
No. It looks like he got out of the car and left.

151
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:27,794
Then, why isn't he coming to the bowling alley?

152
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:28,794
Beats me.

153
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:31,794
Maybe he's asleep behind the car or something.

154
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:33,394
Cut out the joke!

155
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:35,794
It's been raining the whole time, you know?

156
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:37,394
Well, yeah. But...

157
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:40,094
Excuse me. If you're looking for someone,

158
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:44,094
just leave it to me, Kogoro Mouri.

159
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,294
My dad's a detective.

160
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,894
Kogoro Mouri?

161
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:49,594
Did you mean the renowned detective?

162
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,194
Mr. Tanba?

163
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:54,594
Mr. Tanba!

164
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,294
Are you there, Mr. Tanba?

165
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,594
Mr. Tanba!

166
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:03,394
This isn't good. He's not sitting anywhere between the cars.

167
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,794
Maybe he went to drink again at another shop?

168
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:10,394
Don't tell me that he's harassing somebody again?

169
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,394
Then, let's go and look for him at the shops.

170
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,094
-Huh? -Okay.

171
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:16,594
Hey! You guys help us look

172
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,494
-in the nearby shops, too. -What?

173
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,994
But how?

174
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,994
We don't know what he looks like.

175
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,994
This is his picture.

176
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:27,294
If you like, I can forward it to you.

177
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,294
Okay.

178
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:34,094
Hey, our rental car was parked around here too, right?

179
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:36,094
-Mr. Kyogoku... -Right.

180
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,294
But if he's hassled Makoto,

181
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:42,194
he would probably beat the guy to a pulp.

182
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:44,894
Well, I don't think he'll beat the guy to a pulp, though.

183
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,894
"Yakitori"

184
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,294
Darn it. He's nowhere to be found.

185
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,694
He's not over here either.

186
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:08,694
He hasn't come back to the car either!

187
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:11,494
It seems like his cell phone is switched off, too.

188
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:15,994
I wonder where he is.

189
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:22,194
What is it? What's that sound?

190
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:28,194
We've tried looking under the cars as well,

191
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:31,394
but it seems that he's not in this parking lot after all.

192
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:34,894
If so, we'd better call the police and ask them to search for him.

193
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:39,494
What... What's the matter?

194
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:41,994
The... The toilet door was unlocked.

195
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:46,094
So I opened it, and inside it...

196
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:06,553
Palpebral conjunctivitis, petechiae,

197
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:09,153
and foam coming out from his mouth.

198
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:11,053
His face isn't swollen,

199
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:14,253
and there are no strangulation marks on his neck either.

200
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,353
-Was he drowned to death? -Was he drowned to death?

201
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:20,053
Also, there are no marks of him being restrained on his legs or arms,

202
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:23,353
and the fact that his clothes are drenched...

203
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,353
What?

204
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,453
Are you saying that after he was drowned somewhere,

205
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,853
he was carried over to this toilet?

206
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:32,053
Yeah.

207
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:34,953
Judging from the death spots and rigor mortis seen on him,

208
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,653
he was probably killed just about an hour ago.

209
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:41,353
It was just around the time we started to look for him

210
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,853
and headed to search the shops around here.

211
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:47,053
And before we got back here,

212
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,953
the corpse was thrown into this toilet compartment,

213
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,553
and the culprit escaped.

214
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,553
No way...

215
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:54,753
Who on earth...

216
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:58,453
This teacher had a pretty sturdy body.

217
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:00,753
He might have been killed by more than one person

218
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:04,553
or by someone who is really strong.

219
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,053
Hey...

220
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:12,353
Did something happen?

221
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:18,653
So, the victim of the murder is

222
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:21,053
Mr. Masahiro Tanba, aged 32,

223
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:24,253
a PE teacher in Jr. High School.

224
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,653
And the one who discovered the corpse

225
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:29,253
is Ms. Sunami Masaki, a science teacher

226
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,453
from the same Jr. High School. Is that right?

227
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,053
Yes.

228
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,453
Then, will you please tell me

229
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,753
how exactly you went about discovering the corpse?

230
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:39,953
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:44,053
Mr. Tanba, my colleague, Michiko and I

232
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:47,553
were planning to play bowling here today.

233
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:50,253
But he ended up wasted after drinking beer

234
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:52,753
when we came here in a car,

235
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:55,253
and got into trouble after getting violent in town.

236
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,453
We decided to let him sleep it off,

237
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:00,053
so I took him back to Michiko's car.

238
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:01,653
Colleague?

239
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:04,053
Does that mean that you're also a teacher at Jr. High?

240
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,053
Yes. I teach mathematics.

241
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:08,453
I see.

242
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,953
And? What happened after that?

243
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:13,053
After bowling with Sunami for about an hour,

244
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,653
I went to the car to check on him.

245
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,853
He went through a lot,

246
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,953
so I thought I shouldn't keep him alone for too long.

247
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:23,653
But when I went there, he wasn't in the car.

248
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,653
So we all ended up searching for him immediately.

249
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,453
Who did you mean by "we all"?

250
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,653
The people whom we happened to become acquainted with

251
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,153
at this bowling alley.

252
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:35,453
It's me, Kogoro Mouri here.

253
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,853
I see. It's Mr. Mouri!

254
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:41,753
After that, we searched the parking lot, but couldn't find him.

255
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:45,953
So, thinking that maybe he went out drinking somewhere again,

256
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,653
I split up with the girls

257
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,253
and searched the pubs in this vicinity for about an hour.

258
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,853
But since we still couldn't find him,

259
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:55,753
we came back to this parking lot again.

260
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:59,453
We figured that he might have gone back to the car by then.

261
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:04,153
And just as we thought, he did come back.

262
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,453
He went into the toilet here in this parking lot

263
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,953
as a cold, drowned corpse.

264
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:10,553
Drowned?

265
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,653
-Is that so? -Yes, sir.

266
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:15,353
We can't conclude anything until after the autopsy,

267
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:17,253
but judging from the circumstances of the corpse,

268
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:19,353
that's most likely it.

269
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,653
So, what's the estimated time of death?

270
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:24,053
A little before or after 5.00 pm.

271
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,953
I see. Around 5.00 pm?

272
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,853
That's just around the time we left this parking lot

273
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:32,253
and started searching inside the pubs.

274
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,653
Yeah.

275
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:39,553
But why didn't you check inside the toilet to begin with?

276
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:42,053
It was locked with a padlock.

277
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:46,053
There was also an "Out of Order" sign on the door.

278
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,453
A sign, you said?

279
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:50,753
I saw it, too!

280
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:53,953
But the second time we came back here,

281
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,153
that sign was peeled off,

282
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:59,553
and the padlock was gone.

283
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:02,653
So I opened the door of the toilet compartment,

284
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:05,853
and I found Mr. Tanba...

285
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:09,453
That means the victim was carried off by someone

286
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:12,253
between the time when Ms. Sunami brought him to the car

287
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:16,653
and the time Ms. Michiko came to check up on him.

288
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:18,153
So while Mr. Mouri, you and the others

289
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,753
went out to search the pubs for him,

290
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:21,853
he was drowned somewhere else.

291
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,553
And before you and the others got back here,

292
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,453
his corpse was placed inside the toilet compartment.

293
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,853
Is that right?

294
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,453
Yeah. That's the story.

295
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:33,953
By the way, is there any chance that someone

296
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:35,153
was after Mr. Tanba's life?

297
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:38,753
I don't know. But when he got drunk, his personality would change

298
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:41,553
and he would hassle anybody in sight.

299
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:47,253
Therefore, he said that he wouldn't drink at all today.

300
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,453
Inspector Yamamura!

301
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:51,853
There is a bruise found on the stomach of the victim.

302
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:54,053
A bruise?

303
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,053
You're right.

304
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:59,153
It was probably me.

305
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:02,053
Since he was drunk and picked a fight with me,

306
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,053
I punched him in his solar plexus.

307
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:05,553
He picked a fight?

308
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:09,653
He shouted loudly when our eyes met.

309
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,153
You're quite a pushover, aren't you?

310
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:14,353
You were looking for him together with Mr. Mouri

311
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,253
and the others, weren't you?

312
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,553
No. I was taking a nap

313
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:21,953
in Mr. Mouri's car that's parked here.

314
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:29,353
We'll arrest you immediately on charges of murder!

315
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:31,353
Hold it, Yamamura.

316
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:33,053
Would anybody kill someone

317
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,653
just because the person picked a fight with him?

318
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,753
What are you saying...

319
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,053
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

320
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:43,953
He confessed to what he did, thanks to my skillful tact.

321
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:47,153
He just said he had a motive and no alibi.

322
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,653
But... But you can't just arrest him

323
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,753
based on something like that, can you?

324
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:55,053
He's just like his usual self, that klutz.

325
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,653
Just what do you think you're talking about?

326
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:02,053
Makoto isn't the culprit!

327
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,653
Then, can you prove his innocence?

328
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,153
Yes! Of course, I can!

329
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,453
Because... Because Makoto is...

330
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,253
Makoto is?

331
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:17,553
A very fantastic, kind and good person!

332
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:20,853
That's why!

333
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,853
You're not providing him with any evidence.

334
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:31,053
Inspector Yamamura! Take a look at this.

335
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:34,253
There are burn marks on his left shoulder.

336
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:35,653
It's most likely

337
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,653
that the victim was rendered unconscious with a stun gun or something.

338
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:39,753
Stun gun?

339
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,253
If the culprit used a stun gun,

340
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,853
I don't think this guy is the culprit.

341
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:46,453
Why not?

342
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,653
Because all he needed to do was to punch him once in the stomach

343
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,353
to knock him out.

344
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:54,553
And besides, if he strikes another punch on the same spot,

345
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:56,553
it would be lethal without leaving new traces.

346
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,353
But what if he deliberately used a stun gun just to deceive everyone?

347
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:02,353
It's hard to think that this Iron Karate Man

348
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:05,153
would be walking around with a stun gun

349
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,553
to protect himself.

350
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,953
Iron Karate Man?

351
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:12,953
He has won many championships at a lot of major tournaments.

352
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:15,353
Right! He has won 400 games and lost none.

353
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:18,153
He's the Prince of Formidable Kick Attacks!

354
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:21,453
Geez. You should've come right out and told me.

355
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,553
Why didn't you tell me so to begin with?

356
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:27,953
You met him during the red handkerchief incident.

357
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:31,253
Yamamura, are you sick or something?

358
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,253
Huh?

359
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,553
Well, you used to talk in a funny way before,

360
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:38,053
but now...

361
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,053
I used to talk like that

362
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,153
just to get everyone off their guard.

363
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:43,653
Now that I've become an inspector,

364
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:47,953
I don't have to use childish talk like that anymore.

365
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:51,153
Is that so?

366
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:54,853
Then, if you were in this parking lot the whole time,

367
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,353
didn't you see any suspicious people?

368
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,353
No. I was sleeping like a log.

369
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:02,553
I see. Sleeping like a log...

370
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:05,953
Stop!

371
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,953
Wait for me!

372
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,853
That was close.

373
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,953
This place is a bit tilted, it seems.

374
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,853
Yes, it seems that the land is a bit tilted

375
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,153
due to ground sinkage.

376
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,853
They said they'll begin the repair work from next month.

377
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,553
I see.

378
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:28,553
Ground sinkage...

379
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:31,753
Wait a second. If so,

380
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:36,053
the slanted mud marks found on this wall...

381
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:37,753
Don't tell me...

382
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:43,853
-It's raining. -Oh, no. It started raining again.

383
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,653
Let's take shelter in the bowling alley for now.

384
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:49,053
Let's continue talking there.

385
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,353
What's up, Conan?

386
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,553
You'd better hurry and go, too.

387
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,153
Well...

388
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:05,353
That ventilation hole of the toilet over there.

389
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:07,353
-Doesn't it seem strange? -What?

390
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,653
It's the only spot where the water doesn't drip over,

391
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,853
but leaves behind droplets instead.

392
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,953
It's a bit sticky.

393
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:20,353
Maybe something was pasted on there?

394
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:22,253
Hey, you two.

395
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:24,253
You two should hurry and go inside, too.

396
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:25,853
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

397
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:35,853
There are water droplets likewise, around the edges of door, too.

398
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:39,253
It's as if somebody sealed the place off with masking tape.

399
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:42,953
He didn't suffocate, but drowned to death, right?

400
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,253
Yeah.

401
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:47,053
Besides, there are no similar water droplets

402
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,753
around the ventilation hole at the bottom of the door.

403
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:52,853
Even if the door were to be sealed, this would do no good.

404
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,553
True.

405
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,153
Besides that,

406
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:59,653
wasn't there some kind of smell when we first got here?

407
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,053
Yeah.

408
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,553
-The smell of kerosene! -The smell of kerosene!

409
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,553
You two!

410
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:07,153
Didn't you hear what I told you a while ago?

411
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,253
Yes, we did.

412
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:10,353
We'll get going right now!

413
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:55,053
There's a burn mark on the ceiling?

414
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:58,153
That's why I'm telling you to hurry

415
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:01,053
and ask around the pubs in this vicinity.

416
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:02,653
Makoto!

417
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,753
-Let him be! -Huh?

418
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:06,353
Hey, tomboy.

419
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:09,553
You help set up the trick.

420
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:12,853
You know how to work this trick too, don't you?

421
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:18,253
Next Conan, "Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 2)"

422
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:39,153
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:41,153
"Witch"

424
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,053
What's up, Ran? Why are you staring at me?

425
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,353
Karate vs. Jeet Kune Do.

426
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:46,453
Ran's on fire.
