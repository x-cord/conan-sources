1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.340
"Karuizawa"

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.940
"Saturday Bowl"

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.440
I did it! Strike!

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.840
As expected of you, Ran!

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.140
You're good!

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.740
Too bad about tennis, but bowling is fun, too!

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.440
Well, there's a guy who's pissed for not being able

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.340
to view tennis girls with mini skirts and also drink himself away.

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.240
Hey! It's your turn next, Conan.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.640
-Okay! -Give it your best shot, Conan.

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.740
You can do it, brat.

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.740
So? Who is it that you want me to meet?

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.340
It's someone who's been waiting for 4 hours

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.240
at the tennis court in the pouring rain.

15
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.840
I think he'll be showing up soon

16
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.740
after he changes into dry clothes.

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.440
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me.

18
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.240
I came all the way here in this rain on my motorbike, you know?

19
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.240
Who are you?

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.740
Do you want to fight?

21
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.240
Jeet Kune Do?

22
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.940
He dodged me?

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940
Very interesting.

24
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.340
I'll beat you to a pulp!

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.740
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

26
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.440
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

27
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.340
The person that Sonoko favors makes his appearance.

28
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.640
A hair-trigger situation at the bowling alley.

29
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.440
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:33.294
"Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 1)"

33
00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:39.794
Very interesting.

34
00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:41.794
I'll beat you to a pulp!

35
00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:43.794
No, Masumi!

36
00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:45.094
He's the one!

37
00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:48.594
The one whom Sonoko wanted you to meet!

38
00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:53.594
He's my boyfriend, Makoto Kyogoku.

39
00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:57.194
She's my classmate, Masumi Sera.

40
00:03:57.194 --> 00:03:59.794
A... A woman?

41
00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:01.194
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:04.894
I thought you were some womanizer who was hassling Sonoko.

43
00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:06.694
No problem.

44
00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:09.794
I'm always mistaken for a man anyway.

45
00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:12.794
Geez. Why didn't you stop them right away, Sonoko?

46
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:17.494
Well. I wanted to see them have it out.

47
00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:19.194
-Mr. Kyogoku. -What if they...

48
00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:21.194
-get hurt? -Here are your glasses.

49
00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.594
-I'm sorry... -Thank you.

50
00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:24.594
Well, it's no big deal.

51
00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:28.894
I wanted to have it out a bit more with him.

52
00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.994
Jeet Kune Do... Who taught you that?

53
00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:32.994
My big brother did.

54
00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:36.894
He was three times stronger than me, though.

55
00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:38.794
But...

56
00:04:38.794 --> 00:04:42.094
I thought you said your big brother had passed away?

57
00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:44.194
Yeah, that's what I heard.

58
00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:47.194
But weren't you talking on the phone

59
00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:49.694
with your big brother the other day?

60
00:04:49.694 --> 00:04:50.894
Yeah.

61
00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:53.694
So you were listening to our phone conversation?

62
00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:55.394
I have another brother.

63
00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:58.794
The middle child who's super smart.

64
00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:01.094
Unlike my eldest brother who passed away and me,

65
00:05:01.094 --> 00:05:02.294
he took after my dad.

66
00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:04.694
He doesn't look like me, though.

67
00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:08.394
He seems to be in the middle of an important job right now,

68
00:05:08.394 --> 00:05:11.294
and he won't tell me his whereabouts or anything.

69
00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:12.994
But at times, he helps me make deductions on cases

70
00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:15.494
on the phone or by text mails.

71
00:05:15.494 --> 00:05:16.794
He told me during the last case

72
00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:20.994
that there was something wrong with my deduction.

73
00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:22.894
But I figured since you were also there,

74
00:05:22.894 --> 00:05:26.294
you'd be able to revise it if something came up.

75
00:05:26.294 --> 00:05:29.694
I wouldn't, but Shinichi would be able to.

76
00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:36.994
Don't tell me that she knows that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

77
00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:40.294
By the way, Sonoko...

78
00:05:40.294 --> 00:05:44.594
Did you goof when laundering those clothes?

79
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.394
Goof?

80
00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.094
Your collar's stretched out,

81
00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:51.994
and your underwear is showing.

82
00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:56.094
This is called off-shoulder, and I'm showing it on purpose!

83
00:05:56.094 --> 00:05:58.094
Besides, the brassiere is being shown deliberately, too!

84
00:05:58.094 --> 00:05:59.994
Deliberately showing brassieres?

85
00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:03.994
You mean that underwear is something you wear to show people?

86
00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:06.094
That... That's right.

87
00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:10.194
Sonoko came all dressed up for you, Mr. Kyogoku.

88
00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:13.194
By the way, Mr. Kyogoku,

89
00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:15.694
you're bleeding from the back of your right hand.

90
00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:18.294
Did you get hurt when you were having it out with Masumi just now?

91
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.194
No, I got hurt outside a while ago.

92
00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:21.694
Excuse me.

93
00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:22.894
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

94
00:06:22.894 --> 00:06:25.994
"Michiko Monna (30), Jr. High Maths Teacher" -Are you okay?

95
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:29.394
Yes. All I got was a scratch.

96
00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:31.294
How about your friend?

97
00:06:31.294 --> 00:06:34.094
He's fine. He asked for it.

98
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.694
My friend is taking him to the car right now.

99
00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:39.094
-Did something happen? -No.

100
00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:41.494
When I went out to buy a change of clothes,

101
00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:43.994
her male friend hassled me.

102
00:06:43.994 --> 00:06:46.894
So I punched him in the abdomen.

103
00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:48.794
He may not look it,

104
00:06:48.794 --> 00:06:51.294
"Masaki Sunami (29)" -but he works as a PE teacher for Jr. High School.

105
00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:53.794
"Jr. High Science Teacher" -He's normally a serious teacher,

106
00:06:53.794 --> 00:06:58.094
but Mr. Tanba changes whenever he gets drunk.

107
00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.594
So, how is he now?

108
00:07:00.594 --> 00:07:02.794
He's asleep in the car.

109
00:07:02.794 --> 00:07:05.694
He was mumbling "I'll kill him"

110
00:07:05.694 --> 00:07:08.594
in his sleep though.

111
00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.694
By the way, what shall we do after this?

112
00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:12.194
That's right.

113
00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:15.594
Well, I was actually going to have him teach me how to bowl, but...

114
00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:17.894
Teachers!

115
00:07:17.894 --> 00:07:21.494
You seem to be in a fix.

116
00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:26.694
If you like, I could show you how to do it.

117
00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:33.594
It's your hips! Your hips!

118
00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:36.294
Bring your hips a little bit more towards this way!

119
00:07:36.294 --> 00:07:38.494
-I see... -When you're holding the ball,

120
00:07:38.494 --> 00:07:40.494
make sure your leg that is the axis, the ball and your head

121
00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:42.994
are in a straight line, understand?

122
00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:46.094
-Yes... -Okay! Try it!

123
00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:55.194
-Fantastic! -Right! That's the way!

124
00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:57.494
You did great! Just perfect!

125
00:07:57.494 --> 00:08:00.894
Well, it's really my honor

126
00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:03.594
to be able to coach you beauties!

127
00:08:03.594 --> 00:08:04.994
Thank you.

128
00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:09.794
That old man

129
00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:12.494
is really going to be arrested for sexual harassment one day.

130
00:08:18.594 --> 00:08:21.794
Makoto, give it your best shot!

131
00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:29.694
And this guy will probably be arrested

132
00:08:29.694 --> 00:08:33.394
for damaging properties one of these days.

133
00:08:33.394 --> 00:08:35.194
I think I'm not cut out

134
00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:37.794
for dainty competitions like this after all.

135
00:08:37.794 --> 00:08:40.294
I... I guess so.

136
00:08:40.294 --> 00:08:42.594
Besides, I just got back today,

137
00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:44.894
and I'm sort of groggy from jet lag.

138
00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:48.594
Then, would you like to take a quick nap in dad's rental car?

139
00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:51.394
I'm holding the keys for him.

140
00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:54.094
I guess I'll do that, then.

141
00:08:57.394 --> 00:08:59.694
Just when I'm supposed to be on a date with Makoto...

142
00:08:59.694 --> 00:09:00.994
Well, no big deal.

143
00:09:00.994 --> 00:09:04.394
We're eating with him later anyway!

144
00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:06.694
Michiko, where are you going?

145
00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:09.394
I'll go check on Mr. Tanba.

146
00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:11.694
-I'm a bit worried about him. -I see.

147
00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:14.394
I'll bring him with me after he sobers up.

148
00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:18.094
What? He's gone?

149
00:09:18.094 --> 00:09:20.794
Mr. Tanba wasn't in the car?

150
00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:24.594
No. It looks like he got out of the car and left.

151
00:09:24.594 --> 00:09:27.794
Then, why isn't he coming to the bowling alley?

152
00:09:27.794 --> 00:09:28.794
Beats me.

153
00:09:28.794 --> 00:09:31.794
Maybe he's asleep behind the car or something.

154
00:09:31.794 --> 00:09:33.394
Cut out the joke!

155
00:09:33.394 --> 00:09:35.794
It's been raining the whole time, you know?

156
00:09:35.794 --> 00:09:37.394
Well, yeah. But...

157
00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:40.094
Excuse me. If you're looking for someone,

158
00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:44.094
just leave it to me, Kogoro Mouri.

159
00:09:44.094 --> 00:09:46.294
My dad's a detective.

160
00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.894
Kogoro Mouri?

161
00:09:47.894 --> 00:09:49.594
Did you mean the renowned detective?

162
00:09:50.394 --> 00:09:52.194
Mr. Tanba?

163
00:09:52.194 --> 00:09:54.594
Mr. Tanba!

164
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:58.294
Are you there, Mr. Tanba?

165
00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:00.594
Mr. Tanba!

166
00:10:00.594 --> 00:10:03.394
This isn't good. He's not sitting anywhere between the cars.

167
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:06.794
Maybe he went to drink again at another shop?

168
00:10:06.794 --> 00:10:10.394
Don't tell me that he's harassing somebody again?

169
00:10:10.394 --> 00:10:12.394
Then, let's go and look for him at the shops.

170
00:10:12.394 --> 00:10:14.094
-Huh? -Okay.

171
00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:16.594
Hey! You guys help us look

172
00:10:16.594 --> 00:10:18.494
-in the nearby shops, too. -What?

173
00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:19.994
But how?

174
00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.994
We don't know what he looks like.

175
00:10:22.994 --> 00:10:24.994
This is his picture.

176
00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:27.294
If you like, I can forward it to you.

177
00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.294
Okay.

178
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:34.094
Hey, our rental car was parked around here too, right?

179
00:10:34.094 --> 00:10:36.094
-Mr. Kyogoku... -Right.

180
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.294
But if he's hassled Makoto,

181
00:10:38.294 --> 00:10:42.194
he would probably beat the guy to a pulp.

182
00:10:42.194 --> 00:10:44.894
Well, I don't think he'll beat the guy to a pulp, though.

183
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.894
"Yakitori"

184
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:05.294
Darn it. He's nowhere to be found.

185
00:11:05.294 --> 00:11:06.694
He's not over here either.

186
00:11:06.694 --> 00:11:08.694
He hasn't come back to the car either!

187
00:11:08.694 --> 00:11:11.494
It seems like his cell phone is switched off, too.

188
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:15.994
I wonder where he is.

189
00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:22.194
What is it? What's that sound?

190
00:11:25.994 --> 00:11:28.194
We've tried looking under the cars as well,

191
00:11:28.194 --> 00:11:31.394
but it seems that he's not in this parking lot after all.

192
00:11:31.394 --> 00:11:34.894
If so, we'd better call the police and ask them to search for him.

193
00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:39.494
What... What's the matter?

194
00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:41.994
The... The toilet door was unlocked.

195
00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:46.094
So I opened it, and inside it...

196
00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:06.553
Palpebral conjunctivitis, petechiae,

197
00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:09.153
and foam coming out from his mouth.

198
00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:11.053
His face isn't swollen,

199
00:12:11.053 --> 00:12:14.253
and there are no strangulation marks on his neck either.

200
00:12:14.253 --> 00:12:16.353
-Was he drowned to death? -Was he drowned to death?

201
00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:20.053
Also, there are no marks of him being restrained on his legs or arms,

202
00:12:20.053 --> 00:12:23.353
and the fact that his clothes are drenched...

203
00:12:25.153 --> 00:12:26.353
What?

204
00:12:26.353 --> 00:12:28.453
Are you saying that after he was drowned somewhere,

205
00:12:28.453 --> 00:12:30.853
he was carried over to this toilet?

206
00:12:30.853 --> 00:12:32.053
Yeah.

207
00:12:32.053 --> 00:12:34.953
Judging from the death spots and rigor mortis seen on him,

208
00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:38.653
he was probably killed just about an hour ago.

209
00:12:38.653 --> 00:12:41.353
It was just around the time we started to look for him

210
00:12:41.353 --> 00:12:43.853
and headed to search the shops around here.

211
00:12:43.853 --> 00:12:47.053
And before we got back here,

212
00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:48.953
the corpse was thrown into this toilet compartment,

213
00:12:48.953 --> 00:12:50.553
and the culprit escaped.

214
00:12:50.553 --> 00:12:52.553
No way...

215
00:12:52.553 --> 00:12:54.753
Who on earth...

216
00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:58.453
This teacher had a pretty sturdy body.

217
00:12:58.453 --> 00:13:00.753
He might have been killed by more than one person

218
00:13:00.753 --> 00:13:04.553
or by someone who is really strong.

219
00:13:04.553 --> 00:13:06.053
Hey...

220
00:13:09.953 --> 00:13:12.353
Did something happen?

221
00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:18.653
So, the victim of the murder is

222
00:13:18.653 --> 00:13:21.053
Mr. Masahiro Tanba, aged 32,

223
00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:24.253
a PE teacher in Jr. High School.

224
00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:26.653
And the one who discovered the corpse

225
00:13:26.653 --> 00:13:29.253
is Ms. Sunami Masaki, a science teacher

226
00:13:29.253 --> 00:13:32.453
from the same Jr. High School. Is that right?

227
00:13:32.453 --> 00:13:34.053
Yes.

228
00:13:34.053 --> 00:13:36.453
Then, will you please tell me

229
00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:38.753
how exactly you went about discovering the corpse?

230
00:13:38.753 --> 00:13:39.953
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:44.053
Mr. Tanba, my colleague, Michiko and I

232
00:13:44.053 --> 00:13:47.553
were planning to play bowling here today.

233
00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:50.253
But he ended up wasted after drinking beer

234
00:13:50.253 --> 00:13:52.753
when we came here in a car,

235
00:13:52.753 --> 00:13:55.253
and got into trouble after getting violent in town.

236
00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:57.453
We decided to let him sleep it off,

237
00:13:57.453 --> 00:14:00.053
so I took him back to Michiko's car.

238
00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:01.653
Colleague?

239
00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:04.053
Does that mean that you're also a teacher at Jr. High?

240
00:14:04.053 --> 00:14:07.053
Yes. I teach mathematics.

241
00:14:07.053 --> 00:14:08.453
I see.

242
00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:09.953
And? What happened after that?

243
00:14:09.953 --> 00:14:13.053
After bowling with Sunami for about an hour,

244
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:16.653
I went to the car to check on him.

245
00:14:16.653 --> 00:14:18.853
He went through a lot,

246
00:14:18.853 --> 00:14:20.953
so I thought I shouldn't keep him alone for too long.

247
00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:23.653
But when I went there, he wasn't in the car.

248
00:14:23.653 --> 00:14:26.653
So we all ended up searching for him immediately.

249
00:14:26.653 --> 00:14:28.453
Who did you mean by "we all"?

250
00:14:28.453 --> 00:14:30.653
The people whom we happened to become acquainted with

251
00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:32.153
at this bowling alley.

252
00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:35.453
It's me, Kogoro Mouri here.

253
00:14:35.453 --> 00:14:37.853
I see. It's Mr. Mouri!

254
00:14:37.853 --> 00:14:41.753
After that, we searched the parking lot, but couldn't find him.

255
00:14:41.753 --> 00:14:45.953
So, thinking that maybe he went out drinking somewhere again,

256
00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:47.653
I split up with the girls

257
00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:51.253
and searched the pubs in this vicinity for about an hour.

258
00:14:51.253 --> 00:14:52.853
But since we still couldn't find him,

259
00:14:52.853 --> 00:14:55.753
we came back to this parking lot again.

260
00:14:55.753 --> 00:14:59.453
We figured that he might have gone back to the car by then.

261
00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:04.153
And just as we thought, he did come back.

262
00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:06.453
He went into the toilet here in this parking lot

263
00:15:06.453 --> 00:15:08.953
as a cold, drowned corpse.

264
00:15:08.953 --> 00:15:10.553
Drowned?

265
00:15:10.553 --> 00:15:12.653
-Is that so? -Yes, sir.

266
00:15:12.653 --> 00:15:15.353
We can't conclude anything until after the autopsy,

267
00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:17.253
but judging from the circumstances of the corpse,

268
00:15:17.253 --> 00:15:19.353
that's most likely it.

269
00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:21.653
So, what's the estimated time of death?

270
00:15:21.653 --> 00:15:24.053
A little before or after 5.00 pm.

271
00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.953
I see. Around 5.00 pm?

272
00:15:26.953 --> 00:15:29.853
That's just around the time we left this parking lot

273
00:15:29.853 --> 00:15:32.253
and started searching inside the pubs.

274
00:15:32.253 --> 00:15:33.653
Yeah.

275
00:15:33.653 --> 00:15:39.553
But why didn't you check inside the toilet to begin with?

276
00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:42.053
It was locked with a padlock.

277
00:15:42.053 --> 00:15:46.053
There was also an "Out of Order" sign on the door.

278
00:15:46.053 --> 00:15:48.453
A sign, you said?

279
00:15:48.453 --> 00:15:50.753
I saw it, too!

280
00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:53.953
But the second time we came back here,

281
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.153
that sign was peeled off,

282
00:15:56.153 --> 00:15:59.553
and the padlock was gone.

283
00:15:59.553 --> 00:16:02.653
So I opened the door of the toilet compartment,

284
00:16:02.653 --> 00:16:05.853
and I found Mr. Tanba...

285
00:16:07.153 --> 00:16:09.453
That means the victim was carried off by someone

286
00:16:09.453 --> 00:16:12.253
between the time when Ms. Sunami brought him to the car

287
00:16:12.253 --> 00:16:16.653
and the time Ms. Michiko came to check up on him.

288
00:16:16.653 --> 00:16:18.153
So while Mr. Mouri, you and the others

289
00:16:18.153 --> 00:16:19.753
went out to search the pubs for him,

290
00:16:19.753 --> 00:16:21.853
he was drowned somewhere else.

291
00:16:21.853 --> 00:16:24.553
And before you and the others got back here,

292
00:16:24.553 --> 00:16:26.453
his corpse was placed inside the toilet compartment.

293
00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:27.853
Is that right?

294
00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:30.453
Yeah. That's the story.

295
00:16:30.453 --> 00:16:33.953
By the way, is there any chance that someone

296
00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:35.153
was after Mr. Tanba's life?

297
00:16:35.153 --> 00:16:38.753
I don't know. But when he got drunk, his personality would change

298
00:16:38.753 --> 00:16:41.553
and he would hassle anybody in sight.

299
00:16:41.553 --> 00:16:47.253
Therefore, he said that he wouldn't drink at all today.

300
00:16:47.253 --> 00:16:49.453
Inspector Yamamura!

301
00:16:49.453 --> 00:16:51.853
There is a bruise found on the stomach of the victim.

302
00:16:51.853 --> 00:16:54.053
A bruise?

303
00:16:54.053 --> 00:16:56.053
You're right.

304
00:16:56.053 --> 00:16:59.153
It was probably me.

305
00:16:59.153 --> 00:17:02.053
Since he was drunk and picked a fight with me,

306
00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:04.053
I punched him in his solar plexus.

307
00:17:04.053 --> 00:17:05.553
He picked a fight?

308
00:17:05.553 --> 00:17:09.653
He shouted loudly when our eyes met.

309
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:12.153
You're quite a pushover, aren't you?

310
00:17:12.153 --> 00:17:14.353
You were looking for him together with Mr. Mouri

311
00:17:14.353 --> 00:17:16.253
and the others, weren't you?

312
00:17:16.253 --> 00:17:18.553
No. I was taking a nap

313
00:17:18.553 --> 00:17:21.953
in Mr. Mouri's car that's parked here.

314
00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:29.353
We'll arrest you immediately on charges of murder!

315
00:17:29.353 --> 00:17:31.353
Hold it, Yamamura.

316
00:17:31.353 --> 00:17:33.053
Would anybody kill someone

317
00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.653
just because the person picked a fight with him?

318
00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.753
What are you saying...

319
00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:39.053
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

320
00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:43.953
He confessed to what he did, thanks to my skillful tact.

321
00:17:43.953 --> 00:17:47.153
He just said he had a motive and no alibi.

322
00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:49.653
But... But you can't just arrest him

323
00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:51.753
based on something like that, can you?

324
00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:55.053
He's just like his usual self, that klutz.

325
00:17:56.653 --> 00:17:58.653
Just what do you think you're talking about?

326
00:17:58.653 --> 00:18:02.053
Makoto isn't the culprit!

327
00:18:02.053 --> 00:18:05.653
Then, can you prove his innocence?

328
00:18:05.653 --> 00:18:08.153
Yes! Of course, I can!

329
00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:11.453
Because... Because Makoto is...

330
00:18:11.453 --> 00:18:13.253
Makoto is?

331
00:18:14.953 --> 00:18:17.553
A very fantastic, kind and good person!

332
00:18:17.553 --> 00:18:20.853
That's why!

333
00:18:25.053 --> 00:18:27.853
You're not providing him with any evidence.

334
00:18:27.853 --> 00:18:31.053
Inspector Yamamura! Take a look at this.

335
00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:34.253
There are burn marks on his left shoulder.

336
00:18:34.253 --> 00:18:35.653
It's most likely

337
00:18:35.653 --> 00:18:38.653
that the victim was rendered unconscious with a stun gun or something.

338
00:18:38.653 --> 00:18:39.753
Stun gun?

339
00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:42.253
If the culprit used a stun gun,

340
00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:44.853
I don't think this guy is the culprit.

341
00:18:44.853 --> 00:18:46.453
Why not?

342
00:18:46.453 --> 00:18:49.653
Because all he needed to do was to punch him once in the stomach

343
00:18:49.653 --> 00:18:51.353
to knock him out.

344
00:18:51.353 --> 00:18:54.553
And besides, if he strikes another punch on the same spot,

345
00:18:54.553 --> 00:18:56.553
it would be lethal without leaving new traces.

346
00:18:56.553 --> 00:19:00.353
But what if he deliberately used a stun gun just to deceive everyone?

347
00:19:00.353 --> 00:19:02.353
It's hard to think that this Iron Karate Man

348
00:19:02.353 --> 00:19:05.153
would be walking around with a stun gun

349
00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:07.553
to protect himself.

350
00:19:07.553 --> 00:19:09.953
Iron Karate Man?

351
00:19:09.953 --> 00:19:12.953
He has won many championships at a lot of major tournaments.

352
00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:15.353
Right! He has won 400 games and lost none.

353
00:19:15.353 --> 00:19:18.153
He's the Prince of Formidable Kick Attacks!

354
00:19:18.153 --> 00:19:21.453
Geez. You should've come right out and told me.

355
00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:24.553
Why didn't you tell me so to begin with?

356
00:19:24.553 --> 00:19:27.953
You met him during the red handkerchief incident.

357
00:19:27.953 --> 00:19:31.253
Yamamura, are you sick or something?

358
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:32.253
Huh?

359
00:19:32.253 --> 00:19:35.553
Well, you used to talk in a funny way before,

360
00:19:35.553 --> 00:19:38.053
but now...

361
00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.053
I used to talk like that

362
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:42.153
just to get everyone off their guard.

363
00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:43.653
Now that I've become an inspector,

364
00:19:43.653 --> 00:19:47.953
I don't have to use childish talk like that anymore.

365
00:19:49.953 --> 00:19:51.153
Is that so?

366
00:19:51.153 --> 00:19:54.853
Then, if you were in this parking lot the whole time,

367
00:19:54.853 --> 00:19:56.353
didn't you see any suspicious people?

368
00:19:56.353 --> 00:19:59.353
No. I was sleeping like a log.

369
00:19:59.353 --> 00:20:02.553
I see. Sleeping like a log...

370
00:20:04.553 --> 00:20:05.953
Stop!

371
00:20:05.953 --> 00:20:07.953
Wait for me!

372
00:20:11.153 --> 00:20:12.853
That was close.

373
00:20:12.853 --> 00:20:15.953
This place is a bit tilted, it seems.

374
00:20:15.953 --> 00:20:18.853
Yes, it seems that the land is a bit tilted

375
00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:21.153
due to ground sinkage.

376
00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.853
They said they'll begin the repair work from next month.

377
00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:26.553
I see.

378
00:20:26.553 --> 00:20:28.553
Ground sinkage...

379
00:20:28.553 --> 00:20:31.753
Wait a second. If so,

380
00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:36.053
the slanted mud marks found on this wall...

381
00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:37.753
Don't tell me...

382
00:20:40.853 --> 00:20:43.853
-It's raining. -Oh, no. It started raining again.

383
00:20:43.853 --> 00:20:46.653
Let's take shelter in the bowling alley for now.

384
00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:49.053
Let's continue talking there.

385
00:20:57.753 --> 00:20:59.353
What's up, Conan?

386
00:20:59.353 --> 00:21:01.553
You'd better hurry and go, too.

387
00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:03.153
Well...

388
00:21:03.153 --> 00:21:05.353
That ventilation hole of the toilet over there.

389
00:21:05.353 --> 00:21:07.353
-Doesn't it seem strange? -What?

390
00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:09.653
It's the only spot where the water doesn't drip over,

391
00:21:09.653 --> 00:21:11.853
but leaves behind droplets instead.

392
00:21:14.253 --> 00:21:16.953
It's a bit sticky.

393
00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:20.353
Maybe something was pasted on there?

394
00:21:20.353 --> 00:21:22.253
Hey, you two.

395
00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:24.253
You two should hurry and go inside, too.

396
00:21:24.253 --> 00:21:25.853
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

397
00:21:31.553 --> 00:21:35.853
There are water droplets likewise, around the edges of door, too.

398
00:21:35.853 --> 00:21:39.253
It's as if somebody sealed the place off with masking tape.

399
00:21:39.253 --> 00:21:42.953
He didn't suffocate, but drowned to death, right?

400
00:21:42.953 --> 00:21:44.253
Yeah.

401
00:21:44.253 --> 00:21:47.053
Besides, there are no similar water droplets

402
00:21:47.053 --> 00:21:49.753
around the ventilation hole at the bottom of the door.

403
00:21:49.753 --> 00:21:52.853
Even if the door were to be sealed, this would do no good.

404
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.553
True.

405
00:21:54.553 --> 00:21:56.153
Besides that,

406
00:21:56.153 --> 00:21:59.653
wasn't there some kind of smell when we first got here?

407
00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:01.053
Yeah.

408
00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:02.553
-The smell of kerosene! -The smell of kerosene!

409
00:22:02.553 --> 00:22:04.553
You two!

410
00:22:04.553 --> 00:22:07.153
Didn't you hear what I told you a while ago?

411
00:22:07.153 --> 00:22:08.253
Yes, we did.

412
00:22:08.253 --> 00:22:10.353
We'll get going right now!

413
00:23:53.053 --> 00:23:55.053
There's a burn mark on the ceiling?

414
00:23:55.053 --> 00:23:58.153
That's why I'm telling you to hurry

415
00:23:58.153 --> 00:24:01.053
and ask around the pubs in this vicinity.

416
00:24:01.053 --> 00:24:02.653
Makoto!

417
00:24:02.653 --> 00:24:04.753
-Let him be! -Huh?

418
00:24:04.753 --> 00:24:06.353
Hey, tomboy.

419
00:24:06.353 --> 00:24:09.553
You help set up the trick.

420
00:24:09.553 --> 00:24:12.853
You know how to work this trick too, don't you?

421
00:24:12.853 --> 00:24:18.253
Next Conan, "Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 2)"

422
00:24:36.853 --> 00:24:39.153
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:39.153 --> 00:24:41.153
"Witch"

424
00:24:41.153 --> 00:24:43.053
What's up, Ran? Why are you staring at me?

425
00:24:43.053 --> 00:24:44.353
Karate vs. Jeet Kune Do.

426
00:24:44.353 --> 00:24:46.453
Ran's on fire.
