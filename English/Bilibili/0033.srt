1
00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:07.763
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07.763 --> 00:00:09.473
Today's stage is a treasure hunt!

3
00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:11.433
Will we find treasure of the heart?!

4
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.353
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:13.353 --> 00:00:15.313
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:17.523
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.630
The Detective League Survival Case.

8
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.810
Oh, here it is!

9
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.350
Hey, Professor!
Is this map real?!

10
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.080
Yes, it certainly is!

11
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.350
So, then there
really is treasure?!

12
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.250
We'll just have
to find out, won't we?

13
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600
I will find that treasure!

14
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.360
Me too!

15
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.510
Me three!

16
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.480
Say, Professor.

17
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.470
Where did you get
that phony map anyway?

18
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.640
Really want to know?

19
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.190
You'd just lie anyway.

20
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.520
You'll find out for yourself
when you get to the end!

21
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.360
To the end, huh?

22
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.850
I'm too old for treasure hunts.

23
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.050
This is where we are, at Skull Tree.

24
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.510
First, you need to make
your way to London Bridge!

25
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.230
Alright!

26
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.810
Well, I'm going to do
some fishing here,

27
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.970
so have fun, you guys!

28
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.010
Alright!

29
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.980
Come on, I'm not a kid!

30
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.480
Well, maybe I am...

31
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.010
Hey, Conan-kun!

32
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.880
What do you think the treasure is?

33
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.590
We still don't know
if there really is treasure--

34
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.590
Of course there is! Right, Mitsuhiko?

35
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.970
Yeah! Diamonds, or jewels,
or maybe even buried gold!

36
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.920
Whoa! That'd be awesome!

37
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.010
Yeah!

38
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.250
Yeah, right.

39
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.340
Skull Tree

40
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.970
London Bridge

41
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.880
I was worried it might fall down

42
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.470
since it's called
the London Bridge!

43
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.530
Yeah, bridges like this
always break in the movies!

44
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.740
No way!

45
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.380
This isn't funny!

46
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.180
What was the Professor thinking,
sending us out here?!

47
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.340
Now how do we get back?!

48
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.390
London Bridge

49
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.680
Devil's Hand

50
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.390
My compass doesn't
seem to work out here...

51
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.590
Why'd he hafta hide the
treasure in these mountains?!

52
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.320
He was a mystery geek...

53
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.780
But this is too much!

54
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.510
Gimme a break! The map says there's
five cedar trees but there's only four here!

55
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.240
Is this really the place?!

56
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.470
Talk about bad luck--

57
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.290
he died in an accident
just after burying the treasure!

58
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.590
Hey! The treasure's at stake here!

59
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.230
Answer when I ask you something!

60
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.130
That's dangerous, Mister!

61
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.970
You should put cigarettes out.

62
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.680
You wouldn't want
to start a forest fire.

63
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.970
W-Who are you?

64
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.230
We're the Junior Detective League!

65
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.630
Huh? These maps look a lot alike...

66
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.110
Hey! What're you lookin' at?!

67
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.220
Nothing!

68
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.360
Hey. Let's go!

69
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.510
Go where?

70
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.370
Just come on!

71
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.840
Those guys don't seem like hikers!

72
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.180
They have a shovel,
but they're wearing suits!

73
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.210
And what exactly is that map?!

74
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.510
Hey, we're right here, right?

75
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.680
Eh? Yeah, I think so,

76
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.510
but the compass isn't working...

77
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.180
Conan! There's only four cedar trees.
Is this the right place?

78
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.190
Yeah, it is!

79
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.200
Move for a second!

80
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.150
Look! This is the fifth cedar tree!

81
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.010
It's hard to tell because
it was chopped down.

82
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.300
See how these annual
rings are pointing out?

83
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.620
This side got a lot more
sunlight so it grew better!

84
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.580
So that way's south?

85
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.050
Bingo!

86
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.310
So which path do we take?

87
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.040
Let me see the map.

88
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.710
"Devil's Hand - Enter
through the narrow path."

89
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.840
The "Devil's Hand" is your left hand,

90
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.010
so that narrows it
down to the two on the left.

91
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.180
It says,
"Enter through the narrow path,"

92
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.680
so we take the narrowest
path on the very left!

93
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.640
You're so smart, Conan-kun!

94
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.680
So the "Devil's Hand"
is your left hand?

95
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.360
Then what's your right hand?

96
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.280
The "Angel's Hand," of course...

97
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.610
You're so simple-minded...

98
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.830
Why do those kids have that map?

99
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
That kid sure is smart, huh?

100
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.590
Let's hurry before
they beat us to it!

101
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.170
Right!

102
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.010
Devil's Hand

103
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.050
Speckled Band

104
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.290
Those two guys seemed fishy...

105
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.010
Yeah!

106
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.180
They're definitely looking
for the same treasure as us!

107
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.100
Yes, they did mention treasure!

108
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.850
Yeah! No doubt about it!

109
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.220
Help, I'm drowning! Mom!

110
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.930
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

111
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.180
Try standing up.

112
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.510
Oh?

113
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.760
I thought I was a goner!

114
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.970
Speckled Band

115
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.340
River Dove

116
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.220
Walton's Shore

117
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.880
Not even the best camping
matches will light when they get wet...

118
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.130
Darn it. I was hoping
we could dry our clothes off...

119
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.580
We can!

120
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.660
I take the top
off the flashlight,

121
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.420
remove the reflector,
and put a match in it.

122
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.710
Then I just point it at the sun

123
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.170
and collect the light.

124
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.840
It may be a good camping match,
but it's still dripping wet...

125
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.090
Are you sure
it's even usable now?

126
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.380
Way to go, Conan-kun!
Hurray!

127
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.430
There we go!

128
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.720
You've got "old lady wisdom"!

129
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.660
Can't you at least
call it survival knowledge?

130
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.050
Speckled Band

131
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.550
Double-Head Arrow

132
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.010
Damn you! Which way is it?!

133
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.090
Damn! Damn!

134
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.090
Looks like something's
written on it...

135
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.380
It's hard to read, though...

136
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.340
Maybe we go east?

137
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.680
Alright, then which way is east?!

138
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.780
Don't look at me...

139
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.810
Bah!

140
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.780
Maybe it was too dangerous
for them to go alone...

141
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.180
Extinguish complete!

142
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.200
Extinguish confirmed!

143
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.340
Do you think we can really
make it to the end?

144
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.260
Where do we go from here?

145
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.720
I don't wanna
climb up that again!

146
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.420
Don't worry!

147
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.590
We're right here,
so if we go around like this

148
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.510
we'll make it to
our next destination.

149
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.800
In that case, let's get going!

150
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.340
Yeah!

151
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.590
Walton's Shore

152
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.680
Bandit's Balance

153
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.090
Bandit's Balance

154
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.130
Weissmuller's Gorge

155
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.380
9.9...

156
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.510
Weissmuller's Gorge

157
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.680
Double-Head Arrow

158
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.760
It was only cut recently...

159
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.680
It looks like it was chopped
with something sharp...

160
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.050
But not a knife or a blade.

161
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.550
Maybe a shovel or something...

162
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.260
A shovel?

163
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.220
Aha! Those two were here!

164
00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.718
What do you think it says?

165
00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:18.438
It looks like some sort of code,
but it's unreadable...

166
00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:19.428
I know!

167
00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:23.318
If we put paper on it
and rub a pencil over it,

168
00:12:23.318 --> 00:12:25.268
won't the letters come out?

169
00:12:26.148 --> 00:12:27.098
Good thinking!

170
00:12:27.688 --> 00:12:30.978
But we didn't bring
any paper or pencils...

171
00:12:30.978 --> 00:12:31.898
Nope...

172
00:12:31.898 --> 00:12:34.648
I have a felt-tip
pen for some reason.

173
00:12:34.648 --> 00:12:35.928
That'd work!

174
00:12:36.938 --> 00:12:38.028
This would?

175
00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:40.238
No, what Ayumi-chan suggested!

176
00:12:40.728 --> 00:12:42.318
Let me see that.

177
00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:43.638
What are you going to do?

178
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.908
Just watch.

179
00:12:46.868 --> 00:12:49.248
First I pour canteen water on the sign.

180
00:12:49.608 --> 00:12:52.708
Then I rub dirt into the writing,

181
00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:55.338
and when I wipe it away...

182
00:12:55.858 --> 00:13:00.298
Dirt stays in the carved writing,
making it readable!

183
00:13:00.728 --> 00:13:05.268
"The sun's hand shows
the time and way. Go east!"

184
00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:07.728
Hey, which way is east?

185
00:13:07.728 --> 00:13:09.398
Eh? Good question...

186
00:13:09.398 --> 00:13:11.268
No tree trunks this time...

187
00:13:12.068 --> 00:13:14.568
The sun's hand? Go east?

188
00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:15.728
Wait a minute!

189
00:13:17.318 --> 00:13:19.068
What is it, Conan-kun?

190
00:13:21.028 --> 00:13:24.238
Yeah, this'll show
us which way is which!

191
00:13:24.728 --> 00:13:26.768
If you point the
hour hand at the sun,

192
00:13:26.768 --> 00:13:30.978
south is halfway
between it and the twelve.

193
00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:34.108
So east is ninety degrees to the left!

194
00:13:34.108 --> 00:13:35.818
Which means?

195
00:13:37.068 --> 00:13:38.398
This way is east!

196
00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:42.138
Awesome, Conan-kun!
"Old lady wisdom - part two"!

197
00:13:42.648 --> 00:13:44.558
Stop saying that...

198
00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:46.148
Alright! Let's go!

199
00:13:46.148 --> 00:13:47.138
Yeah!

200
00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:51.268
Tree of Bosporus

201
00:13:55.898 --> 00:13:58.768
Chieftain's Home

202
00:14:03.568 --> 00:14:07.618
Big Bear and Little Bear Hill

203
00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:24.048
"Walk from where the sky water
and stones point. Five."

204
00:14:24.048 --> 00:14:26.478
What do you
think the "sky water" is?

205
00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:27.788
Isn't it rain?

206
00:14:27.788 --> 00:14:29.478
Isn't that too simple?

207
00:14:29.478 --> 00:14:30.688
Yeah, huh?

208
00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:34.188
Five stone pillars...

209
00:14:34.188 --> 00:14:36.648
If these are the stones, then...

210
00:14:36.648 --> 00:14:38.188
Genta! Gimme a lift!

211
00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:40.898
What's the big idea?!

212
00:14:45.228 --> 00:14:47.518
The pillars form a W!

213
00:14:47.518 --> 00:14:51.068
W... West... That's it!

214
00:14:51.068 --> 00:14:53.538
Then what does "sky water" mean?

215
00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:56.318
Say, Conan-kun.
Did you figure anything out?

216
00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:59.958
Yeah. I'm wondering if it's five
paces west of the middle pillar...

217
00:15:05.728 --> 00:15:07.388
Let's see here...

218
00:15:07.388 --> 00:15:10.468
Hey, Conan!
There's nothing here!

219
00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:16.148
If it's not a W,
then maybe an M...

220
00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:18.188
Or it could be a B!

221
00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:21.258
But what's the sky water--

222
00:15:22.148 --> 00:15:23.548
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?!

223
00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.188
Where are you?!

224
00:15:25.188 --> 00:15:26.738
Over here!

225
00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:27.238
Ow!

226
00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:28.228
Mitsuhiko!
Ow!

227
00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:29.938
I tripped over a tree

228
00:15:29.938 --> 00:15:33.608
and hit my head on that stone...

229
00:15:35.228 --> 00:15:36.708
A tree and a stone?!

230
00:15:40.228 --> 00:15:42.858
It doesn't appear to have
been moved for a long time.

231
00:15:44.938 --> 00:15:45.968
What's this?

232
00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.348
Could this shape be--

233
00:15:54.858 --> 00:15:58.438
It's the Big Dipper,
made out of logs and stones!

234
00:15:58.438 --> 00:15:59.688
Now I see!

235
00:15:59.688 --> 00:16:02.568
It's shaped like a ladle,
hence the "sky water"!

236
00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:04.488
Which means--

237
00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:12.188
Aha! Those pillars are
the Cassiopeia constellation!

238
00:16:12.188 --> 00:16:15.068
In other words,
the sky water and the stones

239
00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:16.708
point to the North Star!

240
00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:20.478
The North Star is located
about five times the distance

241
00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:24.978
between the two end stars
of the Big Dipper!

242
00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:31.068
And it's also located off
of Cassiopeia's central star,

243
00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:34.638
about five times the distance
between each of its stars!

244
00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:42.768
That sneaky Professor!

245
00:16:45.398 --> 00:16:48.188
Hey! There's a
rock with writing on it!

246
00:16:48.188 --> 00:16:49.408
I figured as such!

247
00:16:49.768 --> 00:16:52.828
Polaris is the North Star,
hence the P!

248
00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:56.288
This is it! This is
definitely the place!

249
00:16:58.728 --> 00:17:01.148
Remember, five paces!

250
00:17:01.148 --> 00:17:02.248
Right!

251
00:17:02.818 --> 00:17:06.718
One! Two! Three! Four!

252
00:17:07.188 --> 00:17:08.098
Five!

253
00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:13.848
Everyone get away!

254
00:17:17.648 --> 00:17:18.748
Alright! Let's go!

255
00:17:18.748 --> 00:17:19.978
Yeah!

256
00:17:28.398 --> 00:17:30.188
Conan-kun! Is this--

257
00:17:30.188 --> 00:17:31.898
It has to be the treasure!

258
00:17:31.898 --> 00:17:33.828
Hurry up and open it, Conan!

259
00:17:41.608 --> 00:17:43.588
Could these jewels actually be--

260
00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:45.228
We did it, Mitsuhiko!

261
00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:48.728
Now I can have all
the eel dishes in the world!

262
00:17:48.728 --> 00:17:50.428
Yeah! And I'll--

263
00:17:50.428 --> 00:17:53.178
Sorry to interrupt...

264
00:17:54.068 --> 00:17:56.228
...but I'll be taking that now.

265
00:17:56.228 --> 00:17:58.058
You're that guy!

266
00:17:58.518 --> 00:17:59.818
No doubt about it!

267
00:17:59.818 --> 00:18:01.518
These guys are jewel thieves!

268
00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:03.978
Hand it over!

269
00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:07.228
Come on!

270
00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:13.398
Don't be tryin' to play hero!

271
00:18:15.648 --> 00:18:16.828
Go!

272
00:18:21.438 --> 00:18:24.208
The man down there
said to give you this.

273
00:18:25.498 --> 00:18:26.438
Here you go!

274
00:18:33.648 --> 00:18:38.228
Hey, Conan-kun. What happened?

275
00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:41.398
Maybe he tripped and hit his head?

276
00:18:41.398 --> 00:18:42.728
You mean like Mitsuhiko?

277
00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:46.728
That's not funny! It really hurts!

278
00:18:49.898 --> 00:18:52.978
This is it-- our real treasure!

279
00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:54.238
Yeah...

280
00:18:59.648 --> 00:19:04.068
Don't tell me this is the treasure?

281
00:19:04.068 --> 00:19:06.318
This single scrap of paper?

282
00:19:06.318 --> 00:19:08.298
Conan-kun! What does it say?!

283
00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:15.438
"The treasure is everything
you experienced to get here.

284
00:19:17.148 --> 00:19:19.258
You might have
fallen into the river,

285
00:19:19.768 --> 00:19:21.678
started a fire, caught fish,

286
00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:25.188
and worked with your
friends to arrive here...

287
00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:28.228
All of those experiences.

288
00:19:28.228 --> 00:19:30.648
You might not understand this now,

289
00:19:30.648 --> 00:19:35.608
but someday it will
be an obvious treasure--

290
00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:37.158
and probably worth a fortune.

291
00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:43.828
If possible, please pass this
adventure on to your successors!"

292
00:19:44.438 --> 00:19:47.648
I don't really get it...

293
00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:50.978
Oh, well!

294
00:19:50.978 --> 00:19:53.838
It's like... Yeah...

295
00:20:04.318 --> 00:20:06.978
Yusaku, Kudo...

296
00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:11.688
You'll find out for yourself
when you get to the end!

297
00:20:13.978 --> 00:20:16.518
Dad wrote this!

298
00:20:16.518 --> 00:20:21.698
Who could possibly duplicate
that peculiar K of his?!

299
00:20:24.898 --> 00:20:27.648
I should've noticed from the start.

300
00:20:27.648 --> 00:20:30.818
The summit across the
river we were camping on

301
00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:33.568
was the place we were looking for.

302
00:20:34.978 --> 00:20:37.258
I never expected to
see the Professor's camp

303
00:20:37.258 --> 00:20:39.228
from the top of that tree...

304
00:20:45.648 --> 00:20:47.848
But even though
it wasn't very far away,

305
00:20:48.318 --> 00:20:50.808
getting there was pretty hard!

306
00:20:51.898 --> 00:20:53.398
Upon hearing the situation,

307
00:20:53.398 --> 00:20:55.318
the professor immediately
called the police

308
00:20:55.318 --> 00:20:56.778
and the jewel thieves were arrested.

309
00:20:57.688 --> 00:21:00.228
They decided to question
us the following day

310
00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:02.398
so we got to go for the night.

311
00:21:08.688 --> 00:21:11.838
I called it a stupid
treasure hunt at first,

312
00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:14.628
but adventures
like this are always fun,

313
00:21:15.728 --> 00:21:19.338
so even though I'm 17,
I really enjoyed it.

314
00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:26.178
The treasure didn't
turn out to be those jewels,

315
00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:31.168
but it was there, Dad. It was there--

316
00:21:34.108 --> 00:21:36.818
--the real treasure.

317
00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:17.498
It happened shortly
after you were born, Shinichi.

318
00:23:18.028 --> 00:23:21.948
Your old man's nearly-released
manuscript was stolen.

319
00:23:21.948 --> 00:23:23.218
Stolen?

320
00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:24.698
Judging from the situation,

321
00:23:24.698 --> 00:23:28.618
it appeared to have
been one of his fans,

322
00:23:28.618 --> 00:23:31.278
but neither the thief nor
the manuscript was ever found.

323
00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:38.398
So that's who the dead jewel
thief was who drew the other map...

324
00:23:38.398 --> 00:23:44.858
Yes. He couldn't afford to
release it as it had been stolen,

325
00:23:45.118 --> 00:23:48.868
but I never thought
it would turn up like this...

326
00:23:51.488 --> 00:23:53.828
Kudo Yusaku

327
00:23:56.498 --> 00:24:01.458
To my son, Shinichi

328
00:24:17.908 --> 00:24:19.268
Oh no! Ran and the others are gone!

329
00:24:24.108 --> 00:24:25.648
Ran! Look out!

330
00:24:28.908 --> 00:24:30.948
Ran! Get up!

331
00:24:36.068 --> 00:24:38.828
Why? Why is he after Ran?!

332
00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:40.318
On the next Conan--

333
00:24:40.318 --> 00:24:44.798
"The Mountain Lodge Bandage
Man Murder Case (Part 1)."

334
00:25:00.368 --> 00:25:02.618
Next Conan's Hint:

335
00:25:02.618 --> 00:25:04.168
Sneak-a-peek.
