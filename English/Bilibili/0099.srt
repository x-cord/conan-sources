1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,180
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,510
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,180
Today is the pottery
case solution!

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,170
There are no cracks
in Conan's logic!

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,050
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,840
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,590
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,909
Kikuemon-san, a potter and
living national treasure,

9
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,829
invited me, Ran, and the old
guy to his home in West Tama.

10
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,879
Before long,
an incident occurred!

11
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,789
Masuko-san broke Kikuemon-san's
latest work, the Fusui-maru!

12
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,419
That night, during a get-together,
Masuko-san became very drunk.

13
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,559
The following
morning in the storeroom...

14
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,519
...she was hanged to death!

15
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,789
"The Famous Potter Murder Case (Part 2)."

16
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:18,739
Were you really all
together in the stateroom?

17
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,619
Y-Yes. The only one who left
was Otani, who went to wake her.

18
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:24,509
Right?

19
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,209
Eh?

20
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,789
Don't tell me you pretended to
wake her and hung her in her sleep!

21
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:32,879
N-No! I was only gone for a moment!

22
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:36,999
Her room is only two
over from the stateroom!

23
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,129
Is this true?

24
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,119
Yes.

25
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,349
I think he was gone
for less than ten seconds.

26
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,559
He couldn't have done
anything in such a short time...

27
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,289
Did anyone else leave?

28
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:51,029
Well, I left for a
short moment to call her.

29
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,289
We thought she
had gone somewhere.

30
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:55,959
I didn't really leave, though;

31
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,039
I only called her cell phone from
the phone in the connecting hallway.

32
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,079
That's strange. She's not answering.

33
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,999
Cell phone? Hers?

34
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:14,219
That's right. I had Masuko-san
always carry a cell phone.

35
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,459
She was in charge of everything else,

36
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,259
so that we could focus
on making our works.

37
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,969
What is "everything else"?

38
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,999
Things like business transactions
and scheduling exhibitions.

39
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,309
So our master very rarely goes anywhere.

40
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:35,279
But that's odd. We didn't
find a cell phone by her body.

41
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:40,369
Oh, a cell phone was
found in the victim's room.

42
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:44,159
It was apparently under her futon...

43
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,289
Under her futon?

44
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:53,049
She always put it under her
pillow and used it as an alarm clock.

45
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,509
The cell phone
was apparently turned off.

46
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:02,639
I see. So that's why a call from just
the other room wouldn't be heard.

47
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,119
So, did anyone else leave the room?

48
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,129
No, no one else.

49
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,149
No one...

50
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,309
Not that I know of.

51
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:17,079
Then who could have carried
her in here and killed her?

52
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,779
Assuming she was found
right after she was hanged,

53
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:23,239
everyone has an alibi
of being in the stateroom.

54
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:26,199
That's what I'm saying!
It was a suicide!

55
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,789
Her feet were bare because she
was upset and about to kill herself,

56
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,749
and her feet weren't dirty because
she used the stepping stones

57
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:38,929
between the house
and the storeroom.

58
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:43,599
Plus, she had broken the
Fusui-maru in this storeroom.

59
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:48,119
I can imagine her seeing
the storeroom when she woke up

60
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,559
and walking in without too much thought.

61
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:57,289
That's true. The rope was used
in this storeroom for packing things.

62
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,029
Plus we all heard the pot
break at the same time.

63
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,959
In any case, we won't make any progress

64
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,829
until we examine the
storeroom in more detail.

65
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,499
I ask that you all wait in the
stateroom for the time being.

66
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,419
Please don't do
anything without permission.

67
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:20,329
Suicide? Is that really what it was?

68
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,049
Still, too many things
are out of the ordinary.

69
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,789
The open cut on her right leg...

70
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:33,619
Her unusual lack of footwear
and the clean bottoms of her feet...

71
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:34,619
And...

72
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:42,289
...this marble I found by the broken
Fusui-maru the day before...

73
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,819
And what's the other thing?!

74
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:48,459
Something I saw at the
scene of the crime is bugging me!

75
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,369
Alright, you!

76
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,659
Oh, just a marble.

77
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,749
Only kids would be
interested in junk like that.

78
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,759
Oh no!

79
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,799
Gimme a break, old guy!

80
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,159
Huh?! What the--?!

81
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,369
Hold on, Conan-kun! Where do
you think you're going?! Stop!

82
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,499
What's that?

83
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,209
Lipstick?

84
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,329
I didn't put it there...

85
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,149
What is lipstick doing here?

86
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,119
Wait a minute!

87
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,039
H-Hold on!

88
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
W-Wait! S-Stop!

89
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,839
Where are you going, Conan-kun?!

90
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:39,459
The thing that bugged me...

91
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,989
Could it be?!

92
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:47,109
What is it?

93
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,579
I forgot something.

94
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:51,289
Maybe so, but you
can't just barge in here.

95
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,159
Huh? Where's the lady's body?

96
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,189
Taken to the police hospital.

97
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,369
Oh?

98
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,779
Yes! This is it!

99
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:06,739
I finally found a trace
that the killer failed to hide!

100
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,699
The fact it's here
means that up above is...

101
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,129
Just as I thought!

102
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:22,249
Using this method, you wouldn't
need to be in the room to kill her!

103
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:30,759
But to ensure she would die,
it would have to be around there...

104
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,329
Alright!

105
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:38,939
H-Hey! What are you doing! Come down!

106
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,249
I told you, I'm looking
for something I forgot!

107
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:46,119
We just checked that area,
but there was nothing out of the ordinary!

108
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,909
Now come down! It's dangerous!

109
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,829
Yeah. Doesn't seem to
be anything but pottery here...

110
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,789
Interesting! That's a potter for you!

111
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,219
Come down this minute!

112
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,459
Okay!

113
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,879
Which means one
of those two is the killer...

114
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,509
...but it's probably that one.

115
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:19,519
He laid a trap for her and killed
her to make it look like a suicide...

116
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:26,079
And only he would
still have proof of it on him!

117
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:34,466
Alright! I know who did it and how!

118
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:38,186
The question now is
how to tell Inspector Megure...

119
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:42,726
Umm, how long do we
have to stay in the stateroom?

120
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:47,356
Oh, I'm sorry!
We'll still be a little while longer!

121
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:51,596
Could we get something to eat?
We haven't eaten at all today...

122
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,326
I'd like to change clothes, too...

123
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:57,516
Oh, that should be fine,
as long as you tell my men first!

124
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,516
No! If they do that,
the evidence'll be gone!

125
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:02,246
Evidence?

126
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,586
Shut up, you stupid kid!

127
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,476
Dad!

128
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:11,676
Evidence, my butt! This was
a suicide! There was no killer!

129
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,096
Right, Inspector?

130
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,636
Y-Yes...

131
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,306
Ouch...

132
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,436
Guess I'll just have to knock him
out with this stun-gun wristwatch...

133
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:26,346
Say! I found the thing
you were talking about earlier!

134
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:27,936
W-What thing?

135
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,636
You don't care if I say it
out loud for everyone to hear?

136
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:32,686
Huh?!

137
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:33,866
Here, listen.

138
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:38,226
As I was saying,
earlier, you told me...

139
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:50,226
Now I'll just put the
button speaker on his collar...

140
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:53,546
Oh! You found it! Well done!

141
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,726
Hold on. Just what did you find?

142
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:03,806
Evidence that the killer failed
to hide completely, of course!

143
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:06,106
K-Killer?! Are you saying--?!

144
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:10,526
Yes. She didn't commit
suicide at all. She was murdered.

145
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,726
By someone here, in fact.

146
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:19,306
Oh! This should be interesting!

147
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:24,206
It's an honor to watch the great
Sleeping Kogoro at work firsthand!

148
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,096
Mori-kun! If the body
was found right after she died,

149
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:30,886
these people couldn't
possibly have done it!

150
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:33,796
Besides, you were the one
who insisted it was a suicide!

151
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,056
That was a lie meant
to throw the killer off guard.

152
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:41,266
Because we wouldn't want the
evidence to be destroyed, after all.

153
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,186
Again, just what is this evidence?!

154
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,146
Blood, Inspector!

155
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,106
Blood?

156
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:53,066
Yeah! Kogoro-ojisan asked me to
look for strange blood on the floor!

157
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:54,776
Strange blood?

158
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,746
See? He must've meant blood like this!

159
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,496
W-What is this?!

160
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,706
You carried the body over here, right?

161
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:09,626
Yes. We thought she might still be alive.

162
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:13,466
I had her arms and Seto had her legs

163
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,686
when we set her down in the corner.

164
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:16,516
Right?

165
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:17,136
Yeah.

166
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:21,596
If so, then this really is strange.

167
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,686
What's the deal with that blood?

168
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:28,566
I think blood dripped from
the body when we were carrying it...

169
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:32,486
No, not all of the blood was from then.

170
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:37,016
It's hard to tell, since
it's mixed with other blood,

171
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,446
but there's something else here.

172
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,406
S-Something else?

173
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,766
The shape that drops
of human blood make

174
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:47,976
is pretty much determined
by how far they fall.

175
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,806
The farther the fall,
the larger the circle,

176
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:54,006
and the more developed
the surrounding splatter is.

177
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:57,056
If you had carried
her by her arms and legs,

178
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:00,466
the distance from her toenails
to the floor was 50 cm at best.

179
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:06,386
However, these blood drops
clearly fell more than a meter.

180
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:09,556
The fact that such blood is here...

181
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:13,106
Are you saying she
was on top of this shelf?

182
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,596
But why?

183
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:16,816
Could it be?!

184
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:25,186
Yes. The killer had carried her
to the top of the shelf last night...

185
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:31,226
...where she slept, with a rope around
her neck, tied to the roof beam.

186
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:35,386
That way, when she woke in the morning,
she would lose her balance,

187
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:40,846
fall from the shelf,
and wind up hanging herself.

188
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:44,306
The loud sound right
after she was hanged

189
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:49,976
was from the pots
left directly below the noose.

190
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:55,136
Being hanged from that height
would result in an almost instant death.

191
00:12:55,136 --> 00:13:03,096
The broken pots would then look
like a stepstool she had overturned.

192
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:07,096
Of course, this was also meant
to hasten the body's discovery

193
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:11,496
and solidify the alibi of
the killer inside the stateroom.

194
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:15,126
Then what about
the cut on her right calf?

195
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:20,346
Look closely at the top of the shelf.
Do you see a protruding nail?

196
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:22,096
Yes, I do.

197
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:30,306
When she lost her balance and fell,
she likely cut her calf on that nail.

198
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,936
The blood landed on a
different spot on the floor

199
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:36,436
probably because she had held
on to the shelf for a few seconds.

200
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:40,846
Meaning she just happened
to get the cut on her calf?

201
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:44,946
Yes. It wasn't part of the killer's plan.

202
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:49,406
He was probably quite
shocked when he saw her cut.

203
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:54,686
But the killer would've quickly
discovered the cause of it,

204
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,126
as well as the blood right by the shelf.

205
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:04,306
Even if the body swung, the shelf
would still have been too far away.

206
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:09,596
Fearing his trick would be
figured out if this blood was found,

207
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:15,886
the killer directed the others
carrying her body to the blood

208
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:18,476
to try to hide it with new blood.

209
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:23,476
Isn't that right, the one
who left last night's party

210
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:28,036
to carry her to the storeroom
and set up this trick...

211
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,996
...Seto Ryuichi-san?!

212
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:37,546
S-Seto?! Don't tell me it was you?!

213
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:42,006
Hold on, now! I wasn't the
only one who left during the party!

214
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,436
Besides, why would
I do something so daring

215
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,806
with a great detective
like you around?!

216
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,556
You had no other choice.

217
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,936
Because she had
broken the Fusui-maru.

218
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:59,386
Wasn't it you who put a
marble under the Fusui-maru

219
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,346
to make it easy to fall?

220
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,946
To make this murder look
like a suicide that she committed

221
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,906
because of her own
mishandling of things?!

222
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,846
I get it.

223
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:12,016
If she was in charge
of selling these works,

224
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:15,846
she would've been the one
who stored and removed them here.

225
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:18,626
So she was bound
to drop it eventually.

226
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:23,436
Moreover, she fell
asleep drunk during the party.

227
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,936
Last night was the perfect chance.

228
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:30,596
Please knock this off! You shouldn't
blame me without any proof...

229
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:35,096
Actually, I believe
you're still wearing the proof.

230
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:40,566
Now then, Inspector!
Please lift up the back of his jacket!

231
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:48,446
What's this?!

232
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:49,946
Lipstick?!

233
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:54,866
That most likely got there while
you were carrying her up the shelf.

234
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:59,846
You'd have to carry her on your
shoulders to use the ladder, after all.

235
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:05,746
And then you returned to the stateroom,
as if nothing had happened.

236
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:12,056
You had left the party to carry
her here before she sobered up!

237
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:16,516
Have a look at the sitting
cushions in the stateroom.

238
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:21,016
One has a bit of the lipstick
he brought back with him.

239
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:26,976
Come on, now!
Yes, this might be her lipstick.

240
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:31,026
But maybe she just
happened to touch my back

241
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:35,516
while she was
sleeping during the party.

242
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:38,636
I was drunk last night,
so I don't really remember,

243
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:41,766
but can you say
that isn't a possibility?

244
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:42,336
Oh?

245
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:46,846
You leave me no choice then.
I'll show my trump card.

246
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:49,936
Hey, Conan!
Show 'em what you found.

247
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:53,306
C-Conan-kun!

248
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,886
Here it is, mister!

249
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,596
Conan-kun! That's dangerous!

250
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,056
Huh?

251
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,106
W-What the--?!

252
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,316
A cell phone!

253
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:13,476
What's this doing inside a pot?!

254
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:16,886
To make sure this murder
worked as planned.

255
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,976
Even if she was atop a narrow shelf,

256
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,706
there'd be no guarantee
she'd lose her balance.

257
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,376
But it'd be a different story
if a phone under her pillow rang.

258
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:31,596
In that situation, most people
would reach out without thinking.

259
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:37,346
Even more so if she used
her cell phone as an alarm clock.

260
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:44,346
Yes. Seto-san placed that
pot in the shelf directly under her

261
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:53,306
and had the cell phone in this
special double-bottomed pot ring.

262
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:58,786
Checking the cell phone's
number should make it immediately clear

263
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,136
that it belongs to Seto-san.

264
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:15,216
Tell me, detective.
How did you know it was me?

265
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:22,936
Yes, I made the call. But Otani
could have too when he left the room!

266
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,886
That's right.

267
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:28,896
I thought so too when Conan
found the pot with the phone in it.

268
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,016
Then how?!

269
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:34,656
After all, when you tried
to call her, you said this:

270
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,736
That's strange. She's not answering.

271
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:44,846
But her cell phone had
been turned off when it was found.

272
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,916
The cell phone was
apparently turned off.

273
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:52,096
In such cases,
a cell phone would reply

274
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:57,926
by saying that it is either
turned off or out of signal range.

275
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,556
My suspicion was confirmed
once I remembered that.

276
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:08,346
My suspicion that when you called,
you called a different number.

277
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:14,186
I see. I guess I should've said
I couldn't get through to her phone.

278
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:20,996
But I can't believe you'd destroy
Master's Fusui-maru to kill her!

279
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:24,456
That thing can turn
to dust for all I care.

280
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:32,336
After all, it's a counterfeit
copy I made of the real Fusui-maru.

281
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,516
C-Counterfeit?!

282
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:38,426
Yeah. The real one is
stored in a different location.

283
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:50,016
Still, even though it broke,
to think I could fool even her eyes...

284
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:53,316
My skill has really come far.

285
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:58,116
Though that's why she sold
my works for high prices, of course.

286
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,206
H-High prices?!

287
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:01,076
You don't mean--?!

288
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,306
Yeah.

289
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:08,436
She took my works and sold
them to rich, artistic know-nothings,

290
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:11,416
claiming they were Master's works!

291
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,706
W-What?!

292
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,476
By the time I realized it,
she had already sold several dozen.

293
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,016
I questioned her about it, of course,

294
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:21,346
but she not only didn't apologize...

295
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,556
You should be thankful
more than anything.

296
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:31,226
I'm actually selling the
unoriginal junk that you make!

297
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:39,736
Wait, does that mean
your recent slump was--?

298
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,056
Yeah! It was on purpose!

299
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:46,206
I didn't want to harm
Master's name any further...

300
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:50,096
But she threatened to kick
me out if I didn't keep making stuff!

301
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:53,086
I couldn't put
up with it anymore, so...

302
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,186
Y-You fool!

303
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:13,686
Why didn't you tell
Master about it?! Surely he--

304
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,596
I couldn't.

305
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:21,816
I couldn't tell him my fakes sold
for more than his authentic works...

306
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:27,846
Let's go.

307
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:14,266
Oh! So that's the
cup worth 10 million yen?!

308
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:19,346
I don't know. It doesn't
seem that valuable to me...

309
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:21,936
Appearances don't always
match what's on the inside.

310
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:23,026
Hot!

311
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,516
Gotcha!

312
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:41,226
In his case, his appearance does
match what's on the inside...
