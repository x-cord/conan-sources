1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,340
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,140
The "Hope" in the case comes with Tokyo approaching.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,940
What is to be with the two police officers?

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,153
On board the Shinkansen from Osaka,

9
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:05,653
we run into Officers Sato and Takagi escorting a suspect.

10
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:10,553
However, a bomb scare happens inside the train.

11
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:12,553
Officer Sato heads for the location.

12
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:16,653
Meanwhile, the suspect the officers are escorting

13
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,153
decides he wants to go to a restroom.

14
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:21,853
Reluctantly, Officer Takagi takes him to the john without his backup.

15
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:24,853
There, the suspect tries to commit suicide.

16
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,953
However...

17
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:37,853
"Escort on the Shinkansen (Part 2)"

18
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,853
Yes.

19
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:46,053
This is undisputedly a murder case.

20
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:48,753
Murder?

21
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,153
Yes.

22
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:54,853
First, the culprit set up a bomb scare in the train car at the back.

23
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,353
I was forced to go there.

24
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:00,453
In no way that Officer Takagi will not suspect,

25
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,353
the culprit sent a message to Ogura,

26
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,053
telling him to go to the restroom in the train car ahead of him.

27
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:08,653
Ogura was made to pretend to commit suicide

28
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,853
with the knife and fake blood hid in inside the toilet.

29
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:16,853
That way, Officer Takagi will remove his handcuffs to call me.

30
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:22,553
When Officer Takagi left, the culprit who was hiding...

31
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:26,353
immediately went to the toilet.

32
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:32,153
And killed Ogura.

33
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:37,353
But the knife was stabbed deep.

34
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:40,353
I looked inside the john to check before Ogura entered,

35
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,753
I didn't see any knife or fake blood.

36
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:46,653
Probably the knife didn't have any blade from the handle,

37
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,353
it must have been a fake knife.

38
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,153
The hiding place was probably...

39
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:56,953
the rack behind this diaper-changing table.

40
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:00,153
There must have been fake blood and knife here with a memo.

41
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:03,853
With the table raised, it can't be found.

42
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:05,753
What memo?

43
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:08,753
A memo describing a fake plan to dupe Ogura.

44
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:10,253
What?

45
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:12,053
The memo must have said, "I planted a bomb".

46
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,953
Use the fake blood and knife and pretend to commit suicide.

47
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:16,753
When the cop is gone,

48
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,053
I will cut the handcuffs lose

49
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:21,453
and let you escape when the bomb explodes".

50
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:27,153
But, why did you call Sato on the cell phone?

51
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:29,053
Well...

52
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,053
Right at that moment, we were in a tunnel,

53
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:32,353
and the cell phone didn't...

54
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:35,153
Yes.

55
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,853
There must have been a watch with the memo,

56
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,853
and the memo must have said,

57
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:44,753
"Take action when the train enters Shintanna Tunnel."

58
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,653
We've been framed.

59
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,953
But, with all this blood,

60
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:56,953
the culprit must have a lot of blood on him as well.

61
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:58,253
You're right.

62
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:02,953
People will notice if you go back with blood all over you.

63
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:06,953
Did you find somebody like that on the train on your side, Ran?

64
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,653
Yes.

65
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:12,053
After Officer Takagi took the suspect to the restroom,

66
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,753
I was watching the door.

67
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:18,353
But, only Officer Takagi returned.

68
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:23,753
The culprit left Car #3

69
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:27,553
and headed toward Car #1, toward the head of the train.

70
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:29,953
That'll make him hard to find.

71
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,053
What's this?

72
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:36,253
Something inside his bloody hand.

73
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,853
Something attaches.

74
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:43,353
So, that's it. The culprit used this for...

75
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:49,953
-I told you to watch him. -All right.

76
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:54,953
But, how could the culprit send the message "Go to the toilet" to Ogura,

77
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,953
without Officer Takagi noticing?

78
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,253
Hey, Takagi.

79
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:01,953
Yes.

80
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:05,153
After I went to the back car of the Shinkansen,

81
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:08,853
did you see anybody suspicious?

82
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:12,253
No one in particular.

83
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:17,753
After you left, I think two or three passengers passed by our seats.

84
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,053
Who were they? Do you remember their faces?

85
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,553
Well, it was just for a very short time.

86
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,153
I remember!

87
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:28,153
Only three passed by the aisle.

88
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,553
Two men were holding newspapers

89
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:32,953
and another man carried a can of coffee.

90
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:35,753
Do you think you can identify those three?

91
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:36,953
Yes.

92
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:40,853
What?

93
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:42,753
Inside the restroom...

94
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,753
A man was killed?

95
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:48,853
Then, why do we have to be interrogated by police?

96
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:52,653
Well, because just before the man left for the restroom,

97
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:56,853
you three passed by the seats.

98
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:00,353
We suspect that one of you had signaled this man to go to the restroom.

99
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,053
If you don't mind,

100
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:07,153
we would like to know why you had passed by his seat at that time.

101
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:11,753
"Tatsuro Iwakuni (47)" -My seat was four rows behind you.

102
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:15,053
When I heard the noise In the car behind me getting louder,

103
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,653
I moved to the car ahead of me

104
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,253
because I wanted to listen to the radio.

105
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,553
I see.

106
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:22,753
How about you?

107
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:23,753
Well...

108
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,753
"Norio Tokuyama (51)" -I bought a can of coffee from a vending machine

109
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:28,953
and was returning to my seat.

110
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:34,753
At that time, I heard that there was a bomb in one of the restrooms.

111
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:37,153
I never thought that somebody got killed.

112
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,753
The next person.

113
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,053
"Akira Akashi (29)" -I got scared about the bomb

114
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,253
and moved to the train car ahead.

115
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,753
I have been told that Mr. Akashi and Mr. Iwakuni

116
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:51,353
were both holding newspapers in your hands when you passed by.

117
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:52,653
Yes.

118
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,553
Yes, I did, too.

119
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:57,653
Talking about newspapers, this guy was reading one, too.

120
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:00,353
-Right? -Well, yes.

121
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:04,153
Then, could all three of you bring the newspapers?

122
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:11,453
Also, don't forget to bring the can of coffee, Mr. Tokuyama.

123
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:19,253
So, all three of them boarded the train at Shin Osaka Station.

124
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:24,453
And before boarding, you bought newspapers at the kiosk on the platform.

125
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,153
Mr. Iwakuni had Keiba 7.

126
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:32,153
Tokuyama had the morning edition of Maicho Shimbun and a can of coffee.

127
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:36,453
Mr. Akashi got Nichiuri Sports.

128
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:39,853
None of these newspapers have the words "toilet" or "restroom"

129
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,553
written in large letters.

130
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,653
None of them have holes or traces of blood.

131
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:48,553
The same is true for the can.

132
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:53,653
There is no way a message to go to the toilet can be sent.

133
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:58,053
What? Wait.

134
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,153
This must be...

135
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:05,553
What? A man stabbed himself while sitting on the toilet?

136
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:07,853
Isn't that supposed to be suicide?

137
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:10,553
Well, that was a hoax to try to deceive us.

138
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:13,153
When we returned, the knife had been removed.

139
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,453
The blade of the knife was pointed the strange way.

140
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:17,653
Then...

141
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:20,353
Because it was hard to remove the knife,

142
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,053
he may have tried to stand up and pull it out with both hands?

143
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,553
He is right!

144
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,353
If he had pulled out the knife standing up,

145
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:31,653
you'll never know which way the knife will turn.

146
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:35,353
You mean to tell me that you suspect us just because of that?

147
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:36,953
Well...

148
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:40,753
Anyway, I refuse to remain after the train arrives in Tokyo.

149
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:42,353
Me, too.

150
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:44,553
Same here.

151
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,853
Pops.

152
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,953
What is it?

153
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,653
Do you remember what newspaper you bought

154
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:53,953
at the platform kiosk in Shin Osaka Station?

155
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,753
Well, let's see...

156
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:58,753
There's "Keiba 7",

157
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:01,853
"Nichiuri Sports" and canned coffee.

158
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,953
And I think, two packs of cigarettes.

159
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:07,253
What's that has to do with this?

160
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,853
Well, nothing.

161
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,353
My hunch is right.

162
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,953
The culprit said something strange.

163
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:23,153
That person...

164
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:27,053
How he made Ogura come to the restroom...

165
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,853
How he killed him...

166
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:31,553
I got it all.

167
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:36,553
Even something that you missed.

168
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:52,961
Suicide, of course! It was suicide, all right?

169
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:58,561
If it is not murder, we have nothing to do with it.

170
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,461
Well...

171
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,261
There's nothing more to talk about.

172
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:05,961
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for boarding the Nozomi.

173
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:08,561
We are now arriving at the terminal Tokyo Station.

174
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:09,461
It's time to leave, bye.

175
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,361
I'm leaving too, I need to pack my things.

176
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,861
Wait...

177
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,861
We're in trouble,

178
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,661
getting our man killed on the train,

179
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,461
and if we let the killer go,

180
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,761
we're seriously in trouble.

181
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:26,661
Especially you, Takagi, having been by his side.

182
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:28,861
You're really gonna get it.

183
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,761
No way.

184
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:31,961
Well, not to worry!

185
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:34,161
If you get fired, you can become

186
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,461
my assistant at the detective office.

187
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,261
Mr. Mouri?

188
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,061
Well, just a fleeting thought,

189
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,461
I can't make you my assistant just yet.

190
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,461
Whether or not I will hire you as an assistant,

191
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:08,161
depends on whether you go through with your job as a police officer.

192
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,661
I need you to see the man behind you.

193
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:17,461
You fulfill your duty and arrest the man as the murderer.

194
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,861
-What do you mean that man? -You found the murderer?

195
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,161
The problem was

196
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:25,461
how the culprit communicated the message to go to the toilet

197
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:28,761
without Officer Takagi noticing.

198
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,161
This is where attention is directed to.

199
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:36,061
When the three suspects passed by Ogura,

200
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:38,861
carrying newspapers and a can of coffee.

201
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,861
Do you get it, Officer Takagi?

202
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,761
There you see the characters suggesting the toilet.

203
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,861
But where?

204
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:48,861
Where can I find such characters?

205
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:52,561
There, can't you see that?

206
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:56,361
Title characters suggesting toilet...

207
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:02,761
The letters WC, meaning "water closet"...

208
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,361
in there.

209
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,761
Takagi!

210
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,561
You mean to tell me...

211
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:21,061
The World Cup?

212
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,161
Yes.

213
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,861
He carried the newspaper to make the headline clear to see.

214
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,361
When he passed by Ogura's seat,

215
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:34,761
he pointed to the letters WC to tell him to go to the toilet.

216
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:37,061
Isn't that right?

217
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,461
It was the man carrying this sports newspaper,

218
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,261
Mr. Akira Akashi?

219
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,361
What?

220
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,061
You must be kidding...

221
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,061
Don't try to make me the culprit just for carrying a sports newspaper.

222
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,061
You're right.

223
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:58,961
Associating the toilet with the letters WC

224
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,861
appears to be a bit unconvincing in logic.

225
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:03,261
That is why Mr. Akashi placed the bag

226
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:05,961
in the toilet cubicle in the bomb scare.

227
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,661
He made the train personnel

228
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:09,361
report this to the police officer right in front of him

229
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:14,161
in order to emphasize the word "toilet" to Ogura.

230
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:18,161
If he points to the letters W

231
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,861
and then points to the car ahead of him,

232
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,761
Without saying a single word,

233
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:26,161
Ogura will most certainly go to the toilet in the car ahead of him.

234
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,261
Probably...

235
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:32,061
Mr. Akashi was watching Officer Takagi

236
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:35,061
buy the tickets at the station on that day.

237
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:37,061
Boarded the same Shinkansen train

238
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:40,561
and executed his plot to kill...

239
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:45,761
Stop playing with me...

240
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,761
Oh! I'm sorry!

241
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,761
I thought you were asleep.

242
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:54,461
I have heard of you before,

243
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:58,061
but it was my first time seeing "Sleeping Kogoro" in action.

244
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,061
Sleeping Kogoro?

245
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,161
You mean the famous detective?

246
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,361
I don't care what kind of sleeper he is,

247
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:09,861
but there is no proof that I'm the killer

248
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,261
and you accuse me of the murder.

249
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,261
It is murder.

250
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:18,461
The knife we found inside the toilet was very unnatural.

251
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:21,661
Did you hear what I said before?

252
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:23,661
He tried to pull out the knife but couldn't.

253
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,061
So, he stood up and pulled it out with both hands.

254
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,061
Well...

255
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:31,361
Why do you have to stand up to pull out the knife with both hands?

256
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,761
Are you fool?

257
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,161
You need to stand up to reach for the knife with your left...

258
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,661
That's right.

259
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:43,161
Certainly, Ogura was chained to the hand bar at that time

260
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,761
and could not have used both hands unless he stood up.

261
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,961
What is strange is that

262
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:53,561
you have never seen the site of the murder. Why do you know?

263
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,461
Just my imagination.

264
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,361
When the man stabbed himself,

265
00:15:57,361 --> 00:16:00,561
I heard that the police officer went to call the other officer.

266
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:04,461
So, I imagined that the handcuffs were chained to the hand bar.

267
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:08,161
Well, how did you know that the man had been in handcuffs?

268
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:10,761
When I pass by the seat of this police officer

269
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,461
that man was sitting beside him with both hands covered with cloth!

270
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:19,061
Then, how did you know that the victim was the same man?

271
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,761
Well, just from the course of developments...

272
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,661
Anyway, if you have so much to complain about me,

273
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:27,661
show me the proof!

274
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,261
Did you find my fingerprints on the weapon?

275
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,661
Do you see blood on my body?

276
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,361
Of course, there's no blood on you.

277
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,561
You have the victim hold the newspaper.

278
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:45,161
And then, you stabbed him through the newspaper...

279
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:50,561
The proof is seen in the bloody right hand of the victim.

280
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,061
A newspaper article was printed on the palm of his right hand,

281
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,161
since he was grabbing onto the newspaper.

282
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,561
I see.

283
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:00,361
That way, the killer won't get blood on his clothes.

284
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,261
What are you saying?

285
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:06,261
There is no hole or blood on my newspaper!

286
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:08,561
That's why you bought two copies.

287
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,261
What?

288
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:14,461
The same Nichiuri Sports that I bought at the station.

289
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,761
Right, Conan?

290
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:19,161
See? This is the same newspaper you have!

291
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:23,261
What proof is there that I bought two copies?

292
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:27,061
Look. This newspaper looks strange.

293
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:35,461
Look, the newspaper that Pops bought and a newspaper that you bought.

294
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:38,361
They looks similar, but the words are different.

295
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,161
You're right.

296
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:46,061
The headline on Father's copy says, "World Cup Hero Arrested",

297
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:50,161
but here, it says "World Cup Hero Interrogated".

298
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,761
That's the difference between newspapers sold at stations

299
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:54,861
and those sold elsewhere.

300
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:58,061
Unlike newspapers sold at convenience stores or delivered to homes,

301
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,461
Newspapers sold at railway stations are delivered late.

302
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,961
That's why, they can switch headlines at the last minute.

303
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:04,561
Because this is big news,

304
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,761
the headlines for newspapers sold at stations had been replaced.

305
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:11,161
Then, the newspaper that Mr. Akashi had...

306
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,761
He must have bought it at a convenience store.

307
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:17,361
It must have been very convenient to get Ogura to go to the toilet.

308
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:21,161
He probably bought another copy of the newspaper

309
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,661
while he waited for him to arrive at the station

310
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:25,861
to use to keep blood for soiling his clothes.

311
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,861
He bought the same sports newspaper,

312
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:31,961
just in case people suspect him

313
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:35,461
for not having the newspaper after the murder.

314
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,661
No! I just bought the same newspaper

315
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:42,061
because I found the difference in headlines interesting.

316
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,461
Then show me

317
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,261
the Nichirui Sports copy that you bought at the station.

318
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,361
It's...

319
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,661
I bet it's been flushed away in one of the toilets on the train.

320
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:58,061
We'll find out when we check the septic tanks.

321
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:02,561
Thank you for boarding the Shinkansen...

322
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,161
Darn it!

323
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,761
I'm not gonna...

324
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,061
let you get away.

325
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,761
You...

326
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,161
Now! You can't get away!

327
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,961
That was fantastic, Officer Takagi!

328
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,761
Fastball was the solution.

329
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:37,961
Oh, nothing...

330
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:40,461
Immediately after that,

331
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,761
Inspector Megure who had been waiting in Tokyo Station

332
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,861
arrested the killer

333
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,061
and he was taken away to the Police Agency.

334
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:53,061
The motive of the murder was to seal the lips of the victim

335
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,861
regarding that drug trade route.

336
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,861
Ironically, the killer confessed,

337
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:01,761
and the route was uncovered and destroyed successfully by the police.

338
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,061
Thanks to this contribution,

339
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,561
Officers Sato and Takagi managed not to get fired.

340
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:11,161
And Officer Takagi escaped the fate of becoming Pops' assistant.

341
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,261
And...

342
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,261
A pay cut! We got a pay cut!

343
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,561
On top of the measly pay we are getting in the first place.

344
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,061
Isn't that horrible?

345
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:51,261
Take it easy.

346
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:54,861
Actually, a pay cut affects promotion, doesn't it?

347
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:56,361
True.

348
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:58,061
Don't take it too hard.

349
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:00,661
You're a girl and you can always find a way out through marriage.

350
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,961
I'm not interested in marriage.

351
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:07,261
I want to work for the peace and security of the people of Tokyo.

352
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:10,061
Actually the problem is Takagi.

353
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,961
He's never gonna make it beyond the post

354
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:15,661
of deputy inspector until retirement.

355
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,461
By the way, Yumi.

356
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:22,661
Do you like Takagi?

357
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,961
What?

358
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:29,561
What?

359
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,561
What's that surprise on your face?

360
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,561
As a veteran officer in the same section,

361
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:41,561
I must know about my colleagues.

362
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,361
Yes...

363
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,661
So, what do you feel about him?

364
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:48,261
Do you like him or not?

365
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,861
Are you in love?

366
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,361
Not really...

367
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:53,861
I knew it.

368
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:58,661
He looked excited receiving a ticket from you. Poor boy.

369
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:01,561
You shouldn't be teasing a boy like him.

370
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,861
You should find the right person.

371
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,361
Well, okay.

372
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:07,761
Miwako has fallen.

373
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:13,061
She's fallen for Operation Ticket Chase.

374
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:18,861
I'd better call the other half of the pay cut pair about the good news.

375
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,861
You should find the right person.

376
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:30,061
Why should I be doing this? This waste of time.

377
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:36,361
Thank you very much for taking your time for coming here.

378
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,561
-No problem. -Don't take it too hard.

379
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:42,961
You can make it up with another successful arrest!

380
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:48,661
Officer Takagi, what's with you? Straighten up!

381
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,061
Straighten up?

382
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,761
We're going after the case on 4th Street!

383
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,661
Yes!

384
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:56,961
Officer Sato is as energetic as ever.

385
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,061
She also got a pay cut.

386
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:02,961
Something nice must have happened to her.

387
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,461
"Next Episode" -Genta, what happened with you?

388
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:11,061
I'm afraid.

389
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:14,761
A killer is after me!

390
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,061
Anyway explain to us.

391
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:29,161
Why would anyone want to kill you?

392
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,061
Next Conan,

393
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,182
"Genta's Misfortune"

394
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,379
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,279
"Red, White, Blue"
