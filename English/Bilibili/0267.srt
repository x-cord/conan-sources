1
00:00:01,124 --> 00:00:02,924
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:05,024
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:06,624
Valentine's Day is coming up soon.

4
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,624
Both love and the case get to the core.

5
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:10,224
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:12,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,424
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:03,237
We all came to a lodge called Suito Mountain Lodge

9
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:04,637
located in a remote mountain area

10
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:07,037
together with Sonoko who invited us.

11
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:12,537
However, one of the guests staying at the lodge,

12
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:14,937
a journalist named Yoshitaka Nigaki

13
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:17,537
fails to return to the lodge after going inte the woods

14
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,537
despite a violent blizzard.

15
00:02:22,437 --> 00:02:26,437
After a while of searching for Mr. Nigaki in the woods,

16
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:34,037
we found him dead.

17
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:37,837
Blood stains that have been wiped off.

18
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:41,137
Goggles that were replaced on him.

19
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:44,237
And Ms. Ako's chocolate.

20
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:47,737
Why did the killer go out of the way

21
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:50,637
to bring Ako's chocolate out of the kitchen?

22
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:55,137
Why?

23
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:03,837
"Bloody Valentine (The Deduction)"

24
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,237
I see.

25
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:11,037
I understand.

26
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,037
So, what did they say?

27
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:16,637
Did the police say they'll be right over?

28
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:18,937
An avalanche is a lie, right?

29
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:22,437
No. There seems have been an avalanche at around 8pm

30
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:24,737
and the tunnel seems to be blocked off.

31
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,437
They say they don't know

32
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,937
when they'll be able to come here until tomorrow.

33
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:32,537
It's just as I said!

34
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:38,237
How was the chocolate?

35
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:42,237
Ako's chocolate was gone after all.

36
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,337
Darn it!

37
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:50,537
I brought back Mr. Nigaki's camera and video camera

38
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:51,637
thinking that we could get some clues,

39
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:55,937
but the video tape is unused.

40
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,437
The only clue we have left now

41
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,737
is the used roll of film that is left inside his camera.

42
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:03,837
But if the forensic officers can't come,

43
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:05,937
we can't develop the film.

44
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:09,037
Oh, I can develop and print the picture

45
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:10,737
if you want me to.

46
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,737
Since Mr. Nigaki said that he wanted to see the pictures

47
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,537
right away after he took pictures of them,

48
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:18,537
I brought a set of the necessary equipments.

49
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:20,937
Let me use your bathroom, okay?

50
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,737
It's just right to use for a dark room.

51
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,537
Yes, go ahead.

52
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,737
I'll help you, then.

53
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:34,237
Hey, was that all that was inside?

54
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:36,737
Weren't there any more films or tapes

55
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:39,537
in the knapsack of the guy who was killed?

56
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,837
Yes, there were.

57
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:45,437
But the films and tapes were all unopened.

58
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:48,737
Which means that the guy was killed

59
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,537
before he filmed anything on video?

60
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,737
Or maybe Mr. Nigaki preferred taking pictures

61
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:55,437
rather than filming videos.

62
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,237
That's not true!

63
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:01,937
He preferred filming videos rather than taking pictures.

64
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:04,337
He was filming a lot last night, too.

65
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,037
Can you show us that video tape, then?

66
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,137
Okay.

67
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,737
But there are a lot of it in his bag,

68
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:15,037
so I don't know if we can tell which one is last night's video.

69
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,737
Forget it, kid!

70
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:19,637
Let's not watch the video a dead man took.

71
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:22,537
Did he film something he shouldn't have?

72
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:25,037
That's not what he meant.

73
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:28,237
It's kind of creepie.

74
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:31,737
Why don't we all watch it together in the living room?

75
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:33,137
Okay.

76
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:37,137
If we watch it together we may be able to find a clue.

77
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,937
I'll go get it from his room then.

78
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:50,537
Gosh.

79
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,737
Is this the love chocolate you're going to give me?

80
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,637
Wrong! This is for me!

81
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:00,937
Hey, don't tell me you're giving it to someone else?

82
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,637
It could be.

83
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,537
It sure is no fun watching

84
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:07,437
somebody elses' home video after all.

85
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:10,637
I'm going to make your chocolate with the girls

86
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,237
that are coming to spend the night here tomorrow.

87
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:14,037
Why are you keeping me in suspense for?

88
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:17,737
I've got a super gift for you too, you know.

89
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,537
Darn it! This stupid TV...

90
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,237
Come on!

91
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:32,937
Sorry that it's a stupid TV.

92
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:35,337
This is a treasure that my husband bought

93
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:39,137
for the first time with Reiko.

94
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,937
Reiko?

95
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,737
She was my husband's first wife.

96
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,637
I was told that she died 12 years ago because of an illness.

97
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,937
Hey, Saburo!

98
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:53,437
It's time for you to go back to your cage already.

99
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:57,537
So, she's the second wife.

100
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:01,837
I've heard about them from the previous owner, too.

101
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,637
This granny came to spend the night here

102
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:08,137
just when he was depressed after having lost his wife.

103
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,037
Then, they hit it off right from the start

104
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:12,337
and got married just like that.

105
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:14,637
Granny's sweets were highly reputable

106
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:18,037
and this lodge was going well for a while.

107
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,537
But I guess it's tough without husband after all.

108
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:23,237
You heard about this before, you said?

109
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:26,937
That means you both come here a lot?

110
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:29,737
Nope, just once in the past.

111
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,337
By the way,

112
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:34,837
is that the last of the four video tapes we watched?

113
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,337
Yes.

114
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:40,237
That's all of the videos with yesterday's date on it.

115
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:43,237
Okay, so there's only so much left of this video tape!

116
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:44,937
I'm going to challenge making chocolate

117
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,737
for the first time in my life starting now.

118
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:48,737
-So goodbye, everyone. -Goodbye!

119
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,637
Good grief, it's finally ended.

120
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:57,037
You two don't seem to have been in the video?

121
00:07:57,037 --> 00:08:01,237
Well, of course. I just got here this morning.

122
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,037
I just got here a while ago.

123
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:07,037
So, we're back to where we started.

124
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,637
We've figured out what time Mr. Nigaki was killed, though!

125
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:15,937
Take a look at this picture.

126
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:19,837
It's a picture that was taken when he was punched.

127
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:23,837
Huh? How can you tell?

128
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,137
Do you see this blurred shadow?

129
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:28,837
It's not in any of the other pictures,

130
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:31,437
just this last one.

131
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:34,837
This is the shadow formed by blood stains on the camera lens.

132
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:39,637
The shutter probably went off accidentally

133
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:41,337
after he was punched and fell to the ground from the shock.

134
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:44,337
But you can't really tell if those are blood stains yet.

135
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:45,837
There's no mistake about it.

136
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,837
We put film in his camera and tried it out,

137
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:50,937
and got the exact same result.

138
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:56,837
Which means he was killed during the day time.

139
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,637
Something's not right.

140
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:04,637
Ms. Mika's explanation doesn't make sense.

141
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:09,337
In other words, the killer

142
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:12,537
may be among the three of you

143
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:16,137
who were not at the ledge with us during that time.

144
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,237
Hey!

145
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,737
Then, what's with that chocolate?

146
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:23,037
It was here at the lodge until 8:00 at night, wasn't it?

147
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:26,137
Just who brought it out then?

148
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:28,237
In the first place,

149
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,437
what stupid person would go back out

150
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,937
into the blizzard just to put the chocolate near the corpse?

151
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:36,637
Well, that's true.

152
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,437
It could be that...

153
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:42,437
It might really exists.

154
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:48,337
A being living in this mountain other than us.

155
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:54,037
What do you mean?

156
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:56,637
Come to think of it, before I met all of you here,

157
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,337
I ran into a queer guy in the woods.

158
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:04,237
A huge guy wearing a black knitted cap!

159
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:09,037
I mistook him for a bear and almost shot him.

160
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,637
A black knitted cap?

161
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:14,837
It can't be...

162
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,137
Don't tell me that...

163
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,987
A man wearing black knitted cap.

164
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:50,787
Don't tell me that it's him.

165
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:53,587
Excuse me.

166
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,687
The person you saw in the woods.

167
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,787
Do you remember what he looked like?

168
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,987
I may know him.

169
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,287
I wonder.

170
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,787
I could tell that he was a man from his physique.

171
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:07,787
But he had goggles and a muffler on,

172
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:11,787
so I didn't get to see his face at all.

173
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,187
I see.

174
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:15,587
Ran?

175
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,487
It could've been Natsuya.

176
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:19,187
I'm sure it was him.

177
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,887
It's Natsuya!

178
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,287
He was alive after all.

179
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,587
Let's go and get him.

180
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:25,787
Mika.

181
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,887
No way!

182
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,687
You can't go out in this blizzard!

183
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:35,487
Natsuya is waiting for us in the woods.

184
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,687
Natsuya's waiting.

185
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:38,787
Natsuya died!

186
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:41,387
He died in the avalanche four years ago!

187
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:48,787
Sorry.

188
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,187
I'm sorry, Mika.

189
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:54,087
Who is Natsuya?

190
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,487
He's my older brother whose whereabouts have been unknown

191
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,987
since four years ago.

192
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:01,487
Mika was going steady with him.

193
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,187
So, the checkered chocolate

194
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:07,587
that Ms. Mika was making this afternoon was...

195
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:11,287
Yes, we were going to take the chocolate to his grave

196
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:13,787
because he liked checkered patterns.

197
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:18,987
My brother grave is also in the woods

198
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:24,087
beside the graves of the previous owner and his first wife.

199
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:26,887
Not only the graves of the three are here.

200
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,187
In this forest,

201
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:31,887
there are the graves of those who have died in this mountain

202
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,787
whose identities are unknown.

203
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:37,787
But all the graves except the three graves were all destroyed

204
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:41,787
by wild animals.

205
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:45,787
Why are only the three graves left undestroyed?

206
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:50,587
Probably because I pay visit to them everyday with Saburo.

207
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:53,887
Just like my husband used to when he was alive.

208
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,587
Well, but if you insist that someone other than us

209
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,087
are in the mountains...

210
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,887
The guy wearing the black knitted cap

211
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:05,387
roaming around in the woods is definitely the killer.

212
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:06,787
What do you mean?

213
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:11,087
I have no idea when that guy called Nigaki was killed.

214
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,187
But the person who left the chocolate next to him

215
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:15,887
is the killer, right?

216
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:19,287
All six of you left the chocolate in the kitchen

217
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,987
and went out at 8pm to look for Nigaki, right?

218
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,787
If everyone found the chocolate together,

219
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:25,287
it's impossible for me to put the chocolate there.

220
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:28,587
I met all six of you near the lodge.

221
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:31,687
It was probably right after you all left the lodge

222
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,187
to look for Nigaki.

223
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,887
It would take 20 minutes to get from the lodge

224
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,387
to the site of the crime which is the woods,

225
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:39,287
no matter how much I rush.

226
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:42,487
So, I would have no time to put the chocolate there.

227
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,587
And of course, I wouldn't have been able to do it either.

228
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:46,487
At around 8pm, I was far away

229
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:52,787
from the lodge watching the tunnel get buried under the avalanche.

230
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:56,187
But you could've heard about the avalanche on the radio news.

231
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:57,687
No.

232
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:00,787
Because the avalanche was announced just about the same time

233
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:04,587
we got back to the lodge and called the police.

234
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:07,387
Well, the only one who could've brought the chocolate

235
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:11,387
is that lady there who was making the chocolate.

236
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:12,387
Huh?

237
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,487
I heard that before everybody went out together,

238
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:18,087
you and the other lady left together to look for the guy, right?

239
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:21,987
You two weren't together all the while, were you?

240
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:27,287
No, we split up part way and searched for him.

241
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:30,487
If you made similar type of chocolate the night before,

242
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:33,687
you could've placed the chocolate near Nigaki

243
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,787
when you went out the first time.

244
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:36,987
If you secretly took the chocolate

245
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:39,087
that you made today together with you

246
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,187
when you went out to search with everybody else,

247
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:44,287
you could make it look as if the killer took it.

248
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,487
Oh, no.

249
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:47,887
That's impossible!

250
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,287
There was a blizzard outside already

251
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,087
when we went to look for him the first time.

252
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,187
If he was killed then,

253
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,687
there should be snow in this picture

254
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:01,387
that was taken at the time of the crime, right?

255
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:02,787
What about the chocolate?

256
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:04,787
Why don't you compare them, then?

257
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:08,587
I took a picture of all the chocolate that everybody made today.

258
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,787
If you take a close look,

259
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,687
the chocolate that was found at the crime scene is a bit melted

260
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,487
and dented slightly out of shape.

261
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:18,687
I would sure like to meet the person

262
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,987
who can shape the letters exactly the same like this

263
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:25,087
as well as insert it onto the chocolate so much alike as it is.

264
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:29,087
What she's saying is that your deductions are off.

265
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:32,787
Right. Well, that's for the better, isn't it?

266
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:36,187
Now that we know the killer isn't among us,

267
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:39,787
I can sleep without worrying, then.

268
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,287
Goodnight then, everybody.

269
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:46,787
Which means...

270
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:49,887
the killer is the man wearing the black knitted cap.

271
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:53,587
The film that was inside Mr. Nigaki's camera,

272
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:54,987
are you sure the pictures are the ones

273
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,087
that were taken by Mr. Nigaki yesterday and today?

274
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,087
What?

275
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:01,687
Because it was already used, wasn't it?

276
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:05,487
It could've been inserted some time later, right?

277
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,887
Then, would you like to look

278
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,187
and compare the other pictures in this film?

279
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,187
The video that he filmed yesterday is also here.

280
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:14,887
The clothing of the three are all the same

281
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,487
in the pictures and the video.

282
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,387
And of course, Mr. Nigaki who is taking the pictures and filming

283
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,987
is virtually not included.

284
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:23,987
Moreover, most of the pictures were taken at night.

285
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:26,887
The fact that at the end of this film

286
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:30,787
there was that blood stained picture

287
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:34,787
means the pictures were taken this afternoon, doesn't it?

288
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,887
Nobody's gone outside

289
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,387
since we arrived at the lodge yesterday

290
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:44,387
to the time he left with his camera this afternoon.

291
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:47,787
Which means that he's the only one who could've take the picture.

292
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:50,487
Well, the only other possibility

293
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,887
is that some trick is used when developing films.

294
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,587
How could I have done something like that?

295
00:16:56,587 --> 00:17:00,287
Ran was with me right through while I was developing the films.

296
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,887
Right?

297
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,687
Yes, she didn't do anything strange.

298
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:08,787
Besides, she even used a glove

299
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:10,187
when taking the film out of the camera

300
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,687
so that there wouldn't be her fingerprints on the films.

301
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:14,687
Moreover, if you look at the negative,

302
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:17,787
I'm sure you can see that nothing was done to it.

303
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,987
Right, if there was anything strange,

304
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,787
there was a picture that was completely black.

305
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,587
Completely black?

306
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:26,487
There were two of them

307
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,887
just before the picture with blood stains on them.

308
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:32,687
Pictures that were completely black and you couldn't see anything.

309
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,887
Really?

310
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,287
I think the shutter just accidentally went off

311
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:41,587
when something was over the lens covering it.

312
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,587
Just as I thought.

313
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:47,387
The picture with the blood stain on it is a trick after all.

314
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:49,887
But I can't figure it out.

315
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,687
How can you take a picture like that?

316
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,287
And what baffles me more

317
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:59,287
the chocolate that was by the corpse.

318
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,487
Putting something like that there would nullify the trick.

319
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,387
Hey, Saburo.

320
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:07,387
-It's your favorite ball. -Don't tell me that the killer...

321
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,087
is actually that man wearing the black knitted cap

322
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,787
who is hiding in the woods?

323
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,687
Huh? Strange.

324
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:16,187
When I came last year, you loved playing with the ball.

325
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:21,787
Why is the name of that dog is Saburo?

326
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:25,187
Because before him, there was a Taro and Jiro.

327
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,887
But they both died.

328
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,087
Huh? They died?

329
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:34,087
Yes, Taro was the name of my husband.

330
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:37,587
It seems that Jiro was a Shikoku dog just like Saburo.

331
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:41,387
But after the death of his first wife,

332
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:45,187
it seems to have died as if going after her.

333
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:49,387
I want to see he picture of that dog named Jiro.

334
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:52,987
I think I can find pictures of Jiro in my husband's album.

335
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,987
If I remember correctly,

336
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:58,287
Mr. Nigaki was using my husband's room.

337
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,087
Would you like me to go and get it?

338
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,287
I'll go with you then.

339
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:07,087
Does Saburo have some odd habits or something?

340
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:09,887
Like going out on walks a lot and stuff like that?

341
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:13,187
Nope, he usually stays inside the lodge.

342
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:14,487
The only time he goes out

343
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,587
is when he comes along to the grave with me.

344
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:19,887
He's a smart dog.

345
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:22,287
When we get near the grave, he runs ahead of me

346
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,487
and waits for me in front of the grave.

347
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,587
Come to think of it,

348
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:29,187
when there is a blizzard and he can't go out,

349
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:32,187
he doesn't eat his dog food.

350
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:35,587
Although he usually eats it on regular days.

351
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,887
Well, but on the day after the blizzard,

352
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:41,687
he seems back to his normal self and pigs out on the food.

353
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,487
Isn't that Ms. Ako's voice?

354
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:55,787
What's the matter?

355
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:57,787
Talk about rude!

356
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:02,087
They were in here going through Mr. Nigaki's things!

357
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:03,087
What?

358
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:04,887
Oh, no. It's not what it looks to be.

359
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:09,387
We just thought there may be clues to solving the case.

360
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:12,687
We didn't take anything.

361
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:16,287
All right. I guess I'll have to body check you.

362
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:17,487
Okay.

363
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:19,487
Let's go to the room over there.

364
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,787
A blood stained parker?

365
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:27,287
The blood stains are not on the stomach area.

366
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:30,587
Oh, that's the parker

367
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:33,987
that Mr. Nigaki was wearing when he got hurt.

368
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:36,087
Huh? He got hurt?

369
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,787
He hurt his left hand thumb

370
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,987
when he was dicing chocolate with a knife.

371
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,387
It wasn't much of a wound,

372
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:46,987
but he was surprised and flung his hand around

373
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,887
so the blood splattered onto his parker, too.

374
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,487
Granny rushed to get he first aid box,

375
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,787
but accidentally dropped it.

376
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:59,087
Ako who worried about him breaks out in tears.

377
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:01,587
It was a total mess, with me holding him down

378
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:03,387
from going wild and all.

379
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,987
Well, the worst part

380
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:09,987
was looking after Ako who got super depressed after that.

381
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:11,187
Right?

382
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:14,187
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:15,387
Here it is!

384
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:17,287
I found it!

385
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,487
See, the dog to the left is Jiro

386
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,887
and the dog to the right is Saburo.

387
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,687
He's wearing a medal he was awarded by the prefecture

388
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:29,287
when he rescued a person who got into an accident in the mountains.

389
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,087
I wonder if the one to the left is Saburo

390
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,487
and the one to the right is Jiro.

391
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,487
Just as I thought.

392
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,087
I've figured out the case.

393
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:18,287
Now I know why there were black pictures taken

394
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:21,887
before the blood stained picture,

395
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,987
who took the chocolate out

396
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:26,987
and why it was put near the corpse.

397
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:30,487
Also, the person who killed Mr. Nigaki.

398
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:34,187
That is...

399
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,687
That person!

400
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,887
"Next Episode" -You found out who the killer is?

401
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:09,787
Are you serious, sonny?

402
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:11,587
So, who is it?

403
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:15,287
Is it that man with the black knitted cap?

404
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,987
Well, Pops says he'll explain all that in the kitchen to you now.

405
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:22,587
In other words,

406
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,687
no one else other than you can be the killer!

407
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:29,387
Don't move!

408
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:31,587
Next Conan,

409
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:35,308
"Bloody Valentine (The Resolution)"

410
