1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,370
Mr. Tatsuya Amagi who was thought to be a nuisance

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,970
by the entire neighborhood is killed.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,570
Mr. Hikoichi Bando, the head of the community,

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,670
who was thought to be a suspect for the murder was also killed.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,570
Through the testimony of Mrs. Toyoko Kanemitsu,

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,770
the owner of a coffee shop nearby

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,570
and the deductions of both Officer Takagi and Chiba,

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,570
Mr. Chino arose as a suspect, however...

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,870
Inspector, it bothered you too, didn't it?

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,570
That a mystery expert

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,770
would put poison inside the bottle instead of the cup

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,670
or make such careless mistakes

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,970
like keeping the door unlocked, right?

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,370
Which means that Mr. Chino is not the real perp X.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,670
But, there's a possibility that he was just framed.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,770
What? Back then...

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,270
The customers here were...

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,870
If I remember correctly...

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,970
Oh, Mr. Fukuda and his family

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,670
and Ms. Hiro Ezaki were here with her friends.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,370
The one who first discovered Mr. Amagi's corpse

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,970
and the lady who was pushing Mr. Bando to do his thing were also here.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,470
If so, the real perp X is...

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,270
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,670
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,770
Who is trying to kill who?

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,970
An unexpected perp is found in an unexpected place.

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,270
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:14,828
"The Shifting Mystery of Beika City (Part 2)"

32
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,028
About Mr. Chino?

33
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:22,928
It seems he used to act as judge for the new writer's award sometimes.

34
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,528
For mysteries, right?

35
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,928
He seems to be in the middle of judging right now too.

36
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:30,228
He said so at the shop yesterday, right?

37
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:33,728
Yes. It seems to be tough work, though!

38
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:36,228
"Yosuke Chino (35), College Professor" -I can't focus unless it's night

39
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:39,228
so I'm confining myself to my study all night again tonight.

40
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:43,828
X who probably heard this decided to commit the crime at night.

41
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,228
But, why are you asking me that?

42
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:49,628
I don't know, because Pops Kogoro just told me to ask you.

43
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:52,728
Those two could've committed the crime.

44
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:54,728
Although the motive is still unknown,

45
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:58,228
it's highly likely that Mr. Fukuda or Ms. Ezaki is X.

46
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:01,628
I've got to confirm their alibis for last night.

47
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:05,128
I'll start with the one who was the first to discover the corpse.

48
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,728
He got what he deserved.

49
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:09,428
The heavens punished him.

50
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,928
Mr. Tameo Fukuda.

51
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,128
If I killed the person called Amagi

52
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:18,128
and tried to make it look as if Bando did it,

53
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:21,028
I would never use an awl!

54
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,628
Because I knew that Bando had a fear of sharp objects

55
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:27,028
and couldn't use an awl!

56
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,428
That was because...

57
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,528
He deliberately!

58
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:37,028
When everything was exposed,

59
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:41,028
he was thinking of getting away by saying that

60
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:44,328
he would never use an awl because he knew Mr. Bando

61
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,128
had a fear of needles!

62
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:51,128
Exactly like you just said, Mr. Chino.

63
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:54,328
I see, you tried to outwit us.

64
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,628
If you keep trying to think how I outwitted you,

65
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,428
this can go on forever.

66
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:01,328
Don't you think we're on the ball this time?

67
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:02,728
Yeah, it scares me too.

68
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:05,028
I can't stop making deductions.

69
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,828
Hey, manager.

70
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,928
Does Mr. Fukuda work only night shifts?

71
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,428
Yeah.

72
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:16,228
It would be difficult for him to commit the crime.

73
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,428
So, it must be the other one then.

74
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,728
That unreliable useless guy

75
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:24,128
finally was of some use to the community.

76
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:27,428
To stab a nuisance who was hated by everyone,

77
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,128
how convenient can things get.

78
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:32,528
Ms. Hiro Ezaki who was pressuring

79
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:36,428
the head of the community, Mr. Bando the most.

80
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:39,028
"Ezaki" -Really?

81
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:42,728
Ms. Hiro Ezaki is a student of Haido University?

82
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,828
Thank you very much.

83
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,128
Mr. Chino teaches at Haido University.

84
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:49,028
The two have a point of contact.

85
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,828
Ms. Ezaki got into trouble with Mr. Chino at the university

86
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:54,128
-and because of this, she... -Hey!

87
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:57,928
Why are you investigating me?

88
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:00,828
What are you snooping around me for?

89
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,128
-Bye! -Hey!

90
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:05,628
Wait, brat!

91
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:14,228
I wonder if there's something she doesn't want me to find out.

92
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,728
What are you going to do with that?

93
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,928
I'm taking it home.

94
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:26,628
But you just brought it with you this morning.

95
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:29,128
I'm done with it, you see.

96
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,528
You're done?

97
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:34,828
I'll go take it home, because there are no customers right now either.

98
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,428
It's precious to me, you see.

99
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:38,828
See you later.

100
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:49,028
Precious?

101
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:50,728
But they're not the latest edition

102
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,328
and she's only got one each.

103
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:56,028
Maybe she buys it only when the writer she favors is in it.

104
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:00,428
Who is it? The writer that Mrs. Toyoko Kanemitsu likes?

105
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,128
If I remember correctly, that "World of Deduction"

106
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,928
was last year's May edition.

107
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,528
I don't think there was anything that stood out.

108
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,628
"Labyrinth" was this year's January edition.

109
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:14,428
What? This writer...

110
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:17,328
I also saw this writer in the "World of Deduction" too.

111
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,528
"The Melting Weapon" -No mistake about it.

112
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:20,228
It's Yamiyo Dorosue.

113
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:23,728
It's the same writer of the books that were on the bookshelf.

114
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:24,928
Hello?

115
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,828
Yes, this is Detective Mouri.

116
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,528
I'd like to ask you an odd question.

117
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:31,928
"Monthly Magazine Labyrinths, Magazine Search"

118
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:35,928
It's a story that's hard to understand, isn't it?

119
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,028
The trick is insane,

120
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,828
and their criminal profile is totally unrealistic.

121
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:41,628
"Zetto Ichimura (32), Editor" -They hate arguments so much,

122
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,728
they casually commit murders one after another to avoid them.

123
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:49,828
There's nobody who could do something like that.

124
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,828
If such a person were actually around, it would really be scary.

125
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,228
"This is terrible! Chiba New Writer Award Submission"

126
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:56,928
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you.

127
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:00,128
Do you remember hearing the name Yamiyo Dorosue?

128
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:02,228
Yamiyo Dorosue?

129
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:08,028
The one who wrote "The Melting Weapon", that ridiculous story.

130
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,128
So, you remembered after all.

131
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:15,228
Pops was saying this case doesn't end with ABC

132
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:20,728
but is an ABCD case that involves that Yamiyo Dorosue.

133
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:25,228
Mr. Chino, do you remember anything about that story?

134
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,328
I knew it.

135
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,728
It's all coming together now.

136
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:40,328
Really? You like mysteries too?

137
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,428
Yes. So, I thought that I'd like to

138
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:45,228
think over the mystery of this case with you.

139
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:48,628
Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?

140
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,728
Okay, let's go.

141
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:54,528
But, Conan, was that your name?

142
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,628
Don't you think it's a bit too late?

143
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:59,828
The perp is Mr. Chino, right?

144
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:03,428
No, I think that there's a real perp X

145
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:07,628
and that Mr. Chino was also framed by X.

146
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:11,428
But I wonder if that'll be enough.

147
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:15,228
X killed Mr. Amagi and Mr. Bando

148
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:19,228
so isn't it unnatural that only Mr. Chino is left unkilled?

149
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,128
I think perp X deliberately didn't kill him.

150
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,628
Which means?

151
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:27,528
X really had a grudge against Mr. Chino.

152
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,928
That's why X didn't want to kill him easily

153
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,228
like Mr. Amagi or Mr. Bando.

154
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:36,128
X wanted him to suffer so badly that even dying would be better.

155
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:40,128
Mean to get him arrested despite being innocent?

156
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:41,828
Right. If you think of it that way,

157
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:45,128
it's understandable why Mr. Chino was left deliberately unkilled.

158
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:49,328
I see, what you're saying makes sense, Conan.

159
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,428
Then, now it's my turn.

160
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:55,628
Who is that X? I think there are two points.

161
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,828
Yes, because X tried to frame Mr. Chino up as the perp.

162
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:02,228
A person who knew that Mr. Chino

163
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,228
wouldn't have anyone to confirm his alibi.

164
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:09,428
And a person who could have stolen his lighter.

165
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:11,028
That's right.

166
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,428
Oh, I'm in a fix!

167
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,228
If so, the suspicious people would be

168
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:19,628
among those who had come to my shop yesterday as customers.

169
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:24,028
I asked Koyuki who the customers that came yesterday were,

170
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:27,328
and the most suspicious among them was Mr. Fukuda.

171
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:31,128
Mr. Fukuda was upset at being troubled by Mr. Amagi

172
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:33,728
and I wonder if he also held a grudge against Mr. Bando

173
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:37,428
despite being the community head for doing nothing.

174
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,528
That's enough motive.

175
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:43,328
But, Mr. Fukuda couldn't have committed the crime at night.

176
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:47,528
I guess so. Because Mr. Fukuda works the night shift.

177
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:51,628
Yeah. Then the next suspicious person is...

178
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:53,828
Ms. Hiro Ezaki?

179
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,228
She seems to be a student at Haido University,

180
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:59,528
so it could be that she got into some kind of trouble with Mr. Chino.

181
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:02,928
But we can't conclude that it's her either.

182
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,528
But if Mr. Fukuda couldn't have done it...

183
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:11,228
We can't narrow it down to Mr. Fukuda and Ms. Ezaki to begin with, right?

184
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:17,328
Mr. Fukuda's wife and Ms. Hiro Ezaki's friend could also have done it?

185
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,928
It's possible.

186
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,628
It also doesn't have to be limited to the customers either.

187
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:26,428
Don't tell me you're referring to Koyuki?

188
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,028
I see.

189
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:30,228
That's thinkable too.

190
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:34,728
But the real identity of the perp who killed Mr. Amagi and Mr. Bando

191
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:40,428
and further tried to frame Mr. Chino up as the killer is...

192
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:51,795
The identity of the real perp X is...

193
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,495
Maybe...

194
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,795
Oh, my.

195
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:59,895
Aren't you the owner of the coffee shop?

196
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:01,795
My, Ms. Ezaki.

197
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:05,295
I was just about to go to the shop, is it open?

198
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:08,495
Yes, Koyuki is watching the shop for me.

199
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,495
My, but he...

200
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:15,195
Oh, no. Don't tell Ruriko about this, owner!

201
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,695
Hey, is everything okay?

202
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,895
It's fine. She's not a blabber mouth.

203
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:22,395
Come on, let's go.

204
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:26,395
I don't think she has anything to do with the case.

205
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,595
It seems she has a secret she doesn't want anyone to know about.

206
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,895
Now that we know Ms. Ezaki is innocent,

207
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,895
I guess the identity of perp X has been narrowed down.

208
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:39,295
Perp X after killing Mr. Tatsuya Amagi and Mr. Bando

209
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,695
is trying to frame Mr. Chino for the murders.

210
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,995
But, in order to frame Mr. Chino up as the perp,

211
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,395
a fundamental problem existed.

212
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,795
Why? Because to begin with,

213
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:54,995
Mr. Chino had no motive to have to kill Mr. Amagi or Bando.

214
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:59,395
Without a motive, you can't frame Mr. Chino up as the perp.

215
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:05,995
But, then X found out that Mr. Chino searched Mr. Bando's storeroom.

216
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,495
X figured this could be used to his advantage.

217
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,595
Moreover, the other day...

218
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,995
I can't focus unless it's night

219
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:16,395
so I'm confining myself to my study all night again tonight.

220
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,395
When Mr. Chino was off guard, X switched his lighter

221
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:22,495
for a similar looking one and got a hold of it.

222
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:25,295
X carried the plan out on the day

223
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,195
that Mr. Chino would have no one to verify his alibi.

224
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:32,095
First, X called Mr. Amagi out to the park at night.

225
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,695
Who are you?

226
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:46,595
And murdered him.

227
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,295
And then...

228
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:11,095
killed Mr. Bando

229
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:15,095
X put the bottle of liquor with pesticide in,

230
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:18,795
and near the glass, a bottle of pesticide and the awl on the table.

231
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:22,595
Then leaving Mr. Chino's lighter that X got in the afternoon behind,

232
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,295
X gets a hold of Mr. Bando's hospital card

233
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:28,695
and drops it near the corpse of Mr. Amagi.

234
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:33,195
All X had left to do was to wait for Mr. Amagi's body to be found.

235
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:37,595
The police would naturally suspect Mr. Bando when they found his card.

236
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:41,395
But I don't think so.

237
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:45,395
Mr. Bando's not the type that can cause such an incident.

238
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:48,995
Then X appears as a kind source of information.

239
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,695
That lighter...

240
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:54,295
-Remember? -Oh! It's Mr. Chino's!

241
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,895
X turns everyone's attention towards Mr. Chino.

242
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,095
What a disgusting off the point pair.

243
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,895
What? Off the point?

244
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,295
X provokes the police detectives

245
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,995
and just as written in the scenario...

246
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,995
-That's it! -That's what it was!

247
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:11,995
X leads them along very cleverly.

248
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,295
Making it sound like there were precious treasures in Mr. Bando's storeroom

249
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:20,095
and that Mr. Chino killed the two men in order to steal the treasures.

250
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,795
In other words, does it mean

251
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,695
that X couldn't forgive Mr. Amagi who was a nuisance to the community

252
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:29,295
as well as the lazy Mr. Bando despite being the head of the community?

253
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,595
Even though the two may have had faults,

254
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:34,895
killing them is a fact that cannot be forgiven.

255
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:38,495
I think you deduction works, Conan,

256
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,595
but even if it is true, the mystery is not yet solved.

257
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:46,095
Why does X have a grudge against Mr. Chino?

258
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:50,795
X left behind the hint to solving that mystery.

259
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,095
The iron rule of solving a mystery is

260
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,895
to hand over all the hints to solving the mystery

261
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,395
without hiding anything.

262
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:02,395
That's why X took us to the coffee shop.

263
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,895
Then X showed us the books that was the key necessary for us

264
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,895
to solve the mystery.

265
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,395
It was a magazine specializing in mystery

266
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:13,295
that X went out of her way to bring over from her residence.

267
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:18,495
Right, in that book, there was a hint to solve the mystery.

268
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,195
What was the hint?

269
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:23,295
Yamiyo Dorosue.

270
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:30,295
The name of this writer was on all the books that X showed us.

271
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:33,095
Unfortunately, it seemed that the police did not realize

272
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:36,195
the hint that X had left behind though.

273
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,695
I almost overlooked it too.

274
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:44,395
All of Yamiyo Dorosue's writings have failed to pass the screening.

275
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,895
I was concerned so I contacted the publisher and confirmed.

276
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:51,595
Then I found another common point.

277
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:55,295
The one who judging all the manuscripts for the new writer's award was...

278
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:00,795
Yosuke Chino.

279
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:01,895
Right.

280
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,995
The real perp X of this case...

281
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,995
had a grudge against Mr. Chino

282
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,995
and wanted to make a killer out of him.

283
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,995
Yamiyo Dorosue.

284
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:21,995
So I confirmed everything with Mr. Chino in person

285
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:24,195
and figured everything out.

286
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,995
After killing Mr. Amagi and Mr. Bando,

287
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,895
she tried to frame Mr. Chino up as the killer.

288
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:32,995
Yamiyo Dorosue is...

289
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,495
Toyoko Kanemitsu.

290
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:41,295
It's you, correct?

291
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:56,795
Mr. Chino said that your writing...

292
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:59,995
Yes, right before my eyes.

293
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,095
Come to think of it,

294
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:04,395
one of the works I'm reviewing right now is incredible.

295
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:07,995
It's called "The Melting Weapon", and this is really horrors.

296
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,695
Is it that bad?

297
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:12,295
Well, everything about it is terrible.

298
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:14,095
Listen to this too, owner.

299
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,795
He criticized your piece.

300
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,295
And...

301
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,695
The contents of the mystery was terrible

302
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:23,795
but the name Yamiyo Dorosue is the pits too.

303
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:27,895
I doubt the character of anybody who can write something like that.

304
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:34,595
He not only laughed off my character, he also denied my entire being.

305
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:35,695
That's why...

306
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,295
I killed Amagi who was a pain to this town...

307
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:47,295
and killed useless Bando as well.

308
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:51,895
So that I could frame Chino up for the murders!

309
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:55,395
I didn't have much of a grudge against the two.

310
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:58,995
I killed them because it was just the thing to frame Chino for the murders

311
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,995
that I wrote as a plot in my mystery manuscript.

312
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:05,795
But Conan...

313
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:09,995
Thank you so much for solving the mystery.

314
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:13,395
But I have no evidence, everything I said is based only on my deduction.

315
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,795
Oh, come on. So as long as the mystery is solved,

316
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:20,795
there's no need for unrefined elements like evidence,

317
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:23,095
in pure mystery.

318
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,595
The ABC murder case that you referred to

319
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,695
was also a hint, wasn't it?

320
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:34,095
Agatha Christie's story not only A, B, C, but also D.

321
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:38,995
In other words, the hint to this case was to think it out including the D.

322
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:41,495
You genuinely like mysteries, don't you?

323
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:52,295
But you've taken things a bit too far.

324
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:57,095
You turned the mystery that you thought up into a murder weapon.

325
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,495
No matter how much you like mysteries,

326
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,595
no matter how good the mystery is,

327
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:05,795
you can't cross the final line.

328
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:10,195
As is basic to mysteries, you displayed the hints, but that's...

329
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:13,995
It was my nature and sin.

330
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,495
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:26,595
What do you want, brat? Why'd you tell me to come here?

332
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:29,295
She wants you to escort her, Pops.

333
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,295
What? Where to?

334
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:34,095
I really hate evidence,

335
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:36,395
but I figured the police may want it,

336
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,495
so I got it ready.

337
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,995
She has the receipt from the DIY shop.

338
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:45,295
The one for the time I bought the awl that I used on Mr. Amagi

339
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,595
and the pesticide I bought and used on Mr. Bando.

340
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,795
What? You...

341
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:55,995
You know where you're going, don't you?

342
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:58,595
What?

343
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:02,295
Mrs. Toyoko Kanemitsu killed the two.

344
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,595
And tried to frame Mr. Chino?

345
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:09,295
And all because she held a grudge against him for laughing at her story?

346
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:16,195
I really don't want to shower the elderly with harsh words,

347
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,895
but to take someone's life is...

348
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:21,895
I know what I did was unforgivable.

349
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,495
That's why I'm here.

350
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:53,995
And, what's the content of "The Melting Weapon" all about?

351
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:57,795
Well, it's about a locked room murder.

352
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,795
The bedroom door is locked from the inside,

353
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:03,495
but the perp sends a slug smeared with poison

354
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:05,895
through the space between the door.

355
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:10,595
The moment the victim who is sleeping inside touches the poisoned slug,

356
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:14,795
the poison penetrates the victim's skin, and they suffers and dies.

357
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,195
On the other hand, the slug which is the murder weapon

358
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,895
because of the salt content in the victim's perspiration

359
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,595
melts and vanishes.

360
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:25,595
The locked room murder is completed.

361
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:30,495
But, why does that slug so conveniently go crawling over to the victim?

362
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:34,995
And why doesn't the slug die despite being smeared with poison?

363
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:38,395
Unfortunately, those things are not explained.

364
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:40,895
What? Give me a break.

365
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:42,995
That's too much of a mystery for me.

366
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:45,995
But if you think of it as some space to think on your own,

367
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,395
it's amusing.

368
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,395
How would you explain it, Pops?

369
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,195
Some space...

370
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,395
"Mount Kumomaru, Cottage Entrance" -Enough!

371
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:57,595
What?

372
00:23:57,595 --> 00:24:01,795
Yeah. I put kerosene on to strengthen it.

373
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:06,595
I had a nightmare.

374
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:12,795
Will you tell us a little

375
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:15,495
about the late Ms. Yamakura then?

376
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:24,295
Next Conan, "The Dark Mountain Route"

377
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:27,138
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:29,238
"Meteorological balloon"

379
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:30,738
-Anything today? -The characters for love and song

380
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,738
make "Love Letter". Oh, my beloved Ms. Sato.

381
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,238
That's actually pretty decent.
