1
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:21,132
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:23,032
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:24,632
Today's episode occurs inside a bus filled with danger.

4
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,532
Ai is acting strange.

5
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,132
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,932
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,032
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,491
Did you see that? He just left.

9
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:17,791
The client left with a happy face.

10
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:22,591
He doesn't realize that was his last drink.

11
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,291
Isn't that right, bro?

12
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,991
Bro?

13
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:36,091
So that diva's up next?

14
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,591
Every time I hear her sing, it sends shivers down my spine.

15
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,991
And she's good looking too.

16
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,891
She's your type, isn't she?

17
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,491
Dry martinis for you two.

18
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,191
Compliments of the diva.

19
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,891
Well, that's mighty kind of her.

20
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,791
What's the meaning of this?

21
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,391
Huh?

22
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,991
I asked you what the heck you're doing!

23
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,391
I already know all about you!

24
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,391
What?

25
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:25,991
Vermouth.

26
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,491
I'm just kidding.

27
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,491
It was a joke. A joke.

28
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,891
Don't get so angry.

29
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,891
I was just teasing the guys

30
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,291
who have the hots for that diva.

31
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,691
That's all.

32
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,191
Sure, but are you sure this is okay?

33
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:51,291
I mean you're a famous actress.

34
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,591
What if someone saw you with us?

35
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,291
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,491
Everyone's attention is on the diva who's up next.

37
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,691
Never mind that.

38
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:05,891
Did you find what you were looking for?

39
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,091
Well...

40
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,491
Not exactly what I was looking for, but...

41
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:11,891
What are you looking for anyway?

42
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:14,291
Don't you think it's about time you tell us

43
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,891
where you're at and what you're doing.

44
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,591
No use asking.

45
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,491
This woman never reveals her secrets.

46
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:26,691
You just don't understand, do you?

47
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:29,891
A secret makes a woman a woman.

48
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:33,491
A woman becomes beautiful

49
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,191
when she has secrets to hide.

50
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,991
You make me sick.

51
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,691
Never mind about me. What about you?

52
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,591
Did you find that little kitten that got away from you?

53
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:50,191
No.

54
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,691
But it won't be long before I do.

55
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:57,091
My nose can sniff out a traitor wherever they are.

56
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,291
And when I do, I'll show them what real fear is.

57
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,891
I'll teach both of them, her and that boyfriend of hers.

58
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:15,591
"Mysterious Passenger (Part 1)"

59
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,391
Next stop, Beika 3rd chome,

60
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,691
front of the Kodama Products main building.

61
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,191
Next stop, Beika 3rd chome,

62
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:48,691
front of the Kodama Products main building.

63
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,391
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

64
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,691
Are you sure you're up to ski?

65
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,991
It's his own fault.

66
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,791
I told him to stop because he would catch a cold

67
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,491
but he stayed up all night watching

68
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:23,091
those "How to Ski" tapes for image training.

69
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,391
I guess you're right.

70
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:27,691
I'm in charge of you kids.

71
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,091
I've got to set a good example.

72
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,291
But when we get there,

73
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,991
you've got keep still and stay in bed at the lodge.

74
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:36,491
Like they say, the beginning of a cold

75
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:38,491
is the most crucial time.

76
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:41,391
You'd better not push yourself and go outside.

77
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,291
All right.

78
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,191
Come on, I can't tell who the kid is.

79
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:55,591
Next stop, in front of Beika Park...

80
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,891
Hey. The passengers are boarding now.

81
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,691
Please stay in your seats.

82
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,491
Yes, sir.

83
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:38,391
Oh, my. You look like you're about to die from boredom.

84
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,991
You look very sad

85
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,891
since you won't be able to see her for a long time.

86
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,091
Huh?

87
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,991
Or could it be...

88
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,391
that you're sad because you won't be able

89
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,091
to see those guys?

90
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:52,991
You're nuts.

91
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,991
These passengers have nothing to do with me.

92
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,191
Who'd be crazy enough

93
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:58,291
to want to run into those guys in a small bus like this?

94
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,091
Especially with all these kids on board...

95
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,891
Is he one of those men in black?

96
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:07,691
No, he isn't.

97
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,691
I can tell, they have a smell.

98
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,991
It's an unpleasant smell,

99
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:15,691
only those who're in the organization give it off...

100
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:20,791
You don't smell funny.

101
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,591
Will you stop kidding around?

102
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:25,691
But if you have that sixth sense,

103
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:27,191
what happened with Pisco?

104
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:31,391
Well, I had my suspicions.

105
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:34,891
Then why didn't you say something?

106
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,591
I wasn't absolutely sure.

107
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,391
I had a feeling there was one more.

108
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:44,191
That's right. Someone worse than Pisco.

109
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,991
I felt an aura that made my skin prickle.

110
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,891
Kudo.

111
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:01,791
Change seats with me and hide me.

112
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,791
Please!

113
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,991
Haibara.

114
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,691
Look! It's Mr. Araide!

115
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,491
I didn't expect to see all of you on this bus too.

116
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:15,691
We took our physical examination at school yesterday.

117
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:16,991
Yes, I know.

118
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,991
Hey. Is something wrong with Mr. Araide?

119
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:23,791
I just remembered. You weren't there yesterday.

120
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,691
Are you on a date, sir?

121
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,591
No, she's a teacher at Teitan High School.

122
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,591
I'm the school doctor there.

123
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:35,591
Hi, boys and girls!

124
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,791
You're that cool kid.

125
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,391
So we meet again.

126
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,791
-Do you know her? -Yes.

127
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,691
She teaches English at Ran's high school.

128
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:50,091
My name is Jodie Saintemillion.

129
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,091
I'm on a date with Dr. Araide.

130
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,291
We're going to the Ueno Art Museum.

131
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,291
No, we met at the bus stop quite coincidentally.

132
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,191
You shouldn't embarrass a lady.

133
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,991
It wouldn't be good for rumors to go around school about us.

134
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,591
Isn't that right?

135
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,091
Yes.

136
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,391
That would be a problem.

137
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,291
Hey, look.

138
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,791
Look at those two.

139
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,991
We're not even there yet and they're already in their ski suits!

140
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,691
They probably can't wait.

141
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,891
But I know how they feel.

142
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,191
I do, too.

143
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:03,191
Good grief. Why is he putting his goggles on in the bus?

144
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,991
Why don't we change too?

145
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:12,391
Don't you remember? We sent our bags on ahead.

146
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,891
Oh, that's right!

147
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,391
Genta, you're so forgetful.

148
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,191
Nobody move!

149
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:25,291
Move and you're dead.

150
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,591
What is this?

151
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,591
It's them.

152
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,699
Nobody move!

153
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,999
Move and you're dead.

154
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,699
What's going on?

155
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,199
Are they hijacking the bus?

156
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,599
What is this?

157
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,899
What the?

158
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,799
Don't you have ears?

159
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,999
I told you to shut up!

160
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,099
Hey.

161
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,199
Yes?

162
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,099
First off, let's close the front doors.

163
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,299
Yes, sir.

164
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,599
Next, let's change the destination sign to read "Not in Service".

165
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,899
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,699
Now then, let's get this bus moving.

167
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,099
Just drive through the city.

168
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:42,299
Yes, sir!

169
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,399
Hurry up!

170
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,899
"Not in Service"

171
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:00,099
Listen. When we stop for a red light,

172
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,699
I want you to call your company.

173
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,199
Yes, sir.

174
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,499
Good. You're all being smart.

175
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,599
Now, I want all of you to get your cellular phones out

176
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,199
and hand them over to me.

177
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,699
Don't try to hide them.

178
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,199
If you do, I'll fix it so you never make another phone call.

179
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,399
This is W-707, Kobayashi.

180
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,799
W-707, Kobayashi.

181
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,999
Listen. We're being...

182
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,799
We've just hijacked your company's bus!

183
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,499
We only want one thing.

184
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,699
We want the release of Kunio Yajima who's in prison.

185
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,099
Tell the cops that if they don't do it,

186
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,799
we'll kill one passenger every hour.

187
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,699
We'll call you back in 20 minutes.

188
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,899
Get things settled by then.

189
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:17,799
Kunio Yajima...

190
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,699
One of the members of a gang of robbers, last month,

191
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,499
they made a bomb and tried to rob a jewelry store.

192
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,599
The leader of the gang, Kunio Yajima was the only one caught.

193
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,599
The other three are still at large.

194
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,599
I'm sure Yajima was once a jewelry broker.

195
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,199
I get it.

196
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,899
I'll bet the rest of the gang don't know what to do

197
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,499
with the jewels they stole

198
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,599
and they haven't gotten rid of them yet

199
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,699
so they're trying to break their boss out.

200
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,099
Or maybe only the boss knows where the jewels are

201
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,699
and they're trying to get him out of jail so they can get to it.

202
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,099
Hey, you! Hurry it up!

203
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,499
Sorry.

204
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,499
"Shuichi Akai (Passenger)"

205
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,899
I don't have a cellular phone.

206
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,199
Gosh, what a dork.

207
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,799
Hey, old man, you!

208
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,099
What's that in your ear?

209
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:13,099
It's a... a hearing aid.

210
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,899
I... I got hurt when I was young.

211
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,999
That's why I...

212
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,599
Hey, you! Stop that, it's noisy!

213
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,799
No can help, gum chewing's noisy.

214
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,699
You guys are wasting your time doing this.

215
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,599
You're going to get caught anyway.

216
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:33,399
I think you should give it up and make a run for it...

217
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,399
Okay, I get you.

218
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,899
I'll shut up.

219
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,199
Yeah.

220
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,699
That's what you should've done from the start.

221
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,999
Ouch...

222
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,499
What happened? Are you okay?

223
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,499
Yeah, fine.

224
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,699
You...

225
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,999
Jodie.

226
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,599
Sorry!

227
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:22,199
Oh, my God! What have I done?

228
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,899
Are you all right? I didn't mean that.

229
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,399
I always make a blunder and gets clumsy.

230
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,699
-Are you really... -Forget it!

231
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,399
Get back to your seat!

232
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:36,899
It's very, very exciting.

233
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,899
Good grief. Is this teacher really all right?

234
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,199
Anyway, while those guys are over there,

235
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,299
I've get to contact Inspector Megure on my earring shaped transmitter

236
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,399
to let him know what's going on in this bus.

237
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,899
What are you doing?

238
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,199
You little brat...

239
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,799
Brat! Try something like that again,

240
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,399
you're really going to get it!

241
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:22,799
I almost forgot.

242
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,699
I'm going to hang onto this.

243
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,799
Gosh. He took my phone.

244
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,199
Conan! Are you all right?

245
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,499
That's strange.

246
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:35,099
He came straight for me.

247
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,199
But I'm sure he couldn't see me. I was hiding behind the seat.

248
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,799
That must mean...

249
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,399
another one from their gang's on this bus.

250
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,899
It must be one of those three

251
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,799
since they could see what I was doing.

252
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,899
But how'd he let him know?

253
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:58,399
How'd he let him know where I was?

254
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,499
How'd he do it without anybody noticing?

255
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,699
This is Sato.

256
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:15,199
The hijacked bus is presently heading towards Takaido.

257
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,599
Travelling at a speed of approximately 50 kilometers.

258
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,599
This is Takagi, we're in position E.

259
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,899
The hijacked bus has just come into view.

260
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:24,399
There are two suspects on board.

261
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,799
Both are in ski suits.

262
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,399
I can't make out their faces because they have hats and goggles on.

263
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,199
It appears both suspects are armed.

264
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,399
What should we do, Inspector?

265
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,299
The bus might pass that way again.

266
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,199
Hold your positions.

267
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,299
Yes, sir!

268
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,699
Gosh! If both of them have guns,

269
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,099
then we have to move carefully.

270
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,199
Inspector.

271
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,999
The bosses upstairs just gave their orders.

272
00:18:55,999 --> 00:19:00,599
First priority is for the safe release of the passengers.

273
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,699
The prisoner, Kunio Yajima,

274
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,899
is going to be released per the hijackers request.

275
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,599
I guess we have no other choice

276
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,899
being as it seems the hijackers have already fired 2 shots in the bus.

277
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:17,699
If they're part of that gang of jewelry robbers,

278
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,699
an explosives professional might be in there too.

279
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:24,499
If they explode some bombs in the city,

280
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,299
we're going to have a disaster on our hands.

281
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,899
But still, they're trapped like rats in there.

282
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,099
It appears that the bus is just moving through the streets randomly.

283
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:37,099
No, they have some kind of plan.

284
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:40,499
They intend to lose the police and escape.

285
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,499
They've got a plan.

286
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,699
So they've agreed to release him, huh?

287
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:51,299
All right then, tell Yajima when he's released

288
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,999
to call us back in 1 hour.

289
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:58,799
As soon as we know he's in a safe place,

290
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,699
we'll let the passengers go, three of them first.

291
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,699
Listen carefully. Don't do anything stupid!

292
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:18,999
Two ski bags in a row on the floor...

293
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,999
Could those be...

294
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,599
You again?

295
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,099
If you're not afraid of dying,

296
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,699
then I'll be glad to oblige.

297
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,499
Hey, little kid, stand up.

298
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,399
Conan!

299
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,899
Stop that!

300
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:46,699
He's just a little boy being mischievous!

301
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:50,199
Besides, you're getting what you asked for!

302
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,899
If you hurt even one passenger,

303
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,099
your plan's not going to go smoothly.

304
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,899
You've got some nerve!

305
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:58,999
You young punk...

306
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,599
Stop that!

307
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,499
If the bullet misses and hits "that thing", then what?

308
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:05,899
That's right.

309
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,699
Okay, you guys! Get back to your seats now!

310
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:09,999
Yes.

311
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,999
You said that if "that thing" got hit...

312
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,299
As I thought, in these bags...

313
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,099
Are there bombs in them?

314
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,899
I still don't know what these guys are going to do with these.

315
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,899
But I do know for sure

316
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:28,499
that one of those three in the back is part of their gang

317
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,399
and he's telling them about me.

318
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:33,599
I've got to find out somehow who it is.

319
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,499
Otherwise, there'll be nothing I can do.

320
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:41,699
Hey, Haibara. Do you have any ideas?

321
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,699
Hey.

322
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,799
What? What is this?

323
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,699
His choking pressure...

324
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:53,599
It's that same overwhelming feeling I got before.

325
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,799
He's here.

326
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,999
That guy's on this bus!

327
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:01,599
Is it one of the men in black? Are they after me?

328
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,099
Or is it just a coincidence?

329
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,599
If my identity is blown now...

330
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,499
If they realize I betrayed the organization...

331
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:14,199
Then Dr. Agasa and all the others on this bus...

332
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,399
Everyone will be killed!

333
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:22,099
And of course, they will get him, too.

334
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,899
Please! Oh, please! Don't let them see me!

335
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,299
"Next Episode" -Hey, don't tell me...

336
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:05,799
It can't be, someone's here?

337
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:08,999
Here, on this bus...

338
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,099
Someone from the organization?

339
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,199
Listen. The moment the bus comes out of the tunnel,

340
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,899
that's when we make our move!

341
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:21,999
I've always known that there'd never be a place for me in society.

342
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,399
I really am a fool, aren't I, sis?

343
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:30,599
Next Conan, "Mysterious Passenger (Part 2)"

344
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,817
Next Conan's Hint:

345
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:36,117
"Back mirror"

346
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:37,817
Next week's episode involves the organization of the men in black too.

347
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:40,017
I don't think we're going to have an easy time with this one.
