1
00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:04.124
"Oohama Beach" -A two hours car ride from Beika-cho.

2
00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:07.224
We've come here to Oohama Beach.

3
00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:11.224
Pops suddenly says he wants to go surfing.

4
00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:14.524
Thinking that refusing would be a hassle,

5
00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:16.624
Ran and I go along unwillingly.

6
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:18.824
Grab your wet suit firmly

7
00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:21.324
and shove your feet through it.

8
00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.124
Tight!

9
00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.024
Yes. If it's loose,

10
00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:29.924
water will come in, you see.

11
00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:37.724
This all started because Pops was

12
00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:40.024
"Nagisa Imaoka (25)" -invited to come over by this woman

13
00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:42.524
that he had recently met.

14
00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.824
Exert strength, more!

15
00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:50.724
In order not to lose your surfboard,

16
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:53.524
use this leash cord and connect it to your ankle.

17
00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:56.124
Make sure the length is a little longer than your surfboard.

18
00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:58.524
Approximately two meters for an adult,

19
00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.324
and 1.5 meters for a child.

20
00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:03.124
Doesn't it ever gets severed?

21
00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:05.224
Rarely.

22
00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:08.224
But you can never tell what will happen

23
00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:10.224
if you are taken in by a big wave that comes along.

24
00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.324
That's one of the interesting things about surfing.

25
00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:16.724
Then, shall we go ride the waves?

26
00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:53.924
The vivid colored memories of summer.

27
00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:56.024
Solve mysteries all season round.

28
00:01:56.024 --> 00:01:57.824
Along the vast sandy beach,

29
00:01:57.824 --> 00:02:00.224
a figure of a person lies, with no footprints around.

30
00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:01.924
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:03.924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:06.324
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.566
"A Sandy Beach Without Footprints".

34
00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:09.166
Are you Mr. Mouri?

35
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.666
I'm sorry,

36
00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.866
I've been out doing some purchasing,

37
00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:13.866
so I wasn't here to introduce myself.

38
00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:18.466
I heard from Nagisa that the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri would be here,

39
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.366
"Umishiro Imaoka (60)" -and was looking forward to meeting you.

40
00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:22.766
I am Umishiro Imaoka.

41
00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.466
How do you do?

42
00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:27.666
Well, this is my first experience at surfing,

43
00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:29.266
but it sure is a lot of fun.

44
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:32.866
I'm the type of guy that likes to go along with the flow.

45
00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.266
So, likewise, with surfing.

46
00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:36.866
You're the type who gets carried away.

47
00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:38.666
I feel that I'm wasting my time being here like this.

48
00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:41.566
I'm dying to ride the waves.

49
00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:47.966
Sir, is this a calendar of the spring tide?

50
00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:50.066
Yes, it is, Sonny.

51
00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:51.666
Looking at this...

52
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.566
Tonight's going to be the night of the spring tide, right?

53
00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:56.466
Yeah. Oohama Beach here

54
00:04:56.466 --> 00:05:00.366
is famous for the great gap during high tide and low tide.

55
00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:04.366
During high tide late at night... Let's see.

56
00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:08.866
The shore becomes about 100 meters closer.

57
00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:10.466
But, in the morning,

58
00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:13.666
the tides withdraw as if fleeing

59
00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.666
and a shallow water beach that seems to have been washed by the waters,

60
00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:20.366
spread over a distance of about one kilometer.

61
00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:21.466
It's fun getting up early

62
00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:24.566
and making footprints in the sand too.

63
00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:27.266
I understand.

64
00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:29.066
For example, if you get to do this in the snow

65
00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:32.266
where no one else has passed...

66
00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.966
Dad!

67
00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:38.066
Are these trophies yours?

68
00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.766
Yes, they are.

69
00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:41.166
In the world of amateurs,

70
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:43.766
she was a pretty good surfer.

71
00:05:43.766 --> 00:05:45.266
No wonder.

72
00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:48.966
Well, how lucky of you to have such a wonderful daughter.

73
00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:52.666
Well, how embarrassing of me.

74
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:54.866
The fact is, she's not my daughter.

75
00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:57.966
Dont tell me that...

76
00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:59.966
he's your son? A boy?

77
00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:01.866
No, no. Was married.

78
00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.266
She's my wife.

79
00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:06.166
Wife?

80
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.566
Which means that she's married?

81
00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:11.266
We have an age difference of 35 years.

82
00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:18.666
Don't let that get you down, Pops.

83
00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:22.666
Dad, come on. Let's continue surfing.

84
00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:24.266
Right, Conan?

85
00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:25.266
Yup!

86
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:30.066
I've had enough. I'm kind of tired.

87
00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:33.266
Right, I see, you're his wife.

88
00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:37.466
Nagisa, I'm ready.

89
00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:39.766
Okay! Let's go then.

90
00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.066
Don't!

91
00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.866
According to the weather forecast I heard in the car,

92
00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:49.266
low atmospheric pressure seems to be closing in.

93
00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:50.866
Look at the waves.

94
00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:53.066
The tip of the waves is turning white.

95
00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:59.666
I've heard that surfing is more enjoyable

96
00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:02.366
when the waves are a bit high.

97
00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:04.166
There are people who say that,

98
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:06.166
but I'm against it.

99
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:08.866
Especially because you're beginners, aren't you?

100
00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:11.366
There are many people who are taken away by the high tides

101
00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:12.866
and lose their lives, you know.

102
00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:15.066
You should never take the sea lightly.

103
00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:19.266
You can't enjoy surfing talking chicken like that!

104
00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:21.666
I'm with you, so you'll be fine.

105
00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.966
Don't get conceited!

106
00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:27.266
What the hell can you do, against the high tides?

107
00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:29.166
Enough of your conceit!

108
00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:41.166
Oh, no. I'm sorry I raised my voice.

109
00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:43.566
No, no, it's okay.

110
00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:45.666
I'm sure that the low atmospheric pressure will pass by morning.

111
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:47.766
Wait until then.

112
00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:58.166
Really. Don't you have any challenge spirit at all?

113
00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:02.166
You're an old man who only finds pleasure in making plastic models.

114
00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:03.966
You're such a bore.

115
00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:08.366
I can hear the sea calling, challenge me.

116
00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:09.866
This is where the passion burns,

117
00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.566
the blood of a surfer girl boils!

118
00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:13.966
Do you understand?

119
00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:15.466
Well...

120
00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:19.566
I understand the relationship between you two very well.

121
00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.366
If we can't surf,

122
00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.466
we may as well return to the pension.

123
00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:24.866
Right?

124
00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:26.266
I guess so.

125
00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:42.166
Left, left.

126
00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:44.866
No, no, to the right.

127
00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:46.766
Right there.

128
00:08:46.766 --> 00:08:49.866
Nagisa used to be a customer of that shop?

129
00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:51.166
Yeah.

130
00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:52.966
According to the pension owner,

131
00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:54.866
something about she's going to conquer the waves here.

132
00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:57.666
That's why it seems she's been frequenting coming here.

133
00:08:57.666 --> 00:09:02.066
And three years ago, she was conquered instead.

134
00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:05.666
Yes, please come in.

135
00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:08.266
Excuse me.

136
00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:10.566
Mr. Imaoka. What seems to be the matter?

137
00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:15.366
Huh? Your wife's not around?

138
00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:16.566
No.

139
00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:19.666
I was making preparations in the kitchen for tomorrow,

140
00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:21.766
when she disappeared from sight.

141
00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:25.766
So I was wondering if she was over here visiting you.

142
00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:27.966
No, she's not here.

143
00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:29.466
Don't tell me she went to the sea...

144
00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:31.266
Where's your wife's surfboard?

145
00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:32.666
At the shop.

146
00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:36.666
Could she has taken a surfboard from the shop?

147
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:38.066
She most probably would.

148
00:09:38.066 --> 00:09:40.166
When she sees the rough sea on a day like this,

149
00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:41.966
her eyes get sharp.

150
00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:44.966
It's almost like a shark going after prey.

151
00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:48.366
Sir, something is flashing in your chest pocket.

152
00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:50.266
Maybe something's coming in on your cell phone?

153
00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:56.266
It's from my wife.

154
00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:57.766
"I'm sorry, I went off without telling you.

155
00:09:57.766 --> 00:10:01.066
Karaoke now. I'm may stay out all night."

156
00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.666
I didn't notice this.

157
00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:05.466
I'm glad she didn't go out to sea.

158
00:10:05.466 --> 00:10:06.766
Even if she were a shark,

159
00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:08.966
there's nothing she can do at a karaoke shop.

160
00:10:08.966 --> 00:10:10.066
Yes.

161
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.166
But, how dare she go out without telling me.

162
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:16.166
I have no idea at all what's on her mind.

163
00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:19.466
A worry that comes along with having a young wife, huh?

164
00:10:19.466 --> 00:10:22.066
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

165
00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:25.166
This is had recently become a habitual phrase between Nagisa and I.

166
00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:43.866
The low atmospheric pressure has passed at daybreak.

167
00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:46.466
The tides are all the way off-shore.

168
00:10:46.466 --> 00:10:48.866
It's a beautiful sandy beach, right, Conan?

169
00:10:48.866 --> 00:10:51.166
True.

170
00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:54.666
Pops.

171
00:10:54.666 --> 00:10:56.166
What could that be?

172
00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:59.166
A drifting wood or something.

173
00:11:00.466 --> 00:11:01.466
No?

174
00:11:01.466 --> 00:11:03.166
Isn't that someone wearing a wet suit?

175
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.166
Don't tell me that...

176
00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:13.166
This is...

177
00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:14.966
Nagisa?

178
00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:18.966
No good. She's dead.

179
00:11:18.966 --> 00:11:20.266
No.

180
00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.066
That's...

181
00:11:24.866 --> 00:11:27.366
At any rate, you contact the police, Ran!

182
00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.466
-You bring Mr. Imaoka, Kid. -Yup!

183
00:11:29.466 --> 00:11:30.766
And while you're at it,

184
00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:33.666
go get some cardboards to put around the corpse too.

185
00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:34.966
Okay!

186
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:41.066
I guess the passion of the surfer girl couldn't be stopped.

187
00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.966
This is probably a homicide.

188
00:11:45.966 --> 00:11:47.566
But...

189
00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:49.366
the only footprints surrounding the corpse are ours,

190
00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:51.966
when we came running over to the body.

191
00:11:53.166 --> 00:11:56.766
How on earth did the culprit...

192
00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:14.317
Nagisa...

193
00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:20.117
What the?

194
00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:22.117
Sand?

195
00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.917
Why in a place like that?

196
00:12:26.517 --> 00:12:28.517
Nagisa.

197
00:12:28.517 --> 00:12:30.517
Hold on. He's...

198
00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:32.017
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.217
Yeah.

200
00:12:33.217 --> 00:12:35.317
He appears on TV a lot, doesn't he?

201
00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:37.517
Let's go get his autograph later.

202
00:12:37.517 --> 00:12:38.617
I guess so.

203
00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:47.117
And, Mr. Mouri, did you figure something out yet?

204
00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:51.117
Briefly speaking, I would say that

205
00:12:51.117 --> 00:12:53.817
this is an unfortunate accident.

206
00:12:53.817 --> 00:12:55.517
So, it's an accident after all.

207
00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:57.317
Yes.

208
00:12:57.317 --> 00:13:01.017
Nagisa, at seeing the rough sea brought about the low atmospheric pressure,

209
00:13:01.017 --> 00:13:05.017
probably couldn't hold her impulse in check.

210
00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:07.217
Therefore, she lied to her husband, Mr. Imaoka

211
00:13:07.217 --> 00:13:10.317
and sent him a mail saying that she was going to karaoke.

212
00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:13.517
She secretly wore the wet suit that was in the workshop

213
00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:15.217
and took the surfboard that was there too,

214
00:13:15.217 --> 00:13:17.417
then headed for the sea from the backdoor.

215
00:13:17.417 --> 00:13:20.917
But, I wonder why she didn't wear her own wet suit

216
00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.917
that is hanging over there?

217
00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:25.417
True.

218
00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:26.917
That's probably because

219
00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:31.217
she thought that I, being in the kitchen would see her.

220
00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:35.417
And if I did catch her going, she knew that I would stop her.

221
00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:39.717
Nagisa really loved surfing, you see.

222
00:13:40.717 --> 00:13:43.517
I truly understand how she feels.

223
00:13:43.517 --> 00:13:48.417
And while she was enjoying surfing a large wave came and flustered her,

224
00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:52.717
it just so happened that the leash cord wrapped around Nagisa's neck.

225
00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:54.917
In addition, the waves pulled the boat along too.

226
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:58.917
And as a result, she eventually was choked to death.

227
00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:06.517
But the strangulation mark is inside the wet suit.

228
00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:14.317
So what?

229
00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:16.217
She was up against the rough sea.

230
00:14:16.217 --> 00:14:18.617
The cord could've gotten inside her wet suit!

231
00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:21.317
But the suit is tightly close to the body

232
00:14:21.317 --> 00:14:22.917
so that water doesn't go inside it, you know.

233
00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:27.417
What a nuisance! Now, get out of here, brat.

234
00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:30.617
And, although the boat got lost,

235
00:14:30.617 --> 00:14:33.417
Nagisa found her way back to this beach

236
00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:36.017
where her beloved husband, Mr. Imaoka is!

237
00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:37.217
Very sharp of you.

238
00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:39.417
What sharp power of observation.

239
00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:42.017
Huh? Her pedicure isn't complete.

240
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.617
True.

241
00:14:45.617 --> 00:14:49.417
I wonder if she went to the beach in the midst of doing pedicure.

242
00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:52.317
What's this? Something's not...

243
00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:55.817
Mr. Imaoka!

244
00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:59.217
Nagisa's been washed up on the beach!

245
00:15:02.817 --> 00:15:04.517
Mr. Imaoka!

246
00:15:04.517 --> 00:15:06.117
Those plastic bags!

247
00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:20.117
So this is homicide after all!

248
00:15:20.117 --> 00:15:21.717
And the culprit is...

249
00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:31.517
Huh? The footprints of a person weighing more than 100 kilograms?

250
00:15:31.517 --> 00:15:34.917
Yup, for example, if a person weighing 60 kilograms

251
00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:37.317
carries a person weighing 50 kilograms on his back,

252
00:15:37.317 --> 00:15:40.117
a deep footprint would remain, right?

253
00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:42.317
Beats me.

254
00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:43.817
Either way,

255
00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:46.917
when we got here, there were no such footprints,

256
00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:48.817
and it was just a beautiful sandy beach.

257
00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:50.917
I see, thank you.

258
00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:52.817
You're welcome.

259
00:15:52.817 --> 00:15:54.217
Darn.

260
00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:56.917
I'm sure that he's the culprit

261
00:15:56.917 --> 00:16:00.517
but how did he carry the corpse to the beach?

262
00:16:00.517 --> 00:16:02.917
I've got to figure that out first.

263
00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:07.217
What's this?

264
00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.917
Was it crushed by something?

265
00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:13.917
It was crushed by something...

266
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.617
Could it be that...

267
00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:30.517
I found it!

268
00:16:38.517 --> 00:16:42.117
I see! So, that's the story.

269
00:16:44.617 --> 00:16:47.317
Nagisa was embraced by the sea.

270
00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:48.617
Yes.

271
00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:50.917
And journeyed off.

272
00:16:50.917 --> 00:16:53.117
Let's think of it that way...

273
00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.117
Dad?

274
00:17:00.117 --> 00:17:01.217
This is...

275
00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:04.317
That's what I'd like to say,

276
00:17:04.317 --> 00:17:07.517
but this is a homicide made to look like an accident.

277
00:17:07.517 --> 00:17:09.817
What? Homicide?

278
00:17:09.817 --> 00:17:11.817
Yes, that's right.

279
00:17:11.817 --> 00:17:15.417
Please look at Nagisa's left toenail.

280
00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:18.517
The pedicure is only halfway through, isn't it?

281
00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:20.617
Don't you think it strange that she would go out to sea

282
00:17:20.617 --> 00:17:22.617
while she was still partway through?

283
00:17:22.617 --> 00:17:24.017
True.

284
00:17:24.017 --> 00:17:29.117
I thought it was strange when Conan mentioned it to me a while ago too.

285
00:17:29.117 --> 00:17:33.617
She only stopped partway because she had no other choice.

286
00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:38.817
Because she was killed

287
00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:42.317
while putting on a pedicure.

288
00:17:42.317 --> 00:17:44.017
Mr. Imaoka.

289
00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:45.917
By you!

290
00:17:49.317 --> 00:17:52.317
Mr. Mouri, what're you talking about, out of the blue?

291
00:17:52.317 --> 00:17:55.417
Please look at the strangulation mark on Nagisa's neck.

292
00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:59.817
A part of his below her wet suit, is it not?

293
00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:01.117
It's because

294
00:18:01.117 --> 00:18:03.317
in order to make it look like an accident,

295
00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:05.517
after you strangled her with the leash cord,

296
00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:08.017
you put the wet suit back on her.

297
00:18:08.017 --> 00:18:10.517
Please wait, Mr. Mouri.

298
00:18:10.517 --> 00:18:12.617
You know too, don't you?

299
00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:15.817
That a lot of strength is needed to wear a wet suit.

300
00:18:15.817 --> 00:18:18.117
If Nagisa was already dead,

301
00:18:18.117 --> 00:18:19.517
although the example is not in good taste,

302
00:18:19.517 --> 00:18:23.217
she would be as soft as a devils tongue, wouldn't she?

303
00:18:23.217 --> 00:18:25.017
How on earth could I have made Nagisa,

304
00:18:25.017 --> 00:18:27.017
who was in that condition wear the wet suit?

305
00:18:27.017 --> 00:18:31.117
Shall we try it, then?

306
00:18:31.117 --> 00:18:34.717
Sakata, you're a corpse, so don't move.

307
00:18:34.717 --> 00:18:37.817
-Yes, sir. -There!

308
00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:41.517
It's true that the foot comes out without having to exert much strength.

309
00:18:41.517 --> 00:18:43.417
There, now for the other side.

310
00:18:45.117 --> 00:18:49.217
The plastic bag that is covering the foot eases the friction.

311
00:18:49.217 --> 00:18:51.617
Please look at the trash container that Ran has brought.

312
00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:55.917
The remains of the pedicure in the plastic bag.

313
00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:58.617
It should match Nagisa's foot.

314
00:18:58.617 --> 00:19:00.417
I see, I see.

315
00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:02.817
So the culprit made her wear the wet suit using the plastic bag,

316
00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:04.117
put her on the rubber boat,

317
00:19:04.117 --> 00:19:06.317
and disposed of it off-shore.

318
00:19:06.317 --> 00:19:09.817
Then, the body wash washed up to shore in the morning.

319
00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:11.317
That's probably what happened.

320
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.817
Please wait.

321
00:19:12.817 --> 00:19:16.217
Since when do you claim I took out the rubber boat?

322
00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:18.717
Yesterday at sundown or at night.

323
00:19:18.717 --> 00:19:19.917
Low atmospheric pressure was here,

324
00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:22.117
and the sea was bellowing, you know.

325
00:19:22.117 --> 00:19:24.917
The rubber boat would sink.

326
00:19:24.917 --> 00:19:26.517
Then, maybe it was this morning

327
00:19:26.517 --> 00:19:27.517
after the low atmospheric pressure passed,

328
00:19:27.517 --> 00:19:29.617
and the sea calmed down?

329
00:19:29.617 --> 00:19:31.617
Enough already!

330
00:19:31.617 --> 00:19:34.317
It's a heavy boat with Nagisa on it, you know.

331
00:19:34.317 --> 00:19:37.917
Where on the sandy beach are there tracks of a boat having been dragged?

332
00:19:37.917 --> 00:19:39.917
Well...

333
00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:44.117
Nagisa went out surfing yesterday at sundown into the rough sea,

334
00:19:44.117 --> 00:19:45.817
and died.

335
00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.317
And this morning,

336
00:19:47.317 --> 00:19:50.617
she was washed up to this beach.

337
00:19:50.617 --> 00:19:54.217
It's true that when we discovered Nagisa,

338
00:19:54.217 --> 00:19:58.117
there were no footprints or anything on this vast beach.

339
00:19:58.117 --> 00:20:01.617
Just as if she was washed up here by the sea.

340
00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.517
However, Mr. Imaoka.

341
00:20:03.517 --> 00:20:06.317
You looked at the plastic model on that shelf over there

342
00:20:06.317 --> 00:20:09.417
and thought up the trick that you used to commit this crime.

343
00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:13.317
The plastic models?

344
00:20:13.317 --> 00:20:14.717
You mean this.

345
00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:17.217
The crane truck.

346
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.517
You stretched out the tip,

347
00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:21.217
tied the corpse to the rope,

348
00:20:21.217 --> 00:20:23.917
and swayed it to both sides like the pendulum of a clock

349
00:20:23.917 --> 00:20:27.517
and cut it off where the movement hit maximum.

350
00:20:27.517 --> 00:20:29.817
I'm sorry. Well, at any rate,

351
00:20:29.817 --> 00:20:32.717
the deceased would fly through the air and fall into the sea.

352
00:20:32.717 --> 00:20:35.117
There would be no footprints in the sand.

353
00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:36.717
How is it, Mr. Mouri?

354
00:20:36.717 --> 00:20:38.217
Wrong!

355
00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:41.317
Mr. Imaoka,

356
00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:43.617
after killing Nagisa,

357
00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:46.217
you buried her into the sand and hid her.

358
00:20:46.217 --> 00:20:49.317
The mail about the karaoke was what you had schemed.

359
00:20:49.317 --> 00:20:50.617
And then, this morning,

360
00:20:50.617 --> 00:20:52.617
you dug Nagisa out,

361
00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:54.917
carried her on your back and moved her.

362
00:20:54.917 --> 00:20:58.017
But, it's the weight of two people, you know.

363
00:20:58.017 --> 00:20:59.817
Of course, you'd have to find footprints.

364
00:20:59.817 --> 00:21:04.617
You used a certain thing so as not to leave footprints behind.

365
00:21:04.617 --> 00:21:07.617
"Crawler" -Using the heavy machinery, the crawler, as a hint.

366
00:21:10.717 --> 00:21:14.517
Mr. Imaoka, you connected this and made a loop, right?

367
00:21:14.517 --> 00:21:16.217
I see.

368
00:21:16.217 --> 00:21:19.417
You carried Nagisa on your back, went inside

369
00:21:19.417 --> 00:21:21.817
and moved along the sandy beach.

370
00:21:21.817 --> 00:21:25.017
Then, you left Nagisa there and returned.

371
00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:28.417
Well? Am I wrong?

372
00:21:35.117 --> 00:21:39.217
Last night, it was after all of you had left.

373
00:21:39.217 --> 00:21:42.917
Nagisa... She said...

374
00:21:45.017 --> 00:21:47.117
Tomorrow morning,

375
00:21:47.117 --> 00:21:50.917
I'm going to meet him under the solitary pine tree.

376
00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:54.517
Once I'm settled, I'll send you the divorce paper.

377
00:21:54.517 --> 00:21:57.917
You have no intention of thinking it over?

378
00:21:57.917 --> 00:21:59.817
What it comes down to is

379
00:21:59.817 --> 00:22:03.817
what the world requires is either looks or money.

380
00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:07.717
Please forget about me.

381
00:22:11.617 --> 00:22:18.217
Nagisa married me only for the money.

382
00:22:18.217 --> 00:22:20.517
Darn!

383
00:23:43.917 --> 00:23:45.617
Now, the last 100m straight!

384
00:23:45.617 --> 00:23:47.017
Tawaru Gitaka's being followed by...

385
00:23:47.017 --> 00:23:49.717
Go, go for it!

386
00:23:49.717 --> 00:23:52.017
Run for it! Run for it! Run for it!

387
00:23:52.017 --> 00:23:53.817
Go and run for it!

388
00:23:58.917 --> 00:24:01.217
Just as expected, a man who can't ride the waves

389
00:24:01.217 --> 00:24:03.117
can't ride horses either.

390
00:24:03.117 --> 00:24:05.617
Why does this happen to me?

391
00:24:05.617 --> 00:24:08.917
Gosh, I've had enough!

392
00:24:09.517 --> 00:24:12.317
"Next Episode"

393
00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.817
No doubt about it.

394
00:24:13.817 --> 00:24:16.517
The cause of death is by gunshot.

395
00:24:16.517 --> 00:24:20.017
All suspicions incurred on me will be cleared!

396
00:24:20.017 --> 00:24:22.717
By me, Ryoma Sakamoto!

397
00:24:22.717 --> 00:24:26.217
We've time-slipped.

398
00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:29.617
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei,

399
00:24:29.617 --> 00:24:31.317
for the details.

400
00:24:31.317 --> 00:24:34.017
Figures will solve everything.

401
00:24:34.017 --> 00:24:35.317
Next Conan,

402
00:24:35.317 --> 00:24:38.917
"The Nagasaki Mystery Theater (End of the Edo Era)".

403
00:24:55.217 --> 00:24:57.417
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:57.417 --> 00:24:59.517
"Font".

405
00:24:59.517 --> 00:25:01.417
He can't ride a winning horse, nor can he ride the waves.

406
00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:03.317
So, I guess I'll just have to float on a boat.

407
00:25:03.317 --> 00:25:04.617
Yes, yes.
