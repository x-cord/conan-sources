1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,070
I think there's no choice but to have her disappear after all.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,270
Motoko, that is.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,670
"Shigemi Terakado (67), Spinster"

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,070
The problem is after that.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,670
How to get rid of the corpse?

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,870
"Ryuji Matsuo (23)" -If you don't ever want anybody to find it,

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,470
you could bury it in the remote mountains or something.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,970
I guess so but I'm not young anymore.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,970
You can count on me to get rid of it.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,270
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,070
I hope you rest in peace.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,670
"Motoko Kawaguchi (25)" -Motoko Kawaguchi.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,170
I'd like you to look for Motoko Kawaguchi for me.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,070
"Haruki Toriumi (33)" -She's my fiancee but she suddenly disappeared.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,170
No matter how many times I call her cell phone, she won't answer.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,970
Haruki Toriumi.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,270
You mean, you're with Toriumi Conglomerate?

18
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,170
Yes. Sort of.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,170
I'll be inheriting everything in time.

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,970
You're the successor of a famed family with a promising future.

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,270
It's not that it means anything,

22
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,470
but I fell in love at first sight with her.

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,070
For Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi who is nothing more than an ordinary person,

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,870
she's a gold digger.

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,670
It's unthinkable that she would throw all this away and disappear!

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,270
I'm sure Motoko got involved in some incident.

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,270
A canvas stained black with crime.

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,570
The fiancee suddenly disappears.

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,970
Sundown closes in on a dangerous conversation.

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,970
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:45,869
"The Fiancee who Disappeared"

35
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,469
But in an incident?

36
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,969
I wonder what it is.

37
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,269
How come you're here?

38
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,769
It's a school's off today.

39
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,569
That's the apartment, right?

40
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,969
Hey!

41
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,969
Don't go ahead of me!

42
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,369
I got a call from Kawaguchi three nights ago.

43
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,869
She said she had to move suddenly.

44
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:17,569
She told me that she couldn't to tell me where she was moving to.

45
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:22,269
She said that the movers would be coming to get her things.

46
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,769
"Katsuko Okubo (45)" -The following day, the movers came as she mentioned.

47
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,569
They took all her things with them.

48
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,069
The movers brought this key

49
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,569
and said that she had told them to return it to me,

50
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,469
so I didn't doubt them at all.

51
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,769
But moving when the resident is not present...

52
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:46,169
It doesn't usually happen, does it?

53
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:51,769
I see. I'm sorry to have intruded on you during your work hour.

54
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,769
Same with her work place.

55
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,469
Likewise, three days ago,

56
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,469
she seems to have called her boss

57
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,369
and suddenly announced that was quitting.

58
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:06,169
Although she didn't say a word about it during the day.

59
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:09,769
So Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi suddenly disappeared

60
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,269
from her home as well as her work place.

61
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,369
What on earth happened?

62
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,169
Excuse me.

63
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,669
Where's Motoko?

64
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,469
It seems that Motoko Kawaguchi moved.

65
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,469
"Kumi Suda (25)" -What?

66
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,369
She didn't say anything of that sort three days ago.

67
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:25,969
Three days ago?

68
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:29,169
I'm a detective called Mouri.

69
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,369
I'm Hisami Suda, Motoko's friend.

70
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:36,569
Did you see Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi three days ago?

71
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,969
Yes. I ran into her in town at sundown.

72
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,969
Did you notice anything strange back then?

73
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,269
What?

74
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:48,469
The whereabouts of Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi is unknown since that night.

75
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,169
But when I met her, she was her usual self.

76
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,269
She said that she was going to visit Ms. Shigemi Terakado while smiling.

77
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,369
Shigemi Terakado?

78
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:04,469
I hear she lives at the Beika residence.

79
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,569
She is an elderly woman living alone.

80
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,969
So, it seems Motoko goes to see her sometimes.

81
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,469
Which means that Motoko's whereabouts became unknown

82
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:13,669
after she visited Ms. Terakado?

83
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,269
I'll try visiting Ms. Terakado, then.

84
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:19,769
Because she could be the last one who saw Ms. Motoko.

85
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,769
I hope we can find some clue.

86
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:29,069
Just how far are you going to tag along?

87
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,469
Yes, how can I help you?

88
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,469
You're Ms. Shigemi Terakado?

89
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:36,669
I'm Detective Mouri.

90
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,869
A detective?

91
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:43,969
I'd like to ask you something about Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

92
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,469
I know her very well.

93
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:48,969
She saved my life.

94
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,669
It was a year ago.

95
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,169
You don't feel well?

96
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,769
Yes. I feel a bit faint.

97
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:59,369
I'm old. So, it happens sometimes.

98
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,369
Where do you live?

99
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,869
I'll take you there.

100
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,369
Since then, she's always been looking out for me.

101
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:11,069
I'm very grateful.

102
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,469
But she hasn't been here for about a month now.

103
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,769
Didn't she come here three days ago?

104
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,269
Looks like the water's boiling.

105
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,769
May I go?

106
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:23,869
Sure.

107
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,869
So, she changed her schedule?

108
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,169
She twitched in surprise

109
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,769
when you introduced yourself as a detective, right?

110
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,669
Yeah. I wonder if she's into something fishy?

111
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,569
Aren't you the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri?

112
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,069
"Mitsue Uno (55)" -Yes, I'm indeed Mouri.

113
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,369
I thought so. You're the real him, aren't you?

114
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:48,769
I believe a young lady has been visiting your neighbor sometimes?

115
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,369
Is her name Kawaguchi?

116
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,869
That's her!

117
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:55,969
She was here at sundown three days ago too.

118
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:58,469
She came here after all.

119
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,969
Yeah. Then, why did she say she didn't come?

120
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:06,169
Terakado was having a tough time with that person called Kawaguchi.

121
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,669
Didn't she saved Ms. Terakado's life?

122
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,169
She said she was grateful.

123
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,369
Yes, in the beginning.

124
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:14,169
But each time she came, it seemed she asked for money.

125
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,169
-What? -What?

126
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,269
Even last week, I think it was...

127
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,769
That wicked woman!

128
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,869
You just wait, I'll give her a taste of her own medicine!

129
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,069
Oh, I was going to throw my trash away.

130
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,369
She hated Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

131
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:38,469
If you consider she was deliberately hiding that Ms. Motoko came,

132
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,769
you can deduce more or less what happened.

133
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,669
Shigemi.

134
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:49,869
I'm sorry to have to ask you again but...

135
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,969
It's just before pay day.

136
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:01,169
The problem is how do we prove it, right?

137
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,569
So, what did she do with the corpse?

138
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,769
She couldn't leave it here for too long, could she?

139
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,969
But it'd be hard for an elderly lady like her to carry it out either.

140
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,969
He's Ms. Terakado's friend and comes sometimes.

141
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,669
Terakado's?

142
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,769
She said he's a mover.

143
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,269
-Mover? -Mover?

144
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,269
Oh, no, what a blabbermouth I am!

145
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:39,169
A convenient next door neighbor full of information, isn't she?

146
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,969
No, but that neighbor's not enough.

147
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,169
Yes, he's the one!

148
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:00,669
He's the mover who came to pick up Kawaguchi's things.

149
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,369
I knew it!

150
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,869
I've figured it out, all of it!

151
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:08,569
Pops.

152
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,769
Ms. Shigemi Terakado killed Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi

153
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,869
who kept ripping her off.

154
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:17,369
Then she pretended to be Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi and placed fake calls.

155
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,969
She called the apartment landlady saying she was going to move.

156
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:23,469
Then called her boss at work and told him she was quitting.

157
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:26,069
She did all this so that nobody would think it strange

158
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,869
even if Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi suddenly disappeared.

159
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,669
The one who helped her get rid of the body and all,

160
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,569
is that man friend mover of hers.

161
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:38,069
He probably move the corpse by shoving it into a mattress bag

162
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,869
and made it look as if Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi had asked him

163
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:43,469
to take all her belongings away,

164
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:46,669
to finish off the moving scheme.

165
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:50,069
This is the truth of this disappearance case!

166
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:52,969
Well, everything does fall into place, but...

167
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,169
That's why it's strange, right?

168
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,169
Strange?

169
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,569
Because the minute you start investigating this case,

170
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:01,569
her friend, Kumi Suda shows up.

171
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:05,669
We got to hear about Ms. Shigemi Terakado from Ms. Kumi Suda too.

172
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:06,669
We come here

173
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,469
and find there's a neighbor who has a lot of information.

174
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,069
She gives us loads of information.

175
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,769
On top of that, even the mover appears.

176
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,569
Everything's falling into place too much.

177
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,869
It looks like everybody's trying to get you to solve the case

178
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:21,869
as soon as possible, doesn't it?

179
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,569
They want you to conclude that

180
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:25,869
Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi was killed by Ms. Shigemi Terakado,

181
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,169
and the corpse was gotten rid of.

182
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:32,069
Now that you mentioned it.

183
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:33,669
So that means?

184
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,569
I guess. It's most likely.

185
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:40,669
Ms. Shigemi Terakado and Mr. Ryuji Matsuo,

186
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:45,069
you both erased Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi from this world, didn't you?

187
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:48,169
Impressive! Well done, famed detective.

188
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:49,869
But unless you find the corpse,

189
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,869
you can't arrest us, can you?

190
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,569
Pops!

191
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,169
I brought them.

192
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,669
You guys didn't really get rid of her.

193
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:06,169
All four of you worked together to make it look that way!

194
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:09,869
So, you saw through our fake murder scheme.

195
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:14,169
We wanted to save Motoko from her fiancee, Mr. Toriumi.

196
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,269
Yeah.

197
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,469
-Right. -Yes.

198
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,969
What do you mean save her from Mr. Toriumi?

199
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:35,729
In the beginning, Motoko was attracted to Mr. Toriumi too.

200
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,929
That's why she accepted his proposal.

201
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:43,329
But she couldn't handle his arrogant attitude of believing that

202
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,429
everything would work out the way he wanted it to,

203
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:49,829
so she asked him to break off the engagement.

204
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,829
But Mr. Toriumi...

205
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,129
It's too late.

206
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,329
I already introduced you as my fiancee to the people around me.

207
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,829
If we break off the engagement now,

208
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,929
what will people think of me?

209
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:08,029
I could never do something so embarrassing.

210
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,829
I don't care whether you love me or not.

211
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:20,129
So, Motoko was at a loss what to do.

212
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,729
She knew what kind of man Mr. Toriumi was,

213
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,029
so she said that no matter where she fled,

214
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,229
he would use his money and power to find her and bring her back.

215
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:32,529
She said that she would never be able to run from him

216
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,929
There are guys like that who are dreadfully selfish like him.

217
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:41,029
That's why you all thought up a plan to rescue Ms. Motoko from him?

218
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,529
So, I got Ryuji, who helped Motoko and I a year ago, to join us too.

219
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,029
And that's how we came up with this fake murder plan.

220
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,029
If you made it look as if she was murdered and buried somewhere,

221
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,229
you figured that even a guy like him would give up, right?

222
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:03,029
Motoko starts a new life in some town far away.

223
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,129
We thought that this would really work.

224
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:07,329
And when Motoko disappeared.

225
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:09,229
Just as you expected,

226
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:10,429
Mr. Toriumi asked Pops, a famed detective,

227
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,729
to search the whereabouts of Motoko.

228
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,929
She's my fiancee but she suddenly disappeared.

229
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,229
Then with the help of Kumi

230
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:24,029
and based on my neighbor, Mitsue, testimony,

231
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,229
Ryuji and I will be suspected.

232
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,229
And Pops concludes that Ms. Motoko was killed by you two

233
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:33,929
and reports this to Mr. Toriumi,

234
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,829
the scenario is completed.

235
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:41,229
We don't care if Toriumi files charges against us.

236
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:44,129
Because the corpse isn't going to be found anywhere.

237
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:46,629
Where is Ms. Kawaguchi now?

238
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,829
We have her waiting in a hideout

239
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:52,829
for us to tell her that our scheme had succeeded.

240
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,129
I understand how you all feel,

241
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:00,729
but how am I supposed to report this to my client?

242
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,329
Why don't you tell him the truth?

243
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,929
That Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi wants to cut all ties with him

244
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:14,329
to the point where she doesn't mind faking being killed.

245
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,529
So to give her up like a man and break off the engagement.

246
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,729
To persuade him to do so?

247
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:23,329
I know you can do it, Pops.

248
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,629
Mr. Mouri?

249
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,229
-Mr. Mouri! -Mr. Mouri.

250
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,029
I'll bring Haruki Toriumi here,

251
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,629
so why don't you guys directly tell him the truth.

252
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:39,029
Then, I'll give you my word,

253
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,629
that I'll convince him to give up on Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi!

254
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,029
Oh, Ms. Shigemi. Let's call Motoko.

255
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,429
Yes, we'd better let her know.

256
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,729
I wonder if she'll answer.

257
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,829
She's still not answering.

258
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,229
Still not answering?

259
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:03,429
We secretly sent her off three nights ago.

260
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,529
Don't worry. I'm sure everything will work out okay!

261
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:09,729
I'll contact you as soon as I find a hideout.

262
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:12,829
You can't get a hold of her since?

263
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:15,429
I've tried calling her several times too.

264
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:18,729
I wonder if she still haven't found a place to stay.

265
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,029
I hope she's not sick or anything.

266
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,229
-Right. -Right.

267
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,229
Maybe.

268
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,229
If so there should be some trace.

269
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,529
Dropped something again.

270
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,229
Again?

271
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,029
Early in the morning the day before yesterday,

272
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,229
there was somebody looking for something there.

273
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:44,029
It seems he couldn't find what he was looking for though.

274
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,429
What was he like?

275
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:51,729
So, something was left behind after all.

276
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,229
A cufflink.

277
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:16,029
These two killed Motoko and hid her body?

278
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:18,929
Yes, but it was a fake murder.

279
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,629
I'm turning them into the police!

280
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:23,229
That's why I just told you that it was fake murder.

281
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:25,729
Bring Motoko here then!

282
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:28,129
Well, the thing is we can't get a hold of her.

283
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,329
See! I'm calling the police after all!

284
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,229
Well, Mr. Toriumi, like I was saying...

285
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:38,729
Mr. Mouri?

286
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,829
Sleeping Kogoro?

287
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:50,829
Okay, let's try calling Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

288
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,029
-Conan! -Yes!

289
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,529
Hello, Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi?

290
00:17:58,529 --> 00:17:59,629
I'm...

291
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:00,629
It can't be.

292
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,029
It's a farce!

293
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:06,329
You're right, it's a farce.

294
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:09,629
Used to verify your reaction!

295
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:10,729
As a result,

296
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:14,929
you knew that Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi couldn't answer the phone.

297
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,129
So what?

298
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,929
You knew, didn't you?

299
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:23,029
About this schemed fake murder.

300
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:27,029
Since you suspected that Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi was scheming something,

301
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,729
three days ago you secretly followed her.

302
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:36,829
And you pressed her for what she had up her sleeve,

303
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,929
Ms. Motoko told you everything.

304
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,529
Because she wanted you to understand how cornered she was.

305
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,229
Fake murder?

306
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:49,729
After we sent her off, you met Motoko...

307
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,029
I didn't see her, nor did I follow her in the first place.

308
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,629
Conan! Bring that stuff.

309
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:55,829
Okay.

310
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:57,029
This, right?

311
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,229
I checked with your secretary

312
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:05,329
and found that this cufflink was given to you.

313
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:08,429
A specially ordered item made just for you.

314
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,329
You were looking for it on the road inside the Beika residence

315
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:15,629
early morning two days ago.

316
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,529
Did you drop something?

317
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:21,129
Which means you lost it the day before.

318
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,329
At night, three days ago!

319
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,729
In other words, you were there that night!

320
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:32,029
Your fingerprints and Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi were found on the cufflink.

321
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:35,329
That is, you had contact with each other!

322
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:40,529
It probably flew off when you tried to force Ms. Motoko into your car.

323
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,529
Then, after hearing about the scheme from Ms. Motoko,

324
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,429
you decided to use it to your advantage

325
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,729
and you murdered her!

326
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:54,929
Why would I do that?

327
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,629
I'm sure you didn't really want to marry

328
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,929
a woman who didn't like you, either.

329
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:01,629
But you were so worried about public standing

330
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:03,729
that didn't want to break off the engagement.

331
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:05,829
However, if your fiancee were killed,

332
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,729
you wouldn't have to get married.

333
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,929
Then, all I have to do is do as everyone schemed, right?

334
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:14,329
No, in your case it was not fake,

335
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,329
but you really wanted her gone from the face of this earth.

336
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:23,029
Because you never know when, how and who will realize that your fiancee

337
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:26,929
who was supposed to have been killed is alive.

338
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:29,629
You killed her with your own hands, buried and hid her,

339
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:33,229
then came to me to ask me to look for her.

340
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:35,929
You were waiting for me to report to you

341
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:38,029
after I found out from Ms. Terakado and the others about their scheme.

342
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,429
You were planning to place an anonymous call to the police.

343
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:46,829
And tell them that you witnessed something like a corpse being buried

344
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,329
to help them locate the corpse.

345
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:52,529
And if they found the corpse like you planned,

346
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:55,229
it would be concluded as a crime committed by Ms. Terakado and the others.

347
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:56,329
Wrong!

348
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,829
I met Motoko, but I left and came home right away.

349
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,329
Oh, I'll get it!

350
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:08,629
Yes...

351
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:11,129
If I say so, they'll know what it's about?

352
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,529
He got off at the Kofu junction.

353
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:21,629
I had them check on what you were doing that night!

354
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:23,429
I guess you got off at the Kofu Junction

355
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:25,829
and went on to a mountain road or something?

356
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:28,829
In order to get rid of the corpse you had in your car.

357
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,629
Where is she? Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi?

358
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,429
Where is she?

359
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,229
You're not getting away!

360
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:44,229
Where's Motoko?

361
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:45,829
Because...

362
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:48,829
Because...

363
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:54,429
If only you didn't get engaged with me...

364
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:11,729
I'll let you rest in peace like you should.

365
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:41,529
"Toriumi Conglomerate Heir Arrested" -Public standing my foot!

366
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,729
What a petty man!

367
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,029
I forgot to get paid!

368
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,329
You're just as petty as he is.

369
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:58,529
"Next Episode" -Risa Purple sure is popular, isn't she?

370
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:13,329
Did you see the guys who came down from the boat boarding area over there?

371
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:16,729
I saw them get on a red truck and go that way.

372
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,229
A red truck?

373
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:19,829
Got it!

374
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:25,129
Next Conan, "The Great Pursuit of Enraged Kogoro (Part 1)"

375

"Recycling Shop"

377
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:31,672
Pops goes public on his new technique!

378
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:32,872
He gets angry as he sleeps!

379
