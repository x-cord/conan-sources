1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:02,924
Man's voi Raita, Hatsune!

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:05,324
Congratulations to your marriage!

3
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:11,224
Oh well, even if you congratulate us now,

4
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:12,624
our wedding's tomorrow.

5
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:15,424
"Raita Banba (37), Groom" -It's not like we're married yet.

6
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:18,224
"Hatsune Kamon (37), Bride" -No big deal. Tonight's our wedding eve.

7
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:19,824
After we finish the wedding,

8
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:22,424
we're going to fly off to our honeymoon right away.

9
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:23,824
True.

10
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,524
Love birds.

11
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:26,824
How I envy you!

12
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:29,124
Hey, long time no see, Mouri.

13
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:32,024
So he's the famed detective?

14
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:36,324
Yeah, he's my bad friend in my high school day, Kogoro Mouri.

15
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:38,824
How do you do? I'm Hatsune.

16
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,324
Well, hello, hello.

17
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:43,624
Which means the two beside you are your...

18
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:46,524
I'm his daughter, Ran.

19
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:48,424
I'm freeloader, Conan.

20
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:52,024
He's staying with us temporarily.

21
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:54,724
I hear that you both fell in love at first sight.

22
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:58,324
Yeah, I felt it was destiny the instant we met.

23
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,024
It was like we finally found each other.

24
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:03,824
I mean after all, our birthdays, blood types,

25
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,524
and the environment we come from are the same.

26
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,024
Sometimes even we understand each other mutually

27
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:10,124
without saying a word too.

28
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,324
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:17,024
-Hey! -I'm sorry.

30
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:20,324
-My God! It's stuck all over my pants. -Oh, no.

31
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:22,824
You're stepping on the cake.

32
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,224
I'm really sorry.

33
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,724
This is my first day part-timing here.

34
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:27,824
Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,424
But, will you please bring a wet towel

36
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:31,624
that we can use to wipe the pants off?

37
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,024
Yes, ma'am, right away.

38
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:38,824
Hey, stop giving the eye just because that waiter's good-looking.

39
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:41,224
Are you jealous?

40
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,224
Of course not.

41
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,224
You haven't changed.

42
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:46,624
You got fast hands and you're always jealous.

43
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:47,924
Knock it off.

44
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:52,524
You used to glare at the guys who gave passes to Eri too, didn't you?

45
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:54,924
-What? -Is that true?

46
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:56,424
Good grief.

47
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,424
It's too tough keeping up with the possessiveness

48
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,524
of all the kings, don't you think?

49
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:02,224
Where are you going?

50
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:03,724
To the nail salon.

51
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:07,124
To get my nails a deco chip for my wedding.

52
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:09,724
You don't have to do something like that.

53
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:11,424
It's raining pretty hard.

54
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,924
I've got to. I've already made reservations too.

55
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:16,824
Besides, all the employees at the salon are women,

56
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:18,824
so there's no need to worry.

57
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:20,624
I told you before, but...

58
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:23,224
If you cheat on me, I'll make you pay.

59
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:26,024
That's my line.

60
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,124
Honey.

61
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,624
I'll be back in about two hours,

62
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,324
so when I do take a look at my nails, okay?

63
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:35,324
Okay.

64
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,224
She should put them on just before her wedding ceremony.

65
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,224
Because she'll be taking them off before she goes to sleep anyway.

66
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:47,524
I hear that you keep nail chips on for 24 hours straight.

67
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,224
Even when you take a bath?

68
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:50,224
Yes.

69
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:53,724
Woman really have it tough.

70
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,524
The vivid coloured memories of summer.

71
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,524
Solve mysteries all season round.

72
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:02,224
An unbelievable car explosion.

73
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,324
Attack the two on their wedding eve.

74
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:05,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,124
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,324
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:02,865
"Wedding Eve (Part 1)"

78
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:06,665
Come on, it's my last night as a bachelor,

79
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,065
so come on be nice to me, will you?

80
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,765
Really, Banba...

81
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:12,565
Your wife's going to get at you, you know?

82
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,965
Good grief,

83
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,865
he's already got himself a beautiful wife and yet...

84
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,565
Really, he's just like somebody I know excuse me, sir.

85
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,365
Excuse me.

86
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,865
You again?

87
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:29,865
What is it now?

88
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,365
Your phone's been ringing repeatedly from a while ago.

89
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,765
If you will excuse me, then...

90
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:34,765
Yeah.

91
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:38,665
It's a mail from Hatsune.

92
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:40,765
You're not answering the phone,

93
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,265
so I'm sending you a picture of it.

94
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,965
You'll get to see the real thing in 30 minutes.

95
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,365
What's with you? You're lovey-dovey!

96
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,565
-Well, sort of... -Well, thanks a lot.

97
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,265
Sorry, I gotta go to the john.

98
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,665
-Bye. -Bye.

99
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:57,065
A second cell phone?

100
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,465
He's talking to somebody wearing a dreadful look.

101
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,065
He hung up right away.

102
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,565
And, he's going straight to the john...

103
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:12,665
Which means that the person he's talking to is in the toilet.

104
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,965
What's the matter, Conan?

105
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,565
Did you see anyone you know?

106
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:18,865
No, it's nothing.

107
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,365
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

108
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:26,065
"Sanji Haruoka (48), Customer"

109
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:27,265
Don't tell me...

110
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,865
that guy was on the other end of the line?

111
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:30,865
Waiter!

112
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,265
Yes.

113
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,765
Thank you for waiting.

114
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,565
Bourbon on the rocks.

115
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,165
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,965
Be careful, idiot!

117
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,565
I... I'm sorry.

118
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:45,765
Banba, you're drinking too much.

119
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,565
I'm fine. Fine.

120
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:51,265
-Hey, waiter. -Yes?

121
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,565
Do you remember what I ordered?

122
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,065
Yes, Bourbon on the rocks, right?

123
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,465
Okay. You got it right.

124
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,465
Then...

125
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:04,365
Banba, what's that scary look on your face for?

126
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:07,165
It's nothing.

127
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:12,565
This party is like a reunion to you too, isn't it, Pops?

128
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,765
Yeah, it seems that the bride-to-be had her wedding party

129
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,565
on a different day so...

130
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,465
Mom couldn't come because of work, though.

131
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:24,865
Then, is that man wearing sunglasses also your classmate?

132
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,165
I don't remember.

133
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,565
I mean, it's already been 20 years, after all.

134
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,565
Hello.

135
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:50,065
Yes, that's right.

136
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:51,465
Yes.

137
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,965
Yes, and?

138
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:55,765
Yes, yes.

139
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,565
Hey, just what're you doing?

140
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,865
Oh, well...

141
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:08,365
This guest suddenly started to punch me.

142
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:09,765
Are you all right?

143
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:10,965
Don't touch me!

144
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,365
Banba.

145
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:15,465
You drank too much.

146
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:18,365
-Your hand is bleeding. -It's no darn big deal.

147
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,765
No big deal... Hey, you should get it treated.

148
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:23,065
Banba, are you listening, or what?

149
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:27,765
The only one I need to talk to now is Hatsune.

150
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:29,765
Hey, Hatsune?

151
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:30,965
Where are you now?

152
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,565
Goodbye?

153
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,265
What're you talking about, Hatsune?

154
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,465
Hey, Hatsune?

155
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,965
Hatsune? Where are you now?

156
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:46,865
Don't tell me... that the car is Hatsune's.

157
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:48,165
-What? -Oh, no.

158
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,865
Ran, call the fire department, the ambulance and the police!

159
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:51,865
Okay!

160
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,565
-Store manager! Where's the fire extinguisher? -Hatsune.

161
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:54,665
-Yes, it's here! -Hatsune.

162
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:56,465
-Okay! It's dangerous... -Hatsune.

163
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:57,765
-so don't let anyone out of the restaurant! -Are you all right?

164
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:58,965
-Yes, sir! -Hatsune!

165
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,065
"Hatsune Kamon"

166
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:07,765
Hatsune!

167
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,765
The body is burnt black

168
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:16,465
and we're having the dental records for a match right now.

169
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,265
It is highly probable that the victim is...

170
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:22,365
the owner of this car, Ms. Hatsune Kamon.

171
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,165
Is it true that a phone call was received

172
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,765
from Ms. Kamon just before the car burned

173
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,865
hinting that she may be wanting to commit suicide?

174
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,765
-Yes. -Inspector.

175
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:35,865
There are two large travel suitcases in the trunk.

176
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:40,465
They were probably getting ready to go on a honeymoon.

177
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,865
Because the woman who passed away was supposed to get married

178
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,965
to my old friend tomorrow.

179
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:49,665
But, why would such a happy person commit suicide?

180
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,065
I wonder...

181
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:53,965
Maybe she had what you call the marriage blues or something?

182
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,665
Officer Takagi.

183
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,665
-Hey! Not you again! -Come, come.

184
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,865
What is it, Conan?

185
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,665
This is a fake nail, isn't it?

186
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:07,065
True. But why would it be in a place like this?

187
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,565
Ms. Kamon left the party

188
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,465
saying that she was going to a nail salon

189
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,365
about two hours ago.

190
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:14,365
What?

191
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:20,265
Maybe it's better not to conclude that she committed suicide yet.

192
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,365
What? A murder?

193
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,865
You mean it's not suicide?

194
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:26,865
Yeah.

195
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:28,065
Although very slight,

196
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:32,165
there was skin stuck on the tip of the fake nail that Conan found.

197
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,465
I hear that she just got those fake nails put on her just a while ago.

198
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:36,865
Which means that it is highly likely

199
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,565
that the skin on the fake nail is of the culprit

200
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:42,365
that she fought with near the car.

201
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:44,965
Who on earth...

202
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,465
Who could've killed Hatsune?

203
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:50,165
You're Raita Banba,

204
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:52,465
who was married to Ms. Kamon, aren't you?

205
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:54,365
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:57,165
Where did you hurt your hand?

207
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:58,465
I... I hurt myself a while ago when I fell

208
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:01,265
and cut myself with the shattered piece of the cracked glass cup.

209
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:05,765
Then, does this hairbrush look familiar to you?

210
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,065
Yeah, that's mine.

211
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:11,365
I had it in my travel suitcase, though.

212
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:14,665
Yes, it was in your suitcase

213
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:17,865
that was in the trunk of the car that burned.

214
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:20,465
Just in case we checked the DNA from he hair we gathered from this brush

215
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,765
and as a result found a match.

216
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,765
It almost matched the DNA of the skin

217
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:29,365
that was found on the tip of her fake nail.

218
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:31,365
What?

219
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,465
Just what are you talking about?

220
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,465
Are you saying that I'm the culprit or what?

221
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:41,465
Oh, no...

222
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:44,365
Because it's still not a perfect match.

223
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,465
If possible we would like to get your approval

224
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:48,665
to perform a more accurate test.

225
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,065
You must be joking!

226
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:51,765
Cool it, Banba.

227
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:53,365
You didn't do it, right?

228
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,765
-Of course not. -But...

229
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,065
It's thinkable that she scratched him trying to resist his attack,

230
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,765
and in order to hide the wound that he got then,

231
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:02,765
he could've deliberately punched me

232
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,465
to make it look like he hurt himself then, right?

233
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:06,665
Why, how dare you?

234
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,365
Look who's talking.

235
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,165
I'll bet you killed your dear darling

236
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,165
before she fell into the arms of someone else,

237
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,765
didn't you, Mr. waiter?

238
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,665
Hey, hold it.

239
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:19,365
What is this about?

240
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:20,965
If you're not going to say it yourself,

241
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,065
I'll say it for you.

242
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:26,465
He's Hatsune's lover

243
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,865
and they've been seeing each other secretly!

244
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,065
What?

245
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:31,265
Is that true?

246
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,865
How about it?

247
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,165
Of course I've been seeing her.

248
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,465
After all, I was hired by her.

249
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:42,365
I'm a private eye.

250
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,765
"Tohru Amuro (29)" -A detective.

251
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,265
Detective?

252
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,215
A detective.

253
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:01,115
Isn't it strange?

254
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,015
Why would a detective that is hired by Hatsune

255
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,915
coincidentally be working at a restaurant that Hatsune and I

256
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:08,415
are holding our wedding party?

257
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,315
It's not a coincidence.

258
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:14,815
I had her choose this restaurant to hold the wedding party

259
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,715
after I got hired to work here part-time.

260
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,815
But, why on earth?

261
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:23,915
Of course to keep an eye on your actions.

262
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:25,315
To keep an eye on me?

263
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:28,315
Yes, that's what Hatsune asked me to do.

264
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:29,915
She wanted me to check if you,

265
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,715
who had a habit of flirting had any other lover

266
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,315
and wanted me to keep an eye on you.

267
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:37,515
That's why I deliberately smeared your pants with the cake.

268
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,815
So that no other women would approach you.

269
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:44,815
Even if I wanted to prove that she had asked me to do all this,

270
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:48,315
since Hatsune seems to have burned to death

271
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:50,415
in the parking lot of this restaurant.

272
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:54,415
However the fact that I was hired by her,

273
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:55,915
can probably be proven

274
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,415
by that man wearing sunglasses over there, correct?

275
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,015
It seems that he was around when I was reporting

276
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:05,115
what I found out about Mr. Banba's surrounding to Hatsune.

277
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:07,115
Who on earth are you?

278
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:08,115
Well...

279
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,015
He's probably a detective too.

280
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,415
A detective?

281
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:16,415
The one who hired him is the groom, Mr. Banba.

282
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:19,115
He probably asked him to check on Hatsune

283
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,515
because she seems to be going with somebody recently.

284
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:24,515
Although he was able to catch her secretly meeting someone,

285
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,115
since the guy she was seeing was wearing a cap and a hood,

286
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,815
he couldn't figure out what the man looked like.

287
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:31,815
But since the voice of the of the man

288
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:34,215
that he heard then sounded like that of the waiter,

289
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,715
he called me to the table to place his order.

290
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:39,515
After confirming my voice matched that of the man,

291
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:41,715
he probably sent a signal to Mr. Banba

292
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,015
that the man and I were one and the same.

293
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,615
He called Mr. Banba on the cell phone

294
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:49,515
and got him to come to the men's room,

295
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,115
to tell him that the man in question

296
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,915
is probably in this restaurant so he would check from now.

297
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,015
Isn't that right?

298
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:58,315
Yeah, that's right.

299
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,715
I had no idea that you were a detective.

300
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:04,615
You got away each time I tailed you too, so...

301
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,315
But, Mr. Banba,

302
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,515
did you still want to marry her

303
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:13,215
knowing that she was going out with some mysterious man?

304
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:15,315
I think it's more natural to go ask her yourself, no?

305
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,715
The detective told me

306
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,915
that she hasn't been seeing the guy after that secret meeting,

307
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:23,815
and besides, I thought that she'd hate me if she found out

308
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:26,415
that I hired a detective to check on her.

309
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,915
We were so close that even disclosed to each other

310
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,115
that we were both foster children too so...

311
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,615
So, that's what Mr. Banba meant

312
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,815
when he said they came from the same surroundings...

313
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:35,515
If you hired me,

314
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,015
I would've seen through immediately that this slip of a boy

315
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:39,415
was a detective right away.

316
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,015
How could I have asked you!

317
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:43,415
You're famous and everybody knows what you look like.

318
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:46,515
And besides, I was going to introduce you to her later anyway.

319
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:49,115
But, if you let me handle it,

320
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,715
maybe she wouldn't have committed suicide either.

321
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:56,315
Maybe she set fire to the car she was inside

322
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,315
because this guy kept reporting to her

323
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,115
on the phone about all the misconduct

324
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:01,615
we were displaying at this restaurant.

325
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,415
I... I made no such phone call to her.

326
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:08,015
Besides, he was drunk and just frolicking,

327
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,915
so even if I did report all of that on the phone,

328
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,515
it's unthinkable that it would lead her to commit suicide.

329
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:13,215
Talking of phone calls...

330
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:18,715
Mr. Banba, you called her just before the car caught fire

331
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:22,215
and received a message hinting that she would be committing suicide.

332
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,215
Yes, she was crying as she said "Goodbye".

333
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,915
I see.

334
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:28,315
If you doubt me...

335
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:32,115
See, tonight at 8:54 pm.

336
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,015
The call history is right here, isn't it?

337
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,315
Please let me take a look at it.

338
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:39,015
What time did you contact the police?

339
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:42,615
Well... 9:21 pm.

340
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:45,315
There seems to be close to a 30 minute time difference.

341
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,615
How should I know!

342
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,215
That...

343
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,415
I'm the one who made the call.

344
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,015
It took me some time because I was making calls for an ambulance

345
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,815
and to the fire department too.

346
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:58,315
But, by the time the ambulance and all got here,

347
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,115
it seems that it was burning so bad

348
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:02,415
that much couldn't be done at that point already.

349
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:04,815
But, isn't it strange?

350
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,515
Normally the place where people get into the car

351
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,815
is made with burn proof materials,

352
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:11,815
and yet, why was it burned so badly?

353
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:12,915
That's true.

354
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,215
It seems to have exploded on and off too.

355
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:18,215
Oh, it's because of the spray can.

356
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,415
There were a lot of spray cans and paper

357
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,715
in the car and those things caught fire, that's why.

358
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,915
Why were things like that in the car?

359
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:30,515
We were going to spray the car placing a pattern on it

360
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:33,315
and decorate the car after the party.

361
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:34,915
We were going to go to the wedding hall

362
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,215
in the car that we decorated

363
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:39,815
and surprise everybody.

364
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:42,215
If you think I'm lying look at my mail.

365
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:46,015
I received mail from her that she got all the stuff together.

366
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:52,715
You seemed to have received mail from her at 8:18 pm

367
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:54,915
saying that she'd be returning in 30 minutes.

368
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:59,515
Yes. She sent me a photo mail from the nail salon.

369
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:01,415
Which means...

370
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:05,615
That you knew she had a lot of easily burnable items in her car

371
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:10,815
as well as the time she would be coming back to this restaurant, no?

372
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:14,115
Hey.

373
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:15,915
What the heck are you getting at?

374
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:19,315
In other words, you could've secretly left the restaurant,

375
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,315
ambush her at the parking lot pass her out,

376
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:26,015
shove her into the car, set fire to it and burn her to death!

377
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,415
Hey, hey, hey.

378
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,615
Moreover, near the car,

379
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:33,615
the fake nail that she just got put on this evening was found,

380
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,315
and on the tip of that fake nail,

381
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,415
a tiny portion of skin was found.

382
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,815
Hey...

383
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:41,915
From the circumstances, it's most likely

384
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:44,415
that this skin adhered to the tip of the nail

385
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,615
when she resisted by scratching when she was attacked.

386
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:51,615
The DNA of that skin virtually matched the DNA that was collected

387
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:54,815
from the hair of your hairbrush.

388
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:58,415
But, it wasn't a perfect match, was it?

389
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,815
Hey! You tell him something too, Mouri!

390
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,715
"Virtually" I think means...

391
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:06,015
that the skin that was found on the fake nail

392
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:08,215
was contaminated by rain and dirt,

393
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,715
therefore, a perfect data couldn't be taken.

394
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,015
Unless you're blood-related,

395
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:15,515
a perfect match of the genome genetic information

396
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:16,915
is virtually impossible.

397
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,215
Taking this into consideration...

398
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:22,815
It's more natural to think that the DNA...

399
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:25,615
is one of the same person.

400
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,815
Why you?

401
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,915
No violence please.

402
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,715
Mr. Mouri, please stop him.

403
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,515
I don't want him punching me again.

404
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,915
It's not necessary.

405
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:41,915
-Darn. -Hey, Banba, cool it.

406
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,415
It hasn't been concluded yet

407
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:47,015
that the hair on your hairbrush is yours yet.

408
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:49,115
Why don't you let them check your DNA

409
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:51,015
and get accurate test results.

410
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,115
-Just as I thought. -They're just going to get some DNA sample

411
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,015
-If I remember correctly... -from your mouth and check it.

412
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,915
Then, how did he...

413
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:58,115
Okay, then, Mr. Banba.

414
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:03,015
You agree to take the DNA test, correct?

415
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:04,015
Yeah.

416
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:05,515
Please come this way then.

417
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,215
But,

418
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,815
DNA test is really something, isn't it?

419
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:19,015
In the past, all we could get from saliva was the blood type and yet,

420
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:22,015
today you can tell who it really belongs to.

421
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,615
Yes, I guess so.

422
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:26,415
Then, you'd be able to disclose

423
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:28,215
the real identity of anyone under disguise.

424
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,415
Yes, I guess so.

425
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:36,515
Everything will come to light after the results are out but...

426
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:38,715
If he were to be the culprit,

427
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,515
why would something like that be left behind?

428
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:44,115
Or, is there some trick involved here?

429
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:48,715
If so, why doesn't he say anything about it?

430
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:14,215
Inspector Megure.

431
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:18,215
There's one door at the back of this restaurant

432
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:21,015
that leads to the parking lot.

433
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:25,115
But, since it was raining hard when the incident occurred,

434
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,115
that door seemed to have been locked.

435
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,615
Which means in order to get out of the restaurant,

436
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:31,815
there was no other way than to go through the front entrance?

437
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:32,915
Yes.

438
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:37,115
But if so, I'm sure that one of the guests would've remembered.

439
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:39,615
Are there no other way in and out of the restaurant?

440
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:42,715
You could try to make it out of the window of the toilet.

441
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,215
But, outside the window the road is not paved

442
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:47,515
and there's a big puddle,

443
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:48,915
so if anyone did pass through here,

444
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:53,215
there should be some traces of footprints left behind.

445
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:57,115
At the time of the incident, it seems to have been windy,

446
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:59,615
because Hatsune's umbrella was found

447
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:02,315
blown to the very end of the parking lot.

448
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:03,815
Wind?

449
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,215
Come to think of it,

450
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:08,715
when we got to this restaurant it was pretty windy.

451
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:13,915
And? Do you detectives have anything that comes to mind?

452
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:15,215
Not in particular.

453
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:18,415
When I told him that she was secretly seeing some other man,

454
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:20,415
he was quite out of sorts

455
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,415
but recently it seems that he was more concerned

456
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:26,115
about the fact that she was secretly talking to somebody over the phone.

457
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:30,315
Well, but she was only probably contacting this guy.

458
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:35,115
Oh, no. I contacted her only by mail.

459
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:36,915
The only time I met her outside was just once,

460
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,715
the time you saw her with me.

461
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:43,215
Only there was just one time when her face clouded.

462
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,915
-Her face clouded? -Yes.

463
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:47,615
I'm a detective so,

464
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:50,915
I was checking in detail on Banba.

465
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:54,215
Then I found out about something.

466
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,815
Found out about something?

467
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:59,815
He and Hatsune were both rescued from a hotel fire.

468
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,015
Although both their identities weren't known,

469
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:04,715
they were raised in the same church.

470
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,815
Which means that...

471
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:14,415
You who mistook me, a detective that was hired by Hatsune,

472
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:16,915
for her lover,

473
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,115
shoved her into the car and burned her to death.

474
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:21,915
Why you...

475
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:25,415
If so, you're not the culprit.

476
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:28,115
If it's just as I've deducted...

477
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:32,015
the sad truth that you didn't want to know about

478
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:34,015
will be exposed in broad daylight.

479
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,615
Next Conan,

480
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:39,515
"Wedding Eve (Part 2)".

481
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:57,715
Next Conan's Hint:

482
00:24:57,715 --> 00:24:59,515
"Cake".

483
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:00,615
Three detectives let's be selective.

484
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:01,915
What a goofy rhyme.

485
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:02,915
That's an old gag.

486
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,315
Good grief.
