1
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.970
We all end up going to the ramen shop

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.970
that MA frequents after school

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.870
since seeing the special program on ramen the day before.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.570
There, we run into Ms. Yuna Shono,

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.570
Mr. Sosuke Mizushina

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.070
and Mr. Osamu Nakanishi.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
They were all a bit odd in that they each used

8
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.970
a lot of seasoning such as vinegar, soy sauce and pepper.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.070
As the three leave the shop, in turn,

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.570
lady cop Yumi Miyamoto and Naeko Miike come bursting into the shop.

11
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.970
According to them, the threesome were suspects of a murder case

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.670
that occurred in the neighborhood.

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.870
A week ago when we were patrolling this area...

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.270
Hey, you over there!

15
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.870
What're you doing?

16
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.370
Hold it!

17
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.770
So, I quickly went around with the car and waited.

18
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.870
But only Yumi showed up.

19
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.070
It seems that they had a get together of all the shops that day

20
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.770
that almost all the lights of the shops were out, with no passersby.

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.970
And the only place open was

22
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.270
this "Ogura Ramen Good Enough to Die For"!

23
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.770
Then, isn't the last person who came rushing in here the perp?

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.970
The thing is

25
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.970
the three came at about the same time like they did today.

26
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.470
From the time the three came, till the two lady cops came,

27
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.170
quite some time had gone by.

28
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.470
What? Didn't you run after the perp, Yumi?

29
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.270
Well, Yumi seems to have fell while she was chasing the perp.

30
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.070
I fell because of the hose!

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.370
Hose?

32
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.470
The perp threw it at me while I was chasing him!

33
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370
We thought it was the murder weapon at first.

34
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.670
What made you think it was the murder weapon?

35
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.770
The lady was bleeding from her head and died, right?

36
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.470
When we first saw the perp,

37
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.470
he was spinning the hose around

38
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.370
in front of the front door of the victim's house with all his might!

39
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.570
Spinning the hose...

40
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.370
With all his might?

41
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.870
Talk about remembering...

42
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.470
On the day and time of the incident that day,

43
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.270
there was another person.

44
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.570
Another customer...

45
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.970
Was here?

46
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.470
A canvas stained black with crime.

47
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.070
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

48
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.970
Another dangerous customer?

49
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.170
Find the perp that is spinning the hose.

50
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.770
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.270
His name is Detective Conan!

53
00:04:25.128 --> 00:04:30.728
"Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 2)"

54
00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:34.328
Wait!

55
00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:38.028
That day, when we came running into this shop,

56
00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:41.228
only the three that was here awhile ago was here, right?

57
00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:42.628
That's right.

58
00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:45.428
Because that customer finished up his ramen

59
00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:48.128
a minute before the three came in and left.

60
00:04:48.128 --> 00:04:51.028
Yumi's boyfriend!

61
00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:54.128
The ramen here is the best after all!

62
00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:56.628
-What? Haneda Meijin? -What? Haneda Meijin?

63
00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:00.328
But that can't be!

64
00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:02.128
Because like I just said.

65
00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:06.328
Back then, Yumi and I flanked the perp that fled

66
00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:08.828
along the street in front of this shop!

67
00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:11.228
We cornered him into this shop!

68
00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:15.728
If her boyfriend went out just before the perp came into this shop,

69
00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:18.528
either Yumi or I would've seen him!

70
00:05:18.528 --> 00:05:20.028
Right?

71
00:05:25.528 --> 00:05:27.328
The thing is...

72
00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:31.028
What? Back then, you ran into him on this street?

73
00:05:34.028 --> 00:05:37.428
It was while you were chasing the perp, right?

74
00:05:37.428 --> 00:05:39.528
Yes, I guess.

75
00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:42.528
When I tripped after the perp threw the hose at me,

76
00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:45.428
he came running over to me.

77
00:05:48.028 --> 00:05:50.928
Are you okay?

78
00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:52.228
Chukichi?

79
00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:53.728
Yumi?

80
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.328
What're you doing here?

81
00:05:56.328 --> 00:05:57.628
What about you, Yumi?

82
00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:00.228
I'm chasing after a suspicious guy!

83
00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:02.428
Didn't you pass him?

84
00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:05.228
Yes, a while ago. But it was dark,

85
00:06:05.228 --> 00:06:08.628
so all I heard were footsteps and saw a silhouette.

86
00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:10.028
A silhouette, huh?

87
00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:13.428
And he threw something like masking tape and left.

88
00:06:14.928 --> 00:06:17.228
Masking tape?

89
00:06:17.228 --> 00:06:20.728
Either way, it's dangerous here, so go home, Chukichi!

90
00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:22.928
I'll give you the details later!

91
00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:28.628
I haven't contacted him since.

92
00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:31.028
Because the case isn't closed yet.

93
00:06:32.528 --> 00:06:34.528
I see. I was wondering why you took so long,

94
00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.728
when all you did was trip.

95
00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:38.228
You should've told me.

96
00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:42.128
I'm sorry. Back then, he wasn't out of breath at all

97
00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:44.428
so I knew he wasn't the perp.

98
00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:47.328
And I didn't want to get him involved.

99
00:06:47.328 --> 00:06:51.128
But no matter if he wasn't out of breath...

100
00:06:51.128 --> 00:06:52.828
-What? -Yeah, I guess so.

101
00:06:52.828 --> 00:06:58.128
Letting him go without doing anything isn't police like.

102
00:06:58.128 --> 00:07:00.728
But...

103
00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:03.328
If he was eating ramen here up

104
00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.228
until just before the incident happened,

105
00:07:05.228 --> 00:07:07.728
Chukichi is completely innocent!

106
00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.628
Right.

107
00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:12.928
Come to think of it, your boyfriend's name is Chukichi?

108
00:07:12.928 --> 00:07:14.728
He's my ex-boyfriend, though.

109
00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.428
Then, why don't you try calling him?

110
00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:20.128
He's got good memory, right? Your boyfriend.

111
00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:21.528
My ex-boyfriend.

112
00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:24.228
Okay then.

113
00:07:24.228 --> 00:07:26.728
I guess I'll try calling my big brother too, then.

114
00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:29.628
After all, he's the one who told me about this shop.

115
00:07:29.628 --> 00:07:32.328
So, he may have seen the three.

116
00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:33.328
Yeah.

117
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.628
Maybe we'll figure out who the perp is

118
00:07:35.628 --> 00:07:37.428
just by asking on the phone.

119
00:07:37.428 --> 00:07:38.428
No way.

120
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:42.928
Hello, Yumi.

121
00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:47.428
I'm sorry about last time that I turned you down for a date.

122
00:07:47.428 --> 00:07:49.228
I don't know why but I happen to come up

123
00:07:49.228 --> 00:07:51.028
with urgent business on your day off.

124
00:07:51.028 --> 00:07:53.428
Never mind that.

125
00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:54.728
But, do you remember?

126
00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:58.928
A week ago when I was chasing a suspicious person and tripped partway,

127
00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.528
the time I ran into you.

128
00:08:01.528 --> 00:08:04.028
Sorry, it's call waiting. Hang on.

129
00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:08.128
-Big brother. -Gosh.

130
00:08:08.128 --> 00:08:11.428
What? You're talking to someone important now so call you back?

131
00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:12.428
Hey, wait!

132
00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:15.228
What? Are you done with your call?

133
00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.728
Who was it?

134
00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:20.028
-Don't tell me you found a new girl? -No!

135
00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:22.628
Darn it. He hung up on me.

136
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:25.328
Their conversation's weirdly synchronized.

137
00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:26.628
Well, whatever.

138
00:08:26.628 --> 00:08:30.628
And about the guy you passed...

139
00:08:30.628 --> 00:08:32.928
Is there anything you haven't told me?

140
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:36.028
Anything I haven't told you?

141
00:08:36.028 --> 00:08:37.328
Come to think of it,

142
00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:40.828
he made a strange sound each time he ran.

143
00:08:40.828 --> 00:08:42.528
Like click-click.

144
00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:46.528
What? He made a strange sound "click click" each time he ran?

145
00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:51.128
Not click-click, but click click?

146
00:08:51.128 --> 00:08:54.328
Not click-click, but click click...

147
00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:57.128
Each time he ran?

148
00:08:57.128 --> 00:08:58.828
I see.

149
00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:01.828
In order to pick that up, the perp...

150
00:09:01.828 --> 00:09:04.828
When you checked inside the shop,

151
00:09:04.828 --> 00:09:06.828
did you check inside the restroom, too?

152
00:09:06.828 --> 00:09:08.528
Of course, we did.

153
00:09:08.528 --> 00:09:10.328
Inside the water tank, too?

154
00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:11.828
We took a quick look,

155
00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:14.528
but there was no accessory or anything like that.

156
00:09:17.528 --> 00:09:18.728
What?

157
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:22.528
-Masumi? -Conan?

158
00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:25.528
Hey.

159
00:09:31.228 --> 00:09:32.728
I see.

160
00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:35.928
That's why the perp was spinning the hose around.

161
00:09:35.928 --> 00:09:39.128
In order not to leave this back at the scene,

162
00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:42.928
and the fact that the perp is still continuing to come to this shop means...

163
00:09:44.028 --> 00:09:46.828
He hasn't retrieved it yet.

164
00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:50.428
The treasure worth several million yen.

165
00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:01.794
"The following day"

166
00:10:06.194 --> 00:10:08.294
-Hello, welcome! -Hello!

167
00:10:08.294 --> 00:10:09.994
Thank you for your patronage!

168
00:10:09.994 --> 00:10:12.094
There are no other customers today.

169
00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:16.594
Until just a while ago, there was a group of people here, though.

170
00:10:16.594 --> 00:10:18.394
Really?

171
00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:29.294
Hello!

172
00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:30.994
I've come again today, boss!

173
00:10:30.994 --> 00:10:34.294
Hey. You're here with the kid today, Mari?

174
00:10:34.294 --> 00:10:37.394
My name's Masumi.

175
00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:39.494
Boss, may I order?

176
00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:40.494
Yeah!

177
00:10:40.494 --> 00:10:45.594
I want pot sticks, shumai, spring rolls and small rice.

178
00:10:45.594 --> 00:10:48.494
Oh, come on! No ramen again today?

179
00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:50.494
Have you gotten tired of it?

180
00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:53.694
No, it's not that.

181
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:57.294
All you ever ate was the Great King Yama ramen and yet.

182
00:10:57.294 --> 00:10:59.294
Really?

183
00:10:59.294 --> 00:11:03.894
But then, why'd you sit in that seat?

184
00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:05.194
Huh?

185
00:11:05.194 --> 00:11:08.794
See, there's only a little bit of shoyu.

186
00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:11.894
It'll run out right away, won't it?

187
00:11:11.894 --> 00:11:15.294
Because with pot sticks, shumai and spring rolls...

188
00:11:15.294 --> 00:11:17.294
You need shoyu, right?

189
00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:19.694
You were using a lot of shoyu yesterday, too.

190
00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:21.194
And since you ran out of shoyu,

191
00:11:21.194 --> 00:11:23.594
you used another bottle of shoyu.

192
00:11:23.594 --> 00:11:25.494
Well...

193
00:11:25.494 --> 00:11:28.694
Besides, before we came here,

194
00:11:28.694 --> 00:11:31.494
there were no other customers, right?

195
00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:33.294
And yet, why did you sit where there was

196
00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:35.194
only a little shoyu left in the bottle?

197
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.494
Why?

198
00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:38.694
Well...

199
00:11:38.694 --> 00:11:44.194
No matter if you ordered a lot of dishes that use shoyu,

200
00:11:44.194 --> 00:11:46.394
nobody would check out the amount of shoyu

201
00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:48.594
left in the bottle before sitting down.

202
00:11:48.594 --> 00:11:52.294
He probably just happened to sit there.

203
00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:53.694
Yeah.

204
00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:55.994
It's not like popsicle where you'd find a prize

205
00:11:55.994 --> 00:12:00.994
at the bottom of the bottle after it's empty.

206
00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:02.394
Right?

207
00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:09.694
Boss! I'd like a large serving of King Yama ramen

208
00:12:09.694 --> 00:12:11.194
and pot sticks with fried rice.

209
00:12:11.194 --> 00:12:12.894
Hey, Sato...

210
00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:16.194
Satoko, you'll get fat eating so much.

211
00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.894
I'll be fine, Taka... o!

212
00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:23.794
Because I'm planning to have quite a work-out tonight.

213
00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:32.694
Come to think of it, do you know?

214
00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:36.594
About the murder that happened around here a week ago!

215
00:12:36.594 --> 00:12:39.194
What? No, I don't.

216
00:12:39.194 --> 00:12:43.294
Something about a lady forgot something and went back home to get it,

217
00:12:43.294 --> 00:12:45.194
when she came face to face with a burglar?

218
00:12:45.194 --> 00:12:47.794
She was knocked down by the burglar who fled,

219
00:12:47.794 --> 00:12:52.394
hit her head strongly on the stairs by the front entrance and died.

220
00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:55.894
But instead of fleeing the scene right away,

221
00:12:55.894 --> 00:13:01.194
that burglar kept spinning a hose of about 2 meters around.

222
00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:03.294
Don't you think that's creepy?

223
00:13:03.294 --> 00:13:05.294
Seriously? This is terrible!

224
00:13:05.294 --> 00:13:07.294
I'm scared!

225
00:13:08.794 --> 00:13:12.794
Wasn't that hose that he was spinning around

226
00:13:12.794 --> 00:13:15.494
have something stuck to the tip of it?

227
00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:18.594
Yeah. According to the police,

228
00:13:18.594 --> 00:13:20.494
there seem to have been traces of masking tape

229
00:13:20.494 --> 00:13:22.994
being stuck on to the tip of one side of the hose,

230
00:13:22.994 --> 00:13:26.294
so something could've gotten stuck to it.

231
00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:28.494
If so, what?

232
00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:32.694
If the thing that was stuck to the tip of the hose was a breathable fabric

233
00:13:32.694 --> 00:13:36.594
and if the tip with the fabric on it was swung above the head,

234
00:13:36.594 --> 00:13:39.094
it'll work like a vacuum cleaner!

235
00:13:39.094 --> 00:13:44.494
The centrifugal force forces the air inside the hose out,

236
00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:46.394
and an amount equaled to the air forced out,

237
00:13:46.394 --> 00:13:49.694
is sucked in through the other end.

238
00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:52.594
They did a similar experiment on TV the other day,

239
00:13:52.594 --> 00:13:55.094
so maybe the perp saw it, too?

240
00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:57.094
Really?

241
00:13:57.094 --> 00:13:59.794
But, what kind of fabric is breathable?

242
00:13:59.794 --> 00:14:01.094
Beats me.

243
00:14:01.094 --> 00:14:04.094
It seems that the hose of that house was used,

244
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.194
so it may have been something that was there,

245
00:14:06.194 --> 00:14:10.094
or maybe something that the perp had on hand.

246
00:14:10.094 --> 00:14:15.094
The cloth of a handkerchief would be too fine to serve as a filter.

247
00:14:15.094 --> 00:14:16.994
What could it be?

248
00:14:16.994 --> 00:14:20.894
Something that lets air through but doesn't have large holes?

249
00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:24.394
Maybe a mask?

250
00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:27.094
Because you can breathe when wearing it,

251
00:14:27.094 --> 00:14:29.794
but it doesn't let dust through, right?

252
00:14:29.794 --> 00:14:31.594
Yeah!

253
00:14:31.594 --> 00:14:34.394
Right! And talking of masks...

254
00:14:34.394 --> 00:14:39.394
On the day of the incident, you had one too, right, sir? A mask.

255
00:14:39.394 --> 00:14:42.094
That day, I sort of had a cold, so...

256
00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:47.194
But I wonder what it was that the perp had to suck up

257
00:14:47.194 --> 00:14:49.894
with a vacuum even before thinking of fleeing.

258
00:14:49.894 --> 00:14:54.194
That's right. The lady cop that told me about this said

259
00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:57.294
there was a person who passed that burglar,

260
00:14:57.294 --> 00:14:59.394
and at that time, he heard a strange sound.

261
00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:01.394
-Sound? -Yeah.

262
00:15:01.394 --> 00:15:04.794
It seems that the burglar was making a click-click sound

263
00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:07.094
with ever step he took.

264
00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:09.494
Click click...

265
00:15:09.494 --> 00:15:13.494
Maybe something was stuck to one of his shoes?

266
00:15:13.594 --> 00:15:17.594
Right. Maybe he stepped on something that was hard

267
00:15:17.594 --> 00:15:19.994
and poked into the sole of his shoe.

268
00:15:19.994 --> 00:15:23.294
But what? What did he step on?

269
00:15:23.294 --> 00:15:26.294
It's something more important than fleeing, right?

270
00:15:26.294 --> 00:15:30.194
Maybe it was glasses.

271
00:15:30.194 --> 00:15:33.294
If you step on it, the lens will crack, right?

272
00:15:33.294 --> 00:15:34.794
I'm sure that's it!

273
00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:37.594
Maybe the perp dropped and stepped on his glasses

274
00:15:37.594 --> 00:15:40.294
when he got into a struggle with the woman.

275
00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:41.994
That's why even before he fled,

276
00:15:41.994 --> 00:15:44.094
he tried to retrieve the cracked pieces of his glasses lens

277
00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:47.194
with the hose vacuum cleaner.

278
00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:48.894
Because even a small piece

279
00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:50.994
can give away what kind of lens it was,

280
00:15:50.994 --> 00:15:53.994
what degree the lens was, and who bought the lens!

281
00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:57.094
The police are really something!

282
00:15:57.094 --> 00:16:00.194
Bo...

283
00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:03.994
Boss! I was wearing my glasses that day, weren't I?

284
00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:07.094
Huh? Yeah, you were.

285
00:16:07.094 --> 00:16:13.294
But back then, you had your glasses case with you, right?

286
00:16:13.294 --> 00:16:16.594
Is anything wrong with that?

287
00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:19.094
Conan, do you have a glasses case?

288
00:16:19.094 --> 00:16:20.494
No, I don't!

289
00:16:20.494 --> 00:16:23.294
I have my glasses on all the time, so I don't need a case.

290
00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:25.694
People who carry cases are people who use

291
00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.794
both far-sighted and near-sighted glasses.

292
00:16:27.794 --> 00:16:32.394
Or somebody who just bought new glasses.

293
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.594
Sometimes, the lens of new glasses are too strong

294
00:16:37.594 --> 00:16:38.894
and can make you dizzy.

295
00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:41.094
So I hear that they are people who carry around their old glasses

296
00:16:41.094 --> 00:16:43.494
until they get used to the new glasses.

297
00:16:43.494 --> 00:16:46.494
Oh, yeah. And what about those new glasses?

298
00:16:46.494 --> 00:16:49.294
What? Oh, my new glasses?

299
00:16:49.294 --> 00:16:51.594
Hey, you were wearing them, weren't you?

300
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:55.094
On the day that the lady who was killed was pestering you?

301
00:16:55.094 --> 00:16:57.794
Oh, yeah?

302
00:16:57.794 --> 00:16:59.194
But how strange.

303
00:16:59.194 --> 00:17:03.594
The police even checked the drainage of the restroom

304
00:17:03.594 --> 00:17:06.494
but couldn't find the cracked lens, I wonder why?

305
00:17:06.494 --> 00:17:08.994
What? Is that so?

306
00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:13.194
There were three suspects and all of them were body checked,

307
00:17:13.194 --> 00:17:16.194
but nobody had it on them.

308
00:17:16.194 --> 00:17:20.894
But I'm sure they'll find it if we tell the police about this!

309
00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:25.094
Because the Japanese police are really efficient!

310
00:17:25.094 --> 00:17:27.294
I'm sure, Satoko!

311
00:17:28.794 --> 00:17:30.394
Oh, no! Oh, no!

312
00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:32.894
I've got to retrieve it before the police get to it.

313
00:17:33.994 --> 00:17:37.594
What? It's gone! It's not here!

314
00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:42.294
I'm inside!

315
00:17:43.594 --> 00:17:45.794
I'm still inside!

316
00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:55.494
Is this the cracked piece of lens that you're looking for?

317
00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:56.894
I hate to disappoint you,

318
00:17:56.894 --> 00:18:00.594
but we found it already a half a day ago.

319
00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:03.294
You probably thought of flushing it down the toilet, too.

320
00:18:03.294 --> 00:18:06.994
But if the police check the drainage, that's it.

321
00:18:06.994 --> 00:18:11.394
That's why you sunk it down the water tank

322
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:13.794
together with the parts of your glasses.

323
00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:15.694
With lens in the water,

324
00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:18.194
you've got to look really closely to see it.

325
00:18:18.194 --> 00:18:20.694
And if those new glasses are frameless,

326
00:18:20.694 --> 00:18:22.394
all you have to sink down the tank

327
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:25.794
are the temples and the bridge for the nose.

328
00:18:25.794 --> 00:18:29.794
So, it's highly likely that they would be overlooked

329
00:18:29.794 --> 00:18:32.294
for the parts of the water tank.

330
00:18:32.294 --> 00:18:36.294
At first glance, it doesn't look like the stolen accessory either!

331
00:18:36.294 --> 00:18:38.094
Well, it seems that you retrieved the temples

332
00:18:38.094 --> 00:18:42.194
and bridge of your glasses the following day.

333
00:18:42.194 --> 00:18:44.694
But we found out after checking the lens that

334
00:18:44.694 --> 00:18:49.094
it was for the glasses you purchased last month at an eyeglasses shop!

335
00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:53.194
So, what?

336
00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:56.494
That's no proof that I killed that lady, is it?

337
00:18:56.494 --> 00:19:00.194
We also found the pierce earrings

338
00:19:00.194 --> 00:19:01.994
that you hid in the shoyu bottle long ago.

339
00:19:01.994 --> 00:19:03.394
Huh?

340
00:19:03.394 --> 00:19:06.594
You probably hid it impulsively

341
00:19:06.594 --> 00:19:08.594
just before Yumi and the other lady cop came in here

342
00:19:08.594 --> 00:19:11.094
but you couldn't figure out which shoyu bottle it was,

343
00:19:11.094 --> 00:19:13.894
so you kept coming here every day since, right?

344
00:19:13.894 --> 00:19:16.594
That's why you kept ordering Tenshin dishes

345
00:19:16.594 --> 00:19:18.594
that you'd be using shoyu with, correct?

346
00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:24.094
The fingerprints on the shoyu soaked pierce

347
00:19:24.094 --> 00:19:27.094
and your fingerprints matched.

348
00:19:27.094 --> 00:19:30.194
We just got an arrest warrant,

349
00:19:30.194 --> 00:19:34.194
so we charged into the restroom to come and get you!

350
00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:36.594
You... You guys are police officers?

351
00:19:36.594 --> 00:19:39.294
Did you forget?

352
00:19:39.294 --> 00:19:41.694
We've met once before, haven't we?

353
00:19:43.594 --> 00:19:48.794
MPD Section One Violent Crimes Division three, Miwako Sato!

354
00:19:48.794 --> 00:19:51.094
And Wataru Takagi of the same department!

355
00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.894
We were actually told to stay outside the shop

356
00:19:56.894 --> 00:20:00.694
and keep an eye on you until the arrest warrant was issued.

357
00:20:00.694 --> 00:20:03.194
But we didn't want to risk you

358
00:20:03.194 --> 00:20:05.394
taking the employee here hostage or something so.

359
00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:09.294
Besides, if we enter the shop when you already know our faces,

360
00:20:09.294 --> 00:20:12.394
it's possible that you would flee on us.

361
00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:15.894
That's why we disguised ourselves and put on an act

362
00:20:15.894 --> 00:20:18.794
with the cooperation of Conan and the others!

363
00:20:18.794 --> 00:20:22.394
Well, it did look like you were really enjoying yourselves too, though.

364
00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:26.694
Besides, you were the ones who told us about the truth of the case!

365
00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:28.694
It... It wasn't me.

366
00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:31.194
It was rather, Masumi here...

367
00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:32.194
Huh?

368
00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:35.594
Where'd Masumi go?

369
00:20:35.594 --> 00:20:38.494
She just left

370
00:20:38.494 --> 00:20:40.494
saying she had something to do.

371
00:20:40.494 --> 00:20:44.294
What? Did Mari leave?

372
00:20:44.294 --> 00:20:47.794
I didn't get to return her handkerchief to her again.

373
00:20:47.794 --> 00:20:49.194
What? Handkerchief?

374
00:20:49.194 --> 00:20:52.894
Yeah. She forgot it here the last time she came.

375
00:20:52.894 --> 00:20:54.294
Right, sonny.

376
00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:57.094
I'm sorry, but will you go give this back to her for me?

377
00:20:57.094 --> 00:20:59.394
Yes, okay.

378
00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.394
I didn't mean to kill her.

379
00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:07.994
I just wanted to see that lady go pale.

380
00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:10.394
Yes, yes. Go tell that to the police!

381
00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:16.694
Gosh.

382
00:21:16.694 --> 00:21:19.494
It seems that he tried to leave a trace of the safe

383
00:21:19.494 --> 00:21:22.394
being forced opened at the victim's house.

384
00:21:22.394 --> 00:21:24.294
Only because he didn't want to be specified as the one

385
00:21:24.294 --> 00:21:27.394
who heard about the pierced earrings at this shop

386
00:21:27.394 --> 00:21:30.294
and committed the crime.

387
00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:33.594
At any rate, let's hurry on back to the station

388
00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:37.494
and record his defense statement.

389
00:21:37.494 --> 00:21:41.294
We've got our hard work-out to do tonight too, don't we?

390
00:21:41.294 --> 00:21:44.994
If you want to work out, why don't you go to the gym or something?

391
00:21:44.994 --> 00:21:47.194
What?

392
00:21:47.194 --> 00:21:49.894
I... I guess I'll do that.

393
00:21:51.494 --> 00:21:52.694
Idiot.

394
00:23:14.794 --> 00:23:17.894
See! There's an embroidery on the handkerchief, right?

395
00:23:17.894 --> 00:23:20.094
It says "Mari"!

396
00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:24.494
No, this isn't "Mari", but "Mary".

397
00:23:24.494 --> 00:23:28.394
Which means that's not Masumi Sera's handkerchief

398
00:23:28.394 --> 00:23:32.794
but the one of the girl who was in the picture with her.

399
00:23:33.994 --> 00:23:35.294
Huh?

400
00:23:35.294 --> 00:23:37.694
What made me think so?

401
00:23:37.694 --> 00:23:42.394
It could be that Masumi Sera's real name is Mary too and yet.

402
00:23:42.894 --> 00:23:47.894
Which means I met her elsewhere and heard her name.

403
00:23:47.894 --> 00:23:50.494
But, where on earth was it?

404
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:55.794
"Next Episode"

405
00:23:57.194 --> 00:23:58.694
What's that?

406
00:23:58.694 --> 00:24:02.394
A kind looking grandpa and grandma used to run this shop.

407
00:24:03.294 --> 00:24:04.894
It seems that the person who was found dead by the bridge

408
00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:07.794
was also wearing brown shoes.

409
00:24:07.794 --> 00:24:10.394
An insurance salesman came at noon.

410
00:24:10.394 --> 00:24:15.094
Which means he was planning to drop by after work.

411
00:24:15.094 --> 00:24:18.894
Yes, it's the soil of the shrine in back.

412
00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:24.294
Next Conan, "Wonder Boy"

413
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:27.237
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:27.237 --> 00:24:29.337
"Toy locomotive"

415
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:31.037
-Loves soccer. -Wears glasses.

416
00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:32.537
Always says, "I have to go to the restroom."

417
00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.137
What is there to wonder about?
