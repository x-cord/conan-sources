1
00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.624
I'm counting on you, Doc.

2
00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.924
Come on!

3
00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.124
We got a winner!

4
00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:21.024
An invitation to the Hotel Beika West cake buffet!

5
00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:28.524
Congratulations!

6
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:31.724
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

7
00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:33.924
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

8
00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:35.424
The remarks that are tweeted in the blog

9
00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.424
are not as sweet as sweets.

10
00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:39.024
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:40.824
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:43.224
His name is Detective Conan!

13
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:34.521
"The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case (Part 1)"

14
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.721
It sure looks delicious. Looks good.

15
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.221
There are so many types of cake here.

16
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:48.721
Are you sure we get to eat all we want of all this?

17
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:51.521
Yeah, because it's a cake buffet after all!

18
00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:53.521
You've sure got a lucky streak when it comes to

19
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:56.221
winning lotteries, don't you, Doc?

20
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:57.821
But we were actually

21
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.921
after the assorted first class sirloin pack though.

22
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:04.221
What? Really?

23
00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:06.421
Yeah...

24
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.021
Cake buffet?

25
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.921
I'll bet Ran will be envious if she hears about it,

26
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.021
so I guess I won't tell her.

27
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.821
Okay. Big catch.

28
00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:22.221
Genta, you're taking too much.

29
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.021
Okay, here I go too, then.

30
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:26.821
What?

31
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:28.821
You're limited to only two, Doc.

32
00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:30.921
No.

33
00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.521
Okay, just two.

34
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.221
And?

35
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:46.721
How was that police detective?

36
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:51.321
The one you sent asking me if I remember seeing him, right?

37
00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:53.221
The man with the scary looking face.

38
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.421
Oh. You mean Officer Kuroda of the 1st Investigation Section.

39
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:59.421
He seems to have been saying a lot of suspicious sounding things

40
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:01.821
but they seem to have all been things deliberately said

41
00:04:01.821 --> 00:04:03.521
to arrest the perp.

42
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:07.621
Well, it did bother me that he knew a lot about me though.

43
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:09.321
He backs up deductions

44
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.521
by viewing the case from an unexpected point of view

45
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:13.621
that leads to clues that solve cases.

46
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.421
He's Sleeping Kogoro's bag of wisdom.

47
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:20.421
That's the rumor going around at the police department.

48
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:22.521
Conan Edogawa.

49
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:26.221
But since he's at Nagano Prefectural Police,

50
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:29.121
we rarely run into each other so...

51
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:31.521
I guess there's really nothing to worry about.

52
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.821
Really? That's fine, then.

53
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:36.721
Dig in!

54
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:46.521
It's good!

55
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:49.121
It's really delicious!

56
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.221
Genta, you should eat a bit slower!

57
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:56.621
But, unless I hurry, they'll run out of cake!

58
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.921
Are you still going to eat?

59
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:02.721
Oh my god! What's this?

60
00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:04.621
A helicopter?

61
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:09.121
That's one of the Petite Falcons that are popular right now.

62
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.721
I wonder where it came flying from.

63
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:13.021
I'm sorry!

64
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.121
Are you okay, sonny?

65
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:17.121
Oh... yeah!

66
00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:18.421
I bought that toy

67
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:22.021
just a while ago at the toy shop in front of the hotel,

68
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.221
but as soon as I switched it on,

69
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:25.321
it flew off to where I didn't expect.

70
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:26.921
What? Could you be...

71
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:29.621
TV talent Ms. Saya Kitami?

72
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.621
Oh, you're the one who came out in "Gomera", right?

73
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:37.921
Oh! The one who had your blood sucked by the enemy monster!

74
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.321
"Saya Kitami (24), TV Talent" -Don't talk too loud

75
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:43.721
because it's a secret that I'm staying over at this hotel.

76
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:45.621
After I go get you a new piece of cake,

77
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:48.021
I'll take a picture with you.

78
00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:49.421
All right!

79
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:52.821
You're as unscrupulous as ever.

80
00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:55.321
You deliberately do things like that and befriend children.

81
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.621
So, you're going to take picture with the children

82
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.321
and upload it on your blog

83
00:05:58.321 --> 00:06:02.421
to raise your popularity ranking.

84
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.721
The title will be...

85
00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:07.721
Right. "Together with the children I met at the cake buffet"

86
00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:09.421
or something like that?

87
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:12.621
I don't intend to do anything like that.

88
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:16.921
Hey, aren't those two Kyona Shono and Saya Kitami?

89
00:06:16.921 --> 00:06:20.621
No. I heard those two really don't get along.

90
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:21.621
Come to think of it,

91
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.221
they were fighting over popularity ranking of their blog.

92
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.521
If I remember correctly, I think the losing side

93
00:06:26.521 --> 00:06:28.421
was going to shave her hair off.

94
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.521
What? Shave her head?

95
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:31.921
No joke?

96
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:36.121
Well, I know I'm going to win though.

97
00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:39.021
You never know.

98
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:43.121
Oh, you haven't seen my blog?

99
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:47.421
I know what your secret is, you know.

100
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.821
If you don't want me to expose it,

101
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:52.521
hurry up and hoist the white flag.

102
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.821
Your hair's short to begin with,

103
00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:57.721
so shaving your head means nothing to you, does it?

104
00:06:57.721 --> 00:06:59.721
No.

105
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:01.121
I'm going back to my room!

106
00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:05.321
Oh, but weren't you going to take a picture eating cake?

107
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:07.121
I don't want to have the same kind of picture she has.

108
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:08.421
That would be the pits.

109
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.321
Please go buy the stuff I asked you for!

110
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:13.021
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:15.721
Are you Sakurako?

112
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:17.821
Conan?

113
00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:20.021
What're you doing here?

114
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:23.021
You're a housekeeper, aren't you Sakurako?

115
00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:26.021
Oh, that's because her manager caught a cold.

116
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:28.321
We got word at our working place

117
00:07:28.321 --> 00:07:33.421
to take care of her until her manager recovers, you see.

118
00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:39.821
But I wonder why they're staying at the same hotel.

119
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:42.821
They don't seem to be getting along too well and yet...

120
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:45.221
Oh, that's because this hotel

121
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:46.921
will be used as the stage for a drama series

122
00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:49.021
starting this spring,

123
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:51.921
and those two will act as double heroines.

124
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:53.121
I know.

125
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:55.121
The drama's called "Top Class", right?

126
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:56.921
I guess it had a good reputation

127
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:58.621
so they decided to make a sequel.

128
00:07:58.621 --> 00:07:59.921
Really?

129
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:02.021
What kind of drama is it?

130
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:04.121
It's a drama where women expose their true selves

131
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:06.421
and are out to get each other any way they can.

132
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:07.821
Would you like to see it?

133
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.921
It seems pretty interesting.

134
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:11.221
Oh.

135
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:13.621
I guess not.

136
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:16.021
I'll see you then.

137
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.821
I've got to go shopping, you see.

138
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:20.421
Excuse me.

139
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:22.821
After you go deliver that to her,

140
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:26.221
will you come to my room, room 504?

141
00:08:26.221 --> 00:08:29.221
I have something I'd like to talk to you about concerning her.

142
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:31.121
Oh, all right.

143
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:32.721
See you later then.

144
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:45.421
Hey, Conan.

145
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:48.221
What're you looking at from a while ago?

146
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:50.921
Kyona Shono's blog.

147
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:53.221
Come to think of it, she was saying something to the effect that

148
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:57.521
Saya Kitami's secret is posted on her blog.

149
00:08:57.521 --> 00:09:01.721
Yeah. That's why I've been looking from a while ago

150
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:04.021
but she's only playing with a dog,

151
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.421
introducing her favorite comics

152
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:09.321
or cooking.

153
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:12.621
There's no secret anywhere.

154
00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:15.121
Hey! What's this?

155
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.921
I told you to get a super fine bristled toothbrush!

156
00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:21.921
I'm sorry. That's all they had.

157
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:24.321
I'll go look for another one and buy it right away!

158
00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:25.721
Never mind already!

159
00:09:25.721 --> 00:09:30.021
Shooting starts at 6pm, so will you come wake me up at 5pm?

160
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:32.221
I'm going to take a snooze till then.

161
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:34.221
Yes, ma'am, I will!

162
00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:36.921
Let me tell you that if anybody besides you come,

163
00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:39.221
I won't open the door,

164
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:41.521
so make sure you come wake me up at 5pm, okay?

165
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:42.921
Do you understand?

166
00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:44.421
Yes!

167
00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:56.921
Room 504...

168
00:09:56.921 --> 00:09:59.521
I found it! Here it is!

169
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:04.821
A heart mark?

170
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.321
Ouch..

171
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.121
Oh, sorry.

172
00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:11.821
Are you all right? I hope you're not hurt.

173
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:13.721
Yes, I'm fine.

174
00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:16.721
Oh, there's something posted on your door.

175
00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:18.221
I wonder what it is.

176
00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:19.621
From a fan, maybe.

177
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:23.221
What did you want to talk to me about?

178
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.621
Oh, that?

179
00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:26.421
I could care less about it already.

180
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.921
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.121
What?

182
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:34.921
I really ate my heart out...

183
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:36.921
Next it's dinner.

184
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:37.921
Already?

185
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.621
You're eating too much, Genta.

186
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:42.321
This is big trouble!

187
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:44.321
Please open the door!

188
00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:46.221
Yes, but...

189
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.021
Is something wrong, Sakurako?

190
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:50.621
Oh, Conan.

191
00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:53.021
No matter how many times a push the door bell,

192
00:10:53.021 --> 00:10:55.621
Kyona won't come out of her room!

193
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.621
What?

194
00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:59.721
That sounds really bad, no?

195
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:01.221
Saya.

196
00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:03.521
I have nothing to shoot today

197
00:11:03.521 --> 00:11:07.421
but Kyona will begin shooting in 30 minutes.

198
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:09.721
She needs time for make-up

199
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:12.121
so she needs to be at the site already.

200
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:15.621
So, please open the door right away with the master key!

201
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:16.921
Okay!

202
00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:23.821
Kyona, what's wrong?

203
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:26.121
Shooting's going to start!

204
00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:31.621
Kyona? Kyona?

205
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:33.821
You're here, aren't you?

206
00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:35.621
Kyona...

207
00:11:55.988 --> 00:11:57.288
What's the matter?

208
00:11:58.088 --> 00:12:00.288
Please call an ambulance and the police!

209
00:12:00.288 --> 00:12:02.588
What? Oh, all right!

210
00:12:05.688 --> 00:12:06.888
What's this?

211
00:12:06.888 --> 00:12:10.488
Conan, that's a card key, isn't it?

212
00:12:10.488 --> 00:12:11.588
Yep.

213
00:12:11.588 --> 00:12:13.788
But, that's strange.

214
00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:16.288
This hotel isn't auto lock.

215
00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:20.788
-What? -How did the perp lock this room?

216
00:12:20.788 --> 00:12:22.788
It's a locked room murder.

217
00:12:25.388 --> 00:12:27.588
What's this white stain?

218
00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:34.488
Whipped cream?

219
00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:35.788
Which means...

220
00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:38.288
Who on earth...

221
00:12:38.288 --> 00:12:40.888
Don't tell me that the perp...

222
00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:44.988
Who could've done something terrible like this?

223
00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:50.688
Could it be...

224
00:12:52.788 --> 00:12:55.588
That's right.

225
00:12:56.288 --> 00:13:00.688
She asked me to come wake her up at 5pm

226
00:13:00.688 --> 00:13:05.288
but, no matter how much I rang the doorbell, she didn't answer

227
00:13:05.288 --> 00:13:09.088
so I went to the front desk to ask them to open the door

228
00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:12.288
and had the bellboy open the door with the master key.

229
00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:16.288
Then I found Kyona in this bedroom bleeding from her head

230
00:13:16.288 --> 00:13:18.988
-and lying on the floor! -I see.

231
00:13:18.988 --> 00:13:23.388
But, if I remember correctly Sakurako, weren't you a housekeeper?

232
00:13:23.388 --> 00:13:24.988
Her manager came down with a cold,

233
00:13:24.988 --> 00:13:29.188
so I was asked to take care of her until her manager recovered,

234
00:13:29.188 --> 00:13:31.188
and accepted the job.

235
00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:35.488
But, I didn't expect something like this happen again.

236
00:13:35.488 --> 00:13:38.788
Maybe I'm cursed after all?

237
00:13:38.788 --> 00:13:40.488
Oh, no.

238
00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:42.888
If you ask me, more than you,

239
00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:46.288
Conan, who is always with you when something comes up

240
00:13:46.288 --> 00:13:49.688
is more like Death to me.

241
00:13:50.588 --> 00:13:53.788
And? When did she die?

242
00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:56.488
Between 4pm and 4.30pm.

243
00:13:56.488 --> 00:13:58.388
The medical examiner said that

244
00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:01.888
she was struck repeatedly with a thin pole or something.

245
00:14:01.888 --> 00:14:04.188
But, is it true that

246
00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:07.788
the card key of this non-auto lock door of this hotel

247
00:14:07.788 --> 00:14:10.088
was found on the floor?

248
00:14:10.088 --> 00:14:11.588
Yes.

249
00:14:13.488 --> 00:14:17.588
If so, this is a locked room murder case.

250
00:14:17.588 --> 00:14:19.588
But, it's strange!

251
00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:21.388
Because Kyona said that

252
00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:24.088
she won't open the door for anyone unless I come,

253
00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:27.288
and asked me to wake her up.

254
00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:29.788
I wonder why she opened the door.

255
00:14:29.788 --> 00:14:33.088
No matter who came besides you, Sakurako?

256
00:14:33.088 --> 00:14:35.988
Something's strange about the way she asked you to do it.

257
00:14:35.988 --> 00:14:37.188
You think so too, don't you?

258
00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:38.588
A stalker.

259
00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:42.388
She was once attacked at a hotel

260
00:14:42.388 --> 00:14:45.688
by a man who pretended to be a staff member in the past.

261
00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:49.388
Since then she stopped letting anyone into her room

262
00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.488
even if she knew that person, unless they had arrangements

263
00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:53.288
to see her beforehand.

264
00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:56.888
Oh, I've read that in a weekly magazine before too.

265
00:14:56.888 --> 00:15:00.088
Show business people have to go through a lot, don't they?

266
00:15:00.088 --> 00:15:03.088
By the way, you're also a TV talent?

267
00:15:03.088 --> 00:15:06.388
She's Saya Kitami who was scheduled to act together

268
00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:08.088
in the drama with Kyona.

269
00:15:08.088 --> 00:15:09.988
This hotel is the stage for the drama,

270
00:15:09.988 --> 00:15:12.788
so she's also staying at this hotel.

271
00:15:12.788 --> 00:15:16.788
I heard at the front desk that Kyona wouldn't come out of her room

272
00:15:16.788 --> 00:15:20.288
so I was worried and came here with Sakurako.

273
00:15:20.288 --> 00:15:24.088
I had no idea that we'd find Kyona like this.

274
00:15:25.688 --> 00:15:29.888
At any rate, we need to check this room in more detail,

275
00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.088
so will all of you who discovered the corpse,

276
00:15:31.088 --> 00:15:33.588
Saya, Sakurako and Conan

277
00:15:33.588 --> 00:15:36.488
wait in Saya's room for now?

278
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:37.688
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:37.688 --> 00:15:39.388
All right.

280
00:15:44.888 --> 00:15:47.388
Saya, is it true that

281
00:15:47.388 --> 00:15:49.988
Kyona was found murdered in her room?

282
00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:54.188
Yes. The police are in her room right now.

283
00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:56.088
Wait. Seriously?

284
00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.188
Then, what about today's shooting?

285
00:15:58.188 --> 00:15:59.188
Stupid!

286
00:15:59.188 --> 00:16:02.388
There'll be no shooting, more so, the drama itself is gone, no more!

287
00:16:02.388 --> 00:16:06.288
So, please tell my make-up artist, that she may leave.

288
00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:09.988
What? Your make-up artist was here, Saya?

289
00:16:09.988 --> 00:16:12.388
-What? -Of course!

290
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.288
Today the main shooting was the part

291
00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:18.288
where Kyona and Saya meet each other again at the hotel!

292
00:16:18.288 --> 00:16:19.488
Really?

293
00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:22.588
Then why did you say that, Saya?

294
00:16:22.588 --> 00:16:24.088
Say what?

295
00:16:24.088 --> 00:16:28.588
Remember, you said that you had nothing to shoot today.

296
00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:31.288
-What? -Just as if you knew that

297
00:16:31.288 --> 00:16:34.988
today's shooting was going to be cancelled or something.

298
00:16:39.688 --> 00:16:42.688
I mistakenly thought so...

299
00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:44.788
Oh, you just made a mistake!

300
00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:47.188
If so, it can't be helped!

301
00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:54.588
She's the perp after all.

302
00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:57.388
The question is the card key that was in the room.

303
00:16:57.388 --> 00:16:59.988
If you were to lock the key from outside,

304
00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:03.988
you could insert the key into the room from the space under the door.

305
00:17:03.988 --> 00:17:06.088
But no matter how hard you push it,

306
00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:09.288
you could never push it all the way inside the room where it was found.

307
00:17:09.288 --> 00:17:11.688
Was that toy helicopter used?

308
00:17:11.688 --> 00:17:13.388
How?

309
00:17:13.388 --> 00:17:16.688
And how did she get into the room when Kyona insisted that

310
00:17:16.688 --> 00:17:20.688
she wouldn't let anyone besides Sakurako come into her room?

311
00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:23.088
It seems unlikely that she'd invite her in

312
00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:26.288
since they were arguing earlier.

313
00:17:26.288 --> 00:17:31.388
At any rate, I still don't have enough pieces to assemble this puzzle.

314
00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:35.488
What?

315
00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:38.288
This room is right under Kyona's room?

316
00:17:38.288 --> 00:17:39.388
What?

317
00:17:39.388 --> 00:17:43.288
Kyona's room was room 604.

318
00:17:43.288 --> 00:17:45.688
Yes, it seems that way.

319
00:17:50.388 --> 00:17:53.088
The layout of the room is practically the same too, isn't it?

320
00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:54.388
Yes.

321
00:17:54.388 --> 00:17:56.588
Come to think of it, what was it?

322
00:17:56.588 --> 00:17:57.988
The thing that was on your door.

323
00:17:57.988 --> 00:18:01.488
I guess it was just a prank by a fan.

324
00:18:01.488 --> 00:18:03.688
What thing?

325
00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:05.288
There was a strange envelope!

326
00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:08.088
It was posted on the door of Saya's room.

327
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.088
What kind of envelope?

328
00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:13.188
There was large black heart drawn on it.

329
00:18:13.188 --> 00:18:18.688
I think it was posted on right under the door peek hole.

330
00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:20.988
Would you two like something to drink?

331
00:18:20.988 --> 00:18:23.488
I can make you something simple.

332
00:18:23.488 --> 00:18:25.888
Oh, I'd like iced coffee, please.

333
00:18:25.888 --> 00:18:27.788
I'll have black tea then.

334
00:18:27.788 --> 00:18:28.888
Okay!

335
00:18:31.888 --> 00:18:34.788
But, isn't it amazing

336
00:18:34.788 --> 00:18:39.088
that they let you stay in a big room like this during your shoot?

337
00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:42.688
Well, the drama plays a part in advertising this hotel,

338
00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:44.188
so they offered us these special rooms

339
00:18:44.188 --> 00:18:47.088
because we're the two heroines in the drama.

340
00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:49.988
Well, but I guess this drama's going to be dropped

341
00:18:49.988 --> 00:18:54.288
and we'll have to be leaving this hotel tomorrow though.

342
00:18:55.088 --> 00:18:56.788
I guess.

343
00:18:57.588 --> 00:19:00.488
Conan, what have you been looking at from some time ago?

344
00:19:00.488 --> 00:19:02.288
Saya's blog.

345
00:19:02.288 --> 00:19:03.588
What?

346
00:19:03.588 --> 00:19:07.888
I was thinking that Saya's blog is so different from Kyona's.

347
00:19:07.888 --> 00:19:09.388
Different?

348
00:19:09.388 --> 00:19:14.388
Because in Kyona's blog, she's included in all her pictures,

349
00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:17.988
but, there are practically no pictures of you on your blog, Saya.

350
00:19:17.988 --> 00:19:21.388
Even though there's a few sometimes, it's really small.

351
00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:26.088
Unlike Kyona, I'm not good at appealing to people in pictures.

352
00:19:26.088 --> 00:19:30.388
If they want to see me, they can watch the drama, I guess I'd like to say.

353
00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:35.488
Come to think of it, what did you do with that?

354
00:19:35.488 --> 00:19:37.188
Do with what?

355
00:19:37.188 --> 00:19:38.888
The Petite Falcon.

356
00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:42.888
You were flying it at the cake buffet, weren't you?

357
00:19:42.888 --> 00:19:44.788
Oh, that?

358
00:19:44.788 --> 00:19:47.888
It wasn't flying right, so I disposed of it.

359
00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:50.588
What? What a waste!

360
00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:52.888
Now we can't fly it together.

361
00:19:52.888 --> 00:19:55.488
Fly it together?

362
00:19:56.388 --> 00:19:58.088
Oh, here they come!

363
00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:04.588
My friends! Is it okay for them to come in?

364
00:20:04.588 --> 00:20:06.388
Hello!

365
00:20:06.388 --> 00:20:09.288
Here, I bought you the Petite Falcon!

366
00:20:09.288 --> 00:20:10.788
Oh, thank you!

367
00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:13.288
But it's really hard, you know!

368
00:20:13.288 --> 00:20:15.388
It doesn't fly like you want it to!

369
00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:17.888
You need a lot of technique to work it.

370
00:20:17.888 --> 00:20:19.288
Let me try.

371
00:20:28.788 --> 00:20:30.588
You're fantastic, just great!

372
00:20:30.588 --> 00:20:33.388
Oh, come on, it's quite easy.

373
00:20:35.388 --> 00:20:38.488
Oh no! It got stuck on the air conditioner.

374
00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:41.488
I need a pole.

375
00:20:48.088 --> 00:20:50.388
-Here you go! -Thank you!

376
00:20:50.388 --> 00:20:53.988
If you fly it in the room, you may get it stuck some place again

377
00:20:53.988 --> 00:20:56.388
so why don't you fly it some other place more spacious?

378
00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:57.888
I guess so!

379
00:20:59.588 --> 00:21:04.288
We'll go play outside, so tell the police that!

380
00:21:04.288 --> 00:21:06.188
Hey.

381
00:21:09.988 --> 00:21:11.888
And? How about it?

382
00:21:11.888 --> 00:21:14.488
Did you figure out the locked room trick?

383
00:21:14.488 --> 00:21:16.688
No, not yet.

384
00:21:16.688 --> 00:21:18.988
But, I have an idea how the perp made it in the room

385
00:21:18.988 --> 00:21:20.588
and the murder weapon!

386
00:21:20.588 --> 00:21:25.388
What? Then are you saying that the TV talent is the perp after all?

387
00:21:25.388 --> 00:21:27.588
Yeah, no mistake about it.

388
00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:28.788
No.

389
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.988
She seems to be so kind.

390
00:21:31.988 --> 00:21:35.288
The outward appearance and inside of a woman are different, you know.

391
00:21:35.288 --> 00:21:36.988
Although the lady who was killed

392
00:21:36.988 --> 00:21:40.488
seemed to have a foul mouth, was vulgar and rude,

393
00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:41.688
if you look at her blog,

394
00:21:41.688 --> 00:21:45.688
you'll see that she had a sensitive and meticulous side too.

395
00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:48.988
What? How did you find something like that out?

396
00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:52.588
The bottles of manicure were lined out in order by number,

397
00:21:52.588 --> 00:21:54.988
despite it being a brand where you couldn't see the number

398
00:21:54.988 --> 00:21:56.788
unless it was turned over.

399
00:21:56.788 --> 00:21:58.088
What?

400
00:21:58.088 --> 00:22:01.088
Wait a sec. Then, that picture...

401
00:22:04.088 --> 00:22:08.888
I see. So this is the secret that she found out about.

402
00:22:08.888 --> 00:22:12.788
But, would a person commit murder just for something like this?

403
00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:14.188
Wait a sec.

404
00:22:14.888 --> 00:22:16.188
Wait.

405
00:22:16.988 --> 00:22:20.388
In English, this would be?

406
00:22:20.388 --> 00:22:23.388
I see, so that's the story.

407
00:22:24.788 --> 00:22:29.788
I've figured out why she had to kill Ms. Kyona Shono.

408
00:23:52.288 --> 00:23:54.088
What? Rice cooker?

409
00:23:55.188 --> 00:23:57.988
I see. That's the story.

410
00:23:57.988 --> 00:24:00.488
The perp didn't use what the function was actually for

411
00:24:00.488 --> 00:24:03.388
and turned that room into a locked room.

412
00:24:03.388 --> 00:24:05.388
If you look through that door hole,

413
00:24:05.388 --> 00:24:10.288
you'll figure out how the perp got into the room.

414
00:24:10.288 --> 00:24:11.688
I tell you.

415
00:24:11.688 --> 00:24:13.388
Who is it this time?

416
00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:16.488
What? Doc Agasa?

417
00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:17.888
Next Conan,

418
00:24:17.888 --> 00:24:21.888
"The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case (Part 2)"

419
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:25.231
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:26.931
"Toy helicopter"

421
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:28.931
Great appreciation to the great hit of the movie version.

422
00:24:28.931 --> 00:24:29.931
We need to air more at night.

423
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:31.831
It's "Nightmare," not "Night More".
