1
00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:20.832
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:22.632
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.132
Today's stage is at a city hotel.

4
00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:26.232
Unique rooms are full of mystery.

5
00:00:26.232 --> 00:00:27.832
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.732
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:32.032
His name is Detective Conan!

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:59.991
"The Mystery Of The Retro Room"

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:04.191
"Tohto Monorail"

10
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.091
Dad.

11
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.791
Here, your ticket.

12
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:12.891
You should come with us to Dolphin Land too, dad.

13
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:16.591
I'm not going to a dolphin show.

14
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:19.591
A man's dream is...

15
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.991
the horse derby!

16
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:23.891
I'll win really big,

17
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.591
and treat you guys to a gorgeous dinner tonight!

18
00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:30.691
Be sure you don't run the household finances broke to win though!

19
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.191
I know.

20
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:35.391
I know!

21
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:38.091
Yes, okay. Bye, then!

22
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:40.491
What did Naomi say?

23
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:42.091
She wants us to hurry over.

24
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.791
Oh, such beautiful ladies!

25
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:50.991
Are you by chance Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

26
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.491
What? You mean that renowned detective?

27
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.491
That's right.

28
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:56.891
I can't believe it!

29
00:02:56.891 --> 00:02:59.091
I'm a great fan of yours!

30
00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.691
Kaori, cut out your rude attitude!

31
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:04.791
Oh, no. She's not being rude at all!

32
00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.891
We're going to Dolphin Land Hotel,

33
00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:10.591
but where are you headed for, Mr. Mouri?

34
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:14.291
What a coincidence! I'm going to Dolphin Land, too.

35
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.591
He's going to the horse race track next to it.

36
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:22.191
Excuse me, but do you mind if we go along with you?

37
00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:24.191
Not at all.

38
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:25.991
Come now, let's go.

39
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.691
I'm sorry, but we have one other person with us.

40
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.891
Kuniko!

41
00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.691
Kaori!

42
00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.091
I'm sorry, did you wait long?

43
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.991
Another beautiful lady!

44
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.491
It's still early.

45
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:41.091
You're late!

46
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.891
We're riding the monorail Ieaving at 1:20 pm, aren't we?

47
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:49.191
We still have 10 minutes.

48
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.591
Huh? Who is he?

49
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:55.591
He is the renown detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

50
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:57.491
We ran into him coincidentally.

51
00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:02.491
We used to be classmates of the same university.

52
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.891
"Kuniko Yamamoto (27)" -We had a class reunion last week,

53
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:10.491
but one of our friends who work abroad couldn't come.

54
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:13.291
She happened to come back to Japan yesterday,

55
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:15.191
"Kaori Obayashi (27)" -so we decided to have another reunion,

56
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.591
just the four of us.

57
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.191
Which means another beautiful is coming?

58
00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.191
Yes. Among all of us,

59
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:25.291
A queen?

60
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.891
Where? Where is she?

61
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:30.791
"Kanami Kaneda (27)" -She's staying at the Dolphin Land Hotel.

62
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:35.591
She's a designer for children's clothes abroad.

63
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:38.691
So, we have beautiful yet talented designers,

64
00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:43.091
travel agent, and a housewife!

65
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.691
Oh, not really.

66
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:47.691
He's right.

67
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:50.591
Especially when it comes to you, Kuniko!

68
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.691
That's right. You're going independent

69
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.491
and opening a designer's office of your own, aren't you?

70
00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:57.391
Well, sort of.

71
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:01.191
That's really something.

72
00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:04.591
I'm the only one who's no more than just a housewife.

73
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:06.191
Oh, come on.

74
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.691
You went ahead before us and got a happily married life!

75
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:12.391
That's true! Look at you, so happy and plump.

76
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:14.191
Oh, cut it out.

77
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:15.891
You know I'm not happy about being plump.

78
00:05:15.891 --> 00:05:19.691
The train headed for Dolphin Land will be arriving soon.

79
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:22.291
-Please stand away from the door. -Oh, here it comes.

80
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:26.691
Off we go to where the fourth beauty awaits us!

81
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:32.391
Here we go! The monorail will get us there in no time!

82
00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:41.991
"Dolphin Land Station"

83
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:46.191
That's the Dolphin Land Hotel.

84
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:49.191
They just renovated and newly opened last month.

85
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.291
Talk about a classical setting.

86
00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:01.791
This is called the retro floor.

87
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:03.691
Retro floor?

88
00:06:03.691 --> 00:06:05.391
The original model of this hotel

89
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.891
is a long established famous Japanese inn called Iruka-Tei (Dolphin Inn).

90
00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:13.491
Come, Naomi's room is over this side.

91
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:16.091
Sure thing!

92
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.791
Hey, Kuniko. What is Naomi's room number?

93
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:23.291
Room 503.

94
00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:25.791
Room 503...

95
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.091
It's here.

96
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:30.791
We made it. It's 2pm sharp.

97
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:34.191
Huh? Don't tell me that Naomi's sleeping,

98
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.691
despite telling us to rush over?

99
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:37.591
Goodness.

100
00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:39.591
What a girl.

101
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.291
Naomi?

102
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.991
Now, what do we do?

103
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:47.091
Huh? The door isn't locked.

104
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.891
Let's just go inside.

105
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:52.091
Naomi?

106
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:53.691
We're coming in.

107
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:58.391
Don't! You don't know them well enough yet!

108
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:00.191
Hey, what is this?

109
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.091
What's wrong?

110
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:14.691
Naomi?

111
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.791
It can't be...

112
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:19.191
Please calm down.

113
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.691
Don't touch anything in this room.

114
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.791
I said don't touch anything!

115
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:29.491
It seems to have switched off automatically.

116
00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.191
This TV is coin operated.

117
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:37.491
Ran, get the police.

118
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.791
Okay!

119
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:42.291
"Off-limits"

120
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.491
What happened?

121
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:47.491
So, the body was found by the three of you.

122
00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:50.191
And like always, the one who coincidentally happened to be here,

123
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:52.691
Mr. Mouri?

124
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:54.691
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:57.991
I'll have to interrogate you, too.

126
00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:01.091
Can you wait a while?

127
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:03.491
I'll act as their bodyguard, then!

128
00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:05.791
There is no need for you to do that.

129
00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:07.491
Hey, Officer Chiba!

130
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:08.491
Yes!

131
00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:10.591
Take care of the girls, will you?

132
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.791
Yes, sir!

133
00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:16.791
Please come this way.

134
00:08:18.691 --> 00:08:20.591
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

135
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:21.991
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:23.991
How is it, Officer Takagi?

137
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.891
Oh, inspector.

138
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:30.091
The victim is Ms. Naomi Fujimura, age 27.

139
00:08:30.091 --> 00:08:34.191
She worked abroad as a designer for children's clothes.

140
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:35.691
Inspector!

141
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:38.391
I found this in the pocket of the skirt of the victim.

142
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:41.391
It's a tear gas spray used to war away sexual harrassers.

143
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.391
What? Tear gas spray?

144
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:47.791
Maybe she was a very cautious person

145
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:51.191
because she had been living in the States for some time?

146
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.791
It is strange.

147
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:59.291
What a place full of things from olden times.

148
00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:01.991
This is called a retro room.

149
00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:03.191
It is a replica of a guest room

150
00:09:03.191 --> 00:09:05.691
of an old established renown Japanese inn.

151
00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:08.691
That's why the TV is coin operated.

152
00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:11.191
This is the type that you can watch it for an hour

153
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.391
by inserting 100 yen coin.

154
00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:19.591
So, the TV switched off as soon as you all entered the room?

155
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.491
Yes, at about 2 pm.

156
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:25.391
According to the operation manual on top of the TV,

157
00:09:25.391 --> 00:09:29.191
only one 100 yen coin can be inserted at a time.

158
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:33.591
In other words, the TV was turned on about an hour ago.

159
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:35.691
What is the estimated time of death?

160
00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:39.191
From between 12 pm to 1 pm.

161
00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:43.191
So, she was attacked as soon as the TV was switched on.

162
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:46.291
Hey. This candy sure is a rare one, isn't it?

163
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:50.391
I've never seen candies like these!

164
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:53.491
Not you again!

165
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.591
Soda candy, stringed candy balls,

166
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.691
squid candy and sauce crackers.

167
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:00.191
All candies that I used to know when I was a child.

168
00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:04.791
These candies come with this room as snacks to have tea with.

169
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:07.291
They probably scattered when the killer and the victim

170
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.391
struggled with each other.

171
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:13.091
Huh? There's ice cream.

172
00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:14.691
It's already melted, though.

173
00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.791
Ice cream?

174
00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:19.291
She was probably attacked

175
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.891
while she was eating ice cream and watching TV.

176
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:27.991
Will somebody check if there is ice cream in the freezer?

177
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:29.091
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:32.991
Inspector, there are a few bars inside.

179
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:36.191
These bars of ice cream are also very nostalgic.

180
00:10:36.191 --> 00:10:38.991
It seems exactly as you say, Mr. Mouri.

181
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:44.391
No, this ice cream bar is not of the olden days.

182
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:46.491
Did the victim buy it?

183
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:47.691
Or maybe...

184
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:53.291
What's this? It's wet.

185
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:56.591
It seems slightly wet here.

186
00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:57.991
Wet?

187
00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.691
Maybe the water from a vase spilled or something.

188
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:05.791
You delivered the blouse that had been cleaned

189
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.991
a little before 1 pm?

190
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:10.891
Yes.

191
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:15.691
But since the "Do not disturb" sign was on the door,

192
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.391
so I didn't go inside.

193
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.891
Was the door locked at that time?

194
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:24.591
You again!

195
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:25.991
Now, now.

196
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:27.791
So, was it locked?

197
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:30.891
I didn't touch the door knob,

198
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:32.291
so I don't know.

199
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:34.591
Inspector.

200
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:38.291
The victim's cell phone was found under the table.

201
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:43.591
Oh, right. Will you check the outgoing calls?

202
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:45.091
Okay.

203
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:48.791
This is...

204
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.591
Please take a look, Inspector.

205
00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:51.791
"November 19th: 1:08 pm, Kuniko Yamamoto"

206
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.691
Kuniko Yamamoto?

207
00:11:53.691 --> 00:11:56.191
She's one of the three girls.

208
00:11:56.191 --> 00:11:59.591
She called the victim at 1:08 pm,

209
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:02.491
that's just before she was killed.

210
00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:05.691
Just after Ms. Yamamoto got the call,

211
00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:07.791
we ran into them.

212
00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:09.891
Oh, I see.

213
00:12:11.191 --> 00:12:13.791
Yes, it was definitely Naomi

214
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:16.691
telling us to hurry over to her place.

215
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:18.891
It shows 1:08 pm.

216
00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:21.491
True.

217
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:24.691
Where were you then?

218
00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:27.491
At the monorail station, waiting for the train.

219
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:30.991
We were together with each other from 1pm.

220
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:34.391
Kanami came 10 minutes late, though.

221
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:39.791
After that, we got on the 1:20 monorail.

222
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:44.091
We arrived at the hotel at about 1:50 pm.

223
00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:47.991
We got to Naomi's room at 2 pm sharp.

224
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:53.491
In other words, the girls have an alibi.

225
00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:54.891
One last thing.

226
00:12:54.891 --> 00:12:57.291
Would you please return to the scene of the crime again

227
00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.991
and explain the circumstances of when you discovered the corpse?

228
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:03.091
Yes.

229
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:10.391
No, this is a well calculated homicide.

230
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:13.791
If my deduction is correct, she is the killer.

231
00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:16.791
But I don't have evidence.

232
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:17.791
What was that?

233
00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:21.191
That sound of something rubbing against something

234
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:22.491
I see.

235
00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:25.791
The killer still has the evidence.

236
00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:29.091
She is the killer after all!

237
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.580
Thank you, everyone. You can all go for today.

238
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.480
Inspector, I guess I'll go with the girls and...

239
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.280
Dad?

240
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.080
On second thought, maybe not just yet.

241
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.880
Inspector, this is a carefully schemed case of homicide.

242
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.880
-What was that? -What?

243
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.280
Moreover, the killer is right here, among the three girls.

244
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.280
What?

245
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.980
It can't be!

246
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.580
The killer is among us?

247
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.680
What a thing to say.

248
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.880
First is the tear gas spray that Ms. Fujimura had with her.

249
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.280
She had it in her pocket, yet didn't use it.

250
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.280
It was probably because the the killer was someone she knew.

251
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.380
Second is the room key.

252
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.480
The one that is on the table.

253
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.780
Let's say that the killer were a robber,

254
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.780
wouldn't it only be natural that the killer would lock the door

255
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.480
when fleeing to buy time to delay discovery of the corpse?

256
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.680
True...

257
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.180
But all the girls have an alibi after 1 pm, you know?

258
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:53.580
The actual time of death is way earlier than 1 pm.

259
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.180
Probably at around 12:20 or so.

260
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.780
How do you explain the TV, then?

261
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.380
It switched off at a little after 2 pm,

262
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.380
which means the coin was inserted a little after 1 pm.

263
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.180
One doesn't have to be in this room to insert the coin.

264
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.780
Look, the candies that are scattered around the room are used.

265
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.780
Candies?

266
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.680
Just how do you do that?

267
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.780
Well, I'll explain that right now.

268
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.980
Conan!

269
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.680
Yes!

270
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.780
You use this ice cream bar

271
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.880
and candy ball with a string attached.

272
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.880
What? With things like that?

273
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.780
Well, watch!

274
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.280
First, you hook the string of the candy ball

275
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.080
to the metal piece by the coin insert slot.

276
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.680
As for the bar of ice cream...

277
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.880
Place it on the channel of the TV and on the cabinet

278
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.580
to serve as a bridge.

279
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.780
Then, one end of the string of the candy ball

280
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.280
is held down by a packaged bar of ice cream.

281
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.680
Do you have a 100 yen coin, Ran?

282
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.180
What? Let's see...

283
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.080
-Here you go. -Can you put it by the coin slot?

284
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.380
Okay.

285
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.980
The coin is caught by the string and cannot be inserted.

286
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.780
After setting all this up, the killer left the room.

287
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.780
As time passes, the ice cream will melt.

288
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.280
If the ice cream melts,

289
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.180
the support is lost and the string drops to the floor.

290
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.880
It's like that.

291
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.780
I see.

292
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.680
Candies were scattered around the TV set

293
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.180
was to hide the trick.

294
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.280
It seems so.

295
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.880
The channel changer and the top of the cabinet were wet

296
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.880
because of the ice cream bar that was left there.

297
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.080
Moreover,

298
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.780
that ice cream bar is one that has recently come on the market,

299
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.180
so it's not something that was left here in the room to begin with.

300
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.180
Naomi could've bought it herself!

301
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.880
The killer didn't lock the door to carry out the trick, you know.

302
00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.580
Just what do you mean?

303
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.680
Because if she locked the door,

304
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.680
even if she were to return here with her friends,

305
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.080
she wouldn't be able to show them the instant the TV switches off.

306
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.480
I see!

307
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.480
It would be meaningless

308
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.380
unless she showed somebody the TV switching off.

309
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.380
Which means that the sign on the door knob was...

310
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.480
The killer probably hung it on the door knob.

311
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.780
Be it only for an hour and a half,

312
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.180
she had to leave the room

313
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.380
with the corpse inside without locking the door.

314
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.080
Because if someone enters the room,

315
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.180
everything goes down the drain.

316
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.480
Wait a minute!

317
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.380
I got a call from Naomi at 1:08 pm, remember?

318
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.580
That's right!

319
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.780
If Naomi were killed one hour before,

320
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.980
she wouldn't be able to make the call, would she?

321
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.180
That's right, Mr Mouri.

322
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.680
Their outgoing and incoming calls all matched up, too.

323
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.180
The killer called

324
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.780
by using the victim's cell phone.

325
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.480
What?

326
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.480
But Kuniko was talking to Naomi and...

327
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.480
Don't tell me that...

328
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.280
That's right. She couldn't have possibly talked to the victim.

329
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.380
In other words, the killer is you,

330
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.380
Ms. Kuniko Yamamoto!

331
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.980
Kuniko.

332
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.480
No way!

333
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.580
After committing the murder,

334
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.780
you took Ms. Fujimura's cell phone

335
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.280
and went back to the monorail station to join Kaori.

336
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.080
At around 1 pm,

337
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.280
you then called your own cell phone from Ms. Fujimura's cell phone

338
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.680
and pretended talking to her.

339
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.380
All you had to do left

340
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.880
was to return the cell phone to the room

341
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.580
during the commotion of the body being found.

342
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.980
Do you have evidence?

343
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.980
You've got the evidence, don't you?

344
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.980
What?

345
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.080
The vinyl bag in your pocket.

346
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.380
What about it?

347
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.480
You put Ms. Fujimura's cellular in there

348
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.080
and took it out, didn't you?

349
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.780
Is that true?

350
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.980
Hey!

351
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.280
Yes, sir!

352
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.280
Please let me check your pocket.

353
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.580
Hey!

354
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.980
It's here.

355
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.980
Hold it up to the light and look at it.

356
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.380
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.480
There are several fingerprints...

358
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.080
There is a place where the fingerprints are bunched up vertically.

359
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.680
Ms. Yamamoto, when I saw your cellular,

360
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.880
I noticed something interesting.

361
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.980
020582805.

362
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.180
When you match that up with the number keys of the cell phone,

363
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.480
only the keys of the center vertical row are used.

364
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.780
The fingerprints are bunched up vertically

365
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.780
because you pushed the number over the vinyl bag.

366
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.180
What?

367
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.380
Hey! Bring the victim's cellular phone.

368
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.980
Yes, sir.

369
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.880
It's only natural that the vinyl bag that was in my pocket

370
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.580
has my fingerprints on it!

371
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.480
This is the victim's cell phone.

372
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.180
It matches up perfectly!

373
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.080
I couldn't...

374
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.080
forgive Naomi.

375
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.580
Kuniko?

376
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.880
Why, Kuniko?

377
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.180
During our university graduation,

378
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.980
the valedictorian was to be recommended

379
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.080
to a brand name merchandise abroad.

380
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.780
Naomi who attained that glory

381
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.980
succeeded as a children's clothes designer.

382
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.880
But the fact was, I was the one

383
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.780
who was supposed to get that recommendation!

384
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.480
Naomi had the nerve to use her feminine wiles on the Professor!

385
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.180
I didn't know about it until the Professor slipped his tongue

386
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.180
and told me about it at a bar we went to after the class reunion.

387
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.980
But weren't you going to go independent

388
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.580
and open your own office, too?

389
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.180
I lied.

390
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.480
The truth is, I was laid off.

391
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.680
Just because of one little first time mistake!

392
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.280
Laid off?

393
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.280
I was so vexed!

394
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.980
Thinking why I had to go through all this.

395
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.180
I was made to go through all this

396
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.580
just because of Naomi!

397
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.380
Naomi took my happiness away from me!

398
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.180
That's why I...

399
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.080
How lucky that there was a night show!

400
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.580
Yes!

401
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.080
And this is the best seat, too.

402
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.480
Well, I guess we were lucky.

403
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.580
Kids stuff...

404
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.480
Okay, now the dolphins will throw balls

405
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.580
at the guests that they take a liking to.

406
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.780
Please catch the ball for them!

407
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.980
That hurts!

408
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.580
You sure are popular, Pops.

409
00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.580
"Next Episode" -Huh?

410
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.280
Isn't there something wrong with that boat?

411
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280
What?

412
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.780
Hey, it's capsizing!

413
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.180
He is Mr. Tachibana.

414
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.480
Huh?

415
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.580
Officer, wasn't Mr. Tachibana wearing a life jacket?

416
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.080
Come to think of it, he was wearing one this morning.

417
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.880
Really?

418
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.780
Then, why isn't he wearing it?

419
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:28.301
Next Conan, "Bay Of Revenge (Part 1)"
