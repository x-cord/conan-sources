1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.440
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.740
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.740
A tangled net murder case on the beach.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.840
The two girls also come to terms with each other today.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:02.453
We came to visit the ocean of Izu once again.

9
00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:06.753
Ran and the others got acquainted with Yuuta Yoshizawa,

10
00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:11.753
Noboru Shimojo, and Giichi Yoshizawa at the beach,

11
00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.953
but there was a somewhat scowl and dark atmosphere.

12
00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:20.153
That night, we coincidentally ran into

13
00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:22.353
Mr. Shimojo and Mr. Yoshizawa

14
00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:25.953
and their friend, Nobutsugu Nezu.

15
00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:30.653
The three seem to have been waiting for Mr. Aramaki.

16
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:38.053
But, at that time, Mr. Aramaki was ruthlessly being washed up to shore,

17
00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.353
a sorry sight and dead.

18
00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:50.453
"The Mystery Caught In the Net (Part 2)"

19
00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:04.653
Everybody sure is late.

20
00:03:12.853 --> 00:03:14.253
Okay, I got it.

21
00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:15.753
Keep at it.

22
00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:17.653
-Yes, sir. -Officer Yokomizo.

23
00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:21.153
I've figured it out.

24
00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:25.853
What did you figure out?

25
00:03:25.853 --> 00:03:29.353
The trick the killer used to drown that man.

26
00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:31.353
What?

27
00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:37.453
What's your reaction supposed to mean?

28
00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:41.653
And how did the killer do it?

29
00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:44.653
That boat that was drifting is a fake.

30
00:03:44.653 --> 00:03:47.753
The real trick is very simple and clear.

31
00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:52.653
The killer got the man wasted,

32
00:03:52.653 --> 00:03:56.153
wrapped him up in a net then threw him out on the beach.

33
00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.853
High tide comes and the man is rendered helpless,

34
00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:02.653
not being able to move, and drowning.

35
00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:05.453
So the killer didn't have to be at the scene of the crime to do it.

36
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.753
Sonoko, you're a genius.

37
00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:10.753
I am, aren't I?

38
00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:13.753
I don't mean to be a wet blanket,

39
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.253
but that's impossible.

40
00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:18.253
Because even at high tide,

41
00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:21.153
water can only increase several centimeters at a time,

42
00:04:21.153 --> 00:04:22.653
and not all at once instantaneously.

43
00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:27.353
If the waves touch the body and the water gradually increases,

44
00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:29.353
no matter what the case, the victim would've awakened.

45
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:32.653
Besides the victim was only tangled in the net

46
00:04:32.653 --> 00:04:34.953
and not tied up or anything.

47
00:04:36.153 --> 00:04:39.553
He could've gotten up and avoided the waves.

48
00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:41.753
He could've escaped on all fours

49
00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:44.553
to a place out of range from the waves.

50
00:04:44.553 --> 00:04:48.253
But, it would be a different story of course

51
00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:49.953
if he were given some strong sleeping pill or something.

52
00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:54.053
We haven't got any such report from the coroner yet, though.

53
00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.553
What then, what about this?

54
00:04:56.553 --> 00:04:59.353
The killer was holding him down with the net

55
00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:02.353
covered over the man until he drowned.

56
00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:03.953
How about it?

57
00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.253
There's no trick involved there.

58
00:05:07.253 --> 00:05:09.953
-No good either. -Sonoko.

59
00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:14.053
I see, that's what happened.

60
00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:19.353
That's why that person did something so weird.

61
00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.753
No doubt about it.

62
00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:24.153
That person's the killer.

63
00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:27.853
"Noboru Shimojo (34), Fisherman" -Moreover, hasn't realized yet...

64
00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:29.553
"Nobutsugu Nezu (35)" -that the trick that he used

65
00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:31.953
"Fisherman" -in an attempt to hide his crime

66
00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:33.253
"Yuuta Yoshizawa (34)" -is actually working against him

67
00:05:33.253 --> 00:05:35.253
"Fisherman" -and revealing what he did.

68
00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:40.653
Hey, come on, that's enough.

69
00:05:40.653 --> 00:05:43.453
Even all the onlookers have left already.

70
00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.053
We said all we have to say,

71
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.353
and if there's nothing more, I'm leaving.

72
00:05:48.353 --> 00:05:50.353
Please wait. Just a little while more.

73
00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:53.853
-What is it? -We need you to stay here just a little while longer.

74
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.453
Sonoko, you can't think of anything

75
00:05:56.453 --> 00:05:58.453
that has to do with the murder anymore, can you?

76
00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:00.853
So, let's go back to the hotel.

77
00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:02.353
I guess so.

78
00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:06.753
Don't tell me... Is something dawning on you?

79
00:06:06.753 --> 00:06:08.753
Like always?

80
00:06:08.753 --> 00:06:11.053
I guess it's just a plain old mosquito bite.

81
00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:15.553
Shinichi,

82
00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:18.053
it seems that the investigation's not going to see much progress for now,

83
00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:19.353
so why don't we get going too?

84
00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:22.153
Come on, what good is it going to do is to head on back?

85
00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:26.753
When Detective Agasa's got to start explaining the truth of the case?

86
00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.853
Then, you mean, don't tell me that...

87
00:06:28.853 --> 00:06:31.053
Yeah, I've figured the case out.

88
00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:33.853
I know now who drowned Mr. Aramaki on this beach,

89
00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:36.053
and the trick he used to carry it out too.

90
00:06:36.053 --> 00:06:37.353
I'm waiting for Mitsuhiko and the others to bring me

91
00:06:37.353 --> 00:06:40.453
the tools necessary to explain what happened,

92
00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:43.053
so when they come back move your lips like always

93
00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:46.553
and match it to my voice through the voice changer...

94
00:06:48.153 --> 00:06:49.953
It's not here.

95
00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:53.453
Oh no, I forgot the voice changer in the hotel room.

96
00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:55.453
Hey, hey.

97
00:06:55.453 --> 00:06:56.653
Here you are.

98
00:06:58.553 --> 00:06:59.853
Ai.

99
00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:01.953
Just as I thought.

100
00:07:01.953 --> 00:07:03.053
Thank you.

101
00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:05.953
It's amazing how you figured out we were here.

102
00:07:05.953 --> 00:07:09.153
You were taking so long to come back,

103
00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:11.153
so I asked the person at the hotel

104
00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:14.853
whether there was a murder or something that happened near the beach.

105
00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:18.553
I'm so sorry, you completely slipped my mind.

106
00:07:18.553 --> 00:07:21.753
Where is everybody else?

107
00:07:21.753 --> 00:07:23.153
They're...

108
00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:24.953
Hey!

109
00:07:25.953 --> 00:07:27.153
Conan.

110
00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:28.753
We found it.

111
00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:31.453
Here, a large shell.

112
00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:33.753
A dead starfish.

113
00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.853
Here. I asked the people living in the neighborhood

114
00:07:35.853 --> 00:07:38.653
to lend me a basin and bucket.

115
00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:41.353
What are you going to use all this for?

116
00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:43.553
Just wait and see.

117
00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:48.253
Please give me a break, will you, officer?

118
00:07:48.253 --> 00:07:51.653
Just when are we going to get to leave anyway?

119
00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:55.453
Like I said, just a little while more

120
00:07:55.453 --> 00:07:57.653
until Mr. Aramaki's estimated time of death is determined.

121
00:07:57.653 --> 00:08:00.353
Gosh. Just how long is it going to take?

122
00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:01.753
It doesn't take this long to wait

123
00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:03.953
for things like this in detective dramas on TV.

124
00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:08.953
Besides, isn't it impossible for us to have killed him?

125
00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:12.253
When we called his cell phone at 8:40 pm,

126
00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:16.453
someone answered and hung up right away.

127
00:08:16.453 --> 00:08:19.153
You've got the call received record for that call,

128
00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:21.553
and all three of us were at the Chinese restaurant of that hotel

129
00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:23.453
at that time anyway.

130
00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.453
If you insist on suspecting us,

131
00:08:26.453 --> 00:08:28.053
give us an explanation, will you?

132
00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:31.053
How on earth was the phone that was tangled up in the net together

133
00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:34.353
with Aramaki taken from such a distance?

134
00:08:34.353 --> 00:08:36.053
That's...

135
00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:37.953
It's the waves.

136
00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:41.353
See, look.

137
00:08:41.353 --> 00:08:42.853
That empty can...

138
00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:47.753
is just like Mr. Aramaki who was washed up to shore, isn't it?

139
00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:51.053
Mr. Aramaki was washed up to shore.

140
00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:55.153
I see, he rolled.

141
00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:59.153
Mr. Aramaki who was washed up to shore

142
00:08:59.153 --> 00:09:02.253
rolled on the beach pushed by the waves.

143
00:09:02.253 --> 00:09:04.653
That's so obvious.

144
00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:06.353
So what about it?

145
00:09:06.353 --> 00:09:08.653
Mr. Aramaki rolled along

146
00:09:08.653 --> 00:09:12.153
and the switch of the cell phone that was caught in the same net

147
00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:15.453
was pushed by a shell or something that was also in the net.

148
00:09:17.053 --> 00:09:20.953
With the next roll or something,

149
00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:23.653
the switch was pushed again and the phone was disconnected.

150
00:09:23.653 --> 00:09:27.153
As proof of that the cell phone that was found together

151
00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:29.153
with Mr. Aramaki was full of scratches.

152
00:09:29.153 --> 00:09:33.153
The same went for his clothes and body.

153
00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:35.953
No doubt about it.

154
00:09:35.953 --> 00:09:39.153
The phone connected when you called him Mr. Nezu

155
00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:41.753
was not because someone pushed the button,

156
00:09:41.753 --> 00:09:43.253
but because when Mr. Aramaki rolled around,

157
00:09:43.253 --> 00:09:47.053
the button of the cell phone just happened to be pushed.

158
00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:49.453
In other words, if the killer could predict

159
00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:51.653
that the body would roll on the beach,

160
00:09:51.653 --> 00:09:57.553
the killer didn't have to be here to connect and disconnect the phone.

161
00:09:57.553 --> 00:09:59.853
But, wasn't that just a coincidence?

162
00:10:01.053 --> 00:10:04.253
Maybe the body rolling on the beach could've been predicted,

163
00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:05.653
but how could the button of the cell be pushed

164
00:10:05.653 --> 00:10:08.853
at exactly the same time that Nobutsugu happened to call him?

165
00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:10.653
Wouldn't that have been impossible?

166
00:10:12.253 --> 00:10:14.053
I guess so.

167
00:10:14.053 --> 00:10:19.653
But, your alibi that was based on the phone call is no good now.

168
00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:22.453
If so, why don't you tell them to hurry up

169
00:10:22.453 --> 00:10:24.753
and check on the estimated time of death?

170
00:10:26.253 --> 00:10:27.253
Hello.

171
00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:31.853
What? You've got the victim's estimated time of death?

172
00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:35.653
Okay, great.

173
00:10:35.653 --> 00:10:36.753
Well?

174
00:10:36.753 --> 00:10:38.253
Well, you see...

175
00:10:40.253 --> 00:10:42.253
Hey. Cut out the whispering,

176
00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:44.253
but hurry and tell us.

177
00:10:44.253 --> 00:10:48.853
You know now what time Aramaki died, don't you?

178
00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:51.653
Yes, now we know.

179
00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:55.353
According to Mr. Aramaki's estimated time of death,

180
00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:58.253
the alibis of all three of you are voided.

181
00:10:58.253 --> 00:11:01.353
That is, all three of you remain suspects.

182
00:11:01.353 --> 00:11:03.353
-What? -What did you say?

183
00:11:03.353 --> 00:11:05.853
Then, when did he die?

184
00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:07.353
If you don't tell us what you know,

185
00:11:07.353 --> 00:11:09.353
how can we be convinced?

186
00:11:09.353 --> 00:11:12.853
I got to the Chinese restaurant after 7:00 pm?

187
00:11:12.853 --> 00:11:14.653
Yuuta got there at 8:00 pm sharp.

188
00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:17.953
And, Nobutsugu got there at 8:40 pm.

189
00:11:17.953 --> 00:11:21.553
It takes 10 minutes from here to the restaurant.

190
00:11:21.553 --> 00:11:23.453
Nobutsugu visited his father's grave

191
00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:25.153
before coming to the restaurant

192
00:11:25.153 --> 00:11:27.753
so I'm sure that somebody from the temple saw him.

193
00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.753
Come on. Tell us.

194
00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:31.953
What time did that guy die?

195
00:11:31.953 --> 00:11:34.753
If that time was when we couldn't be here,

196
00:11:34.753 --> 00:11:38.353
-we couldn't have committed the crime... -Not really...

197
00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:43.753
It can be done without being here...

198
00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:46.553
if this trick is used.

199
00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:58.561
Trick? Mr. Agasa.

200
00:11:58.561 --> 00:12:00.761
Just what are you doing?

201
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.461
Preparing to explain the trick

202
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.661
as I'm sure you all realize already.

203
00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:08.061
The sand that is...

204
00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.561
The sand in this basin is of course the sand of this beach.

205
00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:13.361
This starfish is the victim, Mr. Aramaki.

206
00:12:14.361 --> 00:12:18.961
And the water in this bucket is the water at high tide.

207
00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:23.361
Okay, back down everyone.

208
00:12:23.361 --> 00:12:24.461
-Okay. -Okay.

209
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:28.461
First a hole is made in the sand.

210
00:12:28.461 --> 00:12:29.761
One just big enough

211
00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:31.961
so that the body of a person lying down would fit inside.

212
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:33.561
Then, Mr. Aramaki who is drunk,

213
00:12:33.561 --> 00:12:36.861
wasted and asleep is placed into that hole

214
00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:38.561
with a net wrapped around him.

215
00:12:39.561 --> 00:12:41.561
Dr. Agasa.

216
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:43.861
Too bad, but that won't work.

217
00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:45.961
You want to explain that the body is wrapped in the net

218
00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:47.461
so it cannot pull free, then you wait for high tide

219
00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:50.361
and wait for the victim to drown on his own, right?

220
00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:51.861
But, that's impossible.

221
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:54.661
Because Officer Yokomizo just finished explaining

222
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:56.961
that even though there is a high tide,

223
00:12:56.961 --> 00:13:00.261
there is no way that the water would suddenly increase so many centimeters,

224
00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:02.061
so the victim would realize that he's drowning and would flee.

225
00:13:02.061 --> 00:13:06.361
How about if I use this?

226
00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:08.161
A shell?

227
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:11.261
You put and press this onto the victim,

228
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:12.761
then if a high tide comes...

229
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.561
I guess so.

230
00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.361
If a person is wrapped in a net and moreover,

231
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.061
has something like that put on him,

232
00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:21.361
he wouldn't be able to escape

233
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:24.461
even if he did realize that high tide was coming.

234
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:25.661
But, if it were so,

235
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:30.561
the large rock would've been found on his body when he was found.

236
00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:33.161
Was there anything like that around?

237
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:35.461
No, there wasn't.

238
00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:38.161
Right. If it were a plain rock,

239
00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:40.161
it would've just been left on him, but...

240
00:13:40.161 --> 00:13:44.061
If that weight looked something like this shell...

241
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:47.961
See what happens.

242
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.061
It floated up.

243
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:53.761
But, wait.

244
00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:57.961
Where did you find such a large and convenient shell?

245
00:13:57.961 --> 00:13:59.061
Don't tell me.

246
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:01.861
It's that boat?

247
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:06.261
Yes, the killer got Mr. Aramaki drunk.

248
00:14:06.261 --> 00:14:08.561
After wrapping him up in the net,

249
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:10.061
he was placed inside the hole that was dug in the sand,

250
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:14.361
and this boat was placed on top of him as a weight.

251
00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:17.361
This way, even if he did realize that water was covering him,

252
00:14:17.361 --> 00:14:20.461
it would be impossible for him to get up and he would drown.

253
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:24.561
After the water level increases even more the boat floats

254
00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:26.761
and drifts away from Mr. Aramaki.

255
00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:28.761
You were waiting for that time to come

256
00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:30.161
at the Chinese restaurant, weren't you?

257
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.961
Mr. Noboru Shimojo.

258
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:34.461
And, everything worked out as you planned.

259
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:41.161
Hey, Noboru.

260
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:42.461
Don't tell me, you...

261
00:14:43.561 --> 00:14:45.761
Mr. Shimojo, you...

262
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.261
Am I doing okay?

263
00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:50.161
Yeah, you're doing great.

264
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:52.561
Just keep on matching your lips.

265
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:57.061
But, what about the liquor bottle,

266
00:14:57.061 --> 00:14:59.861
sandals and button that were in the boat?

267
00:14:59.861 --> 00:15:01.361
With those things in the boat,

268
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:04.461
it would look like Mr. Aramaki were put on board the boat, but...

269
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:08.761
no one would even think that he was being locked up under the boat.

270
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:11.661
Moreover, the sea water that accumulated at the bottom of the boat

271
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.461
made it even heavier.

272
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:16.761
It was all planned to make it harder for Mr. Aramaki to escape.

273
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.961
It is true that from what you said just now,

274
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.161
it is possible to commit the crime without being here.

275
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:24.661
But, how did you come to the conclusion that I'm the one who did it?

276
00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:27.861
You knew the order of the incoming calls list

277
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.861
of Mr. Aramaki's cell phone, didn't you?

278
00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:33.261
That your name is listed next to Mr. Yoshizawa's.

279
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:36.861
That's because he said that he called

280
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:38.861
before coming to the Chinese restaurant.

281
00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:41.961
Mr. Yoshizawa came at 8:00 pm sharp.

282
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:45.861
You made the first phone call at 7:47 pm.

283
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.861
How did you know that Mr. Yoshizawa called Mr. Aramaki before you did?

284
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:52.061
So that's because...

285
00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:57.561
You knew that Mr. Yoshizawa called Mr. Aramaki's cell phone.

286
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:01.561
You heard the call come in when you were setting up the boat trick

287
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:05.361
that I just finished explaining.

288
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.661
I see.

289
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:09.761
Just what are you talking about?

290
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:12.261
You're just making an irresponsible remark.

291
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:15.261
I mean, so you're saying that I'm the killer

292
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:17.461
just because I made a mistake in the order of the received calls list.

293
00:16:17.461 --> 00:16:19.061
There's no proof that I carried out the trick

294
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:22.561
that you explained just now either.

295
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:24.561
It could be that somebody just got him drunk,

296
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:28.961
wrapped him up in a net and dropped him into the ocean. Right?

297
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:31.361
Right, Mr. Agasa.

298
00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:34.561
There is no proof that Mr. Shimojo committed the murder.

299
00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:37.061
There is no such thing.

300
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:40.361
What we have are all proof that are advantageous to you.

301
00:16:42.361 --> 00:16:44.061
That's right.

302
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:45.261
The only evidence that you have now

303
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:50.561
is that I was far away in that Chinese restaurant

304
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:52.861
at the time the guy died.

305
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:55.061
Who can testify that for you?

306
00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:58.761
Aren't you one of the witnesses for that too?

307
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:01.461
At what point of time are you referring to?

308
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:04.361
I've become a bit forgetful recently so...

309
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:05.661
Why do you...

310
00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:08.961
You were there too, weren't you, old fart?

311
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.161
Right by me, at the Chinese restaurant.

312
00:17:11.161 --> 00:17:13.461
At about 8:00 pm when he died!

313
00:17:14.461 --> 00:17:16.861
Wait a second, Mr. Shimojo?

314
00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:19.561
How do you know

315
00:17:19.561 --> 00:17:23.161
that Mr. Aramaki's time of death was about 8:00 pm?

316
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:27.761
I heard you whispering among yourselves a while ago.

317
00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:29.761
That's strange.

318
00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:33.061
The estimated time of death that was reported to me

319
00:17:33.061 --> 00:17:37.861
was from 6:00 pm to 9:30 pm when Mr. Aramaki was found dead.

320
00:17:37.861 --> 00:17:40.061
Don't give me that nonsense.

321
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.061
I'm sure you can get the details of his death, can't you?

322
00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:45.161
From things like postmortem rigidity and death spots.

323
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:46.761
Absolutely.

324
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:49.361
The estimated time of death is usually assumed

325
00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.561
by signs of postmortem rigidity,

326
00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:53.261
death spots and rectal temperatures, but...

327
00:17:53.261 --> 00:17:55.661
that is if the body is laid to rest

328
00:17:55.661 --> 00:17:58.961
in one place at constant temperature.

329
00:17:58.961 --> 00:18:01.361
However, in Mr. Aramaki's case,

330
00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:03.461
his body was tossed about by the waves and spun around.

331
00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:04.961
In this case,

332
00:18:04.961 --> 00:18:08.261
the blood accumulates at the bottom of the body because of gravity,

333
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:11.261
and it becomes impossible to judge by death spots.

334
00:18:11.261 --> 00:18:15.061
The muscles that become rigid are difficult to set in place.

335
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.861
Since his body was constantly covered with waves,

336
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:18.361
his body temperature kept changing.

337
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:20.461
Therefore, the speed of decrease of rectal temperature

338
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.161
did not take its normal course,

339
00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:25.861
making it impossible to arrive at an accurate estimated time of death.

340
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.361
In other words, nobody including the police know

341
00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:31.961
what time Mr. Aramaki died.

342
00:18:31.961 --> 00:18:34.961
But if you are the killer that set it up

343
00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:37.861
so that he would drown at that time, of course you would know.

344
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.461
Noboru.

345
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:53.561
Don't tell me you did it for our fathers...

346
00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:56.761
Yeah. Thank me for it.

347
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.761
I conjured up all the courage within me

348
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:04.261
to kill the punk Aramaki who killed our fathers eight years ago.

349
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:05.761
Eight years ago?

350
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:08.161
Wasn't that an accident that happened

351
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:09.861
because the men set out on their boat

352
00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:11.561
despite knowing that there was a storm?

353
00:19:12.561 --> 00:19:13.561
Our fathers didn't just sail out

354
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:16.261
because they wanted to prove how macho they were.

355
00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:19.661
Aramaki ignored the report of an oncoming storm and sailed out,

356
00:19:19.661 --> 00:19:22.661
so our fathers went out after him to call him back.

357
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:27.761
Aramaki lost control of the wheels because of the high waves,

358
00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:31.261
and not only did he crash into the boat of our fathers,

359
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:35.161
he left our fathers who were thrown out into the sea to die

360
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:37.461
and went back to shore alone!

361
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:40.461
I asked a timid mate that was on board his boat at that time

362
00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:44.061
and pressed him to tell me, so there's no mistake about it.

363
00:19:44.061 --> 00:19:47.861
Then, why didn't you take him to the police?

364
00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:51.661
He disappeared out of the blue.

365
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:53.161
What?

366
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.561
I asked Aramaki about him, and that guy,

367
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:58.361
without a tinge of guilt, wise cracked...

368
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:03.061
Do you know how a perfect crime is committed?

369
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:04.861
You set sail with another person and when you're out at sea,

370
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:08.661
you push the other guy off the boat.

371
00:20:08.661 --> 00:20:12.361
The body won't be found and there are no witnesses either.

372
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:14.561
How about it? Easy, right?

373
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:20.161
Which means that Aramaki killed that man too...

374
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:24.061
But, you didn't need to kill him, did you?

375
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:26.061
Now, you're just as guilty as he is.

376
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.861
Just what do you mean by that?

377
00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:33.961
I avenged the death of our fathers, for you guys too, you know?

378
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:35.661
After I sacrificed myself,

379
00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:37.161
went out of my way to conjure up courage

380
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:40.961
and pass judgment on that guy all by myself, what's...

381
00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:43.761
What right do you have talking to me like that?

382
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:45.761
No way.

383
00:20:45.761 --> 00:20:46.761
Ran.

384
00:20:51.061 --> 00:20:52.261
No way.

385
00:20:53.761 --> 00:20:57.961
The word courage is to be used to conjure up feelings of justice...

386
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:03.761
It should never be used to justify taking someone's life.

387
00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:19.161
The killer, who was rendered speechless at Ran's remark,

388
00:21:19.161 --> 00:21:22.761
was escorted silently to the Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department.

389
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.961
He wore a calm and sad smile on his face

390
00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:30.461
as he was being taken away.

391
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:09.661
Maybe I stuck my nose in too far.

392
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:12.461
Nope, you did just great.

393
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:14.361
You really surprised me.

394
00:23:14.361 --> 00:23:19.161
I just thought that was what Shinichi might've said.

395
00:23:19.161 --> 00:23:21.161
Are you in the mood for love or something?

396
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:22.761
No.

397
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:33.561
Courage...

398
00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:37.861
is a word to be used to conjure up

399
00:23:37.861 --> 00:23:39.861
feelings of justice.

400
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:47.161
I'm Ai Haibara.

401
00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:51.561
Nice to meet you.

402
00:23:55.061 --> 00:23:56.861
Nice to meet you.

403
00:23:56.861 --> 00:23:58.361
Let's be friends.

404
00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:10.361
"Next Episode"

405
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:14.361
Pops, his money and credit cards haven't been stolen.

406
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:24.661
All the documents have to do with the village heads work

407
00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:26.461
and are all dated today.

408
00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:28.061
Something's not right.

409
00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:29.261
Something.

410
00:24:29.861 --> 00:24:31.361
Next Conan,

411
00:24:31.361 --> 00:24:35.161
"Alibi of the Healing Forest"

412
00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:37.779
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:37.779 --> 00:24:40.479
"Pottery making soil"

414
00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:41.779
The stage for the next show will be at a pension.

415
00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:43.879
What? There's only 10 more days of summer vacation left?

416
00:24:43.879 --> 00:24:44.979
Oh, no!
