1
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.900
A racing second hand,
a shining comet!

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.930
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.350
The old guy goes on a date today!
All kinds of ripples are made!

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.320
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.860
His name?

7
00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:38.249
"Kogoro's Date Murder Case"

8
00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.579
Yum!

9
00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.659
Ordering pizza was a good idea!

10
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.359
That's for sure! We can't eat
dinners like this when Dad's around!

11
00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:59.589
He sure knows how to be careless,
though! He forgot everything!

12
00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:01.609
He must've been really happy.

13
00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.489
It's been ten years since
he's seen his friend, right?

14
00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.659
Yeah. He said he was
going to drink like crazy,

15
00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.349
so he'll be back late tonight.

16
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.529
I'm really sorry!

17
00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.279
Yeesh! What bad timing!

18
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.529
But I guess it is
a company emergency.

19
00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.109
We can get together
another time soon. Bye!

20
00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.409
Train â™ª2 on the Toto Loop Line
will be arriving momentarily.

21
00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.529
Please stand behind the
yellow line for your safety.

22
00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.199
It's still only 7:30?

23
00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.049
I should've gone
somewhere for more drinks.

24
00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.069
Six stops until Beika Station...

25
00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:21.989
Beika

26
00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.679
"Beika"...
Beika

27
00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.669
Just a second!

28
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.859
That was close.
I almost missed my stop.

29
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.189
Candy?

30
00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.719
Was I eating this before?

31
00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.199
What a poetic sight!

32
00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.359
Oh! It's you, Sachiko-san!

33
00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.739
It's me, Mori! Mori Kogoro!

34
00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:26.699
Remember? We've met in
the Poirot shop below my office!

35
00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.449
Oh, the great detective, Mori Kogoro-san!

36
00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
Shimamura Sachiko Import Company Manager
Oh, the great detective, Mori Kogoro-san!

37
00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.119
Yes! Come to think of it, isn't your
apartment building near here?

38
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.329
8:00?

39
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.589
Whoops! I forgot my watch!

40
00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:45.899
Say, Mori-san! Would you
like to go for a drive?

41
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.729
I know a place with
a beautiful night view!

42
00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.109
But it's no fun unless
you go with someone else!

43
00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:52.809
Won't you come with me?

44
00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.769
Sounds great! Let's go!

45
00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:57.059
Then I'll pull the car out!

46
00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.229
Are you cramped?

47
00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.729
You can pull the seat back.
There's a lever under the seat.

48
00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.419
Thanks...

49
00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.669
Huh?

50
00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:32.399
I was working late by myself earlier,

51
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:37.559
but I came back to check on
my roommate, who caught a cold.

52
00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.269
Don't you need to
go back to work, then?

53
00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:41.359
It's alright!

54
00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:46.319
Hearing your exploits as a great
detective would be even more useful!

55
00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.439
I'm so glad he had
an emergency come up!

56
00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.649
And the night is still young!

57
00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:03.059
Shimamura Sachiko
Takenaka Kazumi

58
00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.629
I had so much fun tonight!
Shimamura Sachiko
Takenaka Kazumi

59
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.229
I had a lot of fun, too!

60
00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.839
Well, good night!

61
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.399
Good night!

62
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.319
Huh?

63
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.809
Is something the matter?

64
00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:17.139
The door... It's unlocked...

65
00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:32.489
The deceased is Takenaka
Kazumi-san, a 29 year-old attendant.

66
00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:38.159
Mori-san and her roommate
Shimamura Sachiko-san found her.

67
00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.559
Judging from the rigor mortis
of her lower jaw and neck,

68
00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:48.169
she died approximately two-and-a-half
hours ago, around 9:00 pm.

69
00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:49.629
Still...

70
00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.729
Mori-kun! What are
those two doing here?!

71
00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.729
Sorry about that!

72
00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.519
I called to let them know,
and they came here on their own!

73
00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.479
What was Dad doing in a girl's home?!

74
00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:10.859
This is Sachiko-san's room.

75
00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:15.579
It connects to the victim's
room via dining room and kitchen.

76
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:20.059
And, as you can see,
this window is slightly open.

77
00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:23.539
She says she might've
forgotten to lock it.

78
00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:27.169
Meaning the killer entered
through this window?

79
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:30.649
But how would they
get onto this veranda?

80
00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.269
Inspector!

81
00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:34.109
Wait! That's dangerous!

82
00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:38.689
See! You can jump onto the
veranda from the emergency stairs!

83
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:40.269
What do you think you're doing?!

84
00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:46.109
The intruder probably didn't
realize Kazumi-san was sick in bed.

85
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:49.859
So, during a search for
things of value in the kitchen,

86
00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.729
the sound woke Kazumi-san,

87
00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:54.859
and the thief stabbed
her out of surprise!

88
00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:58.399
And then the intruder
escaped through the front door.

89
00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.899
In other words,
it was a robbery-murder!

90
00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.369
It would seem so.

91
00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:07.559
I'm sorry to ask, but
where were you at around 9:00?

92
00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:11.809
At that time, I was
taking a drive with Mori-san.

93
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:13.839
Eh?! With Mori-kun?

94
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:15.809
Y-Yes, well...

95
00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:18.899
But, Dad! Weren't you
meeting a friend tonight?

96
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:23.809
I did meet him, but something
came up so we ended early.

97
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:30.149
So I returned to Beika Station,
strolled around 2nd Street to sober up,

98
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:33.229
and then ran into Sachiko-san
behind Beika Middle School,

99
00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:35.739
as she was getting into her car!

100
00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.739
Behind the middle school?

101
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.059
When was this?

102
00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.659
Right at 8:00.
Then we both went for a drive.

103
00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:48.939
She knew a nice spot with
a good view of the Toto Bay Bridge,

104
00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:52.089
and we arrived there at about 8:30.

105
00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:54.939
We chatted for about an hour and a half

106
00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:59.809
while we drank beer and juice
she bought from a vending machine,

107
00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:02.599
and then left at around 10:10.

108
00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:06.019
We stopped by her office
for about five minutes,

109
00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:10.009
and then arrived here at about 10:50.

110
00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:15.229
That's when we found
the body and contacted you.

111
00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:17.869
Meaning you're her...

112
00:09:17.869 --> 00:09:20.199
Yes! I'm witness to her alibi!

113
00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:25.399
Still, what were you doing
behind Beika Middle School?

114
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:30.209
I run a small import
company on Akebono Street.

115
00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:32.879
I was working late by myself tonight.

116
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:36.629
But I was worried about Kazumi,
since she was in bed with a cold,

117
00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:41.559
so I came back to
check on her at around 7:50.

118
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:44.889
Did you see Kazumi-san then?

119
00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:48.899
I didn't really talk to her;
she was fast asleep,

120
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:52.359
so I left her alone and
went straight back to my car.

121
00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:56.239
Say. Why did you park your
car behind the middle school?

122
00:09:56.239 --> 00:09:57.309
Eh?

123
00:09:57.309 --> 00:10:00.559
Why didn't you use the
apartment building's parking lot?

124
00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:04.399
Our parking lot is a two-level,
top-bottom type, so it's a pain to use.

125
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:06.979
And I planned to
return to my office right after.

126
00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:09.619
Then couldn't you park in
front of the apartment building?

127
00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:13.289
I would have gotten in the way
of the buses that pass by the front.

128
00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.259
"To Shimamura Sachiko"...

129
00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:23.649
This is addressed to you.

130
00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:24.439
Eh?

131
00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:27.229
When did this package arrive?

132
00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:28.189
I don't know...

133
00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:31.729
Was it here when you came
to check on Kazumi-san?

134
00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:34.439
No, I don't remember.

135
00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:39.819
Understood. We'll check with
the delivery people tomorrow.

136
00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:48.119
Something really bothers me...

137
00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:50.859
Huh? The fish bones?

138
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:55.559
Not that. The reason Sachiko-san
parked her car behind Beika Middle School.

139
00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:57.059
Say, Dad.

140
00:10:57.939 --> 00:10:59.939
What did you talk
about for an hour and a half

141
00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:02.299
at the Bay Bridge view point?!

142
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:07.009
And why did you go
on a drive with her, anyway?!

143
00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:09.349
Dad! Don't tell me you two--

144
00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:13.729
W-What are you trying to say?!
I didn't do anything improper!

145
00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:16.559
Then tell me what you talked about!

146
00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:21.269
I don't remember everything we said!
Besides, halfway through--

147
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:22.439
Halfway through... what?!

148
00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:23.739
No, uhh...

149
00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:24.909
Dad!

150
00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:31.519
The truth is, we only
chatted for the first half hour.

151
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.919
I fell deep asleep after that.

152
00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:35.329
You fell asleep?

153
00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:39.589
Yeah. Drunkenness started
to set in while I had those beers.

154
00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:42.549
It was after 10:00 when she woke me up.

155
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:52.859
That's so funny!
You fell asleep during a date!

156
00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.939
Quit laughing! Sheesh!

157
00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:56.979
That's why I didn't want to say anything!

158
00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:00.109
He fell asleep halfway through?

159
00:12:00.109 --> 00:12:04.229
But he was awake
until 9:00, chatting with her.

160
00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:08.939
The murder took place
around 9:00. Her alibi is airtight.

161
00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:09.869
Wait a minute!

162
00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:13.979
Hey. You forgot your
watch yesterday, right?

163
00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:16.519
How did you know the time?

164
00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.519
I saw the clock in the car.

165
00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.089
What about before then?

166
00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:25.019
There was a clock in the bar,
and I saw a clock at Shibahama Station.

167
00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:26.859
What time was it?!

168
00:12:26.859 --> 00:12:28.049
7:30.

169
00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:29.359
7:30?

170
00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:34.479
It's fifteen minutes from Shibahama
Station to Beika Station.

171
00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:38.229
It's ten minutes by foot from
Beika Station to Beika Middle School.

172
00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:41.689
Which means you ran
into Sachiko-san at around...

173
00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:44.649
I already told you! 8:00 exactly!

174
00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:48.229
I heard the clock in a nearby house ring!

175
00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:50.869
Now eat your damn
food and go to school!

176
00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:52.519
Okay!

177
00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:55.359
He's right.
I should just forget about it.

178
00:13:02.809 --> 00:13:05.809
Three laps around the
schoolyard is really exhausting!

179
00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:07.379
I can't go on...

180
00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:10.009
Just a little more!
Hang in there, Genta!

181
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:13.519
Hey! Thinking about something
you like makes it go quicker!

182
00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:15.519
Something I like?

183
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:18.309
Alright! I'm gonna
have boxed eel lunch tonight!

184
00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:20.229
Boxed eel lunch!
Boxed eel lunch! Tonight--

185
00:13:20.229 --> 00:13:22.649
Wait, Genta! We're done now!

186
00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:25.859
Oh no. He's too busy thinking
about boxed eel lunches.

187
00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:28.399
I bet he's going to do another lap!

188
00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:32.559
Could it be?!

189
00:13:37.537 --> 00:13:39.347
One trip around the Loop Line?!

190
00:13:39.827 --> 00:13:45.317
Could you have fallen asleep
after you got on at Shibahama Station?

191
00:13:45.787 --> 00:13:48.167
A trip around the
Loop Line takes an hour!

192
00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:51.667
If you had gone around
it once while you were asleep,

193
00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:57.407
you would've reached Beika
Station at 8:40 instead of 7:40!

194
00:13:57.957 --> 00:14:02.537
Nonsense! I only slept for fifteen minutes!
I couldn't have looped around!

195
00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:04.997
Then let's see for ourselves!

196
00:14:04.997 --> 00:14:05.877
What?

197
00:14:06.127 --> 00:14:09.037
Let's all ride the Loop Line tonight!

198
00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:13.097
In the same train and train car
leaving Shibahama Station at 7:30!

199
00:14:14.537 --> 00:14:16.767
I guess that'll be fine...

200
00:14:25.997 --> 00:14:28.827
Well, Dad? Remember anything?

201
00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:32.917
No, I guess I was pretty out of it.

202
00:14:32.917 --> 00:14:34.997
But she can't be the killer!

203
00:14:34.997 --> 00:14:37.447
Let's just take a
full trip around. Okay?

204
00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:48.587
This is the furthest
stop from Shibahama Station.

205
00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:02.827
What is it? Do you know that man?

206
00:15:02.827 --> 00:15:04.397
Candy!

207
00:15:04.877 --> 00:15:07.817
He was sleeping with
his mouth wide open yesterday...

208
00:15:10.037 --> 00:15:12.107
...so he tossed a piece of candy in there!

209
00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:19.247
What time was that?!

210
00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:21.157
The same as today. Around 8:00.

211
00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:27.377
Which means I arrived at
Beika Station just before 9:00!

212
00:15:27.377 --> 00:15:31.167
And that I ran into Sachiko-san at 9:00!

213
00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:34.837
Yes! You arrived at the Toto
Bay Bridge view point at 9:30!

214
00:15:35.797 --> 00:15:37.717
Then you chatted for
thirty minutes, until 10:00!

215
00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:40.387
And then you woke up at 10:10!

216
00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:45.327
You were wrong about sleeping
for an hour and ten minutes!

217
00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:47.767
You only slept for ten minutes!

218
00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:52.037
In other words, she turned
the clock back an hour

219
00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:54.737
to use me for her alibi...

220
00:15:56.077 --> 00:16:00.327
Last night, she parked her
car in this out-of-the-way location

221
00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:03.207
and left to kill the victim.

222
00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:07.167
She entered through the window
she had unlocked in advance,

223
00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.167
made sound on purpose,

224
00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:13.257
then killed the awoken victim to
make it look like a robbery-murder.

225
00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:20.007
After that, she returned
here and ran into you.

226
00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:24.477
Come to think of it, she...

227
00:16:25.037 --> 00:16:30.827
Were they the bloodied clothes
and gloves she used in the murder?!

228
00:16:32.787 --> 00:16:37.067
If so, then she disposed of
them at the view point while you slept.

229
00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:42.877
She set the car clock an
hour ahead before you got in.

230
00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:46.167
Then, while you were asleep,
she put it back to normal.

231
00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:50.797
Damn it! How dare she
toy with the great Mori Kogoro?!

232
00:16:50.997 --> 00:16:53.257
Was there anything
else out of the ordinary?

233
00:16:58.077 --> 00:17:00.427
The children saw Mori-san?

234
00:17:00.427 --> 00:17:03.377
Your alibi no longer holds.

235
00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:09.357
You met Mori-kun behind
Beika Middle School just after the crime.

236
00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:16.457
But isn't it possible the
children mistook Mori-san

237
00:17:16.457 --> 00:17:18.817
for someone else who looks similar?

238
00:17:18.817 --> 00:17:21.167
That possibility does exist.

239
00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:24.407
Even if by some chance
my alibi doesn't check out,

240
00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:28.877
that doesn't mean
that I killed Kazumi-san.

241
00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:34.337
Yes, that's correct. But there is proof!

242
00:17:36.037 --> 00:17:38.507
I leave it in your hands today, old guy!

243
00:17:41.707 --> 00:17:44.967
Do you recognize this pen?

244
00:17:46.207 --> 00:17:49.977
Yes. It's your pen, isn't it?

245
00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:51.697
Dad!

246
00:17:51.697 --> 00:17:53.437
Are you alright, Mori-kun?!

247
00:17:53.787 --> 00:17:56.897
Oh, geez! Do I have
to do it after all?!

248
00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:03.117
Let us go back to
8:30 pm two nights ago.

249
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:09.667
A deliveryman knocked on the door,
and Kazumi-san answered it.

250
00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:12.337
However, she couldn't
find her ink stamp.

251
00:18:12.337 --> 00:18:14.167
With no other choice,

252
00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:18.007
she decided to sign for it
with a pen in the dining room.

253
00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:20.037
But it wouldn't write.

254
00:18:20.037 --> 00:18:23.757
Supposedly, the deliveryman
said it might be the ink,

255
00:18:23.757 --> 00:18:27.037
so he took the
pen and looked inside.

256
00:18:28.037 --> 00:18:34.477
Some ink was still left, and when
she tried to write again, it worked.

257
00:18:36.037 --> 00:18:42.577
When the deliveryman left,
Kazumi-san placed the pen by the phone

258
00:18:42.577 --> 00:18:45.827
and returned to her room to sleep.

259
00:18:45.827 --> 00:18:47.407
Twenty minutes later...

260
00:18:52.377 --> 00:18:56.787
Seeing your own
pen lying next to her body

261
00:18:56.787 --> 00:19:00.337
right after you killed her,
you instinctually picked it up and...

262
00:19:09.307 --> 00:19:11.517
Oh! It's you, Sachiko-san!

263
00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:17.877
Afterward, you invited me for a drive

264
00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:20.667
and moved the clothes and
gloves under the passenger seat

265
00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:22.697
to under the back seat.

266
00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:26.787
When you did,
the pen in your pocket fell out.

267
00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:36.707
You didn't seem to notice, but after
I got into the passenger seat,

268
00:19:36.707 --> 00:19:40.127
I dropped a pen from my suit, too.

269
00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:44.037
I assume you can guess
what happened next.

270
00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:49.517
What I picked up was
your pen instead of mine!

271
00:19:53.537 --> 00:19:59.227
We found the fingerprints
of you and Mori-kun on this pen.

272
00:19:59.227 --> 00:20:06.067
In addition, the fingerprints of
the deliveryman were on the ink stick.

273
00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:11.827
These fingerprints mean you
entered the apartment after 8:30!

274
00:20:11.827 --> 00:20:13.037
Isn't that right?

275
00:20:17.077 --> 00:20:19.747
Kazumi was blackmailing me!

276
00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:29.887
One year ago, I unknowingly
imported and sold outlawed goods.

277
00:20:29.887 --> 00:20:35.247
Kazumi knew this, and demanded
I pay her a set amount each month.

278
00:20:35.247 --> 00:20:40.827
She threatened to tell the banks
and cut off my financing if I said no,

279
00:20:40.827 --> 00:20:43.817
so I did as she said.

280
00:20:43.817 --> 00:20:47.277
But when I considered being
blackmailed for the rest of my life...

281
00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:49.787
You decided to kill her at once.

282
00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:51.247
Yes.

283
00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:55.747
When Mori-san called out to me,
I thought I was already done for.

284
00:20:56.877 --> 00:21:00.997
But I realized he thought it was
an hour earlier than it really was

285
00:21:00.997 --> 00:21:02.707
and decided to use that to my advantage.

286
00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:08.427
But what did you plan to do
for an alibi if he hadn't shown up?

287
00:21:08.917 --> 00:21:11.377
I set a video camera
in my office window

288
00:21:11.377 --> 00:21:14.387
and recorded the pub across the street.

289
00:21:14.387 --> 00:21:18.707
I planned to tell the police it
was one of the customers leaving

290
00:21:18.707 --> 00:21:20.057
at the time of the crime.

291
00:21:20.537 --> 00:21:23.957
So you stopped by your office
after your drive with Mori-kun

292
00:21:23.957 --> 00:21:27.027
to take down that video camera?

293
00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:32.457
Yes. The rest is all as Mori-san deduced.

294
00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:34.997
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

295
00:23:11.127 --> 00:23:13.717
Say. Can I ask you one thing?

296
00:23:13.717 --> 00:23:18.797
You could've killed him after he
fell asleep at the view point, right?

297
00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:19.677
Conan-kun!

298
00:23:20.877 --> 00:23:24.607
But you didn't. How come?

299
00:23:27.087 --> 00:23:32.157
I don't hold anything
against Mori-san, after all.

300
00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:51.007
This face... I've seen
it somewhere long ago...

301
00:23:54.577 --> 00:23:57.377
Come to think of it, you're always
wearing glasses, Conan-kun.

302
00:23:57.377 --> 00:24:00.667
Even when sleeping
or taking a bath. Why?

303
00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:02.837
I-I can't relax without them on.

304
00:24:05.007 --> 00:24:07.557
With Shinichi at a magic show...

305
00:24:07.917 --> 00:24:09.847
On the next Conan Special!

306
00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:13.535
"The Great Detective is Cornered!
Two Big Murder Cases in a Row."
