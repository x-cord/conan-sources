1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.100
A month after enrolment,

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.100
the students are already used to life at the police academy

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.800
and are now allowed to leave campus

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.500
as well as stay overnight off-campus.

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.800
Onizuka Class, do not stop!

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300
Let's finish cleaning up as quickly as possible

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.500
so we can eat!

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.700
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.000
Excuse me, Matsuda.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
Could you hand me the dustpan?

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Sure thing.

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.800
But you have to give it back to me, Rei!

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400
That was a terrible pun. Two points.

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700
Come on... That should have been zero points, don't you think?

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.100
They've become the best of friends.

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700
As Jinpei's best friend,

17
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
I can't help but feel a bit jealous.

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Hagiwara!

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
Don't forget about the mixer that's on the next day off!

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.800
Sure! It's all in your hands!

21
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200
Many handsome guys are coming!

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.300
Like that blond foreigner over there...

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.400
Who are you calling a foreigner?

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Well, no...

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.800
I'm sorry, sir.

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
-Please excuse us! -Please excuse us!

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.800
I'm from Tomori Cleaners.

28
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.400
I've come to retrieve the uniforms.

29
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800
I'm sorry that they're always drenched in sweat.

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.900
No problem at all.

31
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.200
You are the ones who will protect us citizens one day.

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
It's not a big deal.

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.400
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

34
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.500
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

35
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.700
Youth in full bloom!

36
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.800
The unbreakable bonds between Amuro and his friends!

37
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.500
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.600
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200
"Police Academy Arc, Wild Police Story"

41
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.900
"Case: Wataru Date"

42
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100
Oh, no...

43
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.300
I haven't prepared for the English lesson.

44
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.100
The English instructor always has it in for me.

45
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.200
I'm scared that I'm going to be called up in class.

46
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.000
In that case, you should have Furuya tutor you.

47
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.200
Isn't that right, Furuya?

48
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.200
Judging by your looks, you should be fluent in English.

49
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200
Well, more or less.

50
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.400
You can count on a blond half-foreigner like him.

51
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.600
I'm sure he's better at English than the instructor.

52
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.700
Hey! You shouldn't judge a person by their looks!

53
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.900
Well, I wasn't...

54
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.400
And...

55
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400
Don't try to look cool by putting a toothpick in your mouth.

56
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.700
It's disgusting.

57
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.300
I'm sorry...

58
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.300
It's all right if you get it.

59
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.000
Be careful next time.

60
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600
Say, Squad Leader...

61
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.200
Could it be true that you like Furuya?

62
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.800
You did cover for him during the clean-up.

63
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.900
What?

64
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.200
It's all right, you don't have to hide it.

65
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.700
I don't mind that kind of thing.

66
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.200
There's no way I like him like that!

67
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.800
I do have a girlfriend.

68
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.200
What?

69
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.400
You guys are too surprised.

70
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.100
Oh, no...

71
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.700
You talked about us to the guys at the police academy?

72
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.800
Sorry, I blurted it out while in the moment.

73
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.300
But we promised to keep it from others

74
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.700
until I met your parents.

75
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.200
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.800
Did you ask your dad about his schedule?

77
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.900
It would be better if I met him sooner than later.

78
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.100
We don't have to worry about that old man.

79
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.300
There you go, saying that again.

80
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.400
So?

81
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.300
How is the academy going for you?

82
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.500
It's quite fun.

83
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.100
There's a guy who's quick to fight,

84
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.000
and there's a flashy smooth-talker.

85
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.500
There's also a guy who is calm on the outside

86
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.400
but is desperately looking for something in private.

87
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
There's a guy who gets involved in things

88
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.200
because he looks a bit different, like you.

89
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200
They're all interesting, so there's never a dull moment.

90
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.700
I'll introduce them to you when I get the chance, Natalie.

91
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.300
I'm looking forward to that.

92
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.200
Taiho-jutsu is a technique developed

93
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.400
based on ancient Japanese martial arts

94
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400
to restrain and capture suspects and criminals alike!

95
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.500
Hits are valid if they are on the chin,

96
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.700
shoulders, chest and forearms!

97
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.200
You can attack using thrusts, kicks,

98
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.700
locks, throws, chokeholds and grappling holds,

99
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.100
or by using batons, canes, and handcuffs.

100
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.900
You will need to put your opponent into submission

101
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.600
without hurting them or yourself.

102
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.700
One point! Stop!

103
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.600
Good work out there.

104
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.500
Gosh, is Squad Leader strong or what?

105
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
Goodness, I could still win against him

106
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.200
if it came to good old fisticuffs.

107
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.600
I won't lose when it comes to women or cars.

108
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.300
But Squad Leader said he has a girlfriend.

109
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.400
How about we go somewhere this weekend to change our luck?

110
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.600
I'd be fine if it was the car shop or the bike shop,

111
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.100
but not the DIY store.

112
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.100
In that case, I'll come with you.

113
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.900
So it's decided, then.

114
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.900
Do you want to go to the car shop or the bike shop?

115
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.900
Speaking of that bike shop,

116
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.400
I saw a man with a strange tattoo there the other day.

117
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.000
A strange tattoo?

118
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yes, a tattoo of a cup that has a base...

119
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.900
I think it's called a goblet?

120
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.500
What kind of man is he?

121
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.800
Where does he live? What's his name?

122
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800
I don't know any of that!

123
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.300
Hey, what's the matter, Morofushi?

124
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.700
Sorry, Matsuda.

125
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.600
If you're that curious,

126
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.400
how about we go to the bike shop tonight?

127
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.000
One point!

128
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.300
He won against 10 people!

129
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.700
Next up, Furuya!

130
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.800
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.800
This is a must-watch.

132
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.500
Furuya has the upper hand in his studies.

133
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.400
But how will this turn out?

134
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.700
Come on, Zero!

135
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.100
Don't lose to Mr. I-Have-A-Girlfriend!

136
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.900
So that's what you're annoyed about?

137
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.200
Begin!

138
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.300
Hagi, how about we bet on who's going to win?

139
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.200
I bet one fried noodle bun that Zero is going to win.

140
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.700
Then, I bet one melon bun that Squad Leader will win.

141
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.200
If this goes on, he'll force his way through.

142
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.100
No, I'm sure his knees are hurting from his bout with me earlier.

143
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.400
There's no way Zero would miss that.

144
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400
You're playing dirty.

145
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.400
-Zero? -Oh, come on!

146
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.800
That fried noodle bun is mine!

147
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.300
You are only able to put your opponent into submission unhurt

148
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.700
when you actually put them into submission.

149
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.200
I'm disappointed in you, Furuya.

150
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.400
Why didn't you hit my knees?

151
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.100
Why did you hesitate?

152
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.800
If this had been a crime scene,

153
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.800
you would have been badly hurt,

154
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.300
and the suspect would have run away.

155
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.700
Compassion will not work on vicious criminals.

156
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.100
If you show weakness,

157
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.600
they will absolutely take advantage of that.

158
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600
The only thing left would be the worst kind of end,

159
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.000
just like my father had.

160
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.300
If you're not stronger than anyone else,

161
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.800
justice will not be served!

162
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.100
Was there something wrong with what I said?

163
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.800
If you're not stronger than anyone else,

164
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.200
justice will not be served!

165
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.600
Come in.

166
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600
Zero. Sorry, were you asleep?

167
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.400
No, just lying down thinking about a thing or two.

168
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.700
I see.

169
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.500
I'm about to go out with Matsuda and Hagiwara,

170
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.800
so do you want us to get you anything?

171
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.600
Nothing comes to mind.

172
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600
Really?

173
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.500
Okay, then. Sorry to disturb you, Zero.

174
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.600
It's fine.

175
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.200
If you're going to a convenience store, I'd like a tube of toothpaste...

176
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.700
They're gone.

177
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.100
Oh, well. I guess I have to go out myself, then.

178
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.100
Squad Leader Date?

179
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.400
Furuya.

180
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.800
I'm sorry for what I did to you at the dojo earlier.

181
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.200
I said a little too much...

182
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.800
Not at all.

183
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.300
None of you was involved with what happened to my father, after all.

184
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.600
If I recall, your dad was a police officer. Isn't that right?

185
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.800
He was the head patrol officer attached to a neighbourhood police station.

186
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.100
He was tall, thin and frail-looking,

187
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.800
but I respected him.

188
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.100
He was off duty until that day.

189
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.200
Hey, dad. Why do you always have a toothpick in your mouth?

190
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.600
Well, I'm thin and don't look too reliable, do I?

191
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.700
So I have a toothpick in my mouth to look tough to the bad guys!

192
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.200
How about you buy me some toothpicks, dad?

193
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.700
Kids should make do with lollipops!

194
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.700
Hurry, dad!

195
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.200
Okay.

196
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.900
The incident happened right after my father entered the store.

197
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.600
An enraged man with blood splattered all over

198
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.400
and a wooden sword in one hand jumped inside

199
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.500
while crying out, "Give me money".

200
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.900
Of course, everyone in the store was in a huge panic,

201
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.000
but I wasn't scared at all.

202
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.100
There was only one of them.

203
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.000
I was sure my father, a police officer,

204
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.900
would do something about it.

205
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.900
That's what I believed when I saw...

206
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.800
You can have my wallet if you want,

207
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.700
so please leave this store alone!

208
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.900
My dad is a police officer!

209
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.900
He's going to beat you up!

210
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.300
My words were like oil to a flame.

211
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.300
The man beat my father with the wooden sword over and over.

212
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.900
A patrol car's siren was heard in the area,

213
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.100
so the man fled from the convenience store.

214
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.100
My father ended up staying in a hospital for a year

215
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.600
and quit the police force because of the injury.

216
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.500
I only found this out later,

217
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.600
but the criminal was a member of a crime syndicate

218
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.800
who had lost in a dispute and wanted funds to escape.

219
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.200
He later went into another store and assaulted someone else.

220
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.500
In other words...

221
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.600
If my father had been strong enough

222
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.500
to apprehend the man then and there,

223
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.300
justice would have been served

224
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.800
without someone else getting injured.

225
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.700
Sorry for making you listen to such a pointless story.

226
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.400
Don't make any noise!

227
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.100
Why won't you tell me?

228
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.900
The guy with the goblet tattoo is a regular at this shop, isn't he?

229
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.500
So why are you looking for him?

230
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.700
Hey, Morofushi, tell him!

231
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.400
The reason you're looking for the guy!

232
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.000
That's...

233
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.900
Morofushi...

234
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.500
Well, we can't disclose personal information

235
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.300
about our customers without a valid reason.

236
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.500
Didn't we say we forgot the reason we're looking for the guy?

237
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.000
You have to tell us, or...

238
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.200
I remember now!

239
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.400
Didn't Squad Leader tell us about it at the dojo?

240
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.300
The thing from when his father.

241
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.300
Yes.

242
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.000
When I was a kid,

243
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.500
I once saw an older man with similar eyebrows as Squad Leader

244
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.500
being beaten up by a yakuza guy at a convenience store.

245
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.200
Hagi, tell us the details!

246
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.200
Stop dawdling!

247
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.800
Now put your phones in that basket!

248
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.300
Yes...

249
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.400
Is that all of them?

250
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.200
Yes.

251
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.800
Furuya. There are two of them.

252
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.900
If you and I deal with one each,

253
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.700
we can apprehend them.

254
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.600
-First, I'll draw the attention of -Oh, this is the latest smartphone.

255
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.200
-the guy in the knit cap. -Idiot.

256
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.800
-Then, you'll be able to... -We'll get as many as we want

257
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800
-Wait. -once we finish this job!

258
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.400
Something isn't right.

259
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.200
Why didn't they take money from the cash register

260
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.200
and make a run for it right away?

261
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.700
Beats me.

262
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.900
But our priority is to make sure all the customers here are safe.

263
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.000
We haven't been restrained yet,

264
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.800
so this is our chance.

265
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.200
What are you two whispering about?

266
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.700
I'll kill you.

267
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.100
Gosh. So the store clerk is one of them.

268
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.000
Let's get this started.

269
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.800
Come on, now... Just how many of them are there?

270
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.000
Don't be so slow!

271
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.500
Get walking!

272
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.900
How much longer?

273
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.300
After another 400 or 500 thousand, I guess.

274
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.600
Listen up! I don't want to hear any sound from you guys!

275
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.700
Gosh, we have to do something about these restraints first.

276
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.200
What are you doing?

277
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.100
I see! If we rub the restraints against the shoelaces,

278
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.000
the heat from the friction will break them!

279
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.700
Nice one, Furuya!

280
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.800
Let's release everyone from their restraints too!

281
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.600
So it is locked after all.

282
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.300
But still, what are the criminals here for?

283
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.900
They're probably after the cash stored in the ATM.

284
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.700
For security reasons, the timing of when cash is replenished

285
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.000
isn't known to anyone,

286
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.900
but they could make an estimate

287
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.600
if they check the ATM's security footage for large deposits.

288
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.100
I see. So they wouldn't be able to do it

289
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.700
unless the store clerk is in on it, too.

290
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.700
That's right.

291
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.000
But why aren't they covering their faces?

292
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.500
The store clerk isn't even wearing sunglasses.

293
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.900
They are probably

294
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.800
set on leaving no hostage alive when they're done.

295
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.300
That can't be!

296
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.300
I just came in to buy some water.

297
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.800
I just wanted to buy my daughter some snacks.

298
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.000
Don't worry! We'll work something out!

299
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.600
Anyway, we have to figure out a way to get us all out of here.

300
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.100
A switchboard.

301
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.400
This could work.

302
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.400
That's true.

303
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.200
If something like that had happened,

304
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.200
it isn't a stretch to say that

305
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.200
Squad Leader Date would think his father was a coward.

306
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.400
Yes.

307
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.300
An active-duty police officer

308
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.900
was bowing his head to a criminal, after all.

309
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.900
I wouldn't say I don't understand Squad Leader's feelings.

310
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.800
When my father was mistakenly apprehended on suspicion of murder,

311
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.500
people would call me a murderer's kid,

312
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.700
and I was close to hating him for that.

313
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.500
In my case, I was told by the people at the gym

314
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.900
to trust my father and wait,

315
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.200
so it didn't break my faith in him in the end.

316
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200
So, Morofushi...

317
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.400
I don't know what happened in your past,

318
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.700
but if you'd tell us,

319
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.600
perhaps our comments could help you out.

320
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.400
Help me.

321
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.500
What, now?

322
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.400
No! Look over there!

323
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.500
The convenience store light is flickering

324
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.200
like someone is giving out a signal in Morse code.

325
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.600
Hey, that's...

326
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.800
Someone is actually giving out a signal.

327
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.100
No way! It's being remodelled?

328
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.200
I guess we have to go to a different convenience store.

329
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.300
It seems the security company car has given us the signal.

330
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.900
Remove the sign saying the store is being remodelled.

331
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.000
Sure.

332
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.600
-Hey, there! -Hey, there!

333
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.500
What, seriously? Isn't that a rifle?

334
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.200
Don't be such a wuss!

335
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.800
It must be a fake that's used for filming or something!

336
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.800
Hey, what are you filming?

337
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.700
Let us be in it, too!

338
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.900
What's going on? What's with the commotion?

339
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.600
-Well... Three weirdoes have entered the store. -So I'll have a tequila,

340
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.200
-Idiot! -perfect for someone playing a police officer!

341
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.000
There are only three of them,

342
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.300
so kill them!

343
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.900
No way! So there's really a movie being filmed here?

344
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.100
That gets me so excited!

345
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.400
What?

346
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.900
Hey, guys! They said they would let us come on as extras!

347
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.300
-Yes. -Good!

348
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.600
It sure is noisy out there.

349
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.800
What's going on?

350
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800
Sorry to keep you waiting, Zero!

351
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.500
-Hiro! -Morofushi, why are you here?

352
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.000
We saw the Morse code signal you put up,

353
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.900
so we're here to apprehend the criminals.

354
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.600
Not with strength,

355
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.500
but with numbers.

356
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.200
Well, we only did what your father would have done.

357
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.200
What?

358
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.000
Isn't that right, Hagi?

359
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.100
Yes.

360
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.700
What do you mean by

361
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.900
what my father would have done?

362
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.800
I was actually there

363
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.700
when your father was beaten up by the yakuza guy

364
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.400
in that convenience store.

365
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.300
You were there?

366
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.000
Yes.

367
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.200
You might not have realised this because you were taken aback

368
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.000
by the sight of your father covered in blood,

369
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
but a few of the man's accomplices

370
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.200
entered the store not long afterwards.

371
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.900
What are you doing?

372
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.900
The cops are coming! Run for it!

373
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.400
Your father had probably noticed that

374
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.500
the man's accomplices were hiding in a nearby car.

375
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.000
So even if he had apprehended the man,

376
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.600
there was no way he'd win if the accomplices were to come in.

377
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.700
There would be a scuffle inside the store,

378
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.400
and in case he had been surrounded,

379
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.300
the other customers would be in danger as well.

380
00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.300
At the time, I was there with quite a few pregnant women and old folks.

381
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.300
Besides, the police came pretty quickly.

382
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.100
Your father probably contacted them

383
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.900
and stopped the man in his tracks

384
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.400
before he could get farther into the store

385
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.800
until they arrived.

386
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.200
So, Squad Leader...

387
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.700
Your father didn't bow to beg for his life,

388
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.800
but he bowed because his police officer's heart

389
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.200
wouldn't let anyone else get hurt. Am I wrong?

390
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.900
Hello?

391
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.300
Hey, dad. How are you?

392
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.500
Wataru? What's the matter?

393
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.200
You called me out of the blue...

394
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.100
What? There's someone you'd like me to meet?

395
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.500
So you're already that age...

396
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.400
I'm 22 years old now.

397
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.900
It's been a while since we last saw each other,

398
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.700
so you might have forgotten...

399
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.300
Anyway, how's the police academy going for you?

400
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.900
Do you think you'll be able to become a good police officer?

401
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.800
Yes.

402
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.900
But I'm no match for you, dad.

403
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.000
Don't say something so stupid.
