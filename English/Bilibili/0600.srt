00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.140
Dear Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.440
I respect you as a famed detective

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.040
and would like to ask you something.

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.040
11 years ago, I was indicted for murder.

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040
Please prove my innocence

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.340
and clear my name for me with your great deduction.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.040
I will talk the details over with you on December 19th,

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.540
at Kora Inn in Kuchibashi Village,

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.240
Gunma prefecture, near the site the murder.

10
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.440
Mika Tatezato.

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.040
I mean, is that person trying to meet with you, dad,

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.240
while that person is still on the run as a murderer?

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.740
Yeah. It could be.

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.840
It could be?

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
Is it really going to be alright for you to see her?

16
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.440
Right! Let's contact the police first.

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.840
I thought so too.

18
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.740
So I had Yamamura of Gunma prefectural police check for me,

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.040
but was told that no murder committed near that inn 11 years ago.

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.740
There seems to be no fugitive by the name Mika Tatezato either.

21
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.940
Yamamura said he thinks it's a bad prank.

22
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.940
Then why'd you come?

23
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.340
I had no other choice, did I?

24
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.940
Since I ate using the cash that was in the envelope

25
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.840
together with the letter.

26
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.140
You use it to eat...

27
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.840
Don't tell me, you mean yesterday's Chinese cuisine?

28
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.240
Come to think of it,

29
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.940
Pops was ordering a whole lot of expensive food and drinks.

30
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.040
Well...

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.340
I'm just going to go check if it's really a prank or not!

32
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.740
Brooding over passing seasons

33
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.540
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

34
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.440
Today's the 600th time that we've been aired on TV.

35
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.740
The green legend, curse of the water sprite?

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:21.045
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 1)"

40
00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:36.745
You idiot!

41
00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:39.945
-Watch out! -I'm sorry!

42
00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:42.845
Are you people by chance going to the Kora Inn?

43
00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.045
Yes! That's right.

44
00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:48.045
If so, could you give me a lift?

45
00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:50.645
I've got reservations at that inn too today.

46
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.645
Yeah, I don't mind.

47
00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:56.645
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:02.945
Well, you're a life-saver!

49
00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:05.745
I thought of walking from the station,

50
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.745
but I ran out of breath part way.

51
00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:10.345
Could you by chance be Mr. Tatezato?

52
00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:15.045
"Rokuro Tokubi (42)" -No. My name is Rokuro Tokubi.

53
00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:24.145
But, I think it's pretty far from the station.

54
00:04:24.145 --> 00:04:29.245
Yes. I used to be an elementary school teacher near here before,

55
00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:33.145
and used to like to walk around here looking at the scenery.

56
00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:36.645
But, I don't seem to be able to walk like I did before.

57
00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:39.445
Well, but that school is closed now

58
00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:41.145
and I quit my job as a teacher.

59
00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.345
Now, I'm an unknown artist.

60
00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:44.345
That's right!

61
00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:46.245
Since I've already got you to give me a lift,

62
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:49.845
could I ask you to stop over at a grave site?

63
00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:52.345
What? Grave site?

64
00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:56.545
I see...

65
00:04:56.545 --> 00:04:59.645
A child got drifted away and drowned?

66
00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:00.645
Yes.

67
00:05:00.645 --> 00:05:04.345
The boy who died was named Tatsuhiko Numayama,

68
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:07.945
and he seems to have drifted all the way to the reservoir downstream.

69
00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:10.145
Does that have something to do with a murder

70
00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:12.845
that was committed 11 years ago?

71
00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.545
It wasn't murder, it was an accident!

72
00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:18.645
He seems to have been playing at the river despite heavy rainfall

73
00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:20.545
and seems to have been taken away by the current.

74
00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:23.545
But, I think that was about 10 years ago.

75
00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:27.545
Mr. Tokubi.

76
00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:31.145
It's you, Araiwa, right?

77
00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:33.845
Did you come to pay homage to the grave too?

78
00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:34.845
Yes.

79
00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:38.745
"Kazuki Araiwa (21)" -Today is Tatsuhiko's memorial day.

80
00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:42.145
But, this sure is a shabby tombstone.

81
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:45.345
No, the real tomb is elsewhere.

82
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.545
This is a tombstone that the classmates

83
00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:51.345
made for Tatsuhiko when he passed away.

84
00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:55.645
In place of his bones, we buried things in memory of him.

85
00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:59.945
Of course, I went to pay homage to his real grave too.

86
00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:03.245
But, why here?

87
00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:08.845
Because he died taken away by the current of this river in back.

88
00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:11.545
On this day, 11 years ago.

89
00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:14.745
11... 11 years ago?

90
00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:18.445
This have to do with the murder written in the letter, after all?

91
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:20.145
Letter?

92
00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:23.445
How did you know that he was taken by the current of this river?

93
00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:27.545
He was found in the reservoir downstream, right?

94
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:29.645
His shoe was found.

95
00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:32.045
Tatsuhiko's shoe that was stuck between the rocks

96
00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.045
at the bottom of the river.

97
00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:38.045
So, the police concluded that Tatsuhiko,

98
00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:40.445
who was playing at the river, got his foot stuck.

99
00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:42.145
In the meantime, it began to rain harder

100
00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:47.245
and he was carried away in a flash flood.

101
00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:51.245
But to play at the river in December...

102
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:56.145
I wonder about where in the river that shoe was found.

103
00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:59.545
Over there, where the rock is sticking out.

104
00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:01.545
Just about here I think it was.

105
00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:04.545
Is that shoe in some place right now?

106
00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:06.945
About that, we buried it in the grave.

107
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:09.445
I think you can take a look at it if you dig it out.

108
00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.245
-Hey! -No!

109
00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:17.445
We're fine!

110
00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:19.245
Because it's shallow.

111
00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:26.545
My painting tools somehow made it okay,

112
00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:29.245
but I can't use this sketchbook anymore.

113
00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:33.745
These incense are useless too.

114
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.845
As for me, my bag is made of vinyl

115
00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:39.445
so almost nothing got wet.

116
00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:42.145
The cap of my PET bottle was closed tightly,

117
00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.045
and my change of clothes and pillow are also fine.

118
00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:45.745
Hey!

119
00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:48.145
Just what're you guys doing?

120
00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:54.145
You guys look familiar?

121
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:56.445
I'm Tatsuhiko's friend

122
00:07:56.445 --> 00:07:58.745
and I came to pay homage to his grave.

123
00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.545
Pay homage to his grave?

124
00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:02.945
What the heck's this grave worth?

125
00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:08.745
"Banzo Numayama (51)" -Listen! My son died 11 years ago!

126
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:10.845
Forget it already!

127
00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:13.945
Son?

128
00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:19.845
So, he's the late Tatsuhiko's father.

129
00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.945
Yes. He's the owner of the inn

130
00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:24.645
that we're headed for as well.

131
00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:25.745
-What? -What?

132
00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:29.845
But, why was the owner of the inn in a place like that?

133
00:08:29.845 --> 00:08:32.445
I think he was on guard watching.

134
00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.045
-What? -On guard watching?

135
00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:38.145
That inn is on a highland.

136
00:08:38.145 --> 00:08:40.145
And it seems if you use binoculars

137
00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:44.345
and look out the small window of the attic, you get a panoramic view.

138
00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:47.145
"Kora Inn" -What? She's not here?

139
00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:51.345
Are you sure that a person named Mika Tatezato is not staying here?

140
00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:55.045
I'm supposed to meet that person here early tomorrow morning.

141
00:08:55.045 --> 00:08:57.045
There's no such person...

142
00:08:57.045 --> 00:09:01.245
How about about a murder case that occurred 11 years ago?

143
00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:03.445
-I've no idea... -You've no idea?

144
00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:06.345
There was.

145
00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:08.045
"Bosuke Nohira (45)" -But the story is

146
00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:11.445
that the culprit is a water sprite, though.

147
00:09:11.445 --> 00:09:13.445
Water sprite?

148
00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:16.045
Yes.

149
00:09:16.045 --> 00:09:19.845
In this area, deep-rooted legends of the water sprite remain.

150
00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:22.445
About 12 to 13 years ago,

151
00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:25.645
people saying they saw water sprites appeared,

152
00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:29.545
TV crews and magazine reporters came here for the scoop.

153
00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:32.345
Immediately afterwards, a kid drowned in the river.

154
00:09:32.345 --> 00:09:35.745
And people began clamouring that it was the work of a water sprite.

155
00:09:35.745 --> 00:09:39.645
But after that, there were no more eye-witness reports of water sprites

156
00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:43.345
and virtually no one comes to this shabby place anymore.

157
00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:46.145
Wait!

158
00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:49.745
The name on this letter Mika Tatezato.

159
00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:51.445
If you split the kanji characters "tate", "zato",

160
00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:55.445
"mi", "ka" and rearrange them...

161
00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:57.045
"Water Sprite"

162
00:09:57.045 --> 00:10:00.645
Wouldn't it form the kanji character for "water sprite"?

163
00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:02.445
I'm sure that's what it is!

164
00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:05.045
The water sprite called dad,

165
00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:07.645
the detective here to prove its innocence and clear its name!

166
00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:09.645
Everyone is being thrown

167
00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:12.645
into panic by senseless superstition!

168
00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:16.245
If you insist on continuing to talk about non-existent ghosts,

169
00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:18.545
I'm kicking you out of this inn!

170
00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.445
Are you really sure?

171
00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:26.145
That you dropped your cell phone near that river.

172
00:10:26.145 --> 00:10:29.445
When we were at the river I got mail from Sonoko

173
00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:30.645
and I was texting her back.

174
00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:33.145
That's when the two men fell into the river,

175
00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:36.045
I probably dropped it then...

176
00:10:36.045 --> 00:10:38.945
Couldn't we do this tomorrow?

177
00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:42.045
I thought so too, but Conan...

178
00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:43.545
If the battery of the cell phone dies,

179
00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:46.445
we won't be able to hear the ring tone

180
00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:49.045
and won't be able to locate it, right?

181
00:10:51.345 --> 00:10:54.045
I think it was around here.

182
00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:56.045
Let's split up and look for it!

183
00:10:58.445 --> 00:11:01.445
-Hey! Are you calling? -Yep!

184
00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:08.945
I found it!

185
00:11:15.645 --> 00:11:18.645
What? What's that noise?

186
00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:29.545
Hey, what's wrong?

187
00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:32.045
Water sprite!

188
00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:34.045
What? Water sprite?

189
00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:39.945
There's no such thing around!

190
00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:41.845
I saw one a while ago!

191
00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:45.545
It stood up in the river and looked this way.

192
00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:51.145
You found your cell phone!

193
00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.545
Yes.

194
00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:58.545
It's started raining!

195
00:11:58.545 --> 00:11:59.845
Let's go back.

196
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.745
I guess so.

197
00:12:06.845 --> 00:12:08.245
"Kora Inn"

198
00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:11.445
What? You saw the water sprite?

199
00:12:11.445 --> 00:12:16.045
Yes. My daughter says that it was there at that river last night.

200
00:12:16.045 --> 00:12:20.045
Well, I think she mistook a branch or something for it though.

201
00:12:20.045 --> 00:12:23.245
I tell you it was really there!

202
00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:27.345
Maybe that was a ghost...

203
00:12:27.345 --> 00:12:28.345
Ghost?

204
00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:31.945
I think you should cut out the talk about the water sprite.

205
00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:35.345
Otherwise, that man's going to come shouting again.

206
00:12:37.045 --> 00:12:38.545
Here he comes!

207
00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:41.445
Bad news!

208
00:12:41.445 --> 00:12:43.145
The owner...

209
00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:44.145
-What? -What?

210
00:12:45.245 --> 00:12:49.845
The dead body was lying on the floor of the dimly lit attic.

211
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.645
As if possessed by the water sprite,

212
00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:55.645
and dragged to the bottom of the reservoir,

213
00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:59.445
covered in a rancid liquid that stung our noses.

214
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:03.445
Clenching his deceased son's belongings to his chest.

215
00:13:09.492 --> 00:13:11.492
"Kora Inn" -What?

216
00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:12.892
Drowned to death?

217
00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:16.392
Yes, that's what the coroner said.

218
00:13:16.392 --> 00:13:18.592
And that judging from the water that was on the victim

219
00:13:18.592 --> 00:13:20.692
as well as the type of water that was found in his body,

220
00:13:20.692 --> 00:13:24.192
he says that somebody must've drowned him

221
00:13:24.192 --> 00:13:27.992
in a contaminated swamp or something somewhere,

222
00:13:27.992 --> 00:13:30.492
and later brought over here!

223
00:13:30.492 --> 00:13:33.192
Come to think of it, he did smell of stench.

224
00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:34.992
-Yeah. -But,

225
00:13:34.992 --> 00:13:38.592
it seems as if the culprit brought that smelly water over here, though.

226
00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:40.592
-What? -What?

227
00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:43.392
See! This water dipper...

228
00:13:43.392 --> 00:13:45.392
Smells the same!

229
00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.192
I see.

230
00:13:48.192 --> 00:13:50.092
The culprit scooped smelling water

231
00:13:50.092 --> 00:13:52.492
and poured into this water dipper,

232
00:13:52.492 --> 00:13:57.092
then, he sunk Mr. Numayama's face in it and drowned him.

233
00:13:57.092 --> 00:14:00.192
Then, in the end the culprit poured that water over the dead body.

234
00:14:00.192 --> 00:14:03.392
But, I wonder why Mr. Numayama was in a place like this?

235
00:14:03.392 --> 00:14:05.992
It seems to have been a daily routine for him.

236
00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:09.092
The clerk of the inn said that every morning after getting up,

237
00:14:09.092 --> 00:14:14.592
he would come here and guard the river from the window,

238
00:14:14.592 --> 00:14:16.892
with those binoculars.

239
00:14:16.892 --> 00:14:18.992
But, for what?

240
00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:22.292
I think it's because his son was carried away

241
00:14:22.292 --> 00:14:25.492
by the current of that river and died.

242
00:14:25.492 --> 00:14:28.992
So, he didn't want the same thing that happened again,

243
00:14:28.992 --> 00:14:31.892
so he kept watch over from here.

244
00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:34.292
Let's see...

245
00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:37.492
It's true, it's in view!

246
00:14:37.492 --> 00:14:41.392
But, if he was thinking of his son,

247
00:14:41.392 --> 00:14:45.192
he didn't have to kick the tombstone that his friends made for him.

248
00:14:45.192 --> 00:14:48.292
I hear it's not the 1st or 2nd time he's done that.

249
00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:51.392
Maybe there's something.

250
00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:53.792
Near that river.

251
00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:56.492
It seems that he used to walk around that area

252
00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:59.692
after everybody hit the sack.

253
00:14:59.692 --> 00:15:04.392
But the only thing there is the tombstone his friends made.

254
00:15:04.392 --> 00:15:08.392
By the way, the shoe that is near the dead body

255
00:15:08.392 --> 00:15:10.892
is Tatsuhiko's shoe, right?

256
00:15:10.892 --> 00:15:14.092
But, I thought you said it was buried under his tombstone?

257
00:15:14.092 --> 00:15:15.192
Yeah.

258
00:15:15.192 --> 00:15:17.892
Then, I wonder if the culprit dug it back up?

259
00:15:17.892 --> 00:15:20.592
No, the shoe that was buried was only the right shoe

260
00:15:20.592 --> 00:15:22.992
that was stuck between the rocks at the bottom of the river.

261
00:15:22.992 --> 00:15:25.892
That looks like the left shoe, though.

262
00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:27.692
Then maybe it's the shoe that Tatsuhiko was wearing

263
00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:29.992
when he was carried away by the river

264
00:15:29.992 --> 00:15:34.092
and found at the reservoir?

265
00:15:34.092 --> 00:15:35.492
So one side of his shoe came off,

266
00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:38.392
but he was found wearing the other side.

267
00:15:38.392 --> 00:15:40.192
No, it seems that the only thing he was wearing

268
00:15:40.192 --> 00:15:42.892
when he was found was his swimming trunks!

269
00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:44.992
Only his swimming trunks?

270
00:15:44.992 --> 00:15:47.092
You mean in this cold?

271
00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:50.692
So, maybe he was trying to cold-weather swimming or something.

272
00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:53.292
I get it! It's that reservoir!

273
00:15:53.292 --> 00:15:56.692
The stink water that was poured over Mr. Numayama,

274
00:15:56.692 --> 00:15:59.092
smelled the same as the water of the reservoir

275
00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.092
that Tatsuhiko's dead body was found floating in!

276
00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:05.592
That reservoir turned into an illegal trash dumping site.

277
00:16:05.592 --> 00:16:08.492
From the stench and eerie sight of it,

278
00:16:08.492 --> 00:16:12.192
it seems that the villagers named it...

279
00:16:12.192 --> 00:16:14.092
The habitat of the water sprite,

280
00:16:14.092 --> 00:16:17.292
Hell Swamp!

281
00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:19.492
Hell... Hell Swamp?

282
00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:22.992
Then... Then, this case has something to do

283
00:16:22.992 --> 00:16:26.992
with the water sprite after all?

284
00:16:26.992 --> 00:16:29.692
You know what, Ran.

285
00:16:29.692 --> 00:16:33.192
In this day and age when people are talking of traveling to space,

286
00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:36.492
no such things as water sprites exist!

287
00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:39.892
But... last night I...

288
00:16:42.092 --> 00:16:45.192
And? Where is that reservoir?

289
00:16:45.192 --> 00:16:48.592
About 10 kilometers downstream from here.

290
00:16:48.592 --> 00:16:50.792
Then let's have the forensics go over there,

291
00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:52.492
and compare the water in the reservoir

292
00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:55.692
and the water that was on the dead body!

293
00:16:55.692 --> 00:16:59.792
I think you should also check everybody's belongings.

294
00:16:59.792 --> 00:17:02.892
Because if the culprit out that smelly water

295
00:17:02.892 --> 00:17:05.492
into this dipper and enters the inn, it'll be conspicuous,

296
00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.692
and the smell would catch everyone's attention.

297
00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:11.092
I see. In order to bring that water here,

298
00:17:11.092 --> 00:17:15.292
it'd have to put it in an airtight container.

299
00:17:15.292 --> 00:17:19.292
Moreover, the stairs that lead to the attic

300
00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:21.192
is behind the restroom.

301
00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:23.192
Pretending to go to the restroom,

302
00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:26.992
anyone can enter with ease.

303
00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:30.892
In other words, anybody at this inn,

304
00:17:30.892 --> 00:17:33.492
as long as he gets to bring the smelly water here,

305
00:17:33.492 --> 00:17:35.392
could've committed the murder.

306
00:17:35.392 --> 00:17:36.392
Yamamura!

307
00:17:36.392 --> 00:17:38.692
What's the estimated time of death of the victim?

308
00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:40.092
Yes, sir!

309
00:17:41.392 --> 00:17:45.192
I hear it was between 6:00 to 7:00 this morning!

310
00:17:45.192 --> 00:17:49.892
Okay! Check the alibis of everyone at the inn!

311
00:17:49.892 --> 00:17:52.292
I'll go to the rooms of those spending the night here

312
00:17:52.292 --> 00:17:55.392
and check if there are any suspicious containers!

313
00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:58.192
Yes, sir!

314
00:17:58.192 --> 00:18:01.792
I think that's supposed to be my job.

315
00:18:01.792 --> 00:18:05.092
I mean I wasn't promoted to inspector for nothing, you know.

316
00:18:05.092 --> 00:18:06.192
"Chrysanthemum room"

317
00:18:06.192 --> 00:18:09.992
The only airtight containers

318
00:18:09.992 --> 00:18:11.692
that I could keep water in are these.

319
00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:14.792
The big bottle for color ink holds 60 ml.

320
00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:17.992
The small bottle holds 15 ml.

321
00:18:17.992 --> 00:18:21.292
But both bottles are quite filled to the top with ink.

322
00:18:21.292 --> 00:18:22.892
Even the white container,

323
00:18:22.892 --> 00:18:25.092
is filled more than half way with paint,

324
00:18:25.092 --> 00:18:27.992
so the only empty bottle would be this water container.

325
00:18:29.392 --> 00:18:31.392
100 ml.

326
00:18:31.392 --> 00:18:34.892
Isn't enough to drown a person.

327
00:18:34.892 --> 00:18:36.592
I think so too.

328
00:18:36.592 --> 00:18:40.192
Maybe you have other containers hidden somewhere?

329
00:18:40.192 --> 00:18:42.092
I don't think so!

330
00:18:42.092 --> 00:18:43.692
Yesterday after he fell into the river,

331
00:18:43.692 --> 00:18:47.092
he spread out his belongings and checked them,

332
00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.492
but didn't have any containers other than these.

333
00:18:50.992 --> 00:18:53.592
But why do you have so many tools for painting with you?

334
00:18:53.592 --> 00:18:56.892
-He's an artist. -Really?

335
00:18:56.892 --> 00:18:58.992
He seems to previously have been a teacher

336
00:18:58.992 --> 00:19:01.892
at the elementary school that Tatsuhiko went to, though.

337
00:19:01.892 --> 00:19:04.192
That's why I decided to spend the night here,

338
00:19:04.192 --> 00:19:06.792
since I came to offer incense to Tatsuhiko's Buddhist altar.

339
00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:07.892
And?

340
00:19:07.892 --> 00:19:10.592
At the time of the crime this morning between 6:00 and 7:00

341
00:19:10.592 --> 00:19:12.192
where were you and what were you doing?

342
00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:14.292
I was asleep in my room.

343
00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:16.992
Until a person of this inn came

344
00:19:16.992 --> 00:19:18.892
to tell me that breakfast was ready.

345
00:19:20.992 --> 00:19:21.992
"Cherry Blossom room"

346
00:19:21.992 --> 00:19:25.092
Then, you also came to offer incense to Tatsuhiko's altar?

347
00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:28.792
Yes, sir! I used to come with everybody else in the past

348
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:31.592
but, now, only I do.

349
00:19:31.592 --> 00:19:34.292
Then, where and what were you doing

350
00:19:34.292 --> 00:19:35.692
between 6:00 and 7:00 this morning?

351
00:19:35.692 --> 00:19:39.392
I got up at 6:30 am and was taking a bath.

352
00:19:39.392 --> 00:19:41.592
I was all alone, though.

353
00:19:43.192 --> 00:19:44.492
The containers that you can put water inside

354
00:19:44.492 --> 00:19:48.592
are these two 500 ml bottles,

355
00:19:48.592 --> 00:19:50.692
but one is still unopened

356
00:19:50.692 --> 00:19:54.592
and the other one is still more than half filled.

357
00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:58.492
What's this?

358
00:19:58.492 --> 00:20:00.692
That's a water pillow.

359
00:20:00.692 --> 00:20:04.592
You put water inside it and inflate it.

360
00:20:04.592 --> 00:20:07.292
I can't sleep with any other pillow.

361
00:20:07.292 --> 00:20:10.092
I get it! A water pillow!

362
00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:12.492
You filled this up with the smelly water

363
00:20:12.492 --> 00:20:14.692
from the reservoir and brought it here!

364
00:20:14.692 --> 00:20:18.992
As proof of that there's no water in here now!

365
00:20:18.992 --> 00:20:23.092
I drained the water out when I went to take a bath because I'm leaving.

366
00:20:23.092 --> 00:20:26.392
I think he's telling the truth.

367
00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:28.292
Because he too, after falling into the river,

368
00:20:28.292 --> 00:20:33.192
he spread his belongings out, but that pillow was deflated flat.

369
00:20:33.192 --> 00:20:37.892
But, he could've secretly gone to get the water, right?

370
00:20:37.892 --> 00:20:40.892
Well, I guess he could.

371
00:20:42.592 --> 00:20:44.792
"Plum room" -A camera, a camera stand,

372
00:20:44.792 --> 00:20:47.592
an IC recorder, and a laptop computer.

373
00:20:47.592 --> 00:20:49.192
Who are you?

374
00:20:49.192 --> 00:20:51.092
A journalist!

375
00:20:51.092 --> 00:20:54.892
I pursue ghostly legends that exist in various districts.

376
00:20:54.892 --> 00:20:58.592
So, you came here because you heard about the water sprite?

377
00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:02.492
Yes, I wasn't able to gather much material though.

378
00:21:02.492 --> 00:21:05.392
But, how unusual.

379
00:21:05.392 --> 00:21:06.892
That you're carrying around a camera

380
00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:08.792
that uses film instead of a digital camera.

381
00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:11.692
I used to be a cameraman before, that's why.

382
00:21:11.692 --> 00:21:14.692
I just can't come to like digital cameras.

383
00:21:14.692 --> 00:21:17.492
Well, with this many film cases

384
00:21:17.492 --> 00:21:19.492
I guess you could fill quite an amount of

385
00:21:19.492 --> 00:21:21.392
the water in question.

386
00:21:21.392 --> 00:21:23.792
Hey! Didn't I tell you a while ago

387
00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:26.592
that I was talking to the editor in charge all the way

388
00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:29.392
from 6:00 am in the morning till a little past 7:00 am!

389
00:21:29.392 --> 00:21:30.892
Isn't that quite too long?

390
00:21:30.892 --> 00:21:34.092
Talking for more than an hour from that early in the morning?

391
00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:36.292
I was discussing the matter

392
00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:38.092
because I couldn't gather stories on the water sprite!

393
00:21:38.092 --> 00:21:41.392
The printing deadline is near and my camera broke too.

394
00:21:41.392 --> 00:21:44.092
What? Your camera broke?

395
00:21:44.092 --> 00:21:45.992
It got soaked in the rain!

396
00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:49.392
It suddenly raining last night when I was taking pictures outside.

397
00:21:52.692 --> 00:21:55.592
On top of that, you caught a cold?

398
00:21:55.592 --> 00:21:59.092
Yeah. I had a slight cold to begin with,

399
00:21:59.092 --> 00:22:01.392
but it got worse.

400
00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:08.592
The foul smelling water that drowned Mr. Banzo Numayama.

401
00:22:08.592 --> 00:22:11.492
If it was the water from the reservoir

402
00:22:11.492 --> 00:22:14.192
where Tatsuhiko's body was found,

403
00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:15.392
it can be assumed that

404
00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:19.892
this incident occurred because of Tatsuhiko's death.

405
00:22:19.892 --> 00:22:22.292
What on earth is the culprit's purpose for wanting to make it look

406
00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:24.992
as if it were the curse of the water sprite?

407
00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:49.092
A water sprite again?

408
00:23:49.092 --> 00:23:51.492
It is! It's really true!

409
00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:56.792
This is indeed...

410
00:23:56.792 --> 00:23:59.192
An alien!

411
00:23:59.192 --> 00:24:00.792
I see.

412
00:24:00.792 --> 00:24:03.692
So it was tightly put into smaller containers.

413
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:07.592
I shall disclose the truth of the case to you!

414
00:24:07.592 --> 00:24:11.492
Over the name of the inspector of the Gunma Prefectural Police!

415
00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:12.992
Next Conan,

416
00:24:12.992 --> 00:24:16.788
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 2)"

417
00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:19.619
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:21.919
"The color green"

419
00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.319
I swear I saw a water sprite!

420
00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:24.719
I understand, water spout...

421
00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:26.631
-You're not taking me seriously, are you? -No. I'm not.
