00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:04,491
Summer shines but only yesterday.

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,591
You cry and cry, soccer ball is always there for you.

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,091
Genta kicks the ball out of rage.

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,991
Yet it leads to the goal of a criminal case.

5
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,391
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,091
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

7
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,491
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"Tokyo Spirits 3-3 Big Osaka"

9
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:44,018
Hide has failed.

10
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,018
Tokyo Spirits has lost the quarter final

11
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:56,718
of the Sunday Cup in a penalty shootout.

12
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,918
Now, they're gone!

13
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:10,618
"Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 1)"

14
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:13,418
Alright, let's go and eat cake.

15
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:18,918
Come on.

16
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:02,418
Come on!

17
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:05,618
Now, you guys are going to eat the famous cheesecake.

18
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:08,018
So, no more sighs like that, ok?

19
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:09,618
Games are like a roll of the dice.

20
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:12,018
Sometimes, when they lose, they lose.

21
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,718
But still.

22
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,618
I can't believe Hide missed his penalty kick.

23
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:19,118
Maybe he was out of condition.

24
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:21,618
I don't think so.

25
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:24,818
In that game, Hide got one goal, two assists.

26
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,718
He must've been in the best condition.

27
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,118
What I'm trying to say is, he's also a son of a man.

28
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:32,718
Sometimes, he buckles under the pressure.

29
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:35,218
He's a coward, isn't he?

30
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,418
I don't think so.

31
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:42,018
This superstar that people called a treasure of Italian football,

32
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:49,118
said "Only those who have the courage to take a penalty, miss them!"

33
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:50,718
Yeah, that's right!

34
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:53,618
We take it for granted that penalty kicks are always in and never missed!

35
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:56,318
Hide was not a coward!

36
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,218
But you know,

37
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,618
we had Hide and Naoki, right?

38
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:08,518
Tokyo Spirits was winning six games in a row.

39
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,918
They were in really good condition!

40
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,118
How could they lose!

41
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,118
Shoot!

What do you think you're doing to my car?

44
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:23,418
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:28,218
He is upset because his favorite soccer team just lost a game.

46
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,718
Be careful!

47
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:33,718
Hey, where did the ball go?

48
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:36,018
I don't know. Don't ask me!

49
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:38,618
Genta. Keep this in mind.

00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,818
"The strong one doesn't win"

51
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,318

53
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:50,918
"Rutger Heinen (42)" -The word that I'm most proud of.

54
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,918
Who the heck are you, old man?

55
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,218
I'm just looking for a kid who kicked this soccer ball

56
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:02,218
and accidentally cause a damage to my lovely car.

57
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:04,618
I'm just an unlucky foreigner.

58
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,618
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

59
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,918
Here.

60
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,518
It's no problem! Don't you worry about it!

61
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:17,718
Mister, your Japanese is really good for foreigner!

62
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,318
Sure. My wife is Japanese.

63
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,218
When I fall in love,

64
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:26,318
I love not only that person but also that person's language too.

65
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,918
Actually, I divorced once already.

66
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,918
Now I can speak three different languages thanks to that.

67
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,618
Really?

68
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:38,818
"Batsuichi"? He's been totally Japanized.

69
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:42,118
Okay, we gotta go to the shop now.

70
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:45,118
Otherwise, the cheesecake will be all gone!

71
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:48,018
Oh, yeah! You're right!

72
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:49,818
What? Cake?

73
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:52,418
You mean the cake shop called "Ikenaka"

74
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,518
on the second floor here, right?

75
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:57,418
Actually, I came here to buy their cheesecake

76
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,818
because my wife loves them!

77
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:02,518
Second floor?

78
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:05,718
That store is on the third floor, I think.

79
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,918
Yeah, that's right. Third floor.

80
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:14,518
Hello?

81
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,518
You're always like this.

82
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:22,318
Well... It was from my ex-wife.

83
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,918
She called me about our son's academic future

84
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,018
but the reception was bad here.

85
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:29,118
If that's a serious topic to discuss,

86
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:32,518
maybe you should meet and talk to her.

87
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,218
No. It's not that easy to do it.

88
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:40,418
Because your ex-wife is in England.

89
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,018
How did you know that?

90
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:47,818
The "the strong one doesn't win, the one who wins is strong"

91
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:50,318
was mentioned by Franz Beckenbauer,

92
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:52,818
the emperor of German football!

93
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:56,718
You must be German because you not only like the words

94
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:59,118
but also are proud of them, right?

95
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,218
Yes.

96
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:04,618
The three languages you can speak include German, Japanese,

97
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,618
and English as you spoke some English words.

98
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,718
Your present wife is Japanese,

99
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:12,418
then your ex-wife would've been someone who could speak English.

100
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,418
But, she could've been American since they spoke English, right?

101
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:18,618
I got it.

102
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:20,818
It was the word, "second floor" wasn't it?

103
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,818
In America, you say "third floor",

104
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:26,318
but in England, you say "second floor".

105
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:29,918
What do mean? Second means 2, isn't it?

106
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,218
English people call the first floor as ground floor.

107
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:38,918
Above the ground floor is the "first floor", "second" and "third"!

108
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,118
That's why I thought your ex-wife was English.

109
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,818
That kid, is he really a kid?

110
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:51,318
What? Well...

111
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:54,918
Well, do you want us to go and buy cake for you?

112
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,118
That would be great,

113
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:01,518
because it looks like I have to call her back and talk for a while.

114
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:04,718
Can you get a whole cheesecake for me, please?

115
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:05,718
Sure.

116
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:08,118
We are going to eat inside the cake shop,

117
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:11,018
so I think it's going to take a while.

118
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,518
Alright, let's go now!

119
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:14,718
I'm not going.

120
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:17,318
-What? -We are going to eat!

121
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:20,518
Tokyo Spirits lost the game.

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,818
I can't eat cake!

123
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,218
Genta?

124
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:26,318
You guys go and eat!

125
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,618
I am not in the mood!

126
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:31,918
Alright, then. Leave him alone.

127
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:35,518
We don't wanna eat with someone who's grouchy.

128
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:38,118
Haibara.

129
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:41,618
Alright, then. You wait silently in the car.

130
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:44,818
Oh, okay.

131
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:57,118
What's wrong?

132
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:01,218
Aren't you eating? It's amazing!

133
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:02,418
Well...

134
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:06,118
I'm thinking about Genta. You know.

135
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:08,718
Come on, don't worry about him.

136
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:10,718
He'll be okay.

137
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,818
The takeout is ready.

138
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,918
Yes, here.

139
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,518
Sorry to keep you waiting.

140
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:21,218
This big box is the whole cake for the foreigner.

141
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:24,918
And as you know, this small one is for Genta!

142
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:30,218
It's yummy!

143
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:35,018
It's yummy, isn't it?

144
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,618
I'm the one... I'm gonna be the one to change the team.

145
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:02,818
I'm gonna be a much better player than Hide and Naoki

146
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:06,818
and make Tokyo Spirits, an invincible team.

147
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:09,318
What? Oh, shoot!

148
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,918
Once Genta eats this cake,

149
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,918
he will get over his bad mood for sure!

150
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,418
I'll bet!

151
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:23,518
-No! -Oh no.

152
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:33,618
I'm so sorry! I was kind of in a hurry.

153
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,718
That was dangerous!

154
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:43,618
I hope the cake is okay.

155
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:44,818
Driving license?

156
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:47,818
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)"

157
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:50,918
This guy was him?

158
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,618
Hey, what's taking you so long?

159
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:58,018
Ouch...

160
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:01,718
Oh, yeah. I tripped and hit my head.

161
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:04,418
How long will it take you to fix it, man?

162
00:12:04,418 --> 00:12:05,818
I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:08,118
This machine has been acting up recently...

164
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:10,718
"Tatsuzo Genda (44)" -Hey, I'm gonna break the gate bar

165
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,218
if you don't fix it soon.

166
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,618
You hear me, man?

167
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:15,618
I'm doing my best.

168
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,818
Ouch...

169
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:18,818
Where's the ball?

170
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,218
I overdid it.

171
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:26,218
There it is!

172
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:28,518
There you are.

173
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,818
Legs?

174
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:42,518
You should go somewhere else or you are gonna catch cold.

175
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:55,618
Genta!

176
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:10,626
Genta!

177
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,326
Hey! Where are you, Genta?

178
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,326
What happened, Genta?

179
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,926
Genta!

180
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:17,126
Kojima!

181
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,726
I found him! He's here!!

182
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:26,126
He's dead...

183
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,626
Genta, what happened?

184
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,426
The...

185
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:32,926
The foreign man is lying there dead!

186
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,126
What?

187
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:41,826
No.

188
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:44,026
Although weakly, he is still breathing.

189
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:46,426
Doc! Please call the ambulance and the police!

190
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,626
I got it!

191
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,326
Hey! What happened?

192
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:50,926
Who did this to you?

193
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,326
Wait!

194
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,926
Looks like the injury on his left front forehead

195
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,926
is causing him unable to process words.

196
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,926
He couldn't speak too.

197
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:13,126
Criminal.

198
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,726
Me? Is that me?

199
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,426
No way!

200
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,626
Wait a sec!

201
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:23,926
Probably, he is pointing

202
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:26,626
at something that's behind Genta.

203
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:30,826
It might be some kind of clue telling us about the suspect.

204
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:34,726
So, if I move Genta like this,

205
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:37,526
he will show us what that is.

206
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,826
What?

207
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,826
After all, it was still me!

208
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:47,126
E...

209
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,226
E...

210
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:53,326
El...

211
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,326
No way.

212
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,726
Mister! Don't die!

213
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:01,026
Don't you worry! He just lost his consciousness,

214
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,526
though he's still in critical condition.

215
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,126
Well, that aside,

216
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:08,526
why did he point at Kojima?

217
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:12,226
Genta, didn't you see the suspect

218
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:14,226
before you found this man bleeding?

219
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,926
Maybe that's why he pointed at you.

220
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:20,026
No, I didn't.

221
00:15:20,026 --> 00:15:24,226
Because I was stunned when I heard this weird noise.

222
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,226
I missed kicking the ball,

223
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:32,526
tripped and hit my head.

224
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:35,426
I was unconscious for a long time.

225
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:39,426
You were kicking the soccer ball in this parking lot?

226
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:41,226
Yes, I did.

227
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:44,226
That's some dangerous thing you did.

228
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,226
Then, when you woke up,

229
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,326
he was here like this, correct?

230
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,726
Well, I was looking for the soccer ball,

231
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:54,726
and I found it by that foreign man.

232
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:56,626
Then, it maybe possible that

233
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:59,826
the ball you kicked struck this man's head?

234
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,826
Maybe that was why he said the word "criminal" to you.

235
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:06,126
What are you, stupid?

236
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:09,826
How could a kid's shot injure an adult like this?

237
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:15,526
But Conan's shots always blow criminals away, don't they?

238
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,726
Conan's shots are specials.

239
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:22,726
He's using machines. It's all fake!

240
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,726
Fake, huh?

241
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,326
Well, anyway,

242
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,526
it's worth believing that Genta is holding some clue

243
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:30,726
to find the criminal!

244
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:34,326
We are going find out who that is.

245
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,726
So don't worry about anything, Genta.

246
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:41,226
I am the criminal...

247
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,826
Right. He's not listening.

248
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,926
The victim was Mr. Rutger Heinen.

249
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:49,426
He's German.

250
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,426
He works for a German sports goods manufacturer

251
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:54,626
and was sent to Japan.

252
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:58,526
He was attacked with the steel pipe that was on ground.

253
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:00,626
According to the wounds,

254
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,226
it seems his head was hit twice,

255
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:04,726
one in the back and one in the front.

256
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:06,826
So, how's the victim's condition?

257
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,426
He was sent to a hospital,

258
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,726
but he's still unconscious.

259
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,926
I thought he might've seen the criminal's face

260
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:16,826
if he was attacked from the front.

261
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:19,626
This is Mr. Rutger's car.

262
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:22,626
Perhaps, he was waiting for somebody here.

263
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,026
As he got out of the car to talk to this person,

264
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:28,226
the criminal attacked him.

265
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:30,926
You are saying, resentment is the motive?

266
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,426
Yes, probably.

267
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:36,726
I found it his wallet in his jacket with plenty of money in it.

268
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:38,326
It left untouched,

269
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,626
so I don't think money was the motive in this case.

270
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,126
Okay. Then you go to where he's working,

271
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,626
and look for the criminal.

272
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:45,726
Yes, sir!

273
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:49,026
It... it was me.

274
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,326
It was me...

275
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:53,826
Genta?

276
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:55,726
What the heck are you doing here?

277
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,326
It was me who did that to that foreigner...

278
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:04,426
Well, actually he was the first to find him!

279
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:07,126
He found the foreigner lying there bleeding.

280
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,326
That's right!

281
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:11,626
Really. You guys again?

282
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,726
We came here to eat cheesecake

283
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,826
and we happened to get to know Mr. Rutger.

284
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:20,226
Oh, Mr. Agasa.

285
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,826
He asked us to buy the cake for him.

286
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:26,026
So we came back with his cake, Genta stayed in the parking lot,

287
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:30,326
and found Mr. Rutger lying here injured.

288
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:34,126
So, Genta, did you see anybody suspicious?

289
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:36,226
No... I was...

290
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,426
We didn't see anybody suspicious

291
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:41,226
but I think money was involved in this case.

292
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,226
What?

293
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:46,326
But Detective Takagi said that the wallet was left untouched.

294
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,926
Alright, why don't you take a look inside Mr. Rutger's car?

295
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:53,026
You see the coins?

296
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,326
Yeah, I see them.

297
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:57,626
They are scattered over the passenger's seat.

298
00:18:57,626 --> 00:19:00,526
So, why was money involved?

299
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:05,526
Actually, I checked inside the car before you came

300
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:10,226
and I found out that there was no parking ticket!

301
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,426
What?

302
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:15,026
Inspector, where do you usually keep your parking ticket?

303
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,526
Let's see.

304
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,426
Parking ticket, right?

305
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:23,026
In the glove compartment, the pocket of my pants

306
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,026
or in the wallet or...

307
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,326
I got it. It's the coin purse!

308
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:28,226
The criminal took the coin purse

309
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:32,126
with the parking ticket in it and ran away!

310
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,426
I see.

311
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:37,126
The coin purse on the passenger's seat was left open,

312
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:40,426
and some of the coins dropped when the criminal took it away.

313
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:42,126
Without even checking the wallet

314
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:45,226
that was full of money in the pocket though?

315
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,326
Yeah, because the criminal was feeling so pressed

316
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:49,326
that he couldn't even search around.

317
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:50,626
Thus, the criminal just took what was in sight,

318
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:52,026
which was the coin purse!

319
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,826
Feeling so pressed?

320
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,126
Yes. Maybe.

321
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:58,426
Perhaps, right after beating Mr. Rutger up,

322
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:03,326
then the soccer ball Genta kicked came rolling by the car.

323
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:04,826
The criminal must've thought that it would be dangerous

324
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,226
because someone might come over and get the ball.

325
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,426
Well, by the sound of Mr. Rutger being hit,

326
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:12,726
the person who kicked the ball was actually stunned tripped,

327
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:16,126
hit his head on the ground and lost consciousness.

328
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:20,926
Actually, it's bad news that the criminal is a robber, isn't it?

329
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,026
True.

330
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:25,526
We have to do investigations to get testimony from witnesses.

331
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,626
No.

332
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,526
There are only three people who are suspicious.

333
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:31,626
What?

334
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:35,426
It seems Mr. Rutger was talking to his ex-wife on the phone

335
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:38,626
while we were buying the cake.

336
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:40,626
But the reception was bad,

337
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:43,326
so he called her back again and again.

338
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:47,126
And the very last call was made four minutes

339
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,326
before we came back here!

340
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:53,626
That means, the incident occurred within these four minutes, right?

341
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,226
Yes.

342
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,426
Then, we need the one who was stranded

343
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,726
because of the accident at the entrance gate.

344
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,826
And the one who is still in his car.

345
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,526
And the one who we saw in front of the elevator

346
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,026
connecting the parking lot and the building

347
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:10,726
when we came back to the parking lot.

348
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,426
I'm so sorry! I was kind of in a hurry.

349
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,326
He also dropped his driving license.

350
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:23,326
It's this guy.

351
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:27,326
"Driving license" -They are the three suspects!

352
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:29,426
Really?

353
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,626
I see. Three people, right?

354
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,426
Alright, Takagi!

355
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,226
You search for these two men in this parking lot,

356
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,226
and also the man with this driving license.

357
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,926
And get them over here, got it?

358
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,826
Yes, sir! Understood.

359
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:46,426
The one who has the coin purse is the...

360
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:50,326
He would throw the purse away if he finds that there are only coins.

361
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:53,026
-What? -But, don't worry!

362
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:56,726
Mr. Rutger left us a hint.

363
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:58,126
A hint?

364
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,126
Before he fainted,

365
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:03,026
Mr. Rutger pointed his finger at Genta.

366
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:05,026
Saying "criminal".

367
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,326
He said that to you?

368
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:11,926
Yes. It's me, was it?

369
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:15,826
And he grabbed my shoulder and said "El".

370
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:21,626
E...

371
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:25,826
El...

372
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,026
That means, the criminal is someone

373
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:30,126
that has something in common with Genta,

374
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:34,326
and someone who has something to do with the word "El".

375
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,526
Elf?

376
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:08,026
You know the pixies in the fantasy stories.

377
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,826
Asking for a small favor.

378
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:13,726
Then, this boy must have done it.

379
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,826
Genta didn't do anything!

380
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:20,326
So it was by someone acting like a pesky kid, just like Genta.

381
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,926
-I got it! -What?

382
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:23,726
The person who attacked Mr. Rutger is...

383
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:28,626
I see. It was like that.

384
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:33,926
Next Conan, "Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 2)"

385
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:52,026
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:54,026
"Pesky Kid"

387
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,126
I'll be a good kid, so...

388
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:57,526
Well, you didn't do anything, Genta.

389
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:58,926
So please, don't take eels away from me!
