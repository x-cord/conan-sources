Thank you. You're a great help.

hurry and close this shop down, will you?

We've been coming to Tamaki Used Bookshop quite frequently,

but I didn't notice this park till now.

93
00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:58.009
Yes. I only found out recently, too.

94
00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.809
And this park has a secret.

95
00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:02.209

96
00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:05.709

That's not it. The wheels move in place.

100
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:14.409
I see.

101
00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.709
And when is it going to move?

102
00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:20.909
I hear it moves twice a day at 11:00 and 3:00.

I'm so excited!

Mitsuhiko, what's that?

113
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:48.209
I borrowed it from my father.

114
00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:52.309
I wanted to take a picture when the locomotive starts moving.

115
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:54.909
Can you use things like that?

116
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:57.009
Yes. You can count on me.

117
00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:00.709
What are you doing?

118
00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:03.109
We're waiting for the locomotive to start moving.

What are doing here, Mr. Ichiro?

121
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:08.809
Since I work the late shift today,

122
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:10.909
I thought that I'd take a walk around and kill the time.

124
00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:34.509

It was!

I wonder if Mr. Tamaki's all right?

He's in no danger. I'm sure he'll be fine.

I'm glad.

"Tamaki Used Bookshop"

136
00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:32.976
The clock stopped at 3:00.

137
00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:38.076
It's the same time when we were all watching the locomotive.

138
00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:41.376
That's why we didn't hear this place collapsing.

139
00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:45.376
Judging from the circumstances,

140
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.876
the shelf at the very end collapsed

141
00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:52.776
and the rest fell one by one domino style.

142
00:09:52.776 --> 00:09:55.276
After all, the deterioration was pretty bad.

143
00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:58.176
I guess this was an accident waiting to happen.

All right, all of you.

146

It's dangerous, so you better leave the shop right away.

Yes. Are you all right?

153
00:10:28.276 --> 00:10:31.076
Yeah, it's just a slight concussion.

154
00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:32.976
I should be out of the hospital soon.

155
00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:34.976
That's good to hear.

156
00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:38.376
How unfortunate that the bookshelves fell down.

157
00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:44.576
Well, I'm sure glad that no customers got hurt.

158
00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:46.476
I guess I was lucky.

159
00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:47.576
What?

160
00:10:47.576 --> 00:10:51.576
The truth is, I wasn't supposed to be at the shop that time.

161
00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:54.276
I left the shop to purchase books,

162
00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:57.976
but I realized partway that I forgot my wallet.

163
00:10:57.976 --> 00:11:01.576
When I went back to get it, this happened.

164
00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:03.176
I see.

165
00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:07.176
If I'd closed down the shop like Ichiro told me to...

166
00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:10.076
What? Are you going to close down the shop?

167
00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:13.176
I did think it was time to quit,

168
00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:16.576
but I just couldn't make up my mind.

169
00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:18.076
Although the accident was unlucky,

170
00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.176
it gave me a good chance to make up my mind.

171
00:11:21.176 --> 00:11:23.976
Well, I guess that's an appropriate choice.

172
00:11:23.976 --> 00:11:25.276
Ai.

173
00:11:25.276 --> 00:11:28.276
That shop is much too deteriorated.

174
00:11:28.276 --> 00:11:30.576
If they want to return it to how it was before,

175
00:11:30.576 --> 00:11:33.476
they would have to renovate from the foundation

176
00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:37.176
and that would cost several millions of yen.

177
00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:40.976
They don't look like they have that much money.

178
00:11:40.976 --> 00:11:43.276
It's just as she says.

179
00:11:43.276 --> 00:11:46.776
Then what about the books?

180
00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:49.876
It's sad, but I'll auction them.

181
00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.776
Then I know that the books

182
00:11:51.776 --> 00:11:54.676
will go to the person who wants them.

183
00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.276
That's right!

184
00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:00.676
Would you like to look at the pictures?

185
00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:04.376
We took a lot of pictures of the locomotive.

186
00:12:04.376 --> 00:12:06.076
Really?

187
00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:07.876
I'd like to see them, then.

188
00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:12.376
They're good pictures.

189
00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:19.076
This is the best picture.

190
00:12:19.076 --> 00:12:20.876
I think so, too.

191
00:12:21.876 --> 00:12:23.976
That picture... Will you show it to me?

192
00:12:26.476 --> 00:12:27.876
What's the matter?

193
00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:37.376
Thank you very much...

194
00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:39.876
I heard you went to visit Dad at the hospital.

195
00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:44.976
Yes, it was a slight concussion so he'll be out soon.

196
00:12:44.976 --> 00:12:46.176
I see.

197
00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:49.076
But he says he's going to close down the shop.

198
00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:52.976
You don't look too happy.

199
00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:54.176
What?

200
00:12:54.176 --> 00:12:57.076
You wanted him to close down the shop, didn't you?

201
00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.076
Well yeah, but...

202
00:12:59.076 --> 00:13:00.176
Ichiro.

203
00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:02.476
Michiko.

204
00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:06.576
She's my girlfriend, I guess.

205
00:13:06.576 --> 00:13:09.476
What do you mean by "I guess"?

206
00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:11.376
"Michiko Yoshikawa (27)" -I'm Michiko Yoshikawa.

207
00:13:11.376 --> 00:13:12.876
Nice to meet you all.

208
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.876
Hello...

209
00:13:14.876 --> 00:13:18.176
What are you all doing here?

210
00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:20.676
They went to visit Dad at the hospital

211
00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:23.176
and came to tell me how he is.

212
00:13:23.176 --> 00:13:25.376
Is your father hospitalized?

213
00:13:25.376 --> 00:13:28.376
Yeah. He hurt himself in an accident.

214
00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:29.776
Is he all right?

215
00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:32.276
The old man is fine.

216
00:13:32.276 --> 00:13:34.376
I see. I'm glad.

217
00:13:38.876 --> 00:13:41.276
You're his girlfriend?

218
00:13:41.276 --> 00:13:42.776
Yes, I am.

219
00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:44.776
We've been going out for 5 years already.

220
00:13:44.776 --> 00:13:46.976
What? That long?

221
00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:50.676
What do you like about Mr. Ichiro?

222
00:13:50.676 --> 00:13:53.176
Gosh, you're precocious.

223
00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:56.276
I guess I like him because he's kind.

224
00:13:56.276 --> 00:13:58.876
And how much he cares for his father.

225
00:13:58.876 --> 00:14:00.976
He sure didn't look like it.

226
00:14:00.976 --> 00:14:03.976
They were arguing at the shop, too.

227
00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.476
He's awkward,

228
00:14:06.476 --> 00:14:09.176
especially in front of his father.

229
00:14:11.176 --> 00:14:12.476
Thanks for waiting.

230
00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:20.176
This is delicious.

231
00:14:20.176 --> 00:14:23.676
I have something to tell you later after work.

232
00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:25.976
Tonight, I have to...

233
00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:27.976
You're going to visit you father in the hospital, right?

234
00:14:27.976 --> 00:14:30.476
-I'll go with you. -I'm sorry.

235
00:14:30.476 --> 00:14:33.476
There's a lot of preparations to be made and paper works to fill out.

236
00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:35.676
Can we meet tomorrow?

237
00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:39.576
Okay. Call me when you're settled.

238
00:14:39.576 --> 00:14:41.676
Keep up the good work.

239
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.376
Don't worry about the shop.

240
00:14:47.376 --> 00:14:49.576
I'll wait as long as you need me to.

241
00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:53.676
Tell your father that I can't wait to see him well again.

242
00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:54.976
Okay.

243
00:14:54.976 --> 00:14:56.776
-Bye. -All right.

244
00:14:57.576 --> 00:14:59.976
Wait. What did she mean when she said "shop"?

245
00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:05.376
Michiko and I are planning to open a cafe.

246
00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:09.676
I'm working here to earn money for the cafe and train.

247
00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:11.376
I see.

248
00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:14.876
If that happens, Mr. Yujiro will be alone and lonely, won't he?

249
00:15:15.976 --> 00:15:18.276
I really wish he would close down the shop

250
00:15:18.276 --> 00:15:21.376
while I can still look after him.

251
00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:23.676
You were saying the same thing before,

252
00:15:23.676 --> 00:15:26.576
but is there a reason why you want to close down the bookshop?

253
00:15:27.976 --> 00:15:30.376
A bookshop requires heavy work load

254
00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:33.276
so it's a burden for aged bodies.

255
00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:35.776
I was worried about making Dad work

256
00:15:35.776 --> 00:15:38.376
in a deteriorated shop like that all alone.

257
00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:40.976
Well, although there was an unfortunate accident,

258
00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:43.476
it all worked out the way you wanted to, right?

259
00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:46.276
I guess things have settled.

260
00:15:46.276 --> 00:15:48.876
Ai, you shouldn't have said that.

261
00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:50.476
Really?

262
00:15:50.476 --> 00:15:51.876
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:02.276 --> 00:16:04.776
Don't go in there, it's dangerous.

264
00:16:06.076 --> 00:16:07.076
Conan?

265
00:16:07.076 --> 00:16:08.276
And...

266
00:16:09.976 --> 00:16:13.276
Mr. Ichiro, what are you doing here?

267
00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:20.676
I dropped something when I came here this afternoon.

268
00:16:20.676 --> 00:16:22.276
I was looking for it.

269
00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.076
Without even turning on the lights?

270
00:16:24.076 --> 00:16:26.376
More importantly, why are you here?

271
00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:29.176
It's dark already, so you should head home.

272
00:16:29.176 --> 00:16:33.076
Aren't you the one who triggered the accident that happened?

273
00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.476
What?

274
00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.676
The accident couldn't have happened

275
00:16:36.676 --> 00:16:38.876
if there wasn't something intentional behind it.

276
00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:41.676
What are you talking about, Conan?

277
00:16:41.676 --> 00:16:43.476
Try to remember.

278
00:16:44.776 --> 00:16:48.576
There were no books in the last bookshelf, right?

279
00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:51.176
Then do you think that empty bookshelf

280
00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:56.776
can make all the other bookshelves fall?

281
00:16:56.776 --> 00:16:59.876
You're right.

282
00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:02.676
Since that entire place was deteriorated,

283
00:17:02.676 --> 00:17:07.876
I see nothing strange about accidents like that happening.

284
00:17:07.876 --> 00:17:10.676
Besides when the bookshelves fell, I was...

285
00:17:10.676 --> 00:17:13.776
You were with us.

286
00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:15.976
This picture was taken at 3:00 sharp

287
00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:18.176
when the locomotive started moving.

288
00:17:18.176 --> 00:17:21.176
And from looking at the broke clock at the bookshop,

289
00:17:21.176 --> 00:17:24.876
the accident happened at the same time.

290
00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:26.176
See?

291
00:17:26.176 --> 00:17:28.876
So it would've been impossible for me

292
00:17:28.876 --> 00:17:30.876
to push the bookshelves down at that time.

293
00:17:30.876 --> 00:17:32.576
Maybe not directly,

294
00:17:32.576 --> 00:17:34.576
but if you use a trick, it's possible.

295
00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:37.276
Trick? What's that?

296
00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:39.276
Take a good look at this picture.

297
00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:43.876
It looks like an ordinary group picture to me.

298
00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:48.376
This picture was actually taken by continuous shooting mode.

299
00:17:48.376 --> 00:17:50.376
Let me play it for you.

300
00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:51.876
Please watch the movement of the butterfly

301
00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:54.076
that you see at the corner.

302
00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:06.276
Don't you think that the movement of this butterfly is odd?

303
00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:09.276
It's weird that it's not flapping its wings,

304
00:18:09.276 --> 00:18:12.876
but it suddenly jumps into the air.

305
00:18:16.276 --> 00:18:17.676
I think that the butterfly was on a string

306
00:18:17.676 --> 00:18:22.876
that was not in sight and bounced up because of impact.

307
00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:23.976
Mr. Ichiro.

308
00:18:24.776 --> 00:18:27.176
You had the wheels of the locomotive and the bookshelf

309
00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:29.776
connected by a string, right?

310
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:33.976
When the wheels of the locomotive start turning at 3:00...

311
00:18:56.176 --> 00:19:01.176
The bookshelves will fall one after the other.

312
00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:05.076
After the wheels wind the string to some extent,

313
00:19:05.076 --> 00:19:09.176
the string was cut and the butterfly bounced up.

314
00:19:09.176 --> 00:19:11.976
When you came over to us,

315
00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:14.176
you had a leaf on you

316
00:19:14.176 --> 00:19:17.576
because you went into the bush to pass the string through.

317
00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:20.976
You're wrong.

318
00:19:20.976 --> 00:19:24.776
Then show me what you're hiding behind your back.

319
00:19:25.776 --> 00:19:28.276
If my deduction is correct,

320
00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:29.976
what you're hiding is the evidence

321
00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:33.176
you used to cause the accident at the bookshop.

322
00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:34.676
Am I wrong?

323
00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:37.876
You wouldn't do anything bad

324
00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.976
because you were so kind to us!

325
00:19:39.976 --> 00:19:41.376
Right?

326
00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:53.776
There are burnt and scratched parts everywhere.

327
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:57.776
I'm sure they will match the marks found on the bookshelf.

328
00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:02.676
Enough already.

329
00:20:02.676 --> 00:20:04.076
I did it.

330
00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:05.376
It's a lie.

331
00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:08.876
You would never think of killing Mr. Yujiro.

332
00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:10.676
Mitsuhiko.

333
00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.676
He wasn't trying to kill him.

334
00:20:12.676 --> 00:20:14.676
Mr. Yujiro has said before,

335
00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:19.376
he just happened to go back to the shop to get his wallet.

336
00:20:19.376 --> 00:20:21.876
Now that you mentioned it, yes.

337
00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:25.076
Mr. Ichiro just tried to destroy the bookshelves.

338
00:20:25.076 --> 00:20:29.376
But Mr. Yujiro unfortunately got messed up in it.

339
00:20:29.376 --> 00:20:32.376
I really did something stupid.

340
00:20:32.376 --> 00:20:35.076
Then why did you do something like this?

341
00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:39.276
I didn't want Dad to push himself any further.

342
00:20:39.276 --> 00:20:40.676
What?

343
00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:43.276
He wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.

344
00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:46.776
I thought that he would stop working if the shop disappeared.

345
00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:54.376
After that, Mr. Ichiro confessed what he did

346
00:20:54.376 --> 00:20:56.676
and turned himself into the police.

347
00:22:26.076 --> 00:22:28.976
This used to be Tamaki Used Bookshop, right?

348
00:22:28.976 --> 00:22:30.976
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

349
00:22:33.076 --> 00:22:34.576
Welcome.

350
00:22:34.576 --> 00:22:35.976
Oh, my.

351
00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:37.276
You're the children from back then.

352
00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:40.676
Here you are.

353
00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:42.276
Mr. Yujiro!

354
00:22:42.276 --> 00:22:44.976
Thank you for your help.

355
00:22:44.976 --> 00:22:46.476
Mr. Ichiro.

356
00:22:46.476 --> 00:22:47.476
Long time no see.

357
00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:50.476
You got to open the cafe that you have always wanted.

358
00:22:50.476 --> 00:22:51.576
Yeah.

359
00:22:51.576 --> 00:22:55.576
We talked it over and decided that it was the best for us three.

360
00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:57.876
It's a really nice shop.

361
00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:00.176
Don't you think so too, Ai?

362
00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:02.376
Well, I guess so.

363
00:23:04.376 --> 00:23:06.476
Thank you.

364
00:23:06.476 --> 00:23:10.376
Mr. Ichiro was taken into the custody of the police for a while,

365
00:23:10.376 --> 00:23:13.076
but since Mr. Yujiro understood how Mr. Ichiro felt,

366
00:23:13.076 --> 00:23:16.076
he did not file claim.

367
00:23:16.076 --> 00:23:19.276
Therefore, Mr. Ichiro was acquitted.

368
00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:21.876
That's right.

369
00:23:23.976 --> 00:23:25.876
These are for you.

370
00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:29.076
I didn't get the chance to give them to you back then.

371
00:23:29.076 --> 00:23:31.676
"The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes" -No joke!

372
00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:33.176
Are you sure it's all right?

373
00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:34.176
Yeah.

374
00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:36.976
All right!

375
00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:38.876
I want that one.

376
00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:40.176
Me, too.

377
00:23:41.476 --> 00:23:44.576
Come on. Didn't you guys get your own books?

378
00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:47.876
-I want that one! -Hey, wait!

379
00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:49.476
No way! Absolutely not!

380
00:23:49.476 --> 00:23:52.276
-Don't fight, you guys! -I said no!

381
00:23:52.276 --> 00:23:53.376
Let go!

382
00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:55.676
"Next Episode"

383
00:23:55.676 --> 00:23:57.776
Where did he go?

384
00:23:57.776 --> 00:24:01.076
Conan went out with Ai and the other kids.

385
00:24:08.876 --> 00:24:11.276
He's seriously hurt, but still breathing.

386
00:24:18.976 --> 00:24:24.376
Next Conan, "Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 1)"

387
00:24:24.819 --> 00:24:27.619
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:29.619
"Family photograph"

389
00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:30.619
Old books sure are great.

390
00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:32.619
-They're cheap, too. -And they have flavor.

391
00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:34.319
They're tasty?
