1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.140
Move your base of operations overseas?

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.040
Does this mean you're finally making a serious effort

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.240
to win a major title?

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.140
Yeah, since I won my first domestic tournament the other day.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.240
"Teigo Banno (32)" -I'm going to base myself in the United States

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.140
and work for three or four years.

7
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.940
"Kurumi Iiyama (29)" -I've already found a house there.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.140
Really?

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.540
So...

10
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.140
I need to move out of here by next month.

11
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.540
Could you return the spare key I gave you?

12
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.840
Oh, is that why you invited me here so early in the morning?

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.240
We hadn't seen each other in a while.

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.740
I thought you were breaking up with me.

15
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.940
I was nervous.

16
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
So, when are you leaving Japan?

17
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.540
My passport is expired.

18
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.240
I'll need to renew it.

19
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.940
Well, actually...

20
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.140
There's no ticket for you.

21
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.540
What?

22
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.940
I've thought about it.

23
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.140
I'd like to reset everything and start with a blank slate.

24
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.340
So you and I are over.

25
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640
You owe me 100 million yen in damages.

26
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.240
100 million?

27
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240
You can afford it, can't you?

28
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.940
It seems like you've been making money off your photo collections.

29
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.040
Wait a minute.

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.440
If I give you that much, I won't be able to go on tour anymore.

31
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.640
You know my father's a lawyer, don't you?

32
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.740
He'll take everything you have, so prepare yourself.

33
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.540
Calm down, Kurumi.

34
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.040
Why don't we talk about it here tonight?

35
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.940
I'll cook dinner for you like I used to.

36
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.540
Fine.

37
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.840
But I have work at 9 am tonight.

38
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.440
Then how about 6:30 pm?

39
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.440
I'll make sure you can eat right away.

40
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.440
Just so you know, you can't distract me with a meal.

41
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.540
In any case, let's talk over dinner.

42
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.240
Also, if you're going to cook, make my favourite paella.

43
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.340
Although you'll probably keep making it for me.

44
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.740
No.

45
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.540
This will be our last dinner.

46
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.740
Did you say something?

47
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740
No, nothing.

48
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.840
Really?

49
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.540
See you at 6:30 pm, then.

50
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.140
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

51
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.740
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

52
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.840
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

53
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840
There's a troubled couple living in an upper floor apartment.

54
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.140
And Ms. Wakasa's home is next door.

55
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.440
His name is Detective Conan!

58
00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:35.898
"The Woman with White Hands (Part 1)"

59
00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:47.398
General, the tiger is afraid of me and won't come out!

60
00:04:47.398 --> 00:04:52.198
Every night this tiger leaves its screen and causes trouble!

61
00:04:52.198 --> 00:04:54.798
If you insist that I capture it,

62
00:04:54.798 --> 00:04:57.798
then you must drive it out of the screen!

63
00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.898
Then I, Ikkyu...

64
00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:05.198
shall tie him up for you!

65
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:09.098
That was amazing!

66
00:05:09.098 --> 00:05:11.098
That was amazing, Conan!

67
00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:14.198
It's way better than the script I wrote.

68
00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:16.298
Really?

69
00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:18.998
You were like the real Ikkyu.

70
00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:19.998
Really?

71
00:05:19.998 --> 00:05:22.398
Impressive as always.

72
00:05:22.398 --> 00:05:24.598
And you've got "tonkatsu" (Japanese pork cutlet).

73
00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:26.598
You mean "tonchi" (wit).

74
00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:27.698
"Menchi" (Minced meat)?

75
00:05:27.698 --> 00:05:28.998
It's "tonchi".

76
00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:30.998
What's that?

77
00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.098
Genta, you haven't heard of "tonchi"?

78
00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.598
I wasn't sure how it would turn out

79
00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:36.498
since you've been skipping rehearsal,

80
00:05:36.498 --> 00:05:38.798
but you show up when it counts.

81
00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:43.798
Actually, I once played this role my third year of grade school.

82
00:05:43.798 --> 00:05:46.098
"Ikkyu" -Who would like to play the role of Ikkyu

83
00:05:46.098 --> 00:05:47.998
"Ikkyu, priest, general" -in the upcoming play?

84
00:05:47.998 --> 00:05:49.898
Teacher!

85
00:05:49.898 --> 00:05:52.598
Suzuki, do you want to play Ikkyu?

86
00:05:52.598 --> 00:05:56.998
No. I think Ikkyu should be played

87
00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:59.198
by the arrogant Shinichi.

88
00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:00.498
What?

89
00:06:00.498 --> 00:06:01.498
Right?

90
00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:03.298
Don't you agree, Ran?

91
00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:07.498
Yeah. And Ikkyu is smart like Holmes.

92
00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:11.898
No way!

93
00:06:11.898 --> 00:06:15.898
You're going to be playing Ikkyu in your upcoming play?

94
00:06:15.898 --> 00:06:16.898
Yeah.

95
00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:19.898
That's great, Shinichi. Isn't you're the leading role?

96
00:06:19.898 --> 00:06:21.598
Well, yeah.

97
00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.698
Then I, Ikkyu, will capture the tiger...

98
00:06:25.698 --> 00:06:26.798
No!

99
00:06:27.898 --> 00:06:31.198
You need to put yourself in Ikkyu's shoes.

100
00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:32.598
Let me see that.

101
00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:33.798
Watch this.

102
00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:36.598
Glare straight ahead.

103
00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:43.198
Then I, Ikkyu, will capture the tiger!

104
00:06:43.198 --> 00:06:45.298
Here. Now you try it.

105
00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:50.798
Then I, Ikkyu, will capture the tiger!

106
00:06:51.898 --> 00:06:56.598
Why don't you change "will" to "shall?"

107
00:06:56.598 --> 00:06:58.798
That'll make it sound more like a folk tale

108
00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:00.798
and give it some weight.

109
00:07:00.798 --> 00:07:06.398
Also, I think changing "capture" to "tie up" would sound stronger too.

110
00:07:06.398 --> 00:07:08.198
Great idea, Yu.

111
00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:10.898
Who cares what I say?

112
00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:13.198
It's just a play.

113
00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:14.498
No.

114
00:07:14.498 --> 00:07:18.798
Are you trying to embarrass the great actress, Yukiko Fujimine?

115
00:07:18.798 --> 00:07:20.298
What?

116
00:07:20.298 --> 00:07:24.998
My parents made me practice half to death.

117
00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:26.198
I see.

118
00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:28.898
So that's why you weren't taking rehearsal serious.

119
00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:31.098
I still remembered most of my lines.

120
00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:34.898
Anyway, this tiger painting is amazing.

121
00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:38.798
It is. It's very realistic and powerful.

122
00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:41.898
Ms. Wakasa, you painted this, right?

123
00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:45.998
Yes. I'm pretty good at painting.

124
00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.998
Okay, everyone.

125
00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:50.098
The actual play is tomorrow.

126
00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:52.698
Let's finish making the sets we have left.

127
00:07:52.698 --> 00:07:54.498
-Okay! -Okay!

128
00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:10.998
Oh, my.

129
00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.998
The water for washing the brushes is pitch black.

130
00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:16.298
I'll get you some clean water.

131
00:08:16.298 --> 00:08:17.898
Thank you.

132
00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:19.898
You're welcome...

133
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:29.198
It hurts...

134
00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:34.498
The folding screen!

135
00:08:34.498 --> 00:08:37.798
Oh, no. What should we do?

136
00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:39.898
I'll repaint it immediately.

137
00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:47.098
Oh, but I took the photo of the tiger I used for reference home.

138
00:08:47.098 --> 00:08:49.298
I know it's a lot to ask,

139
00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:51.498
but you could paint it once you get home today

140
00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:52.898
and bring it in tomorrow?

141
00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:54.598
But then I won't be sure

142
00:08:54.598 --> 00:09:00.098
if the tiger is the right size for Conan's body.

143
00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:02.298
In that case,

144
00:09:02.298 --> 00:09:04.698
do you want me to come over to your place?

145
00:09:04.698 --> 00:09:06.598
I want to go, too.

146
00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:09.098
We'll help you color it.

147
00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:10.098
Really?

148
00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:13.298
It beats working alone.

149
00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:16.898
I'm kind of interested to see your house.

150
00:09:16.898 --> 00:09:18.798
Thank you.

151
00:09:18.798 --> 00:09:21.998
Then can I count on you to recreate the tiger screen?

152
00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:27.498
Yes. I'll take the children home once we're finished.

153
00:09:29.698 --> 00:09:33.598
You live in a high-rise apartment, Ms. Wakasa?

154
00:09:33.598 --> 00:09:34.698
Yes.

155
00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:38.998
It's just like Ayumi's place.

156
00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:41.498
Yoshida, you live in a high-rise, too?

157
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.898
Yeah.

158
00:09:42.898 --> 00:09:44.398
"Banno"

159
00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:45.498
This way.

160
00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:08.298
She was wearing a lot of makeup.

161
00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:11.998
Seems like she had business with Ms. Wakasa's neighbour.

162
00:10:11.998 --> 00:10:14.398
What does your neighbour do?

163
00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:18.798
I think he's some kind of sports athlete.

164
00:10:18.798 --> 00:10:21.098
I've only seen him a few times,

165
00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:23.198
so I don't know him well.

166
00:10:23.198 --> 00:10:24.298
I see.

167
00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:27.498
It's done!

168
00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:29.898
It's even better than the last one.

169
00:10:29.898 --> 00:10:32.798
The size and intensity are perfect, too.

170
00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:36.898
Now we just have to glue it to cardboard once the paint dries.

171
00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:38.698
Thanks, everyone.

172
00:10:38.698 --> 00:10:41.098
I couldn't have done it without you.

173
00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:44.798
You should always help a person in need.

174
00:10:44.798 --> 00:10:46.498
You don't need to thank us.

175
00:10:47.598 --> 00:10:50.398
In that case, to thank you for helping me,

176
00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:53.398
I'll make you some Japanese omelette rice.

177
00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:54.498
Seriously?

178
00:10:54.498 --> 00:10:56.798
Genta.

179
00:10:56.798 --> 00:10:59.398
I thought she didn't need to thank us.

180
00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:03.498
-Thanks for the food! -Thanks for the food!

181
00:11:03.498 --> 00:11:04.998
Sure. Eat up.

182
00:11:07.698 --> 00:11:09.298
It's good!

183
00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:10.698
It's delicious!

184
00:11:10.698 --> 00:11:13.498
It's the best I've ever had!

185
00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:14.698
Thank you.

186
00:11:14.698 --> 00:11:18.198
Anyway, did you call your parents to tell them you'd be home late?

187
00:11:18.198 --> 00:11:19.298
Yeah.

188
00:11:23.698 --> 00:11:26.298
Your neighbour's awfully loud.

189
00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:28.198
I hear it all the time.

190
00:11:28.198 --> 00:11:32.498
Apparently he plays music on a timer instead of setting an alarm.

191
00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:35.198
It's not stopping though.

192
00:11:35.198 --> 00:11:38.698
That's odd. Normally it stops pretty quickly.

193
00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:42.498
I'm gonna go complain.

194
00:11:42.498 --> 00:11:43.898
Wait, Genta.

195
00:11:43.898 --> 00:11:45.298
Conan, you too!

196
00:11:48.698 --> 00:11:50.198
Gosh.

197
00:11:50.198 --> 00:11:52.998
Hey, you're being too loud! Wake up!

198
00:11:52.998 --> 00:11:54.698
Is he not home?

199
00:11:54.698 --> 00:11:57.698
What? It's unlocked.

200
00:11:57.698 --> 00:11:59.598
So he is home.

201
00:11:59.598 --> 00:12:01.298
Wait, Genta.

202
00:12:01.298 --> 00:12:02.498
Hey!

203
00:12:02.498 --> 00:12:04.698
It must be that stereo.

204
00:12:04.698 --> 00:12:07.598
Gosh. How do you turn this thing off?

205
00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:10.498
I'll just unplug this.

206
00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:16.098
It finally stopped.

207
00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:20.198
What's wrong, Genta?

208
00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:44.965
Darn it! That is loud.

209
00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:47.265
Huh? Who are you kids?

210
00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:49.165
Are you a zombie?

211
00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:50.965
Who are you calling a zombie?

212
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:54.865
And you shouldn't come barging into people's homes uninvited.

213
00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:56.465
Next to you...

214
00:12:56.465 --> 00:12:57.665
What?

215
00:13:00.265 --> 00:13:02.265
What is this?

216
00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:03.765
Looks like...

217
00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:07.265
someone bludgeoned her to death.

218
00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:09.065
Bludgeoned?

219
00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:10.465
Ms. Wakasa.

220
00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.265
Call the police.

221
00:13:12.265 --> 00:13:13.565
Okay.

222
00:13:16.065 --> 00:13:20.665
Come to think of it, a strange woman zapped me in my doorway.

223
00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:24.465
You have something on your right cheek.

224
00:13:24.465 --> 00:13:26.665
Something? Like what?

225
00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:30.065
See?

226
00:13:30.065 --> 00:13:32.165
It's written in red.

227
00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:33.565
"I love you"

228
00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:34.865
I love you?

229
00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:38.365
Did you make the dead woman write that?

230
00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:41.865
No! This isn't Kurumi's handwriting!

231
00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:49.065
It's her!

232
00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:51.865
She did it!

233
00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:53.065
Look!

234
00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:55.965
This woman with the white hands wrote it!

235
00:13:55.965 --> 00:14:00.965
Killing Kurumi after knocking me out!

236
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.465
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

237
00:14:05.465 --> 00:14:06.965
It's true.

238
00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:09.565
You have to believe me, officers.

239
00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:13.965
A strange woman suddenly showed up at my place this evening.

240
00:14:13.965 --> 00:14:15.565
The moment I opened the door,

241
00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:19.265
she zapped me with a stun gun and knocked me out.

242
00:14:19.265 --> 00:14:20.265
When I came to my senses,

243
00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:23.665
these kids were in my apartment

244
00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:26.065
and were yelling.

245
00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:29.665
They told me to look next to me, so I did.

246
00:14:29.665 --> 00:14:31.565
That's when I saw my girlfriend, Kurumi,

247
00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:34.765
bleeding from her head on the floor.

248
00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:36.165
I see.

249
00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:39.665
By the way, what about those red letters on your right cheek?

250
00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:42.465
That strange woman wrote this.

251
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:46.165
The one who knocked you out with the stun gun?

252
00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:52.465
This polaroid that was on the floor next to me proves it.

253
00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:53.465
Look.

254
00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:56.965
This woman with white hands is writing on my cheek.

255
00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:03.465
Kurumi was supposed to come to my place at 6.30 pm.

256
00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:06.365
She must've entered without realizing that strange woman

257
00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:07.765
was inside.

258
00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:11.165
And that woman killed her when they ran into each other.

259
00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:14.865
An imaginary girlfriend.

260
00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:16.265
What?

261
00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:18.865
I've seen it on TV and in magazines.

262
00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:22.365
Men put foundation and nail polish on their hands

263
00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:26.465
and take selfies to make it look like they have girlfriends.

264
00:15:26.465 --> 00:15:30.265
Maybe that's how you took that photo.

265
00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:33.365
What are you talking about?

266
00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.765
Look closely.

267
00:15:35.765 --> 00:15:39.065
My right hand is behind my head.

268
00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:42.465
And I couldn't write this clearly on my own face.

269
00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:46.265
Then maybe you made the woman write that

270
00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:48.265
on your face before killing her.

271
00:15:48.265 --> 00:15:50.265
Don't be ridiculous!

272
00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:53.465
There was another photo.

273
00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:54.465
Look at it!

274
00:15:54.465 --> 00:15:58.465
She took a photo before she wrote on my face.

275
00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:01.965
That's why Kurumi couldn't have written it.

276
00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:03.965
You're right.

277
00:16:08.965 --> 00:16:13.165
Anyway, officers, can I erase this writing on my face?

278
00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:14.765
It's creeping me out.

279
00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:18.865
You can once forensics has taken photos of it.

280
00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:20.765
Then hurry up.

281
00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:29.265
Do you remember what the woman who knocked you out

282
00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:30.865
with a stun gun looked like?

283
00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:34.765
Yeah, but since I lost consciousness almost instantly,

284
00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:36.865
I only got a quick look at her.

285
00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:40.865
She was wearing a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

286
00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:44.165
A broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses...

287
00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:46.565
Anything else?

288
00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:48.065
Well...

289
00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:51.865
She was wearing a lot of makeup.

290
00:16:51.865 --> 00:16:56.965
We saw her standing in front of the door to this apartment.

291
00:16:58.165 --> 00:16:59.365
Is that true?

292
00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:02.465
She rang the doorbell a bunch of times.

293
00:17:02.465 --> 00:17:03.565
When she realized he wasn't home,

294
00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:07.865
she banged on the door and clicked her tongue.

295
00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:09.265
Come to think of it,

296
00:17:09.265 --> 00:17:13.265
she had a scrunchie on her right hand

297
00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.265
like the woman in the photo.

298
00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:17.365
That's it! It was her!

299
00:17:17.365 --> 00:17:20.465
She was relatively tall.

300
00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:24.165
Just about your height.

301
00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:26.365
Really?

302
00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:32.365
Did you recognize the woman?

303
00:17:33.665 --> 00:17:37.265
I had my first win the other day and published a photo collection.

304
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.365
I've had a sudden increase in weird fans.

305
00:17:41.665 --> 00:17:42.965
First win?

306
00:17:42.965 --> 00:17:48.465
Are you the professional golfer, Teigo Banno?

307
00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:49.665
You just noticed?

308
00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:52.065
Then the murdered woman

309
00:17:52.065 --> 00:17:55.265
is the model you were rumoured to have been dating...

310
00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:57.865
Yeah, Kurumi Iiyama.

311
00:17:57.865 --> 00:17:59.365
Is she famous?

312
00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:02.465
Yes. Her father's a lawyer.

313
00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:05.465
She was being promoted as a socialite model.

314
00:18:05.465 --> 00:18:07.165
So you have all these trophies

315
00:18:07.165 --> 00:18:10.365
because you're a professional golfer.

316
00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:15.365
The cabinets below are full of file folders.

317
00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:16.765
Don't touch those!

318
00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.965
I mean...

319
00:18:20.965 --> 00:18:23.665
They're records of the tours I've participated in.

320
00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:25.665
I finally got them organized recently,

321
00:18:25.665 --> 00:18:28.365
so try not to touch them.

322
00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:30.465
-I'm sorry. -Sorry.

323
00:18:30.465 --> 00:18:36.265
By the way, why did the victim, Ms. Iiyama, come here?

324
00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:38.565
She was just coming to hang out.

325
00:18:38.565 --> 00:18:40.665
She's my girlfriend.

326
00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:42.265
Nothing wrong with that, right?

327
00:18:42.265 --> 00:18:44.865
You were breaking up.

328
00:18:44.865 --> 00:18:46.365
Right?

329
00:18:50.165 --> 00:18:51.265
Excuse me.

330
00:18:51.265 --> 00:18:54.965
I've been wondering, but who are you?

331
00:18:54.965 --> 00:19:00.265
I'm their assistant homeroom teacher, Rumi Wakasa.

332
00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:03.365
What's their assistant homeroom teacher doing here?

333
00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:08.365
I actually live next door.

334
00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:10.265
Today the children helped me paint the screen

335
00:19:10.265 --> 00:19:14.865
that we're using in a play tomorrow.

336
00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:19.465
We heard loud music coming from next door.

337
00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:23.965
Normally it stops immediately, but today it kept playing.

338
00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:26.665
So we came to check things out

339
00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.765
and found the front door unlocked.

340
00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:31.765
And that's how we ended up here.

341
00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:33.165
I see.

342
00:19:33.165 --> 00:19:36.065
What did you mean by breaking up?

343
00:19:36.065 --> 00:19:40.065
This morning on my way to school I passed by this apartment,

344
00:19:40.065 --> 00:19:44.165
I heard the two of them arguing.

345
00:19:44.165 --> 00:19:46.265
You heard them arguing?

346
00:19:46.265 --> 00:19:47.865
About what?

347
00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:52.865
I think he said he wasn't taking her with him on his international tour.

348
00:19:52.865 --> 00:19:55.965
And she demanded he pay her damages for breaking up with her.

349
00:19:55.965 --> 00:20:00.365
He said he'd cook for her so they could talk about it tonight.

350
00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:04.565
So she asked him to make paella.

351
00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:05.965
And he said,

352
00:20:05.965 --> 00:20:11.165
it would be their last dinner.

353
00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:14.265
Their last dinner?

354
00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:17.865
Oh, excuse me. I may have misheard them.

355
00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:22.465
You haven't cooked anything, though.

356
00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:26.365
We didn't smell any food when we entered the apartment.

357
00:20:26.365 --> 00:20:27.965
The refrigerator's empty too.

358
00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:31.565
I was just about to go buy ingredients

359
00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:34.665
when the strange woman knocked me out.

360
00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:37.365
And stop messing around in my kitchen.

361
00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:42.465
Yeah, but when the strange woman rang your doorbell,

362
00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:45.165
you were out, right?

363
00:20:45.165 --> 00:20:49.265
You should've bought the ingredients on your way home.

364
00:20:49.265 --> 00:20:51.765
I do what I want.

365
00:20:51.765 --> 00:20:55.865
In any case, see if any the other residents have seen the woman.

366
00:20:55.865 --> 00:20:57.465
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.065
And Ms. Wakasa,

368
00:20:59.065 --> 00:21:03.065
could you return to your apartment with the children?

369
00:21:03.065 --> 00:21:04.265
Okay.

370
00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:06.965
Come on, children. Let's head back to my apartment.

371
00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.365
Okay.

372
00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.165
Darn it.

373
00:21:13.165 --> 00:21:14.265
If I'd known this would happen,

374
00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:17.965
I would've taken a photo of that woman ringing the doorbell.

375
00:21:17.965 --> 00:21:23.365
Her white hands are in the polaroid, though.

376
00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:26.265
Conan.

377
00:21:26.265 --> 00:21:29.865
Can't you drag the woman out of the photo?

378
00:21:29.865 --> 00:21:32.165
Aren't you Ikkyu?

379
00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:34.265
I can't do that.

380
00:21:34.265 --> 00:21:36.665
Besides, I'm not Ikkyu.

381
00:21:36.665 --> 00:21:40.265
And not even Ikkyu could do that.

382
00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:42.565
Oh?

383
00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:44.765
What is this smell?

384
00:21:44.765 --> 00:21:47.665
It smells like the cosmetics section of a department store.

385
00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:50.865
Did Ms. Wakasa spill some of her cosmetics?

386
00:21:53.565 --> 00:21:56.165
It's coming from Kojima's right hand.

387
00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:57.465
What? Me?

388
00:21:57.465 --> 00:21:59.365
But I'm not wearing any makeup.

389
00:22:02.165 --> 00:22:03.965
I knew it.

390
00:22:03.965 --> 00:22:05.565
Knew what?

391
00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:08.365
Didn't I say I'm not wearing makeup?

392
00:22:08.365 --> 00:22:11.065
No, I'm talking about the perp.

393
00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:13.165
What? The perp?

394
00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:16.265
Conan, have you already figured out who the perp is?

395
00:22:16.265 --> 00:22:18.265
Who is that woman?

396
00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:20.565
Tell us, Conan.

397
00:22:20.565 --> 00:22:24.565
The person who killed the model, Kurumi Iiyama, is...

398
00:22:25.865 --> 00:22:31.365
the professional golfer, Teigo Banno, after all.

399
00:22:31.365 --> 00:22:33.965
-What? -What?

400
00:23:54.365 --> 00:23:56.565
"Next Episode" -It's hard to imagine

401
00:23:56.565 --> 00:24:00.565
someone could write so clearly on their own face.

402
00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:02.265
That's the thing.

403
00:24:02.265 --> 00:24:06.265
There really was a woman wearing a broad-brimmed hat

404
00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:08.065
and sunglasses.

405
00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:12.065
It was probably that woman in the photo with white hands.

406
00:24:12.065 --> 00:24:14.365
Hurry up and find her.

407
00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:18.365
These children claimed to have figured something out.

408
00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:24.365
Next Conan, "The Woman with White Hands (Part 2)"

409
00:24:24.608 --> 00:24:27.208
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:29.408
"Stamp"

411
00:24:29.408 --> 00:24:31.008
-Our Japanese omelette rice! -We weren't...

412
00:24:31.008 --> 00:24:32.608
-Finished eating! -We'll eat next time.

413
00:24:32.608 --> 00:24:33.908
It'll be cold.
