1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.940
After accepting Sonoko's invitation,

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.940
Ran and I headed toward Haido Hotel for a cake buffet.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.040
We encountered a Jeet Kune Do user on the bus en route.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740
With combative skills that evenly matched Ran's,

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.040
who is this person?

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.340
At Haido Hotel, the fact that the cake buffet offer

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.240
already came to an end disappointed Ran and Sonoko.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.740
Then came a resounding scream.

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
A man had fallen to his death

10
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.040
at the parking lot behind the hotel annex.

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.040
Toshiko Hirukawa, a housewife who happened to be there,

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.240
said she saw someone on the roof,

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.840
so we rushed there as fast as we could.

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.140
However, all we saw on the roof

15
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.340
were men's shoes and clothes.

16
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.440
Was this a suicide?

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.040
No, this was a murder disguised as a suicide.

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.740
One more person saw through the disguise.

19
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.440
It was the Jeet Kune Do user from earlier, Sera.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.940
That wannabe claimed to be a detective.

21
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.140
The man who fell to his death was Teigo Uesumi.

22
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.640
He caused a public uproar

23
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.540
for being the ringleader of a remittance scam.

24
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.540
And Hirukawa's group was victims from that scam.

25
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.440
In the hotel annex where Uesumi was hiding,

26
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.440
rumors regarding an old man's ghost on a wheelchair

27
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.840
were flying about.

28
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.740
Apparently, Hirukwa's father who had been using the wheelchair

29
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.940
lost hope at the news of his wife's death

30
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.440
due to her suffering from the scam.

31
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.240
And committed suicide in this hotel annex.

32
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.040
Don't tell me, Uesumi was pushed off by a ghost?

33
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740
Or was it...

34
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.640
If all cases were men,

35
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.440
all hidden mysteries are women.

36
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440
The truth behind the ghost will betray any expectations.

37
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.440
And the identity of Sera, our new detective is...

38
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.440
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

41
00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:21.193
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 2)"

42
00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:28.093
This graffiti certainly is terrible.

43
00:03:28.093 --> 00:03:31.493
No choice but to renovate, huh?

44
00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:32.893
Officer Chiba!

45
00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:34.693
You found anyone?

46
00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.193
No, not yet.

47
00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:39.493
Oh? Why is there a wheelchair here?

48
00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:41.393
I don't know.

49
00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:43.993
When I found it, it was still moving.

50
00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:45.693
It was moving?

51
00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.893
Since there was weird fishing line

52
00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.193
attached between the wheels,

53
00:03:50.193 --> 00:03:52.093
I checked with the hotel.

54
00:03:52.093 --> 00:03:54.193
They said this was the electric wheelchair

55
00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.993
that the fallen Uesumi had been borrowing.

56
00:03:56.993 --> 00:03:59.493
So did he have bad legs?

57
00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:04.793
No, it seems that he was just using it to cruise around the annex.

58
00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:07.993
What an unbelievable guy.

59
00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:10.493
It's possible that Uesumi was the one

60
00:04:10.493 --> 00:04:13.193
behind the aforementioned ghost commotion.

61
00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:16.493
If he had planned to scare the three victims

62
00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:19.293
who came to visit on 2F where the elderly man committed suicide,

63
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:21.693
by manipulating the unoccupied wheelchair with a fishing line,

64
00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:24.493
if we think of it this way...

65
00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:28.493
That would certainly make sense.

66
00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:32.193
Even so, this fishing line is extremely long.

67
00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:36.193
And there are some broken rubber bands at the tip of this.

68
00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.793
The footrests have marks

69
00:04:37.793 --> 00:04:40.693
indicating they've bumped into something.

70
00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:44.893
Say, Inspector, couldn't the culprit have used this?

71
00:04:44.893 --> 00:04:47.393
Take a look out the window.

72
00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:51.593
This is the opposite side from the parking lot where Uesumi fell.

73
00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:54.893
They couldn't have accomplished anything even with the wheelchair.

74
00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.993
Why is Conan with us?

75
00:04:56.993 --> 00:05:00.493
Conan was among the ones who came to the annex

76
00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:04.393
after the incident, so I brought him along just in case.

77
00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:07.093
Looks like there's an unfamiliar man in the mix.

78
00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:09.493
Yeah, a detective it seems.

79
00:05:09.493 --> 00:05:13.693
A detective, huh?

80
00:05:15.293 --> 00:05:18.293
Could it have been your misunderstanding?

81
00:05:18.293 --> 00:05:21.793
Regarding this elevator stopping on the second and sixth floor?

82
00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:25.793
If you think I'm lying, ask the guard and find out.

83
00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:27.693
Because we both saw it

84
00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.793
when I asked him to keep watch on the elevator.

85
00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:39.193
So the doors on this side open too?

86
00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:43.293
Yeah! This elevator has both front and rear doors!

87
00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:45.193
When I asked the hotel staff,

88
00:05:45.193 --> 00:05:47.893
they said that this side of the annex's 1F and 2F

89
00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:50.693
were made into a Grand Hall used for occasions like weddings.

90
00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:52.193
And that by making the elevator entrance and exit

91
00:05:52.193 --> 00:05:53.993
on the opposite side, it was more convenient

92
00:05:53.993 --> 00:05:58.793
and freed up more space, so that's why!

93
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:02.993
Still, it seems that the graffiti here is even more obnoxious.

94
00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:04.293
Yes.

95
00:06:04.293 --> 00:06:08.193
Since this apparently was the floor Uesumi had been staying on.

96
00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:10.493
By the way, the renovation workers

97
00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:12.593
had been scheduled to come in one hour

98
00:06:12.593 --> 00:06:14.793
after the time of Uesumi's fall.

99
00:06:14.793 --> 00:06:16.193
So this is it...

100
00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:19.193
The window Uesumi broke using the fire extinguisher.

101
00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:20.593
Looks like it.

102
00:06:20.593 --> 00:06:23.193
Hey, that's dangerous!

103
00:06:23.193 --> 00:06:25.093
The sticky tape on the sheets that had been covering it

104
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:28.093
has been blown through by the wind.

105
00:06:28.093 --> 00:06:30.093
But, this place is...

106
00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:33.193
it's directly above the place where he fell, right?

107
00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.393
Don't you think this means something?

108
00:06:38.993 --> 00:06:41.593
On the border between the wall under the window and the floor,

109
00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:43.493
there's a lot of paint.

110
00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:46.293
What's more...

111
00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:50.193
It's entirely dried up.

112
00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:51.293
And these marks seem to indicate

113
00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:53.993
something had been placed a top the paint.

114
00:06:58.193 --> 00:07:00.693
This paint can, perhaps?

115
00:07:00.693 --> 00:07:04.093
There's a dent on it caused by collision.

116
00:07:04.093 --> 00:07:07.593
And there's one more paint can with the same condition.

117
00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:10.193
As far as having marks from having bumped into something,

118
00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:14.593
the bottom parts of those elevator doors have them too.

119
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.093
Hold on, hold on.

120
00:07:18.093 --> 00:07:21.493
An elevator with both front and rear doors.

121
00:07:21.493 --> 00:07:24.793
An electric wheelchair with fishing line attached.

122
00:07:24.793 --> 00:07:26.493
Rumors of ghosts.

123
00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:31.293
And this suspicious renovation scene.

124
00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:33.993
I see, so that's how it was!

125
00:07:33.993 --> 00:07:35.693
No doubt the culprit was the only one

126
00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:37.293
to have entered the annex before the incident.

127
00:07:37.293 --> 00:07:40.893
It was that lady named Hirukawa, our culprit!

128
00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.593
What?

129
00:07:42.593 --> 00:07:45.993
If you would set things up per my instructions now,

130
00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:48.593
and bring Mrs. Hirukawa over here?

131
00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:00.793
You said the case is solved.

132
00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:04.193
So then you've realized that he committed suicide after all?

133
00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:05.893
No.

134
00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:10.193
Teigo Uesumi's jumper suicide was a trick.

135
00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:13.093
And that's why we deliberately had you come to this 6F

136
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:14.493
via the elevator

137
00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:17.093
which was out of service at the time of crime.

138
00:08:17.093 --> 00:08:19.293
Because the culprit used the elevator

139
00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:21.393
in order to disguise it as a suicide.

140
00:08:21.393 --> 00:08:22.893
Or so he says.

141
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:24.893
He? I'm...

142
00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:26.393
You're Sera, right?

143
00:08:26.393 --> 00:08:28.993
-Oh, I mean... -Anyway...

144
00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:30.593
Can you tell us?

145
00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.693
Your deduction, Sera?

146
00:08:32.693 --> 00:08:34.493
We'll listen and let you know

147
00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:37.493
if there are any erroneous parts.

148
00:08:37.493 --> 00:08:40.693
Well, all right, you d better watch and learn.

149
00:08:40.693 --> 00:08:42.393
Because the trick I'm going to speak of

150
00:08:42.393 --> 00:08:44.693
will be put it into practice right here!

151
00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:48.293
But, why right here?

152
00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:52.993
Even if it was a murder, didn't he fall from the roof?

153
00:08:52.993 --> 00:08:54.793
I've said this before,

154
00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:58.193
but Uesumi's jacket and shoes found on the roof

155
00:08:58.193 --> 00:09:00.393
were placed beforehand in order to make this incident

156
00:09:00.393 --> 00:09:02.993
look like a jumper suicide.

157
00:09:02.993 --> 00:09:04.593
They were fakes planted there

158
00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:06.193
so that we wouldn't know the actual crime scene was here

159
00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:08.793
on the 6F of the annex.

160
00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:10.293
Mrs. Hirakawa.

161
00:09:10.293 --> 00:09:13.593
You did that in order to hide the fact that you used

162
00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:18.093
the elevator and wheelchair to fling Uesumi out from here!

163
00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:21.593
Hold on a minute!

164
00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:23.893
When he fell from above,

165
00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:27.293
Mrs. Hirukawa was inside the car in the parking lot

166
00:09:27.293 --> 00:09:29.993
with the two of us!

167
00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:31.393
That's right.

168
00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:33.193
So tell me,

169
00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:36.593
how could I have controlled the wheelchair and the elevator?

170
00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:37.993
Sure thing!

171
00:09:37.993 --> 00:09:40.093
Once you pressed the buttons on the elevator beforehand,

172
00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.793
you didn't need to stay there

173
00:09:41.793 --> 00:09:45.493
to be able to transport Uesumi in the electric wheelchair

174
00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:48.093
from 2F to 6F, drop him,

175
00:09:48.093 --> 00:09:52.193
and then return the wheelchair to 2F.

176
00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.293
Although, you did need to have prepared

177
00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:58.693
a long fishing line with several rubber bands attached to one end.

178
00:09:58.693 --> 00:10:00.493
Fishing line and rubber bands?

179
00:10:00.493 --> 00:10:04.393
Well, why don't we hear it from you then?

180
00:10:04.393 --> 00:10:07.893
How one could automatically cause someone to fall to their death

181
00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:10.893
with this witchcraft-like trick?

182
00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:11.993
Well...

183
00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:26.893
First, you met with Uesumi who was staying on this sixth floor

184
00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:29.893
and fed him alcohol until he was inebriated.

185
00:10:31.393 --> 00:10:33.393
Next, you set the completely smashed Uesumi up

186
00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:35.793
in the wheelchair he borrowed,

187
00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:38.293
in a way that he was hugging his knees,

188
00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:40.293
and brought him in front of the elevator

189
00:10:40.293 --> 00:10:41.893
while opening the door.

190
00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:44.793
So that you could wrap the rubber bands

191
00:10:44.793 --> 00:10:46.693
attached to the long fishing line around the mirror

192
00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:49.293
near the elevator's ceiling.

193
00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:51.493
Then, you pushed the button for the first floor

194
00:10:51.493 --> 00:10:55.593
from outside the elevator to send the empty cab down,

195
00:10:55.593 --> 00:10:56.893
so that you could measure

196
00:10:56.893 --> 00:10:58.893
the length of the line between 1F and 6F.

197
00:10:58.893 --> 00:11:01.393
You then brought the elevator back up to 6F

198
00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:05.093
and at a length about 30cm shorter than measured.

199
00:11:05.093 --> 00:11:06.693
You tied the fishing line

200
00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:08.293
in between the front wheels of the chair,

201
00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.793
so that your trick could start!

202
00:11:11.093 --> 00:11:13.393
After reeling the fishing line in

203
00:11:13.393 --> 00:11:15.193
so that it wouldn't catch on anything,

204
00:11:15.193 --> 00:11:18.893
you rode the elevator with Uesumi on the wheelchair.

205
00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:22.693
On the second floor, you pushed the wheelchair out the elevator

206
00:11:22.693 --> 00:11:25.993
and steered the wheelchair toward the elevator doors.

207
00:11:25.993 --> 00:11:29.493
You then closed the doors and descended to 1F.

208
00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:34.093
The one who ran into Mrs. Hirukawa

209
00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:37.893
as she got off on 1F was this little boy.

210
00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:39.493
It seems you told him,

211
00:11:39.493 --> 00:11:42.093
"This one is for the annex, so don't get on" or something.

212
00:11:42.093 --> 00:11:46.493
But that was to prevent the little boy from using the elevator.

213
00:11:46.493 --> 00:11:48.793
Because if he did, the fact that

214
00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:50.493
a weird line was dangling down from the mirror

215
00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:52.893
above the elevator doors.

216
00:11:52.893 --> 00:11:54.093
And that the other end of the line

217
00:11:54.093 --> 00:11:57.593
passed out through the opposite doors would be exposed.

218
00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:02.393
Plus, the fact that the buttons for 2F and 6F had been pushed

219
00:12:02.393 --> 00:12:05.293
would have become an obvious clue.

220
00:12:05.293 --> 00:12:08.093
The second and sixth floors?

221
00:12:08.093 --> 00:12:10.693
Well, "Seeing is believing".

222
00:12:10.693 --> 00:12:12.493
Let's go ahead and reenact it!

223
00:12:12.493 --> 00:12:13.993
Ready, Inspector?

224
00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:16.793
Officer Chiba, are you ready?

225
00:12:16.793 --> 00:12:17.893
Yes, sir!

226
00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:21.193
I've pressed the buttons for 2F and 6F on the elevator.

227
00:12:21.193 --> 00:12:22.993
I'm sending it up now!

228
00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:28.793
As the elevator reaches the second floor,

229
00:12:28.793 --> 00:12:30.693
what's waiting for it is...

230
00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:33.993
The electric wheelchair, which is still moving forward

231
00:12:33.993 --> 00:12:35.893
while being blocked by the doors.

232
00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:38.693
When those doors open, it'll go inside the elevator

233
00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:42.093
and keep going straight into the doors on the opposite side.

234
00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:43.593
As you already know,

235
00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:47.293
this elevator has both front and rear doors.

236
00:12:47.293 --> 00:12:49.593
The doors that open on 2F

237
00:12:49.593 --> 00:12:52.993
are on the opposite side as those that open on 6F.

238
00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:56.393
Which means the wheelchair that entered on the 2F

239
00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:59.993
will automatically come straight out when it reaches this 6F.

240
00:13:02.293 --> 00:13:04.893
Afterwards, if you use the paint cans and cardboard boxes

241
00:13:04.893 --> 00:13:09.793
placed around the elevator to guide the wheelchair's path...

242
00:13:09.793 --> 00:13:11.693
The wheelchair will keep going in a straight line

243
00:13:11.693 --> 00:13:13.093
parallel to the wall.

244
00:13:13.093 --> 00:13:15.693
Toward the glass window that Uesumi had broken,

245
00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:18.093
hit the wall below it, and...

246
00:13:22.893 --> 00:13:24.593
What?

247
00:13:24.593 --> 00:13:27.093
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

248
00:13:27.093 --> 00:13:28.193
No, no way!

249
00:13:28.193 --> 00:13:29.593
The reactive force from hitting the wall

250
00:13:29.593 --> 00:13:32.293
should have already sent the dummy flying out!

251
00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:35.793
Perhaps, when the wheelchair headed back to the second floor,

252
00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:37.193
the force of the turn threw him out...

253
00:13:37.193 --> 00:13:40.193
But, according to your previous deduction,

254
00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:43.393
you said the culprit only returned the wheelchair to the second floor

255
00:13:43.393 --> 00:13:45.493
after Uesumi had fallen.

256
00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:47.293
Did I say that?

257
00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:51.193
Don't tell me this wannabe truly didn't figure it out?

258
00:13:51.193 --> 00:13:52.793
But I'm in a bind.

259
00:13:52.793 --> 00:13:54.693
It's too abrupt to call Sonoko now

260
00:13:54.693 --> 00:13:56.893
and put her to sleep for my deduction.

261
00:13:56.893 --> 00:13:58.893
And making Inspector Megure or Detective Takagi

262
00:13:58.893 --> 00:14:01.793
the target of my tranquilizer watch

263
00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:04.793
will create problems down the road.

264
00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:06.493
The only one who can appear here unannounced

265
00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:09.293
and yet convincingly shine light on the truth...

266
00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:11.593
And later be able to explain away their involvement,

267
00:14:11.593 --> 00:14:13.693
is none other than...

268
00:14:13.693 --> 00:14:15.293
I got it!

269
00:14:15.293 --> 00:14:17.093
She used her car!

270
00:14:17.093 --> 00:14:19.393
She tied Uesumi, who was brought here by the wheelchair,

271
00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:22.593
to her car with a fishing line and backed it up...

272
00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:23.593
Sorry to say,

273
00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:26.093
but we didn't find any sort of device or trick at all

274
00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:27.693
on Mrs. Hirukawa's car.

275
00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:31.793
And frankly, if she had tied Uesumi to her car using the line,

276
00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:33.893
she could've just left him sleeping near the window

277
00:14:33.893 --> 00:14:36.893
instead of moving him with the wheelchair, no?

278
00:14:37.993 --> 00:14:39.993
You have a point.

279
00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:42.293
Look what I've done.

280
00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:44.393
I was too careless.

281
00:14:45.893 --> 00:14:49.493
Indeed, an interesting trick it was.

282
00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:52.093
But it was just an empty theory.

283
00:14:52.093 --> 00:14:55.593
I'm disappointed in you, police officers.

284
00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:58.993
To think you'd take a whipper-snapper's fantasy as truth.

285
00:14:59.993 --> 00:15:01.993
It was the paint cans.

286
00:15:03.493 --> 00:15:07.693
The culprit used the two paint cans near the window

287
00:15:07.693 --> 00:15:10.793
in order to toss the victim out the window.

288
00:15:10.793 --> 00:15:13.393
-The... -The voice... is that Kudo?

289
00:15:13.393 --> 00:15:15.093
That's right!

290
00:15:16.193 --> 00:15:19.493
Once I told Shinichi about the case over the phone,

291
00:15:19.493 --> 00:15:21.693
he said he figured it out!

292
00:15:21.693 --> 00:15:24.293
Shinichi Kudo?

293
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.140
Shinichi Kudo?

294
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.840
And then?

295
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.240
How exactly were the paint cans used?

296
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.540
Kudo?

297
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.340
There is a huge stain

298
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.140
from spilled paint beneath the window, right?

299
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.840
And some marks indicating something had been put there.

300
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.440
So please set the paint cans on their side

301
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.740
and align them with those marks.

302
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.040
Do they match up perfectly?

303
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.940
Both of them match up exactly!

304
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.540
Then please hold those two cans in place

305
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.240
from either side with your feet.

306
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.240
Pull the wheelchair away from the window

307
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.840
and set it in motion once more!

308
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.440
Well, the wheelchair...

309
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.740
All right, I'll handle this.

310
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.640
Will it work if I start from around here, Kudo?

311
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.340
Around here?

312
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.940
I'm not at the crime scene,

313
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.740
so there's no way I could ascertain that.

314
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.140
I suppose so, huh.

315
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.840
All right, I'll let 'er rip!

316
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.140
The wheelchair Uesumi had been placed

317
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.040
in exited the elevator on 6F

318
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.140
and headed toward the window.

319
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.440
And when the footrests hit the paint cans

320
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.840
that had been glued against the wall by paint.

321
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.640
The footrests would slip under the cans

322
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.740
tilting the wheelchair forward.

323
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.940
The armrests would then hit the wall,

324
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.740
sending the victim flying due to recoil.

325
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.540
And the culprit having confirmed the victim's fall with her own eyes.

326
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.840
Made up an excuse to go up the roof

327
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.340
by mentioning a suspicious figure

328
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.840
and brought the elevator down from the sixth floor

329
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.840
to the first floor.

330
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.640
Chiba, call the elevator down to 1F.

331
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.940
Roger that.

332
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.540
Doing so pulled on the fishing line

333
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.940
that had been attached to the wheels.

334
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.440
The wheelchair did an about-face

335
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.140
and moved toward the elevator

336
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.540
and crashed into the elevator doors!

337
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.440
As the fishing line that was 30cm shy

338
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.240
kept being pulled down...

339
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.140
The rubber bands wrapped around the elevator mirror

340
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.140
stretched to the fullest.

341
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.440
And snapped!

342
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.540
That's how, when the culprit got on to the elevator,

343
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.240
nothing was left inside of it!

344
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.440
Afterwards, when the elevator reached the rooftop,

345
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.040
she made up some reason.

346
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.740
What are you doing, Mrs. Hirukawa?

347
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.340
Can't I just stay here?

348
00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.840
I'm scared.

349
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.340
No way!

350
00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.740
You're the one who saw them, Mrs. Hirukawa!

351
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.740
And she only had to push the 6F and 2F buttons before she left.

352
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.540
Having done so, the elevator would bring the wheelchair

353
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.940
from 6F down to 2F in the same manner as before.

354
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.340
Even if the police found it later...

355
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.540
They would only see it as a random wheelchair

356
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.940
that was still running for some reason,

357
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.840
away from the crime scene.

358
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.740
Incidentally, the reason why the paint cans were not stuck to the wall

359
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.740
under the window when Conan got there was...

360
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.640
because the collision from the footrests

361
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.540
knocked them loose from the wall.

362
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.440
And when the wheelchair turned around,

363
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.140
the force bumped them off.

364
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.040
At any rate, if you find fibers from the clothes the victim was wearing

365
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.740
on the clothes the culprit has on,

366
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.740
it'd be decisive.

367
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.240
Since, in order for a woman to put a grown man in a wheelchair

368
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.640
she had to have held his body tightly against her.

369
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.940
Of course, if you testify that the man

370
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.540
whom you saw as the remittance scam ringleader...

371
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.240
And you, the surviving family member of his victim,

372
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.240
had hugged in joy after reconciling...

373
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.640
That'll be a different story.

374
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.240
If I had to commit that sort of nausea-inducing perjury,

375
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.440
I'd rather just confess to everything!

376
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.940
That I was the one who put that man in the wheelchair,

377
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.940
And wheeled him straight into hell!

378
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.240
Then, could it be that the haunting rumors

379
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.640
were the result of your having tested this trick out repeatedly?

380
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.140
No.

381
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.240
I only came up with the idea of setting the paint cans

382
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.640
under the window that man broke.

383
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.040
The one who tested it out repeatedly wasn't me.

384
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.640
Before, when I had gone to that man's room to call on him...

385
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.440
It was that man who showed me...

386
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.440
An unoccupied wheelchair

387
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.440
coming out from an empty elevator.

388
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.940
Don't tell me, the victim came up with the trick himself?

389
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.740
Yeah. That man, as he was laughing

390
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.940
and ending the call with his friend who had sent the elevator up, said...

391
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.540
It was a plan to drive out all the pesky media

392
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.440
and hotel annex guests,

393
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.740
dubbed "Operation Old Geezer's Ghost"!

394
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.640
That's why I had him sit in the wheelchair

395
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.240
in order to make that man understand

396
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.340
how my father had kept begging for his apologies

397
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.640
even while riding in a wheelchair.

398
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.640
That heartrending feeling of his...

399
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.040
Afterwards, Teigo Uesumi's hidden bank account was found,

400
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.740
and by following the money trial, more scan groups

401
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.840
were subsequently arrested.

402
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.840
The case against the remittance scan leader

403
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.140
was sent to the prosecutor even though the suspect had died.

404
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.940
And thus the curtain closed on

405
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.740
both the scam case and the murder case.

406
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.040
Huh? It was Shinichi who solved that case?

407
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.340
That's right!

408
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.540
Detective Takagi spilled the beans after my interrogation!

409
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.640
How he had seen through the truth like it was nothing

410
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.640
after getting a call from Conan!

411
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.040
Wouldn't it be great if he would also take the time

412
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.340
to give his lovely dear wife a ring?

413
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.240
That reminds me,

414
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.540
that Sera person was also a detective, according to Conan.

415
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.540
That person also said "We'll see each other soon" before we left.

416
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.540
I wonder what that meant?

417
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.140
I don't know. Maybe he's just interested in you. Ran?

418
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.940
All right.

419
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.040
Let me introduce to you!

420
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.440
Someone who's joining our class as of today.

421
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.940
Sera!

422
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.240
Sera?

423
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.340
A transfer student?

424
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.940
What the... she's wearing a skirt!

425
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.240
A girl?

426
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.840
My name is Masumi Sera.

427
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.140
Nice to meet you!

428
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.740
Don't mess around!

429
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.640
These bombs will go off!

430
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.240
What's the heck?

431
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.940
My sister, Miku Sawaguri is...

432
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.440
She was killed by one of these three

433
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.240
who went to the hot spring with her!

434
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.240
Trying to play smart with me.

435
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.940
You've got quite the nerve!

436
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.240
Next Conan,

437
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.240
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Outbreak)"

438
00:24:16.009 --> 00:24:18.009
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:20.409
"Signed Books"

440
00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:21.809
Next time, I'm taking the leading role, too.

441
00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:23.209
Please root for me, a high school girl, Masami Sera.

442
00:24:23.209 --> 00:24:25.213
-No, the leading role is... -Mine, you know...
