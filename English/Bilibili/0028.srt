1
00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:05.335
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:08.505
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:11.515
Although smaller, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:14.765
Today's case is the continuation
of a reunion murder case!

5
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.565
Let's listen to "Mune ga Doki Doki"
as we review the last episode!

6
00:01:55.374 --> 00:02:00.454
The old man's college buddies had
a reunion at the hot spring resort, "Benkei."

7
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.454
The attendees were the
club manager, Horikoshi Yumi,

8
00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:06.464
the model shop owner, Omura Jun,

9
00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:09.464
the high school gym instructor,
Ayashiro Yukio,

10
00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:11.964
his wife, Ayashiro Noriko,

11
00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.964
the Chiba Prefectural police
detective, Nakamichi Kazushi,

12
00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:17.514
and then me,
Ran, and the old man.

13
00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:20.644
We went to wake up Horikoshi Yumi,

14
00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:24.044
who was still in her room
after the fireworks show ended,

15
00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.064
only to find that she
had committed suicide

16
00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:27.544
by shooting herself in the head!

17
00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:33.794
A makeshift autopsy showed
that she had died seven hours earlier--

18
00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:37.254
at around 3:00 p.m., when
everyone was playing ping-pong

19
00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:38.924
before leaving
for the fireworks show!

20
00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:46.894
Kogoro's Reunion Murder Case (Part 2).

21
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.334
Come to think of it,
she did say something...

22
00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:53.754
I really wish I were dead...

23
00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:56.424
She must've been serious!

24
00:02:56.964 --> 00:03:00.754
Say, how did Yumi-san
shoot herself in the head?

25
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:02.214
What are you talking about, Conan-kun?!

26
00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:03.464
Don't ask strange questions!

27
00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:04.394
How?!

28
00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:06.214
Isn't it obvious?

29
00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:09.334
She put the gun up
to her head like so and--

30
00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:13.544
Wait! Mori! What is it?!

31
00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.004
Mori!

32
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:18.294
Tell me, Nakamichi.

33
00:03:18.294 --> 00:03:20.294
Normally when someone
commits suicide with a gun,

34
00:03:20.294 --> 00:03:22.964
they stick the barrel
against their head, right?

35
00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:23.744
Yes...

36
00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:27.374
Then her bullet wound
is missing something vital.

37
00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:33.214
You're right! Burn marks!

38
00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:34.664
Yes.

39
00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:36.004
When you shoot a gun,

40
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:39.794
a stream of hot air
accompanies the bullet!

41
00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:42.004
If you shoot with
the gun against your head,

42
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.644
it would have to
leave burn marks behind!

43
00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:46.874
The fact that there
are none here means...

44
00:03:46.874 --> 00:03:50.104
...that someone else shot her?!

45
00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:51.584
Yes.

46
00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:55.124
Someone shot her and then
tried to make it look like a suicide!

47
00:03:55.124 --> 00:03:58.074
Someone in this inn...

48
00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:11.754
You don't think
one of us did it, do you?!

49
00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:14.164
Now, now.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

50
00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:17.964
I just said the murder
took place at approximately 3:00.

51
00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:20.374
That was right after
she went off on her own.

52
00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:24.044
We were all in the ping-pong
room from 3:00 to 6:00,

53
00:04:24.044 --> 00:04:25.724
so none of us could have done it.

54
00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:28.664
The only time someone left

55
00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.434
was when Omura
went to the restroom.

56
00:04:31.044 --> 00:04:33.374
But that was well past 5:00,

57
00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:35.444
and he came back
in less than a minute.

58
00:04:35.444 --> 00:04:37.774
He couldn't have done it either.

59
00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.234
So then it was an outside job?

60
00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:42.904
Yes, perhaps.

61
00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:48.044
As you can see,

62
00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:50.214
the killer could have gone
anywhere along the roof,

63
00:04:50.214 --> 00:04:52.964
plus the door wasn't locked.

64
00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:56.654
It's very conceivable that
someone entered from outside.

65
00:04:57.674 --> 00:05:00.094
At any rate, let's hear
what the employees have to say.

66
00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:04.044
Someone might've
seen a suspicious character.

67
00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:17.334
Anybody suspicious?

68
00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:22.194
We were all out
to lunch at three o'clock,

69
00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:26.504
and even after we came back,
there was no one that suspicious--

70
00:05:26.504 --> 00:05:30.254
Oh! Actually,
there was such a person!

71
00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:31.494
What were they like?!

72
00:05:31.494 --> 00:05:33.504
-A young lass with a child.

73
00:05:33.504 --> 00:05:38.464
She seemed very distraught
and rushed straight upstairs!

74
00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:40.414
Can you describe this girl?!

75
00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:43.464
Oh, she's right there behind you.

76
00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:45.414
It was those two young'uns.

77
00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:51.644
I believe that was around 6:30,
just when the fireworks started...

78
00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:53.964
She's talking about when
we came to wake Yumi-san up

79
00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:56.164
so she wouldn't
miss the fireworks!

80
00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:57.794
Oh...

81
00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:01.614
We went to her room
and were about to go in, but...

82
00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:03.834
...I stopped them.

83
00:06:03.834 --> 00:06:05.624
She gets grumpy
when people wake her up,

84
00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:07.794
so I figured it
best that they didn't.

85
00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:12.014
Nakamichi? You were still here?

86
00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:14.914
Yeah. I had worked up
a sweat playing ping-pong

87
00:06:14.914 --> 00:06:17.334
so I took a quick
dip in the public bath.

88
00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:22.254
I felt bad for making you and Omura
go on ahead and save our spot,

89
00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:26.004
but you two were
taking a bath too, correct?

90
00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:29.224
Yeah. We were in
the open-air bath, though...

91
00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:35.334
If only we had gone to
wake her up, she might still be--

92
00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:37.164
What are you talking about?

93
00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:40.754
Yumi died while
we were playin' ping-pong!

94
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.444
We would've been
too late no matter what...

95
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.904
Say. Can I ask you something?

96
00:06:46.124 --> 00:06:47.164
Alright, Omura.

97
00:06:47.164 --> 00:06:49.834
You're hiding something, aren't you?

98
00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:52.334
You've been acting
strange since this evening!

99
00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:56.004
Come clean! What're you hiding?!

100
00:06:56.004 --> 00:06:58.044
Nothing!

101
00:06:58.044 --> 00:06:59.724
Don't tell me you did this?!

102
00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:01.124
I saw her!

103
00:07:01.124 --> 00:07:03.794
When I left to go to the bathroom!

104
00:07:03.794 --> 00:07:05.054
You saw the killer?!

105
00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:08.004
No! I saw Yumi!

106
00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:09.754
What are you talking about?!

107
00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:12.374
It was after 5:00 when
you went to the bathroom!

108
00:07:12.374 --> 00:07:14.764
Yumi was already dead by then!

109
00:07:14.764 --> 00:07:16.624
That's just it!

110
00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:19.254
I saw her even
though she was dead!

111
00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:23.194
She was glaring at the ping-pong
room from an upstairs window!

112
00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:26.084
That can't be!
Yumi was already dead!

113
00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:28.364
Don't be stupid!
That's impossible!

114
00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:34.164
What if what I actually
saw was her... her...

115
00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:40.084
Get serious!
There's no such thing as ghosts!

116
00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:43.914
Your mind was just confused
because you were tired!

117
00:07:43.914 --> 00:07:46.134
You were just imagining things!

118
00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:47.584
Yeah, maybe...

119
00:07:49.584 --> 00:07:53.464
Did something happen at our inn?

120
00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:55.374
What's all this about
ghosts and dying?

121
00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:59.754
My friend was shot.

122
00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:02.144
Then they need medical
treatment right away!

123
00:08:02.374 --> 00:08:04.214
It's too late for that.

124
00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:06.574
The police are on
their way as we speak.

125
00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:10.254
Wait a minute! That's strange!

126
00:08:10.254 --> 00:08:13.114
Why did that person
say that at that time?!

127
00:08:13.374 --> 00:08:18.584
Don't tell me the
murderer is one of you?!

128
00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:20.414
Of course not!

129
00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:23.584
The murderer was
someone else! Don't worry!

130
00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:24.964
Wait! Where are you--

131
00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:27.004
Nakamichi! You're in charge!

132
00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:28.504
I gotta use the restroom!

133
00:08:29.124 --> 00:08:30.134
Hey! Mori!

134
00:08:31.884 --> 00:08:37.004
Say, isn't it too early to tell
that this was an outside job?

135
00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:39.214
After all, the way
Yumi-san was killed was--

136
00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:40.854
Hey, are you even listening?

137
00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:46.194
Quiet! I don't need
any of your babbling!

138
00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:49.334
This was no outside job!

139
00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.794
Would someone
who snuck in from outside

140
00:08:51.794 --> 00:08:54.164
kill somebody and
make it look like a suicide?!

141
00:08:54.504 --> 00:08:56.624
This was an inside job!

142
00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:59.584
In other words,
it was one of my best friends!

143
00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:04.004
I don't know
why or how they did it,

144
00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:07.544
but I won't let them
get away with this!

145
00:09:07.544 --> 00:09:10.424
I'll expose them for
what they are! This I swear!

146
00:09:13.624 --> 00:09:14.934
Old man...

147
00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:19.834
He's right.

148
00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:22.624
One of those four is the murderer.

149
00:09:22.624 --> 00:09:25.664
No, I have a good idea who it is.

150
00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:29.114
It's most likely the person
who said that one odd thing.

151
00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:31.694
But that person
has a perfect alibi--

152
00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:35.284
they were in the ping-pong
room with everyone else!

153
00:09:35.914 --> 00:09:38.714
I checked Yumi-san's estimated
time of death for myself,

154
00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:40.414
so that can't be wrong.

155
00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:44.124
In which case,
how did that person kill her?

156
00:09:44.124 --> 00:09:45.414
What bothers me

157
00:09:45.414 --> 00:09:47.834
is the fact that Yumi-san's
finger wasn't on the trigger

158
00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:50.004
of the gun placed in her hand.

159
00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:52.464
You would expect the
killer to put her finger on it

160
00:09:52.464 --> 00:09:53.714
to fake her suicide...

161
00:09:54.044 --> 00:09:57.214
It also bothers me that she
didn't have any undergarments on

162
00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:00.014
and that she had
changed into a large yukata...

163
00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:03.874
Did the killer change her clothes?!

164
00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:04.984
What for?

165
00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:16.504
Benkei...

166
00:10:17.744 --> 00:10:20.914
Come to think of it,
that's the name of this inn, too...

167
00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:23.504
The fact all these
arrows are stuck in him

168
00:10:23.504 --> 00:10:25.794
must mean this is from
when Benkei died standing up.

169
00:10:28.914 --> 00:10:30.254
Died standing up?

170
00:10:34.804 --> 00:10:36.964
That's it! Benkei!

171
00:10:36.964 --> 00:10:38.514
The killer used this!

172
00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:41.974
I've finally figured
out the trick the killer used!

173
00:10:50.714 --> 00:10:52.004
Here goes!

174
00:10:52.004 --> 00:10:54.124
I'll just put the old
man to sleep like always

175
00:10:54.124 --> 00:10:55.784
with my Anesthetic Watch Gun...

176
00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:10.294
This was an inside job!

177
00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:13.214
In other words,
it was one of my best friends!

178
00:11:13.794 --> 00:11:17.674
I won't let them
get away with this!

179
00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:20.554
I'll expose them for what they are!
This I swear!

180
00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:28.144
Understood, old man.

181
00:11:28.144 --> 00:11:31.664
But why did the killer shoot her?

182
00:11:31.664 --> 00:11:34.294
Perhaps the killer
came to steal her things

183
00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:36.114
but shot her
when she spotted him.

184
00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:37.964
But isn't it strange?

185
00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:41.574
Why didn't we hear the shot
when we were playing ping-pong?

186
00:11:42.044 --> 00:11:43.374
Why?

187
00:11:43.374 --> 00:11:48.044
The killer has to be in here,
so why do they all have alibis?!

188
00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.794
Judging from the
state of her rigor mortis,

189
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.544
Yumi's estimated time
of death was around 3:00 p.m.

190
00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:57.874
Which means she was murdered
immediately after she left us

191
00:11:57.874 --> 00:11:59.264
and returned to her room.

192
00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:03.514
The rest of us were in the
ping-pong room from 3:00 to 6:00.

193
00:12:03.874 --> 00:12:05.874
Nobody had the chance to kill her.

194
00:12:05.874 --> 00:12:09.434
What bothers me is what Omura said...

195
00:12:09.434 --> 00:12:11.334
That's just it!

196
00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:14.004
I saw her even though she was dead!

197
00:12:14.004 --> 00:12:17.904
She was glaring at the ping-pong
room from an upstairs window!

198
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.914
Omura went to
the bathroom just after 5:00.

199
00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:22.864
Yumi couldn't have been alive.

200
00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:25.824
So why did Omura say that?

201
00:12:26.294 --> 00:12:28.374
Say...

202
00:12:28.374 --> 00:12:31.164
Let's play ping-pong! Come on!

203
00:12:31.164 --> 00:12:32.834
Hey!

204
00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:35.614
Conan-kun! What are
you saying at a time like this?!

205
00:12:35.614 --> 00:12:37.044
I can't play?

206
00:12:37.374 --> 00:12:39.874
My shakehand grip
is pretty good, you know!

207
00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:42.514
That reminds me, Yumi-san
used the shakehand grip too, huh?

208
00:12:44.224 --> 00:12:50.374
Remember? She was holding a racket
with a shakehand-style in that picture.

209
00:12:50.374 --> 00:12:56.364
Yeah, but you can't
play right now! Okay?

210
00:12:56.364 --> 00:12:57.504
You're right.

211
00:12:57.504 --> 00:12:59.824
I'd have to change
clothes if I got all sweaty.

212
00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:03.584
Sweat? Change clothes?

213
00:13:03.584 --> 00:13:05.664
Shakehand grip?

214
00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:10.374
Come to think of it,
Yumi had changed into a large yukata...

215
00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:12.254
And had nothing on underneath!

216
00:13:12.254 --> 00:13:15.834
And her right index
finger stuck out stiffly

217
00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:19.214
instead of being on the trigger!

218
00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:20.414
With the shakehand grip,

219
00:13:20.414 --> 00:13:23.174
you hold the racket
with your index finger out.

220
00:13:23.174 --> 00:13:26.414
Could Yumi have been
playing ping-pong with the murderer

221
00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.644
before she was killed?!

222
00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:32.504
That's ridiculous.
What purpose would that serve?

223
00:13:32.504 --> 00:13:33.834
Wait a minute!

224
00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:37.054
I could swear they mentioned
something at the police academy--

225
00:13:38.914 --> 00:13:43.074
Say, didn't Benkei
die while standing up?

226
00:13:43.334 --> 00:13:45.004
That's right.

227
00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:48.414
Benkei fought hordes
of enemies off all by himself

228
00:13:48.414 --> 00:13:51.994
and then died on his feet when
they showered him with arrows!

229
00:13:51.994 --> 00:13:54.714
Oh! That's it!

230
00:13:55.914 --> 00:13:59.594
Hey, Mori.
What's the shouting about?

231
00:14:01.124 --> 00:14:05.554
I've finally figured
out who killed Yumi!

232
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:06.344
What?!

233
00:14:07.184 --> 00:14:09.014
Who is it, Dad?!

234
00:14:09.664 --> 00:14:11.974
You were the one who killed Yumi!

235
00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:27.783
You were the one who killed Yumi!

236
00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:29.743
What? Nakamichi killed her?!

237
00:14:30.873 --> 00:14:32.963
Hey, stop joking around...

238
00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:35.423
I was in the ping-pong
room with everyone else

239
00:14:35.423 --> 00:14:37.503
at her estimated time of death!

240
00:14:37.763 --> 00:14:40.463
Yes, your alibi is perfect.

241
00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.973
Assuming she really
was killed at 3:00 p.m.!

242
00:14:43.973 --> 00:14:49.553
What are you talking about?
We checked her time of death together!

243
00:14:49.553 --> 00:14:54.463
Yumi's toes were
indeed beginning to stiffen,

244
00:14:54.463 --> 00:14:59.133
so I estimated that she
had died over seven hours prior.

245
00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:00.483
But there are exceptions:

246
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:04.443
sudden deaths during
intense physical exertion.

247
00:15:05.593 --> 00:15:09.673
In such situations, intramuscular
proteins harden more easily,

248
00:15:09.673 --> 00:15:13.293
causing rigor mortis to
take effect much more quickly.

249
00:15:13.293 --> 00:15:18.463
Yes. Just like the
heroic Musashibo Benkei!

250
00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:22.343
So Benkei's death
while standing up--

251
00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:24.463
Yes. It's been medically proven

252
00:15:24.463 --> 00:15:27.723
that it's possible to
die while standing up.

253
00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:31.763
Come on, now.
The body was in Yumi's own room!

254
00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:35.433
What kind of exercise
are you saying I made her do?

255
00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:40.013
No, she wasn't forced
to exert herself in her room--

256
00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:41.423
it was in the ping-pong room!

257
00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:45.193
You made her play ping-pong
right up until you killed her!

258
00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:49.053
You were most likely
supposed to meet her all alone

259
00:15:49.053 --> 00:15:50.883
in the ping-pong room.

260
00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:55.253
But then you invited us
all into the room!

261
00:15:55.423 --> 00:15:58.583
Oh yeah! What do you say
we play some ping-pong now?

262
00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.043
Sounds great!

263
00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:01.793
I'll pass.

264
00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:05.053
Naturally, Yumi grew angry
and returned to her room.

265
00:16:05.303 --> 00:16:07.803
After 6:00,
when everyone had left,

266
00:16:08.213 --> 00:16:11.843
Yumi went by herself to the
ping-pong room, where you were waiting.

267
00:16:11.843 --> 00:16:14.183
It must've been quite
the secret rendezvous.

268
00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:17.813
You then invited her
to a game of ping-pong.

269
00:16:18.553 --> 00:16:20.883
After making her
exert herself for a while,

270
00:16:20.883 --> 00:16:23.863
you got her
to return to her room...

271
00:16:31.843 --> 00:16:35.383
...at which point
you shot her in the head.

272
00:16:35.383 --> 00:16:40.833
All to skew the estimated time
of death and create the perfect alibi!

273
00:16:41.053 --> 00:16:44.213
You likely used Yumi's
short temper to your advantage

274
00:16:44.213 --> 00:16:47.803
to get her to return to her room.

275
00:16:47.803 --> 00:16:49.133
As proof of this,

276
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:53.013
Yumi rushed back to her
room still holding the racket.

277
00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:56.093
That's why her right
hand which held the gun

278
00:16:56.093 --> 00:16:58.983
had stiffened
in the shakehand grip!

279
00:16:58.983 --> 00:17:01.693
So the Yumi
I saw right after 5:00 was--

280
00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:03.673
Was the real Yumi, in the flesh.

281
00:17:03.673 --> 00:17:05.763
She was still alive then.

282
00:17:05.763 --> 00:17:07.763
She was watching
the ping-pong room

283
00:17:07.763 --> 00:17:10.613
from the 2nd floor and waiting
for Nakamichi to be all alone!

284
00:17:10.883 --> 00:17:13.303
Yumi was probably
really murdered at 6:30,

285
00:17:13.303 --> 00:17:16.093
when the fireworks show started!

286
00:17:16.093 --> 00:17:19.833
The gunshot would seem inconspicuous
with all the fireworks exploding about!

287
00:17:23.003 --> 00:17:24.963
But Nakamichi still had the job

288
00:17:24.963 --> 00:17:29.463
of wiping off the body's sweat
and changing the clothes--

289
00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:31.593
there was a chance
the trick could be discovered

290
00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:33.933
if we learned that
she had been sweating.

291
00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:37.133
He had no choice but
to remove her undergarments,

292
00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:38.893
but he did change her yukata...

293
00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:41.813
...with a spare one.

294
00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:46.153
But in the middle of his work,
an unforeseen obstacle appeared:

295
00:17:46.153 --> 00:17:50.243
Ran and Conan,
who came to wake Yumi up.

296
00:17:50.243 --> 00:17:52.283
You stopped your
work halfway through,

297
00:17:52.633 --> 00:17:55.803
exited onto the
roof through the window,

298
00:17:55.803 --> 00:17:58.763
and stopped Ran
from entering the room.

299
00:18:01.423 --> 00:18:04.713
You then went with
everyone to see the fireworks,

300
00:18:04.713 --> 00:18:06.763
pretended to get separated,

301
00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:10.383
and finished the rest of your work.

302
00:18:10.383 --> 00:18:15.093
That's when you put the gun in
her hand to make it look like a suicide.

303
00:18:15.593 --> 00:18:18.093
Though it would seem that her hand

304
00:18:18.093 --> 00:18:20.843
had already stiffened
into that peculiar grip,

305
00:18:20.843 --> 00:18:24.063
making it impossible to
put her finger on the trigger.

306
00:18:25.513 --> 00:18:28.133
Your theory is indeed interesting.

307
00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:31.863
But do you have
any proof that I did it?

308
00:18:31.863 --> 00:18:33.173
Don't be a fool!

309
00:18:33.173 --> 00:18:35.633
The only person besides
me who could've pulled that off

310
00:18:35.633 --> 00:18:37.623
was you, a police detective!

311
00:18:37.623 --> 00:18:40.923
See! You could've done it as well!

312
00:18:40.923 --> 00:18:45.583
And besides, anybody
could learn that from a book.

313
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.543
Why, you!

314
00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.633
You sure are dumb, old man.

315
00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:55.433
This great policeman
couldn't possibly be the killer.

316
00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:57.053
Great policeman?

317
00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.383
Don't you think?

318
00:18:58.383 --> 00:19:02.843
He knew that Yumi-san was dead
just by seeing her covered in blood!

319
00:19:05.213 --> 00:19:08.903
You said the following
without ever touching Yumi...

320
00:19:08.903 --> 00:19:09.813
Yumi!

321
00:19:09.813 --> 00:19:10.773
Don't touch her!

322
00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:14.863
Nobody but me and Mori are to
come in here, since we're detectives!

323
00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:18.213
For some reason you
called not for an ambulance,

324
00:19:18.213 --> 00:19:20.333
but for the police!

325
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:23.833
You knew that it was too late!

326
00:19:24.383 --> 00:19:26.293
Because you killed her!

327
00:19:27.213 --> 00:19:29.213
How could you?!

328
00:19:29.213 --> 00:19:30.043
Shut up!

329
00:19:30.463 --> 00:19:32.383
I didn't want to kill her!

330
00:19:32.383 --> 00:19:34.713
We went out for eighteen years, you know!

331
00:19:35.053 --> 00:19:36.593
Eighteen years?!

332
00:19:36.963 --> 00:19:37.963
That's right!

333
00:19:37.963 --> 00:19:40.513
Until I met someone half a year ago!

334
00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.933
You did this because
she would hinder your marriage?!

335
00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.563
Why? Why didn't you marry her?!

336
00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:48.193
Let go!

337
00:19:50.883 --> 00:19:53.093
I proposed to her many times!

338
00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:55.553
But her answer was always no!

339
00:19:55.553 --> 00:19:58.033
For eighteen long years!

340
00:19:58.033 --> 00:20:02.263
Just when I was about
to marry someone else,

341
00:20:02.263 --> 00:20:04.513
Yumi told me this:

342
00:20:05.513 --> 00:20:07.213
I won't allow it.

343
00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:09.513
I won't allow you to be happy.

344
00:20:09.513 --> 00:20:13.883
That's when her
threatening letters and phone calls

345
00:20:13.883 --> 00:20:16.553
to my fiancé started.

346
00:20:16.553 --> 00:20:21.173
Finally she said she was going
to send photos of just the two of us!

347
00:20:21.173 --> 00:20:23.673
I told her that if she brought
the photos to the reunion

348
00:20:23.673 --> 00:20:26.433
I would buy them all off of her.

349
00:20:27.013 --> 00:20:30.883
That was the day
you caught the bank robber.

350
00:20:30.883 --> 00:20:33.863
I had just met with Yumi.

351
00:20:34.343 --> 00:20:38.323
I was struggling over
what to do about her...

352
00:20:39.463 --> 00:20:42.783
...when the robber's gun fell nearby.

353
00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:46.573
It was then that
I thought up this plan.

354
00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:50.383
The deal was to take
place in the ping-pong room,

355
00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:52.963
but then I told her this:

356
00:20:52.963 --> 00:20:56.303
"The photos have been
removed from your things."

357
00:20:56.303 --> 00:20:57.713
I see.

358
00:20:57.713 --> 00:21:00.713
So that's why Yumi
rushed back to her room,

359
00:21:00.713 --> 00:21:03.013
racket still in hand!

360
00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:06.013
And you followed behind and shot her!

361
00:21:06.013 --> 00:21:06.963
That's right!

362
00:21:06.963 --> 00:21:09.983
I shot the demon
who screwed up my life!

363
00:21:11.053 --> 00:21:12.423
Which one was the demon?

364
00:21:12.423 --> 00:21:13.343
Shut up!

365
00:21:13.343 --> 00:21:16.113
What the hell would you know?!

366
00:21:17.343 --> 00:21:18.963
I'll never know...

367
00:21:20.343 --> 00:21:22.363
...how a murderer feels...

368
00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:24.323
...no matter what the reason!

369
00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.823
I don't want to know!

370
00:21:30.763 --> 00:21:32.963
Dad!

371
00:21:32.963 --> 00:21:35.923
Seems you're still
as strong as ever...

372
00:21:36.423 --> 00:21:40.013
Don't be stupid.
You've just gotten weaker.

373
00:21:40.013 --> 00:21:41.883
Both your mind and your body.

374
00:21:42.463 --> 00:21:43.843
Yeah...

375
00:23:32.883 --> 00:23:35.203
He's been pretty glum lately...

376
00:23:35.633 --> 00:23:39.633
You can't blame him;
those were his friends...

377
00:23:40.053 --> 00:23:42.303
That reminds me,
if he's that strong,

378
00:23:42.303 --> 00:23:44.093
why didn't he ever
win any matches?

379
00:23:44.093 --> 00:23:47.713
Apparently, in actual
matches he gets so tense

380
00:23:47.713 --> 00:23:49.973
that he can't concentrate his strength.

381
00:23:50.923 --> 00:23:53.103
So he had a
knack for being outdone...

382
00:23:53.103 --> 00:23:56.093
I'll go try to cheer him up...

383
00:23:56.093 --> 00:23:57.553
Wait.

384
00:23:57.553 --> 00:23:59.713
Let's leave him alone for a while.

385
00:23:59.713 --> 00:24:01.233
He'll be back to normal eventually.

386
00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:12.963
This time it's pink!

387
00:24:17.793 --> 00:24:22.263
Oh, Inspector Megure!
Good morning!

388
00:24:22.263 --> 00:24:24.173
Mr. Okida's dead?!

389
00:24:24.423 --> 00:24:25.883
It's damp!

390
00:24:25.883 --> 00:24:28.593
For someone who died while
sweating, there's too much here!

391
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:32.173
If his heart attack
was intentionally caused,

392
00:24:32.173 --> 00:24:34.593
then Tokito-san
is the prime suspect!

393
00:24:34.593 --> 00:24:38.013
But how exactly
could he have done it?!

394
00:24:39.763 --> 00:24:41.053
On the next Conan--

395
00:24:41.053 --> 00:24:44.773
The Computer Murder Case.

396
00:24:59.773 --> 00:25:02.643
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:25:02.643 --> 00:25:03.483
"A cat."
