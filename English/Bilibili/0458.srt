1
00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:01.457
My heart tingles!

2
00:00:02.657 --> 00:00:04.857
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.257
Trouble in a mountain full of maple trees with red leaves!

4
00:00:06.257 --> 00:00:08.657
That man appears when Sonoko screams!

5
00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:10.057
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:11.657
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:13.957
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.661
Invited by Sonoko, we came to view the red maple leaves.

9
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.761
However, Sonoko's real purpose

10
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.661
was to meet Makoto Kyogoku at the shooting site of

11
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.561
the popular drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"

12
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.461
after she ties a red handkerchief to the branch of a maple tree.

13
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:18.561
However, the trees of the mountain are full of red handkerchiefs.

14
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.161
And there,

15
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.361
the AD of the drama that we had met,

16
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.261
Mr. Hozumi was murdered!

17
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:37.461
"Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 2)"

18
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.461
Let's see.

19
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:46.761
Oh, it's you people who found the corpse?

20
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:52.861
Maybe you people did something to bring a curse upon you?

21
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.461
Just what do you mean by that?

22
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:59.961
Like turn a Buddhist altar upside down or kick a tombstone.

23
00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.461
Goodness! Of course not!

24
00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:05.261
Oh, I'm sorry. And do you people know him?

25
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.961
No, we met him for the first time today.

26
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.361
He asked us to leave a message in his place,

27
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:11.361
so we went to the Akagi Inn in front of the station.

28
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:13.861
Then when we came back here...

29
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.261
What kind of message?

30
00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:19.261
He's an AD for the TV drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

31
00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:20.361
"Red Maple Leaves in Winter"!

32
00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:23.561
Oh, I know. Yes, I know it.

33
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.861
They have a re-run of it here now in Gunma on local TV.

34
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:30.361
It's a love romance story, right?

35
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:33.461
My grandma in the country recommended me to watch it.

36
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:36.261
It's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"... got that?

37
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:39.761
I started watching the re-run, but I'm really hooked on it!

38
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.261
Every week on Saturday, from 9 pm to 10 pm,

39
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.761
I'm glued in front of the TV.

40
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.261
And today is Saturday, you see! So...

41
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:53.661
See! I secretly brought a portable TV with me.

42
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:57.061
Although I'm recording it at home, I just can't wait that long!

43
00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:59.261
Oh...

44
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.361
And what sort of message did you leave behind?

45
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:05.361
Oh, right. A fan of the program wanted to know

46
00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:08.861
where the tree for the drama that the red handkerchief was tied on to was

47
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.361
so he wanted us to leave a message to the fan

48
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.561
who was staying at the Akagi Inn

49
00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:15.961
that he found the tree and he would be waiting here.

50
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.461
Yes.

51
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.261
How lazy of him,

52
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:22.461
he should've given the message himself.

53
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.861
And did you get to meet that fan?

54
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:26.861
No, Sonoko just wrote the message in the message book

55
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.261
that was left at the inn.

56
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.061
Right! "I found the tree that you were looking for."

57
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.561
"Please come to the place where the rock used

58
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:36.161
"in the last scene of the drama is." That's what I wrote.

59
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.461
She signed his name, Hozumi, for some reason in katakana.

60
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.461
Yes.

61
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.361
Why in katakana?

62
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.261
Beats me, that's how he told me to write it.

63
00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:46.261
Right.

64
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:47.561
Hey!

65
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:52.061
Maybe it was because that man used katakana often?

66
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:56.761
Even on his pocket diary that we picked up on our way here,

67
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.261
"Hozumi" was written in katakana!

68
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:04.261
We found it on the ground about 100 meters away from here.

69
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.261
It was soiled with blood, so we rushed over here.

70
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:09.661
Soiled with blood?

71
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:12.661
Then we found him lying there on the ground.

72
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:14.661
Oh...

73
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:17.661
Let's see, there was nothing really worth noticing in his pocket diary.

74
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:21.461
A blood stain on April 1st.

75
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:22.761
April 1st...

76
00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:27.061
April 1st is April Fool's Day, April fool...

77
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:33.061
Hey...

78
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:37.261
-Yes? -Maybe that's a dying message?

79
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:40.061
He's got blood on his finger.

80
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.261
Officer Yamamura!

81
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:46.261
The estimated time of death of the victim is around 5 pm today.

82
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:48.261
We've found out that he was stabbed in the stomach once,

83
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:51.261
then stabbed in the chest too.

84
00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:52.861
Anything that would identify the victim

85
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.961
seems to have been taken away by the killer.

86
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:57.661
No need to worry!

87
00:05:57.661 --> 00:06:00.561
Just call the production staff of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"

88
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.161
"Hozumi" -and have them look for an AD named Hozumi

89
00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:05.061
and we'll be able to find him right away!

90
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:09.561
Oh, and they seemed to have found an empty tent up ahead.

91
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.061
An empty tent? Now that's quite suspicious.

92
00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.561
Please continue investigations!

93
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.761
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:17.961
-Hey. -What?

95
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.261
Didn't those officers say something else?

96
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:23.461
Or were there are lot of suspicious looking people?

97
00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:26.161
No. All that was found was this tent.

98
00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:29.961
More than the tent, wouldn't it be better if you went to Akagi Inn?

99
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:31.661
-What? -This is the place

100
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:34.261
where the last scene of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter" was filmed,

101
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.061
so the fan that was waiting for him here is suspicious!

102
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:39.761
Oh, so the last scene of the drama was filmed here.

103
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:41.161
Yes, that's right!

104
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:42.461
In the last scene,

105
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:45.661
the young officer leans against the rock and hugs the young lady...

106
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:48.261
No...

107
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.461
I'm still in the middle of watching the drama,

108
00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:52.161
so don't tell me!

109
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.761
"Akagi Inn"

110
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.661
What? 53 people?

111
00:06:57.661 --> 00:06:59.861
You mean there are that many people staying here?

112
00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:01.861
Yes, thank god!

113
00:07:01.861 --> 00:07:03.961
Then how about the people who checked in this morning?

114
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:04.961
What?

115
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:06.161
Huh?

116
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.261
Please check!

117
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:12.261
Remember? The man said that he got a mail from that fan

118
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:16.261
saying that he checked in at this inn this morning!

119
00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:17.761
Yes.

120
00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:19.261
And how about it?

121
00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:22.761
Oh. These are the three people

122
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:24.961
who checked in this morning.

123
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.361
"Isamu Okuma, Tatsuzo Watanuki, Hans Buckly"

124
00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:30.361
Then could you ask

125
00:07:30.361 --> 00:07:33.161
those three people to come here?

126
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.161
"Isamu Okuma (25)" -What is it, bummers?

127
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:39.361
"Tatsuzo Watanuki (63)" -The police here this late?

128
00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:41.961
"Hans Buckly (41)" -What do you want?

129
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.361
Well...

130
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:45.061
What were you three doing

131
00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:49.561
and where were you at around 5 pm today?

132
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:50.961
I was sleeping in my room.

133
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.461
I was taking a bath.

134
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:54.761
I was taking a walk nearby.

135
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:56.561
Is there anyone who can confirm that?

136
00:07:56.561 --> 00:07:57.561
No!

137
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.461
I was taking a bath in my room so...

138
00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:01.561
I didn't run into anyone.

139
00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:03.861
A young man with a foul mouth,

140
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.861
an aged man with glasses,

141
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.361
and a non-Japanese man who speaks broken Japanese.

142
00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:12.161
Hey, Ran! Don't you think that guy with the pierced nose

143
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:14.061
-looks suspicious? -What?

144
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.161
Maybe he asked the victim to write his name in katakana

145
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.461
because he can't read kanji.

146
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:21.561
If so, then that aged man is also suspicious.

147
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.661
Maybe he wanted the name written in katakana

148
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.661
because kanji is too cluttered together and hard to see.

149
00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:27.661
Oh, wait!

150
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:29.261
It could be that non-Japanese man.

151
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:34.361
It's likely that he can read hiragana and katakana but not kanji.

152
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.561
Then who of you here

153
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:39.361
know the drama called "Red Maple Leaves in Winter?"

154
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:40.761
What the heck is that?

155
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:42.961
I've never heard of it.

156
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:45.861
Don't red maple leaves wither in winter?

157
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:50.161
Oh, maybe you're playing dumb despite knowing the program.

158
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:51.661
But no use!

159
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:53.861
Because if you're a fan of the drama, it'll show on your face

160
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:55.661
as soon as the opening comes on!

161
00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:57.261
So, watch!

162
00:08:57.261 --> 00:08:58.661
Here's "Red Maple Leaves in Winter!"

163
00:08:58.661 --> 00:09:00.561
So, the time has finally come

164
00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:02.861
for the Europe Karate Championship Tournament.

165
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:06.261
-Episode eight of "Red Maple Leaves in Winter!" -What? No?

166
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:08.261
-will not be aired tonight.-A special program?

167
00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:09.661
You want us to watch karate?

168
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:12.361
-But the center of attraction of this tournament is -Oh, well, no...

169
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:14.461
-none other than the man, Makoto Kyogoku! -Yes...

170
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.461
-What? -What?

171
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:18.361
Let's take a look at his introductory video tape.

172
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:19.561
Lend it to me!

173
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.361
He just made 18 years of age but holds a 400 times straight win record!

174
00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:25.661
The powerful fisted Makoto Kyogoku, apart from all others.

175
00:09:25.661 --> 00:09:27.461
Makoto!

176
00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:29.061
But Sonoko,

177
00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:31.961
didn't Kyogoku tell you about the tournament?

178
00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:33.261
Well,

179
00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:34.861
he said that he'd rather commit "seppuku"

180
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:38.961
than to have me watch him lose, and wouldn't tell me!

181
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.761
"Seppuku" (Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment)?

182
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:43.461
I mean, he'd never lose.

183
00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:47.261
Officer Yamamura! I contacted the movie production company.

184
00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:49.961
But was told that no one by the name of "Hozumi" works there.

185
00:09:49.961 --> 00:09:51.061
What?

186
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:54.261
Here's the copy of the namelist that they sent us.

187
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.961
Copy of the namelist.

188
00:09:57.761 --> 00:09:59.761
Are you sure this namelist is correct?

189
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:01.961
It seems that the dates are mixed up.

190
00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:03.761
See, at the very end of the line.

191
00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:05.161
True.

192
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:08.461
I see! The date!

193
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:12.161
But if we're to believe what the production company says,

194
00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:14.261
it would mean that the victim was lying.

195
00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:15.361
Lying?

196
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:16.361
Come to think of it,

197
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:19.361
"April Fool" -April Fool is a day when it's okay to lie.

198
00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:23.261
Which means that the killer is lying!

199
00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:27.161
Oh, Officer Yamamura, the one who's lying is the victim.

200
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.461
-Hey, Sonoko. -I wonder

201
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.261
-Goodness, she's not listening to me. -when is Makoto coming on.

202
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.761
Hey, Conan...

203
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:35.461
Conan...

204
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:41.361
If my deduction is correct,

205
00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:43.461
the killer still hasn't found it!

206
00:10:51.161 --> 00:10:52.961
Found it! It's this tree!

207
00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:57.961
The soil is still soft.

208
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:00.161
As I thought, Mr. Hozumi was digging here

209
00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:02.061
before he met the killer.

210
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:07.661
I see.

211
00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:09.261
The red maple leaves in winter

212
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:11.561
was simply to mark this grave.

213
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:19.361
"Akagi Inn" -Hey, Conan?

214
00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:22.161
Where are you now? I'm searching for you!

215
00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:23.561
You can go on home without me!

216
00:11:23.561 --> 00:11:24.661
Go home without you?

217
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:26.461
Yes. I can't make up my mind

218
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:28.461
on what souvenir to get for Genta and the others.

219
00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:32.761
Don't worry because Dr. Agasa is coming to pick me up!

220
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:36.161
Hey! What do you mean don't worry about you?

221
00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:39.661
By the way, are the three guests still there?

222
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.761
All three of them are still here.

223
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:45.461
But they're going to continue interrogation again some other day

224
00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:47.461
because it's already late tonight,

225
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:49.661
Officer Yamamura said so a while ago.

226
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:53.261
I see. Oh, will you put Sonoko on the line?

227
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:54.261
Huh?

228
00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:55.761
Conan wants to talk to you.

229
00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:57.961
He wants to talk to me?

230
00:11:57.961 --> 00:11:59.561
Yes.

231
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:00.961
Hello?

232
00:12:02.161 --> 00:12:04.161
Yes, I remember.

233
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:08.461
You mean the tree that I thought my handkerchief was stuck on, right?

234
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:11.661
It was located way in the foreground of the forest

235
00:12:11.661 --> 00:12:13.861
where the rock that appeared in the last scene of the drama is.

236
00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:17.161
It was about ten minutes away.

237
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:21.261
That tree may have also been used for the drama?

238
00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:23.961
Yes, because the handkerchief was also there

239
00:12:23.961 --> 00:12:26.861
and the branch also looked very similar too.

240
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.761
Don't be silly! The handkerchiefs on that tree are those of the fans!

241
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:33.161
The only tree that was used in the drama is the maple tree

242
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:34.661
with red leaves near the rock!

243
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:36.761
It would be too confusing if there are two or three

244
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.461
of the same kind of trees around!

245
00:12:39.561 --> 00:12:41.661
That's true. Thank you, Sonoko.

246
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.561
Oh, hey.

247
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:45.761
Oh, he hung up on his side!

248
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:47.561
No! You mean he hung up?

249
00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:01.769
Ran?

250
00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:03.469
Yes, that's right.

251
00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:06.869
I was just about to go pick Conan up.

252
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:08.869
I discussed things over with Conan a while ago

253
00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:12.469
and agreed to ride your car with Sonoko.

254
00:13:12.469 --> 00:13:13.569
What? No way!

255
00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:15.269
I called our car to come pick us up already.

256
00:13:16.369 --> 00:13:20.169
So, will you tell me where you're meeting Conan?

257
00:13:20.169 --> 00:13:22.569
It seems that Conan's cell phone battery went dead

258
00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.569
in the middle of our conversation.

259
00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:28.669
Strange, Shinichi is supposed to be riding with me alone.

260
00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:31.269
The entrance of the mountain path

261
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:34.169
that was used in the drama called, "Red Maple Leaves in Winter".

262
00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:36.269
I see, thank you, Dr. Agasa!

263
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:37.369
Yeah.

264
00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:55.969
You should act happier.

265
00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:58.269
You're meeting each other after a long while, aren't you?

266
00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:03.469
Mr. Tatsuzo Watanuki?

267
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:09.569
I don't know who the skeleton is,

268
00:14:09.569 --> 00:14:13.269
but you're the one who buried it there.

269
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.469
And you tied a red handkerchief on the branch,

270
00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:19.569
so that you could move the body at anytime if something came up.

271
00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:20.869
You decided on a red handkerchief because you figured that

272
00:14:20.869 --> 00:14:23.769
it would blend in with the red leaves and be inconspicuous.

273
00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:25.469
After all, in the past,

274
00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:28.669
people used to come here only during the autumn season.

275
00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:31.469
But ever since a drama called "Red Maple Leaves of Winter" was aired

276
00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:34.569
using a red handkerchief,

277
00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:37.269
regardless of the time of season, fans began swarming to this mountain

278
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:39.669
and tying red handkerchiefs to the branches of the maple trees

279
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:41.469
one after the other as was done in the drama.

280
00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:42.569
Therefore, you ended up not knowing

281
00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.869
which tree you buried the body under.

282
00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:49.269
Afraid that someone would eventually find the body if left as is.

283
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:52.269
You found out that the person who originally found the tree

284
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:54.269
was Mr. Hozumi, a production staff of the drama,

285
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.769
so you paid him to find the tree!

286
00:14:57.769 --> 00:15:00.869
Just as expected, Mr. Hozumi found the tree.

287
00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:03.469
You went to the place he specified he would see you

288
00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:06.369
in the forest used in the last scene of the drama,

289
00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:09.569
you paid him after he told you where the tree was,

290
00:15:09.569 --> 00:15:11.969
everything was to end well.

291
00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:15.069
However, before he met you,

292
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:16.769
Mr. Hozumi came across the bones.

293
00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:22.769
He dug the root of this tree, like you just did just now.

294
00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:27.969
Mr. Hozumi then decided to blackmail you about the bones.

295
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.969
However, on the contrary,

296
00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:32.369
he was stabbed to death by you instead.

297
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.869
You killed him before asking him where the tree was

298
00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:42.169
because if he had already found the skeleton of the body,

299
00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:44.169
all you had to do was look for a maple tree

300
00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:47.169
where the soil is soft near the root of the tree.

301
00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:50.369
But you couldn't find it at the place of the last scene of the drama.

302
00:15:50.369 --> 00:15:51.669
It's most natural

303
00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:56.069
because the tree in question was here, more than 500 meters away.

304
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:58.169
Well, if you presume that it would be confusing

305
00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:00.269
if two red handkerchiefs are in view when shooting the drama,

306
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:02.569
so he chose a place some distance away,

307
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:05.769
it's easy to figure out that it's this tree.

308
00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:08.469
Besides, the staff would never remove the handkerchief

309
00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:11.569
that brought so much attention just because it's in the way of filming.

310
00:16:12.869 --> 00:16:16.569
Boy, you seem to be pretty bright

311
00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:21.069
but what were you planning to do if I didn't show up?

312
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:23.269
Just call the police!

313
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:27.869
Because it was written in Mr. Hozumi's pocket diary that you're the killer.

314
00:16:27.869 --> 00:16:31.069
It can't be. All that was found in that pocket diary

315
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:32.769
was a blood stain on the April 1st page.

316
00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:34.969
Right! April 1st.

317
00:16:34.969 --> 00:16:37.069
In the old days, people used to remove the cotton

318
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:39.569
from their winter kimonos to change them to summer wear.

319
00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:41.869
"April 1st" -Therefore, in the past,

320
00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:46.269
April 1st used to be read as "Watanuki", meaning removing cotton!

321
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:49.069
In other words, April 1st stands for you, Mr. Watanuki.

322
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:53.269
It's none other than your name!

323
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:56.769
By the way, Mr. Hozumi wanted his name written in katakana

324
00:16:56.769 --> 00:17:00.069
because his last name could be read "August 1st" as well as Hozumi.

325
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:03.269
The origin of the name came from the fact that on August 1st,

326
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:06.269
people used to reap the ears of rice and offer it to God.

327
00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:09.269
He probably thought that writing "August 1st" would not be read "Hozumi",

328
00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:12.369
so he went out of the way and asked his name to be written in katakana.

329
00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.769
The fact that Mr. Hozumi's pocket diary with your name written in

330
00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:18.969
was found some distance away from where he was lying on the ground.

331
00:17:18.969 --> 00:17:23.069
Shows that you saw him writing in the diary, went back to him,

332
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.869
stabbed him in the chest, striking the final blow,

333
00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.769
stole his pocket diary and fled

334
00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:29.969
but unable to make out what "April 1st" stood

335
00:17:29.969 --> 00:17:32.269
for you decided to throw it away on the way.

336
00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:34.869
Who the heck... who the heck are you?

337
00:17:35.969 --> 00:17:37.969
Conan Edogawa!

338
00:17:37.969 --> 00:17:39.469
A detective!

339
00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:44.369
Then tell me, detective brat,

340
00:17:44.369 --> 00:17:49.369
why I left and fled leaving his body?

341
00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:52.069
You figured it was already dark so no one would come

342
00:17:52.069 --> 00:17:53.869
and was deciding to go back after getting prepared

343
00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:56.369
and get rid of his body at around midnight, right?

344
00:17:56.369 --> 00:17:58.769
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:01.069
Along with these guys.

346
00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:04.869
40, rather, 50 people?

347
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:07.169
Who're these guys?

348
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:11.269
They were soldiers that I summoned to search this tree

349
00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:14.069
but I guess there are too many of them to get rid of just one brat.

350
00:18:14.069 --> 00:18:15.569
Conan!

351
00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:16.569
Ran?

352
00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:18.569
Conan!

353
00:18:20.769 --> 00:18:22.369
Conan!

354
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:25.569
Come on, Ran! I think he'll do well on his own, don't you think?

355
00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:29.269
-That glasses kid will be okay! -What're you talking about? No way!

356
00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:31.669
I'm sure that curiosity got the best of him again,

357
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:33.969
and he's up to doing something dangerous!

358
00:18:33.969 --> 00:18:34.969
So, it's finally time

359
00:18:34.969 --> 00:18:37.069
-for contestant Kyogoku's first match! -Hey, Sonoko, are you listening?

360
00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:40.569
Oh, Kyogoku didn't compete yet?

361
00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:45.269
No! I don't know why but Makoto's being seeded one after the other!

362
00:18:48.769 --> 00:18:50.769
What? Who is it?

363
00:18:50.769 --> 00:18:51.969
Beats me...

364
00:18:51.969 --> 00:18:53.569
Ran! Sonoko!

365
00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:55.769
Conan!

366
00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:57.569
Glasses kid?

367
00:18:57.569 --> 00:19:00.369
Hey...

368
00:19:00.369 --> 00:19:02.269
Who on earth are these people?

369
00:19:02.269 --> 00:19:03.469
Beats me.

370
00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:08.769
-Conan. -Glasses kid, who are these people?

371
00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:12.469
They're not your friends, are they?

372
00:19:12.469 --> 00:19:17.669
Well... I guess we need to dig three grave holes now.

373
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:18.669
Grave?

374
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:21.769
I'm sure they are not good people.

375
00:19:31.469 --> 00:19:32.769
Ran, behind you!

376
00:19:35.869 --> 00:19:36.969
Ran!

377
00:19:38.069 --> 00:19:39.569
There are just too many of them.

378
00:19:41.069 --> 00:19:43.369
Are you all right? Ran...

379
00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:46.269
Only if Makoto were here.

380
00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:47.369
Darn!

381
00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:49.969
Makoto, please help us!

382
00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:52.069
Makoto!

383
00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.569
What's going on?

384
00:19:58.269 --> 00:20:01.069
Something is beyond on the other side?

385
00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:03.969
Makoto Kyogoku is not at the tournament?

386
00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:06.369
His whereabouts have been unknown since three days ago?

387
00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:08.469
Then where on earth is he?

388
00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:20.669
What?

389
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:22.069
Makoto?

390
00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:24.669
How come...

391
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:26.769
Oh, well, you see...

392
00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:28.069
In front of you!

393
00:20:32.069 --> 00:20:34.269
-Well, you see... -Behind you!

394
00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:39.569
Darn. You brat.

395
00:20:39.569 --> 00:20:41.569
How dare you make light of me?

396
00:20:48.969 --> 00:20:52.569
A death battle continued for about 10 minutes

397
00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:56.169
until Officer Yamamura who we called arrived at the scene.

398
00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:59.569
After everything was settled, what we found out was that

399
00:20:59.569 --> 00:21:02.169
those men are members of a gang called Deisankai

400
00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:04.669
and the old man called Watanuki is the leader of the gang.

401
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:07.869
The skeleton that was found was also the leader of that gang.

402
00:21:07.869 --> 00:21:10.069
In other words, this seems to have been a fight

403
00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:11.769
for who was to succeed the position of leader of the gang.

404
00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:13.669
He seem to have killed the leader secretly and buried him here.

405
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:16.369
So, even if he manages to get out of prison,

406
00:21:16.369 --> 00:21:19.169
he would have to face the gang.

407
00:21:19.169 --> 00:21:22.069
Well, that's if he can get out.

408
00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:51.969
It's so much like a hero

409
00:22:51.969 --> 00:22:55.069
to have felt that Sonoko was in danger and come rushing over.

410
00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:57.769
I went to the place that Ms. Sonoko had written in her mail

411
00:22:57.769 --> 00:23:00.069
and was waiting there, but...

412
00:23:00.069 --> 00:23:01.469
Then you found out where the place was

413
00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:03.869
by watching the drama "Red Maple Leaves in Winter"?

414
00:23:03.869 --> 00:23:07.669
The fact is I was recording it for my sister on the video

415
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:10.269
but although it's embarrassing, I got hooked on it myself.

416
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:14.369
But I wrote in my mail that I would be waiting on the "Eve of Eve".

417
00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:16.569
I couldn't understand what you meant by that.

418
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:17.869
What?

419
00:23:17.869 --> 00:23:21.169
It means the day before Christmas Eve.

420
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:23.769
I figured all I had to do was ask you and feel embarrassed for a second.

421
00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.969
But I didn't want to lose my pride as a man doing so.

422
00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:28.969
That's why I set a tent up and waited over there.

423
00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:32.169
Till that day came.

424
00:23:32.169 --> 00:23:34.169
Was I a bit reckless?

425
00:23:34.169 --> 00:23:36.069
No, not at all.

426
00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:38.369
He's really a free soul.

427
00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:40.469
But how wonderful to come all this way just for Sonoko

428
00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:43.069
despite having to put a stop to your successive wins.

429
00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:45.369
Yes, I'm overwhelmed and touched.

430
00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:47.769
So, the best four contestants of

431
00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:49.869
the European Karate Championship game has lined up!

432
00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:53.869
It's really disappointing that contestant Makoto Kyogoku is not here!

433
00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:56.569
I'm sorry, but please speed over to Narita Airport.

434
00:23:56.569 --> 00:23:58.569
Don't tell me you're going back to the tournament grounds!

435
00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:02.369
Yes, I want to compete with the winner and determine who's stronger.

436
00:24:02.369 --> 00:24:04.869
Gosh, he still wants to fight.

437
00:24:05.969 --> 00:24:08.669
"Next Episode" "Burnable garbage, non-burnable garbage"

438
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:11.069
Genta, make sure you sort the trash correctly!

439
00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:22.769
Is she the person called Ms. Misa?

440
00:24:24.369 --> 00:24:26.669
Is this a recent picture?

441
00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:35.969
Next Conan, "The Abominable Man of Rules"

442
00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:53.969
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:53.969 --> 00:24:56.269
"Moving house"

444
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:57.969
The next episode is about a skinny man.

445
00:24:57.969 --> 00:24:58.969
The abominable skeleton.

446
00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:00.769
-You mean square. -Oh, really?
