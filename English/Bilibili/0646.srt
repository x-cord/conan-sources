1
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.340
But Ran, you really are unrivaled!

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.140
Having won the Kanto Karate championship and all!

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.040
It was all thanks to the "Rounding Heel Kick"

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.340
my elder, Kazuha taught me!

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.640
I feel sorry for her opponent.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.840
Well then, today I'll treat you

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.240
to the cake buffet at Haido Hotel as promised,

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.840
so eat and get stronger!

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.340
I'll be sure to eat a lot and get super strong!

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.340
Won't you get fat instead?

11
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.740
If all the cases are men,

12
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.540
all hidden mysteries are women.

13
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.540
Could he be Shinichi's new rival?

14
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.740
A handsome mysterious detective appears!

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

18
00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:18.236
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 1)"

19
00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:20.236
So?

20
00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:23.336
What did Shinichi say?

21
00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.936
When you told him about your victory...

22
00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:28.636
you also gave him your answer to that, right?

23
00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:29.936
What answer?

24
00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:33.736
The answer to that guy's confession in London!

25
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.736
I did inform him about my victory, but...

26
00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:40.236
not my reply to that.

27
00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:43.236
Since I also only reported my victory through email,

28
00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:46.536
I guess I just feel uneasy talking to him directly.

29
00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:49.036
What the Flipping Heck, Lady?

30
00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.536
Don't you realize how many days it's been since then?

31
00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:55.336
Well, how many days?

32
00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:57.636
I bet Shinichi is now like that.

33
00:02:57.636 --> 00:03:02.636
Oh, Ran, why hasn't she responded to my feelings?

34
00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:06.636
Don't tell me she has someone else in her heart?

35
00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:09.836
Oh, no, if that's the case, I'm doomed!

36
00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:11.536
No choice but to cry!

37
00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:14.236
Cry until these tears are used up!

38
00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.436
He's probably depressed with those thoughts.

39
00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:18.036
No way.

40
00:03:18.036 --> 00:03:20.436
Come on, you think I'm like that?

41
00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:21.836
If you take it too slow,

42
00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:24.836
Shinichi may have a change of heart!

43
00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:26.736
His attitude is kind of...

44
00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:29.036
but he's surprisingly popular, see?

45
00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:30.836
"Kind of"?

46
00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:36.536
One day, a powerful rival suddenly appear you know.

47
00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:40.936
Pervert! This guy's a groper!

48
00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:42.436
No, I'm not..

49
00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.436
Don't act all innocent!

50
00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:46.636
You touched my butt just now!

51
00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:48.636
Ran, it's payback time!

52
00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:50.736
Wait.

53
00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.736
I'm done for, if I get hit!

54
00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:10.836
As expected of Kanto's champ.

55
00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:13.736
Great moves!

56
00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:15.536
Jeet Kune Do!

57
00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:16.936
Ran.

58
00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:18.536
Sonoko, stay back.

59
00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:19.836
This pervert is strong.

60
00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:22.736
Oh, if you would let me explain!

61
00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:24.036
I'm absolutely...

62
00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:26.236
This person's not a pervert!

63
00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:29.436
Because I saw it!

64
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.136
I saw how that person seized the hand responsible

65
00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:34.136
for touching Sonoko's butt.

66
00:04:34.136 --> 00:04:38.936
And then that's why Sonoko mistook that person's hand.

67
00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:40.936
For, this.

68
00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:41.936
No.

69
00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:43.736
So the pervert...

70
00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:45.936
was you?

71
00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.536
I'm so sorry!

72
00:04:53.536 --> 00:04:55.636
Forgive me!

73
00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:58.436
Never show yourself again, idiot!

74
00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:00.836
I'm so sorry!

75
00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:03.436
I almost kicked you without even making sure.

76
00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.136
No problem, no problem!

77
00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:08.136
I'm just glad we've cleared up our misunderstanding.

78
00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:10.636
On second look, what a hot guy!

79
00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:11.736
Besides...

80
00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:14.536
Since you're my type,

81
00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:16.736
I'll forgive you.

82
00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:19.536
What the heck was that?

83
00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:22.636
The pervert's victim was me, you know.

84
00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:24.236
I'm joking.

85
00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:25.736
Where you headed?

86
00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.436
To Haido Hotel.

87
00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:29.036
What a coincidence!

88
00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:31.736
I'm headed to that hotel too.

89
00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.536
Are you really?

90
00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:37.136
You'd better not be making that up, jerk!

91
00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:40.536
Thank you for earlier, little boy!

92
00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:45.736
"Haido Hotel"

93
00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:48.536
Oh, no? You have no vacancies?

94
00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:51.336
How come? I made a reservation, you know!

95
00:05:51.336 --> 00:05:53.336
My sincere apologies.

96
00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:54.736
We should have declined,

97
00:05:54.736 --> 00:05:56.836
but our oversight caused the problem.

98
00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:00.236
Well, it sure seems he really has some business with the hotel.

99
00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:02.636
Then, any other rooms available?

100
00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:04.336
About that...

101
00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:07.136
We are currently renovating our hotel annex,

102
00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:09.636
so we have fewer rooms available and are now all occupied.

103
00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:12.236
Isn't there anything you can do?

104
00:06:12.236 --> 00:06:14.736
Say, let's hurry and go eat some cake.

105
00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:16.636
I'm really hungry.

106
00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:18.236
All right.

107
00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:20.536
Still, isn't he so cool?

108
00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:22.736
And as strong as you, Ran!

109
00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:28.836
If he fought with Makoto, I wonder who would be stronger at Karate?

110
00:06:28.836 --> 00:06:31.136
That wasn't Karate.

111
00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:32.936
That was Jeet Kune Do.

112
00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:35.136
"Jeet Kune Do"

113
00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:36.836
Movie star Bruce Lee

114
00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:39.436
took the art of Kung Fu he had been practicing as a child.

115
00:06:39.436 --> 00:06:41.636
And combined it with boxing, judo, wrestling,

116
00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:44.936
savate, aikido and other forms of fighting

117
00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:46.436
to develop this martial art!

118
00:06:46.436 --> 00:06:49.136
But, it has a number of attacks that target vital points

119
00:06:49.136 --> 00:06:52.336
such as the eyes and throat, so it's pretty fierce.

120
00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:55.536
As usual, you know all kinds of weird things!

121
00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:59.636
Regardless, where are they having the cake buffet?

122
00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:03.336
We've come to a place where there's somehow nobody around.

123
00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:08.136
On the net, it says it's at the cafe on the second floor.

124
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.236
Then, let's go to the second floor and take a look!

125
00:07:11.236 --> 00:07:13.436
There are elevators over there.

126
00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:18.236
Oh, where are you going, little boy?

127
00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.836
To the cake buffet on the second floor.

128
00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:23.936
Then, you can't get there using this elevator.

129
00:07:23.936 --> 00:07:26.136
This one goes to the annex.

130
00:07:26.136 --> 00:07:27.436
The annex?

131
00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:31.236
But didn't they say the annex was under renovation?

132
00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:33.236
Sorry for troubling you.

133
00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:34.536
No problem.

134
00:07:34.536 --> 00:07:37.736
We should help each other when in need!

135
00:07:40.536 --> 00:07:42.736
Mrs. Hirukawa!

136
00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:44.836
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

137
00:07:44.836 --> 00:07:47.136
How'd it go with him?

138
00:07:47.136 --> 00:07:51.136
At first he was drunk and shouting curses as usual, but...

139
00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:54.036
After I scolded him severely, he started crying.

140
00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.936
He cried?

141
00:07:55.936 --> 00:07:56.936
Yeah.

142
00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:58.336
He said that, after he had sobered up,

143
00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.236
he'd apologize to everyone and admit his sins,

144
00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:02.036
so he'd like us to go to his room.

145
00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:03.936
Really, now?

146
00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:07.136
But could he just be planning to spew nonsense

147
00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.936
to dodge our question?

148
00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:11.036
In order to get us off his back.

149
00:08:11.036 --> 00:08:14.436
Good point. He might say that

150
00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:16.636
he doesn't remember saying anything of the sort

151
00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:18.036
if we ask him about it later on.

152
00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:21.736
Then, why don't we record this repentance?

153
00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:25.636
That way, the other victims could hear it as well.

154
00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:29.736
But, I don't have any recording devices with me.

155
00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:31.136
Me neither.

156
00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.336
In that case, let's take my car

157
00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.436
and the three of us can buy one!

158
00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:39.536
Since he said it'd be a while before he sobered up.

159
00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:41.236
And we should be able to find

160
00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:43.836
at least one electronics shop in this area, right?

161
00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:45.136
You're right.

162
00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:50.636
No way! You're cutting off the line for the cake buffet?

163
00:08:50.636 --> 00:08:54.436
Yes. More customers than we'd expected came,

164
00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:55.736
"Cake Buffet Now Closed" -so there weren't enough cakes.

165
00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:57.436
If you're going to hold a cake buffet,

166
00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.936
you should prepare a whole lot and go out with a bang!

167
00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.536
A bang!

168
00:09:03.636 --> 00:09:05.336
What was that sound just now?

169
00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.136
Could be the parking lot?

170
00:09:15.536 --> 00:09:16.636
Hold on!

171
00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:23.136
This is bad.

172
00:09:23.136 --> 00:09:25.136
Call an ambulance!

173
00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:32.936
What just happened?

174
00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:35.836
We were just backing up the car

175
00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:38.336
when this man fell from above!

176
00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:39.936
Isn't this...

177
00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:41.436
Him?

178
00:09:41.436 --> 00:09:43.536
It is! It's Uesumi!

179
00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:46.536
What's the matter?

180
00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:48.836
Hold on, who's that over there?

181
00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:51.936
Someone suspicious was on the roof just now!

182
00:09:51.936 --> 00:09:52.936
What?

183
00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:57.836
Do you remember what that person looked like?

184
00:09:57.836 --> 00:09:59.836
I saw the clothes.

185
00:09:59.836 --> 00:10:03.036
It might have been an acquaintance.

186
00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.936
Ran, call the police

187
00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:06.936
and keep watch over this place with the security guard!

188
00:10:06.936 --> 00:10:09.336
-What? -I'm going with these people

189
00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:11.236
to the roof to take a look!

190
00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:22.436
So this elevator has both front and rear doors?

191
00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:24.636
What are you doing, Mrs. Hirukawa?

192
00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:27.736
Can't I just stay here?

193
00:10:27.736 --> 00:10:29.436
I'm so scared.

194
00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:30.836
No way!

195
00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:33.536
You're the one who saw them, Mrs. Hirukawa!

196
00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:47.736
Shoes on top of a jacket.

197
00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:50.036
Then, suicide?

198
00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:53.436
Then, what was the person's shadow that Mrs. Hirukawa saw?

199
00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:56.736
The jacket flapping in the wind.

200
00:10:56.736 --> 00:10:59.236
Maybe that's what I saw.

201
00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:01.436
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:04.636
I pushed him too hard with my words.

203
00:11:04.636 --> 00:11:07.336
No, this was most likely...

204
00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:09.236
A murder.

205
00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:11.236
Isn't that right?

206
00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.436
Conan?

207
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:23.641
Murder, you say?

208
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:28.941
Are you saying you saw someone push him off from here?

209
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:30.141
No.

210
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:34.341
I just happened to overhear your conversation stating that

211
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:37.741
the man who fell to his death was quite drunk.

212
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:40.541
Due to my line of work, my ears are quite good.

213
00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:42.441
Your line of work?

214
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:45.141
But, why isn't this a suicide?

215
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:48.341
Look, his shoes are lined up properly.

216
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.641
That's just a preconception, you know?

217
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:56.141
I've seen innumerable jumper suicide scenes up until now, but...

218
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.441
Just about none of the bodies had been shoeless.

219
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.041
You've seen innumerable jumper suicide scenes?

220
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:05.841
Well, I guess the most influential theory

221
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:08.641
would be that it's a key plot device in movies or TV dramas?

222
00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.841
"If you see shoes lined up on a roof, it's most likely suicide."

223
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:13.541
It would be a convenience condition

224
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.741
for dramas to strike that chord emotionally.

225
00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:18.441
Nowadays not so much, but...

226
00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:20.241
The same goes for detective dramas in the past

227
00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:23.441
that would show blood gushing out of the mouths of people

228
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:24.941
who hung themselves.

229
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.941
In reality, blood will not flow out.

230
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:29.041
But it's easier for viewers to understand the death,

231
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:30.841
and it has more impact.

232
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:32.541
Although...

233
00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:35.141
Having seen those sorts of dramas or movies,

234
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:36.841
there are cases you'd think the victims

235
00:12:36.841 --> 00:12:40.941
should remove their shoes before jumping off, but...

236
00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:42.641
Seeing how the man who fell to his death

237
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.341
had been heavily intoxicated

238
00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:47.841
and requested time to sober up.

239
00:12:47.841 --> 00:12:50.541
In such a groggy state, there's no way

240
00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:52.441
he'd do things such as take his jacket off

241
00:12:52.441 --> 00:12:54.841
and place his shoes neatly atop it.

242
00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:56.541
And even the possibility

243
00:12:56.541 --> 00:13:00.441
that some random person placed this here as a prank...

244
00:13:00.441 --> 00:13:02.341
Must be rejected since the shoes are directly above

245
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:05.941
where the man fell to his death.

246
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:07.941
So that brings us to...

247
00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:10.841
No other conclusion but that this was a disguise jumper suicide,

248
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:15.641
and the culprit deliberately lined the shoes up here, see?

249
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:16.941
Right?

250
00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:18.341
Little boy!

251
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:21.541
Then, where is the culprit?

252
00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:24.841
I bet he'll be arrested real soon now.

253
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:27.741
Since, before I came up here to the roof,

254
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:31.841
I asked the guard to keep watch over the elevator and stairs.

255
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:33.741
What's all this?

256
00:13:33.741 --> 00:13:36.341
Who in the world are you?

257
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:39.441
My name is Sera.

258
00:13:39.441 --> 00:13:41.841
Like this little boy here.

259
00:13:41.841 --> 00:13:43.741
I'm a detective.

260
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:46.941
What?

261
00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:48.941
There wasn't anyone there?

262
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:51.041
Are you saying there wasn't anyone at all

263
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:53.441
except this man who fell in the annex?

264
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:55.241
No.

265
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:59.141
According to the guard who had been watching the elevator and stairs,

266
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:01.641
you all were the only ones who had passed.

267
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:04.641
By the way, just who would you be?

268
00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:07.041
A detective, it seems.

269
00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:08.641
A detective?

270
00:14:08.641 --> 00:14:11.941
Another one of these pain-in-the necks?

271
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:15.441
But, why was this man there?

272
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:18.641
The annex was under renovation, so nobody should've been there.

273
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.341
The deceased Teigo Uesumi

274
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:24.741
was the son of the owner of this Haido Hotel.

275
00:14:24.741 --> 00:14:27.941
They made an exception and let him use one of the rooms,

276
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:30.541
in order to avoid the media, it seems.

277
00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:32.141
"Media"?

278
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:34.041
Is that person famous?

279
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.341
Yeah, sort of. He was arrested in the past

280
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:39.041
for being the ringleader of a remittance scam,

281
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:41.241
but was acquitted on insufficient proof

282
00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:43.741
and is now being written up about in the weeklies.

283
00:14:43.741 --> 00:14:46.441
But the media caught wind of it,

284
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:49.541
and a huge uproar about it went on until last week.

285
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:52.641
Mr. Uesumi flew off the handle at his media interviewers.

286
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.041
And broke the sixth floor window with a fire extinguisher.

287
00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.641
Because of that, guests staying in the annex reduced,

288
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:02.641
and even the hotel couldn't accommodate him anymore.

289
00:15:02.641 --> 00:15:04.141
There had been rumors that they were using

290
00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:06.841
the annex renovation as an excuse

291
00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:08.441
to force him to move overseas.

292
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.741
Yes, we victims also heard that rumor,

293
00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:13.641
and that's why we came to meet Uesumi.

294
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:16.041
Before he could flee overseas...

295
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.741
We wanted him to at least give an apology.

296
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:21.641
Then, were you able to see Mr. Uesumi?

297
00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:25.641
Yes, I was the first one to go to his room

298
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:28.141
but he suddenly burst into tears

299
00:15:28.141 --> 00:15:30.241
and said that he'd admit to his crimes and apologize.

300
00:15:30.241 --> 00:15:32.841
But said he wanted some time to sober up.

301
00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:38.241
We thought we might as well record his repentance.

302
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:39.541
So the three of us decided to go

303
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:43.441
and buy a recording device from a nearby electronics shop.

304
00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:46.441
We got into my car in the parking lot,

305
00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:49.341
but just as we backed up...

306
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:52.741
He came falling right before our eyes!

307
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:58.241
Just as you backed up the car?

308
00:15:58.241 --> 00:15:59.641
Inspector.

309
00:15:59.641 --> 00:16:02.041
It might be that someone tied a string or something

310
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:03.941
to connect Uesumi and the car

311
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:06.941
and as a result that caused him to fall.

312
00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:11.141
Was there anyone who touched your car or the body after he fell?

313
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:12.641
Don't know.

314
00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:14.241
I don't think anyone did!

315
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:19.141
As soon as this lady said she saw a suspicious figure on the roof,

316
00:16:19.141 --> 00:16:22.241
I immediately went up to the roof with her and the others!

317
00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:23.941
And in the meantime, I told Ran and the others

318
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:28.241
to help the guards watch the car and the body.

319
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:30.541
-Right? -Yeah.

320
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:35.041
It seems the suspicious figure was something I mistook, though.

321
00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:39.441
In that case, there may still be traces of some sort of contraption.

322
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:41.141
Inspect it thoroughly!

323
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:43.941
-Roger! -But, this is strange.

324
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:47.041
While I was waiting for the elevator,

325
00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:52.541
I'm pretty sure it stopped on the sixth and second floors.

326
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:54.241
It stopped?

327
00:16:54.241 --> 00:16:56.441
When did that happen?

328
00:16:56.441 --> 00:16:59.541
During the commotion of the man falling and all...

329
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:00.741
Right after this little boy

330
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:02.841
brought the lady and the others to the elevator

331
00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:05.241
and headed to the roof.

332
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:09.241
The elevator went nonstop to the top floor

333
00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:11.241
but took its time coming back down.

334
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:14.941
But, if I recall, there should have been two elevators.

335
00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:17.841
It appears that only one had been working.

336
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:21.241
Since they figured Uesumi was the only one staying there.

337
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:25.141
Then, it may be that someone else is still lurking in the annex.

338
00:17:25.141 --> 00:17:26.741
Yeah.

339
00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:29.441
The investigators are searching every nook and cranny,

340
00:17:29.441 --> 00:17:32.241
but there are no results of anyone having been found yet.

341
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:34.141
The surveillance cameras?

342
00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:36.441
They're in the elevators and the hallways, right?

343
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:38.441
About that...

344
00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:40.641
when Mr. Uesumi wreaked havoc,

345
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:43.441
he sprayed paint all over the hotel annex.

346
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:47.941
And even the surveillance cameras were all sprayed over.

347
00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:51.041
They're all blacked out and nothing can be seen.

348
00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:55.141
In short, the inside of the annex is a black box.

349
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:59.341
No one can tell for sure who did what inside of it.

350
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:02.441
This is getting to be exciting, right, sonny?

351
00:18:02.441 --> 00:18:04.641
Please watch what you say!

352
00:18:04.641 --> 00:18:07.041
A person just passed away, you know!

353
00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:09.441
Oh, yes. Sorry.

354
00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:11.041
Anyway...

355
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:13.541
It seems it's necessary for us to check it out.

356
00:18:13.541 --> 00:18:15.741
The reason the elevator supposedly stopped

357
00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:17.341
on the second and sixth floors.

358
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:19.141
I'm telling you it did!

359
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:22.641
But even if you tell that to the police detectives...

360
00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:25.041
Let's just tell them anyway!

361
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:26.541
What is it?

362
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:31.241
Well, you see, it's just a rumor, but...

363
00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:34.141
They say it appears in this annex.

364
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:36.941
Appears? What does?

365
00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:39.441
A ghost, it's a ghost!

366
00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:41.341
At night, some people seem to have seen

367
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:44.741
an unoccupied wheelchair that belonged to an elderly man

368
00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:47.141
wandering around the annex!

369
00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:51.041
It could be that ghost was the one

370
00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:53.541
who pushed the elevator button.

371
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:55.241
Now see here.

372
00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:57.841
If no one was sitting in the wheelchair,

373
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:01.241
how could you tell, it was an elderly man's ghost?

374
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.741
It was my father.

375
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:06.841
The one who fell victim to the remittance scam

376
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:09.341
was my mother.

377
00:19:09.341 --> 00:19:11.141
But she collapsed due to the shock

378
00:19:11.141 --> 00:19:13.041
and had to be hospitalized, so...

379
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:15.841
my father deliberately booked a room in the annex

380
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:20.141
so that he could plead to Uesumi in front of his room every day.

381
00:19:20.141 --> 00:19:22.241
Saying, "I won't ask you to return the money,"

382
00:19:22.241 --> 00:19:25.241
"but please apologize to my wife"

383
00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:29.441
But when my father found out about my mother's death in the hospital,

384
00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:31.841
on the evening of that day...

385
00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:35.341
He committed suicide in the room he was staying.

386
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.341
My father had been using an electric wheelchair

387
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:42.041
on loan from the hotel due to his disabilities.

388
00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:44.841
I guess that's how the rumor started.

389
00:19:45.641 --> 00:19:49.641
Incidentally, what room did your father stay in?

390
00:19:49.641 --> 00:19:51.841
It was on the second floor.

391
00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:01.841
The graffiti certainly is terrible.

392
00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:04.841
No choice but to renovate, huh?

393
00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:06.941
Officer Chiba!

394
00:20:06.941 --> 00:20:08.841
You found anyone?

395
00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:10.341
Not yet.

396
00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:13.541
Oh? Why is the wheelchair here?

397
00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:15.441
I don't know.

398
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:18.141
When I found it, it was still moving.

399
00:20:18.141 --> 00:20:19.641
It was moving?

400
00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:22.041
Since there was a weird fishing line

401
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.341
attached between the wheels,

402
00:20:24.341 --> 00:20:26.141
I checked with the hotel.

403
00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:27.741
They said this was the electric wheelchair

404
00:20:27.741 --> 00:20:31.141
that the fallen Uesumi had been borrowing.

405
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:33.641
So did he have bad legs?

406
00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:38.741
No, it seems he was just using it to cruise around the annex.

407
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:42.041
What an unbelievable guy.

408
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:44.541
It's possible that Uesumi was the one

409
00:20:44.541 --> 00:20:47.341
behind the aforementioned ghost commotion.

410
00:20:47.341 --> 00:20:50.441
If he had planned to scare the three victims

411
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:53.341
who came to visit on 2F where the elderly man committed suicide,

412
00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:55.841
By manipulating the unoccupied wheelchair with a fishing line...

413
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:58.541
if we think of it this way...

414
00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:02.541
That would certainly make sense.

415
00:21:02.541 --> 00:21:06.341
Even so, this fishing line is extremely long.

416
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:10.341
And there are some broken rubber bands at the tip of this.

417
00:21:10.341 --> 00:21:11.941
The footrests have marks

418
00:21:11.941 --> 00:21:15.241
indicating they've bumped into something.

419
00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:17.141
The man who fell to his death

420
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:19.241
was the ringleader of a remittance fraud group

421
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:22.841
that had caused a public uproar Teigo Uesumi.

422
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:25.941
Mrs. Hirukawa and other victims from his scam

423
00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:28.041
visited this Haido Hotel.

424
00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:29.841
While waiting for Uesumi,

425
00:21:29.841 --> 00:21:32.341
who had wept and admitted to his crimes, to sober up,

426
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:34.941
they decided to go buy a recording device for his confession,

427
00:21:34.941 --> 00:21:37.241
and just as they started driving,

428
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:40.041
Uesumi came tumbling down.

429
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:41.841
On the roof, we found Uesumi's

430
00:21:41.841 --> 00:21:44.541
clothes and shoes lined up perfectly, but...

431
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:48.441
It was actually a setup to disguise this as a suicide.

432
00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:51.641
According to the testimony of this self-proclaimed detective,

433
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:53.941
after we had rushed up to the roof,

434
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:56.241
he saw the elevator stopping at the sixth and second floors

435
00:21:56.241 --> 00:21:58.641
before coming down to first floor.

436
00:21:58.641 --> 00:22:03.041
And a wheelchair still in motion was found on the second floor.

437
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:05.241
A long line had been tied between the wheels

438
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:08.941
with broken rubber bands attached at the tip.

439
00:22:08.941 --> 00:22:11.941
Doesn't this mean that the culprit utilized this wheelchair

440
00:22:11.941 --> 00:22:15.141
to make Uesumi fall to his death?

441
00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:17.341
But, how did he do it?

442
00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:23.541
Moreover, just who is this guy calling himself "Sera"?

443
00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:47.741
I've figured out, the culprit!

444
00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:48.841
What?

445
00:23:48.841 --> 00:23:52.841
Can you tell us your deduction, Sera?

446
00:23:52.841 --> 00:23:57.641
We'll listen and let you know if there are any erroneous parts.

447
00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:58.941
All right.

448
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:01.241
The voice. Is that Kudo?

449
00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:04.641
Once I told Shinichi about the case over the phone,

450
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:06.441
he said he figured it out!

451
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:09.441
Shinichi Kudo?

452
00:24:09.841 --> 00:24:11.141
Next Conan,

453
00:24:11.141 --> 00:24:15.329
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 2)"

454
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.310
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.110
"Paint Cans"

456
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.310
-He's such a handsome chum! -I wonder.

457
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.310
Why, are you jealous?

458
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.214
You'll find out in the next episode.
