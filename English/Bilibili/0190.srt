1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.340
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.140
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.040
A gun is between Conan and Haibara.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.740
While Ran is putting on quite a performance with a certain someone.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.099
We, the Youth Detective Squad,

9
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.599
go on a camping trip with Doctor Agasa.

10
00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.999
And find a limestone cave in the forest.

11
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.299
We immediately decide to go in and explore it.

12
00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.399
But inside the cave,

13
00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.799
we come across a gang of bank robbers

14
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.599
who are trying to hide the body of one of their partners.

15
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.099
And of all the bad luck,

16
00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.699
I am shot and seriously injured.

17
00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.899
But thanks to the good work of the Youth Detective Squad,

18
00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:21.299
we escaped and the robbers were arrested.

19
00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.299
I was quickly taken to the hospital

20
00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.099
and thanks to Ran whose blood they used for my transfusion,

21
00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.499
I pulled through.

22
00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.899
I have the same blood type as him.

23
00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.299
Ran knew for sure.

24
00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.799
She knew my blood type.

25
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.499
She knows who I am.

26
00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.999
And just when I figured the only option I had

27
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.799
was to tell Ran the whole truth...

28
00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.999
Haibara comes and points a gun at me!

29
00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.599
"Perilous Return: The Third Choice"

30
00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.399
Haibara...

31
00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.999
Sorry about this.

32
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.699
I guess

33
00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.799
there was still some bad blood flowing through me.

34
00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.799
What?

35
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.299
What? You didn't you know?

36
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.199
My cover has been blown.

37
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.199
By those you call "men in black".

38
00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.099
Want to know how?

39
00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.799
It was that incident at the Haido City Hotel.

40
00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.799
I never dreamed it would happen.

41
00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.799
Who would have thought there was another man there

42
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.099
besides Pisco.

43
00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.999
What he told them

44
00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.999
made the organization suspect

45
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.899
the potion turned me into a child.

46
00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:50.199
And they found out where I was and contacted me this morning.

47
00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.499
I thought they'd kill me off right there.

48
00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.299
But they said that if I returned to the organization,

49
00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.899
they'd overlook the fact I betrayed them.

50
00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:04.399
They want me to get back to developing the APTX 4869,

51
00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.799
that's their objective.

52
00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.599
So that's it.

53
00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.599
That's why you're here to kill me

54
00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.399
because I know about your organization.

55
00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:13.699
That's right.

56
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.699
That's what they told me I had to do if I want to go back.

57
00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.699
Of course, your parents and your detective friend in Osaka

58
00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.099
will also be killed tomorrow.

59
00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.899
I'm sorry about this.

60
00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.499
But Doctor Agasa's been taken hostage.

61
00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:32.499
So, this is the only thing I can do to save him.

62
00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.299
But you can also thank me.

63
00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:38.199
You won't have to see your parents or your friend get killed.

64
00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.199
Because I'm going to kill you first.

65
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:52.599
What do you think?

66
00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.899
-What? -What if...

67
00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.299
there really was someone like that at the hotel?

68
00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:03.099
And what if they did find me and take the doctor as hostage?

69
00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.299
I will do exactly like what I just did, you know.

70
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.299
But then it's a sure bet

71
00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:12.899
that they will kill anyone and everyone I came in contact with.

72
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:15.499
No doubt about that.

73
00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:18.899
Hey, what are you trying to get at?

74
00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:21.399
I came here to make things clear to you.

75
00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:23.099
Make what clear?

76
00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.599
If you let your feelings get the best of you

77
00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.999
and you tell her about the organization,

78
00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:29.799
I want you to know that

79
00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:33.599
she'll certainly be one of those the organization gets rid of.

80
00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.299
Do you mean Ran?

81
00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:38.299
That's right.

82
00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:42.999
I'm almost positive she knows who you are.

83
00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:47.499
And you're thinking you can't fool her this time.

84
00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.699
So, you're thinking of telling her

85
00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.699
all about the potion and the organization.

86
00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.699
And get everything off of your chest.

87
00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.099
Why are you so surprised?

88
00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.999
Anyone could tell by looking at you now.

89
00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.799
If I can see through you,

90
00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:06.699
she probably can, too.

91
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.899
She might just be thinking,

92
00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:11.499
"He's going to tell me any day now."

93
00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:13.499
Oh, come on.

94
00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:15.999
You have three choices.

95
00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.299
Three?

96
00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:18.499
The first is,

97
00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.699
leave things as it is,

98
00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.099
don't tell her anything and keep your distance.

99
00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.299
Second,

100
00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.499
you cast your fates to the wind

101
00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:29.899
and tell her everything.

102
00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:32.699
Or your third choice which is...

103
00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.199
"Teitan High School Festival"

104
00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.899
"Shuffle Romance"

105
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.799
Good grief, I don't believe this.

106
00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:58.699
Why are there so many people out there?

107
00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.099
And we're up next, too!

108
00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:03.799
That's because they've heard good things about it!

109
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.999
After all, it's being billed as the best love romance

110
00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.799
surpassing even "Romeo and Juliet"!

111
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.899
Ran!

112
00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.999
Kazuha!

113
00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.899
I decided to come after all!

114
00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:18.499
Heiji said I shouldn't since I'd only be imposing, though.

115
00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.699
You mean Hattori didn't come with you?

116
00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.599
Oh, shucks! I have a secret crush on him, though.

117
00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:24.699
What?

118
00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.499
She's just joking!

119
00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:31.299
Sonoko's crazy about another tall dark boy, aren't you?

120
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:34.399
Well, excuse me for liking them tall and dark.

121
00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:38.799
And where is Kudo?

122
00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.699
I didn't invite him.

123
00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:41.899
Gosh.

124
00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:45.399
You invite old friends and people from your neighborhood,

125
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.799
but you don't invite your honey, I don't understand you.

126
00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:48.999
Oh, I get it.

127
00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.799
I'm not the only one you invited today.

128
00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:55.799
Conan, I'm glad you could make it!

129
00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:57.499
He's still got a cold,

130
00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.999
so I told to him stay at home and rest.

131
00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:03.899
He said he promised to come so nothing could stop him.

132
00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.099
How are you?

133
00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:06.299
Do you feel okay?

134
00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:07.599
I'm okay.

135
00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:09.699
Don't push yourself just for me.

136
00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.599
Ran, may I speak to you?

137
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.699
It's about the cue to the last dialogue.

138
00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:16.099
Be right there.

139
00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:17.899
He's nice looking!

140
00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.999
Is he by chance her partner in the play?

141
00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.899
That's right! Don't you think they make a nice couple?

142
00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:25.699
Well, I'll be going to my seat now.

143
00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:28.699
Don't get nervous!

144
00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:30.099
Good luck!

145
00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:35.899
Oh, no! It's 15 minutes before stage time!

146
00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.299
We've got to change into our costumes!

147
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.599
Sorry it took so long.

148
00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:49.299
What took you so long?

149
00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:51.399
"Yota Mitani (27)" -I'm dying of thirst.

150
00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.799
"Mai Kogami (28)" -Sorry about that,

151
00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.099
but the concession was pretty crowded.

152
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:57.699
I have to go to the restroom, could you take these?

153
00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:59.799
Are you going now?

154
00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.899
"Yumemi Noda (27)" -Then, you'd better hurry, Mai.

155
00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:03.599
I think it's about to start.

156
00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:04.899
Really?

157
00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.899
I have less than a minute left. I better hurry.

158
00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:08.799
Hurry!

159
00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:11.099
Let's see, Mai has an iced coffee and...

160
00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:12.399
Mine's orange juice.

161
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.799
Orange juice.

162
00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:16.399
-Here. -Thank you.

163
00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.299
Kohei, you're having iced coffee, aren't you?

164
00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:19.999
Yes.

165
00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:22.399
Mine is the oolong tea.

166
00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:24.799
"Kohei Kamata (28)"

167
00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.299
No way...

168
00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:29.899
It's her...

169
00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.199
"Ayako Ninagawa (18)"

170
00:09:33.099 --> 00:09:34.699
What's wrong?

171
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.799
No, it's nothing.

172
00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:43.399
The B group of the junior class will now perform "Shuffle Romance".

173
00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.499
I hope you all enjoy the play.

174
00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:52.299
Omniscient and omnipotent God Zeus!

175
00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:56.299
Why do you subject me to such cruelty?

176
00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:58.499
Or are you telling me to resign myself to this marriage

177
00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:01.999
that I do not wish?

178
00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:04.699
That's the way, show us your stuff!

179
00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:07.899
Well, that's my daughter up there!

180
00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:11.499
Oh, how embarrassing.

181
00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:13.299
I want to change my seat.

182
00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:18.699
It's the first climatic scene!

183
00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:21.199
Hurry and get up there to stand by for...

184
00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:26.599
Who are you ruffians?

185
00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:28.299
Do you realize this is Princess Heart's carriage?

186
00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:30.999
Her father is the Duke Bridge!

187
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.899
Of course, we know that!

188
00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.599
Our orders are to kill the princess

189
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.999
so the wedding doesn't take place!

190
00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:38.599
To our empire,

191
00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:39.899
it is more convenient

192
00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:42.099
for the Duke and the King to remain at odds.

193
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:44.999
It is to our benefit.

194
00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:46.099
Get out of the way!

195
00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.699
Come!

196
00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:54.099
Ran, give him a karate chop!

197
00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:56.499
Take those guys out!

198
00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:02.399
-Huh? -Raven feathers?

199
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.699
It can't be...

200
00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:11.499
Black knight?

201
00:11:11.499 --> 00:11:13.699
He is so cool!

202
00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:15.499
Darn it! Let's get out of here!

203
00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:17.399
You've saved me not once but twice.

204
00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:20.899
Just who are you?

205
00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:25.799
Unnamed knight with your black cloak,

206
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:28.999
if you would grant me my wish,

207
00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:32.199
please remove that dark mask that you're wearing.

208
00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:34.599
And show me your face.

209
00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:48.999
Ran, you're so lucky.

210
00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:54.399
Mr. Arade.

211
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.799
This wasn't in the script.

212
00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:01.099
That animal...

213
00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:04.099
What is he doing to my young daughter?

214
00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.599
Unforgivable!

215
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:07.799
Don't go up there, sir! Don't interrupt them!

216
00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:09.599
This is the best part!

217
00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:20.099
Sonoko.

218
00:12:20.099 --> 00:12:22.799
What am I supposed to do?

219
00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.999
"Just keep going!"

220
00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:28.199
What do you mean keep going?

221
00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:29.299
Are you sure about this?

222
00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:34.999
Could you by chance be Spade?

223
00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:37.499
The man my father slashed between the eyes,

224
00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:39.899
then threw out of our land.

225
00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:43.599
But no one dreamt you were the prince of Trump empire.

226
00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:45.099
If you haven't forgotten the promise we made

227
00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:46.999
when we were children,

228
00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.799
please...

229
00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:52.299
Plant a kiss upon my lips.

230
00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:55.199
You idiot! What are you saying, Ran?

231
00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:28.588
The deceased is Kohei Kamata, 27 years old.

232
00:13:28.588 --> 00:13:31.488
He's a doctor at the Beika General Hospital, right?

233
00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:33.988
-That's right. -You say he collapsed...

234
00:13:33.988 --> 00:13:36.088
while watching the play, right?

235
00:13:36.088 --> 00:13:38.888
It seemed as if he was suddenly overcome with pain.

236
00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:42.388
Then, he just collapsed.

237
00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:43.788
Could he have collapsed

238
00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:47.188
after drinking the contents of this cup?

239
00:13:47.188 --> 00:13:48.288
I don't know.

240
00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:50.888
I was concentrating on the play.

241
00:13:50.888 --> 00:13:53.988
There isn't much left inside.

242
00:13:53.988 --> 00:13:58.288
At approximately what time did Mr. Kamata collapse?

243
00:13:58.288 --> 00:13:59.388
Let's see...

244
00:13:59.388 --> 00:14:02.288
The play started a little after 2...

245
00:14:02.288 --> 00:14:05.788
I believe it was about 2:40 pm.

246
00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:07.688
Ran?

247
00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:09.588
We heard the scream

248
00:14:09.588 --> 00:14:12.988
during the climatic scene in the first half of the play.

249
00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:16.388
Isn't that right, Mr. Arade?

250
00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:18.088
Mr. Arade?

251
00:14:18.088 --> 00:14:19.188
Oh, I get it!

252
00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:22.088
This is Ran's high school and it's their school festival!

253
00:14:22.088 --> 00:14:23.488
Which means...

254
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.388
That fellow must also be here.

255
00:14:26.388 --> 00:14:28.988
Are you looking for somebody, Inspector?

256
00:14:28.988 --> 00:14:31.088
I certainly am looking for you!

257
00:14:31.088 --> 00:14:32.688
You murder magnet!

258
00:14:32.688 --> 00:14:37.188
So, you've finally brought bad luck onto your daughter's school.

259
00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:38.988
And? You did make sure

260
00:14:38.988 --> 00:14:41.488
that no one got close to the corpse, didn't you?

261
00:14:41.488 --> 00:14:43.488
Of course, Inspector!

262
00:14:43.488 --> 00:14:44.788
Preserving the scene of the crime

263
00:14:44.788 --> 00:14:47.088
is one of the most basic steps in crime solving.

264
00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:51.388
This officer was the first one to touch the body.

265
00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:53.388
Have you determined the cause of death?

266
00:14:53.388 --> 00:14:55.588
Yes, I'm certain this was...

267
00:14:55.588 --> 00:14:57.688
It was potassium cyanide.

268
00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:58.888
What?

269
00:14:58.888 --> 00:15:02.888
I'm sure this guy died after drinking potassium cyanide.

270
00:15:02.888 --> 00:15:03.888
Hey!

271
00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:07.188
I thought you said no one touched the body!

272
00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:09.988
Well, I didn't see anybody...

273
00:15:09.988 --> 00:15:11.088
You fool!

274
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.288
You don't have to touch the body

275
00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:14.188
to figure out how he died.

276
00:15:14.188 --> 00:15:15.288
When somebody dies,

277
00:15:15.288 --> 00:15:17.288
it's normal for them to take on death's colors.

278
00:15:17.288 --> 00:15:21.388
But this guy's lips and his nails aren't purple,

279
00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:23.588
they're pink.

280
00:15:23.588 --> 00:15:26.888
That's proof he died of potassium cyanide poisoning.

281
00:15:26.888 --> 00:15:29.988
Potassium cyanide is different from other poisons is that

282
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:31.488
when you drink it,

283
00:15:31.488 --> 00:15:33.788
it destroys the electron transmission in the cells.

284
00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:37.988
And the oxygen in the blood gets circulated without being used.

285
00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:41.288
That's why the complexion takes on a healthy color.

286
00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:44.388
Also, there's the smell of almond coming out his mouth

287
00:15:44.388 --> 00:15:46.888
that points at potassium cyanide poisoning.

288
00:15:46.888 --> 00:15:49.288
Officer, is what he said true?

289
00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:50.788
Yes.

290
00:15:50.788 --> 00:15:52.688
And there is an almond smell.

291
00:15:52.688 --> 00:15:53.988
This boy is right,

292
00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:57.988
it's almost certain he died of potassium cyanide poison.

293
00:15:57.988 --> 00:15:59.288
Hey, you.

294
00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:01.588
You seem to know a lot about this case.

295
00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:03.688
You weren't anywhere near the victim's chair

296
00:16:03.688 --> 00:16:06.288
when it happened, were you?

297
00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:07.388
No way.

298
00:16:07.388 --> 00:16:09.888
I was sitting in the very front row of the block

299
00:16:09.888 --> 00:16:12.288
across the aisle from him.

300
00:16:13.588 --> 00:16:16.288
The first row of the next block...

301
00:16:16.288 --> 00:16:19.388
That's right, I was sitting three seats away from you!

302
00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:21.288
Mouri, is that true?

303
00:16:21.288 --> 00:16:22.488
Well, you see...

304
00:16:22.488 --> 00:16:23.788
I was concentrating on the play,

305
00:16:23.788 --> 00:16:27.188
so I didn't notice who was sitting in the other seats.

306
00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:30.888
Is there anybody else who can prove you were there?

307
00:16:30.888 --> 00:16:34.088
Let's see now...

308
00:16:34.088 --> 00:16:35.488
Just ask him!

309
00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:39.488
I was sitting right next to that kid with the glasses!

310
00:16:39.488 --> 00:16:41.188
Is that right, Conan?

311
00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:43.688
Yes, I think so.

312
00:16:43.688 --> 00:16:46.188
But still, I got this funny feeling

313
00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:48.388
that I know you from some place.

314
00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:50.388
Who are you anyway?

315
00:16:50.388 --> 00:16:54.188
Don't tell me you've already forgotten about me?

316
00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:55.788
I'm so disappointed!

317
00:16:55.788 --> 00:16:59.688
After all the trouble I went through to get back here.

318
00:16:59.688 --> 00:17:01.288
It's me, Shinichi Kudo!

319
00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:02.988
What?

320
00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:10.988
The kid with the eye glasses called me.

321
00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.288
That's why I came to see your play, sweetie!

322
00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:15.888
Isn't that right, kid?

323
00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.788
Aren't you...

324
00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:19.488
Huh?

325
00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:21.788
Heiji, what are you doing?

326
00:17:21.788 --> 00:17:23.188
Kazuha?

327
00:17:23.188 --> 00:17:25.288
I told you not to come here!

328
00:17:25.288 --> 00:17:28.588
You put powder on your face and changed your hair style.

329
00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:31.088
Are you going to put on a kabuki show for us here?

330
00:17:31.088 --> 00:17:32.588
No, you've got everything wrong.

331
00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:33.688
Take a good look!

332
00:17:33.688 --> 00:17:36.588
I'm not Heiji, I'm Shinichi Kudo!

333
00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:39.588
What kind of joke is this anyway?

334
00:17:39.588 --> 00:17:41.488
Oh, I give up!

335
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:44.488
You're right, it's just a joke!

336
00:17:44.488 --> 00:17:47.588
I thought I'd dress up Iike Kudo and surprise everybody.

337
00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:50.188
But I guess it didn't work!

338
00:17:50.188 --> 00:17:52.788
Good grief. What's up with you anyway?

339
00:17:52.788 --> 00:17:56.788
One fool is enough and that's Mouri.

340
00:17:58.188 --> 00:18:00.788
Well, it's just a joke.

341
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:02.188
Darn it.

342
00:18:02.188 --> 00:18:03.688
All I wanted to do was pretend to be Kudo,

343
00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:05.388
and sit next to the real mini Kudo.

344
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:06.688
So that Ran would see us.

345
00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:08.288
And maybe she wouldn't be suspicious anymore.

346
00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:10.288
My plan was perfect

347
00:18:10.288 --> 00:18:12.988
and that darn Kazuha spoiled everything!

348
00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:16.788
At any rate, let's continue the investigation.

349
00:18:16.788 --> 00:18:21.488
So did the deceased Mr. Kamata buy his own drink?

350
00:18:21.488 --> 00:18:23.288
No, he didn't.

351
00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:25.588
I bought the drinks.

352
00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:27.288
From that concession.

353
00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:29.088
I bought four drinks

354
00:18:29.088 --> 00:18:32.588
and took them to my friends who were waiting at their seats.

355
00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:35.588
After that, I handed the drinks to Mitani

356
00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:37.588
and I went to the restroom, isn't that right?

357
00:18:37.588 --> 00:18:38.688
Yes.

358
00:18:38.688 --> 00:18:43.988
So Mr. Mitani, did you give the victim his drink?

359
00:18:43.988 --> 00:18:44.988
No.

360
00:18:44.988 --> 00:18:48.488
Mai asked me to pass out the drinks and...

361
00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:51.188
I'm going to the restroom, could you take these?

362
00:18:51.188 --> 00:18:53.088
Are you going now?

363
00:18:53.088 --> 00:18:54.988
Then, you'd better hurry, Mai.

364
00:18:54.988 --> 00:18:56.888
! think it's about to start.

365
00:18:56.888 --> 00:18:58.288
Really?

366
00:18:58.288 --> 00:19:00.388
I have less than a minute left. I'd better hurry.

367
00:19:00.388 --> 00:19:02.188
Hurry!

368
00:19:02.188 --> 00:19:04.488
Let's see, Mai has an iced coffee and...

369
00:19:04.488 --> 00:19:05.788
Mine's orange juice.

370
00:19:05.788 --> 00:19:06.988
Orange juice.

371
00:19:06.988 --> 00:19:07.988
Here.

372
00:19:07.988 --> 00:19:09.888
Thank you.

373
00:19:09.888 --> 00:19:11.888
Kohei, you're having iced coffee, aren't you?

374
00:19:11.888 --> 00:19:13.188
Yes.

375
00:19:13.188 --> 00:19:17.488
So she was the one who handed him his drink.

376
00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:18.888
What's that supposed to mean?

377
00:19:18.888 --> 00:19:23.488
You're the one who picked out which cup was his!

378
00:19:23.488 --> 00:19:25.088
Excuse me

379
00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:26.888
but could you tell me

380
00:19:26.888 --> 00:19:29.588
what is your relationship with Mr. Kamata?

381
00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:32.388
We all graduated from this high school

382
00:19:32.388 --> 00:19:35.088
and we were in the same drama club.

383
00:19:35.088 --> 00:19:37.488
We all coincidentally got jobs in the same company.

384
00:19:37.488 --> 00:19:39.988
And it's become a tradition for us

385
00:19:39.988 --> 00:19:41.888
to come see the play at the school festival.

386
00:19:41.888 --> 00:19:46.988
I can't believe something Iike this would happen to Kamata.

387
00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:50.188
And he was so excited that his doctrine

388
00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.388
might finally be recognized.

389
00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:54.088
Yes, that's right.

390
00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:55.588
But, Ms. Mai,

391
00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:57.088
I don't understand why

392
00:19:57.088 --> 00:19:59.788
you went to buy four drinks all by yourself.

393
00:19:59.788 --> 00:20:03.388
Isn't it pretty hard to carry four drinks by yourself?

394
00:20:03.388 --> 00:20:04.988
Well, it was crowded

395
00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:08.588
so I told the others to go and get the seats.

396
00:20:08.588 --> 00:20:11.088
Kamata came back later and...

397
00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:13.688
Mai, can you manage all those drinks alone?

398
00:20:13.688 --> 00:20:14.688
I'll help you.

399
00:20:14.688 --> 00:20:16.088
Thank you.

400
00:20:16.088 --> 00:20:18.788
Huh?

401
00:20:18.788 --> 00:20:21.288
I'm sorry, but I'll wait at my seat.

402
00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:22.488
What?

403
00:20:24.588 --> 00:20:28.788
Kamata suddenly got pale and went back to his seat.

404
00:20:28.788 --> 00:20:30.188
He got pale?

405
00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:31.988
I wonder what happened?

406
00:20:31.988 --> 00:20:36.188
Maybe it was because he saw me working at the concession.

407
00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:38.588
Ayako, is that you?

408
00:20:38.588 --> 00:20:40.788
You're a student here, too?

409
00:20:40.788 --> 00:20:44.088
I knew it! I knew I recognized you from somewhere.

410
00:20:44.088 --> 00:20:45.888
Do you know her?

411
00:20:45.888 --> 00:20:46.888
Yes.

412
00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:50.088
Her father is the director of the hospital we work in.

413
00:20:50.088 --> 00:20:54.888
Then, the person who put the drinks in this group's cups was...

414
00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:56.288
It was me.

415
00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.688
I see.

416
00:20:57.688 --> 00:21:01.488
Now, we have all the suspects!

417
00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:02.788
Just hold on a minute!

418
00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:06.188
Kohei and I both drank iced coffee!

419
00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:08.588
If I put the poison in his drink,

420
00:21:08.588 --> 00:21:10.388
I'd give him his drink personally

421
00:21:10.388 --> 00:21:12.588
so that I wouldn't drink it by mistake!

422
00:21:12.588 --> 00:21:16.788
But if you poisoned both and then just didn't drink your own...

423
00:21:16.788 --> 00:21:18.688
I drank every drop!

424
00:21:18.688 --> 00:21:21.988
Maybe you poured yours down the toilet?

425
00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:23.288
Didn't I tell you

426
00:21:23.288 --> 00:21:27.188
I left all the drinks and then went to the restroom?

427
00:21:27.188 --> 00:21:28.788
When I got back, the play had already started

428
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.088
and I never left my seat after that.

429
00:21:31.088 --> 00:21:33.888
All I did was pass out the drinks,

430
00:21:33.888 --> 00:21:36.888
I didn't have time to put any poison in it.

431
00:21:36.888 --> 00:21:38.688
Neither did I!

432
00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:42.588
But you did have time to open the lid and look inside, didn't you?

433
00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:44.988
We didn't have to open them up.

434
00:21:44.988 --> 00:21:47.588
The contents of each cup was written on the lid.

435
00:21:47.588 --> 00:21:52.788
Besides, the iced coffee had tubs of gum syrup and milk on them.

436
00:21:52.788 --> 00:21:57.288
Then, someone could have brought poisoned gum syrup or milk

437
00:21:57.288 --> 00:22:00.488
and switched them later.

438
00:22:00.488 --> 00:22:03.188
Then, he would have died as soon as he drank it!

439
00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:05.788
Potassium cyanide causes instant death!

440
00:22:05.788 --> 00:22:09.688
But Kamata's cup was almost completely empty!

441
00:22:09.688 --> 00:22:11.488
It's still not clear what trick the killer used

442
00:22:11.488 --> 00:22:13.888
to poison Mr. Kamata's drink,

443
00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:16.188
nonetheless,

444
00:22:16.188 --> 00:22:23.188
it's clear one of you is the killer.

445
00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:01.288
"Next Episode" -You probably figured it out too, right?

446
00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:02.788
The person who poisoned the drink

447
00:24:02.788 --> 00:24:04.988
is more than likely that person.

448
00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:08.988
No! Don't do it!

449
00:24:08.988 --> 00:24:12.388
You're not supposed to be out front in the spotlight.

450
00:24:12.388 --> 00:24:15.588
That's not allowed.

451
00:24:15.588 --> 00:24:17.288
Don't you understand that?

452
00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:24.688
Next Conan,

453
00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:28.509
"Perilous Return: The Black Knight"

454
00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:31.406
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:31.406 --> 00:24:33.706
"Ice"

456
00:24:33.706 --> 00:24:35.306
In the next episode, he will finally appear!

457
00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:37.306
No, he won't come! I'm good enough!

458
00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:38.506
That's not true!
