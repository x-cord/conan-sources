1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,540
The wind feels good.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,240
Really!

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,940
There are many super pretty fish near the isolated island

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,540
that we're headed for now!

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,640
I feel really excited.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,840
Ai should've come too.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,040
She said she didn't want to get a sun tan.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,340
Conan, a seagull!

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,140
The seagull's over that side.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,940
More than that,

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,640
doesn't it look like it's going to rain?

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,440
Like the fog clears.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,640
Let's see through love and crime as well.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,240
A tragedy occurs on an isolated island.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
A fight that breaks out among the video crew.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,040
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:30,923
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 1)"

20
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,423
Mr. Kurahashi, thank you for having us over again.

21
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:47,023
Sonoko, thank you for always

22
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:49,623
-patronizing our pension. -Thank you.

23
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,223
Okay, let's hurry and put our things in our room

24
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,223
and go snorkelling!

25
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:57,523
"Osamu Kurohashi (43)" -Oh, a storm is coming this way now.

26
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:00,423
I'm sorry to say this after you've come this far,

27
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:03,223
but please don't go into the water because it's dangerous.

28
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:05,823
-What? -Are you serious?

29
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,823
How disappointing.

30
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:13,323
I wanted to see pretty fish.

31
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:17,023
Well, I thought it was going to turn out this way.

32
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:19,323
"Keiko Kurahashi (38)" -Let me show you

33
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,423
to your rooms, everyone!

34
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,823
No joke.

35
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:30,223
I was looking forward to it and yet.

36
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:34,323
Come to think of it, it's typhoon season right now.

37
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:37,723
What's the matter, Conan?

38
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:40,623
They seem to be filming something over there.

39
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,123
Filming?

40
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,123
Hey, Okita,

41
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,823
make sure you shine the light on me.

42
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,423
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:50,223
"Yuya Miyasaka (30)" -Right, right. That's good.

44
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:53,923
Hey, hey! Isn't that Yuya Miyasaka?

45
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:56,323
Who? Is he famous?

46
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:57,723
He's an actor.

47
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,323
You see, the one who got drunk

48
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,923
and was arrested for assault last year.

49
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,623
I remember.

50
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:07,423
And because of that the drama he was starring in was called off.

51
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:10,723
I also used to like that drama so I remember it too.

52
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:12,723
Ever since then, his popularity went down the drain

53
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:15,423
and he disappeared from TV.

54
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:18,023
But, I wonder what he's filming in a place like this?

55
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,923
It looks sort of interesting.

56
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:22,323
Let's go check it out.

57
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:23,923
-Okay. -Hey, hey.

58
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:27,623
"Saeko Akimoto (25)"

59
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:34,123
Oh. Actress Saeko Akimoto is there too.

60
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:35,523
Actress?

61
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,523
Where?

62
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,323
Cut!

63
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:48,123
All right. Okay.

64
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,123
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,223
It's okay.

66
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,423
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,823
We're staying over at a pension nearby,

68
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:01,823
and came to see what you were shooting.

69
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,223
"Miki Kitagawa (22)" -Then, I'm sure you're staying

70
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:06,223
at the same pension we are.

71
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,523
What are you shooting now?

72
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:12,923
We're shooting a promotion video of Yuya Miyasaka.

73
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:16,223
What's the content about?

74
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:20,123
Well, the two, Saeko and Mr. Miyasaka drift onto an isolated island,

75
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:22,023
but with his superb survival skills

76
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,623
he protects her from danger.

77
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,823
The story goes like so.

78
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:29,223
An uninhabited island.

79
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:34,923
I'm counting on you, then.

80
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:37,123
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:38,723
Hey, Miki.

82
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:40,223
He's calling me.

83
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,423
See you.

84
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:48,623
Who are those guys?

85
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:51,923
People who are staying at the same pension as we are.

86
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:54,823
Huh?

87
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:57,623
Oh, that great actress is putting on her own make-up.

88
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,423
Um, wasn't that person who was here a while ago

89
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,723
the make-up artist?

90
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:06,923
Don't... Saeko is watching.

91
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:11,823
Who cares?

92
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:15,623
Let's get on with the shooting.

93
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,523
I see, so that's the story.

94
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,723
What do you mean?

95
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:25,923
Yuya Miyasaka and Saeko Akimoto were once rumored about.

96
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:29,423
However, another woman showed up.

97
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,723
I mean, she can hear.

98
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,423
Next, scene 14!

99
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:44,023
It's the scene where I slide down the cliff

100
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:46,223
to try and save Saeko who is below the cliff.

101
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,023
Hey, Yamamoto!

102
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,323
Are ready over there?

103
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:53,623
"Eiji Yamamoto (21), Assistant Director" -Yes, sir. We're ready.

104
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,523
Hold it.

105
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:57,923
"Mitsuo Okita (23), Camera Assistant" -Mr. Miyasaka, what is this?

106
00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:00,723
I didn't hear anything about me doing stunts!

107
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,423
But, you used to be in the exercise club

108
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,723
and have good athletic skills, don't you?

109
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:06,823
If you didn't,

110
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:09,923
I wouldn't have hired you as an assistant cameraman.

111
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,723
"Shingo Takayama (28), Cameraman" -Well, you can quit if you want to,

112
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,323
but I'm not paying you a cent, get that!

113
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:19,823
Darn, how dare he take unfair advantage of me?

114
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:22,323
You'd better make your mind up and resign yourself.

115
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:24,723
Once Mr. Miyasaka makes up his mind, he won't take no for an answer.

116
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:26,223
I know!

117
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:30,123
It's easy for you to say because it doesn't concern you!

118
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:38,323
Hey, is he really going to slide down from there?

119
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,423
No matter how good you are, that's impossible.

120
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:41,523
How frightening.

121
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:43,823
No matter how athletic.

122
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:46,123
This is going too far.

123
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,123
Ready,

124
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,323
action!

125
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,123
Cut!

126
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,423
Hey, Okita, are you okay?

127
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:25,123
I mean somehow the way you fell didn't have much impact.

128
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:27,423
Okita, do it once more!

129
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,523
What's with that look of yours?

130
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,723
I think it's better to cut it out already!

131
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,123
Exactly, right!

132
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,223
What?

133
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:40,423
Weren't you watching, Mr. Miyasaka?

134
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:43,623
He was one step before getting seriously hurt, you know!

135
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,623
-Right! -That's right!

136
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:48,723
You guys have no business in this!

137
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:57,423
That hurts!

138
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:00,323
Who threw the coke can over here?

139
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,023
Oh, no.

140
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:05,023
Not you again, Genta.

141
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:10,823
There's a coke stain on it.

142
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:12,623
Oh, no.

143
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:15,523
Idiot!

144
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,323
Getting precious small props dirty!

145
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:23,323
Oh, come on, cool it.

146
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,823
Are you all right, Mr. Yamamoto?

147
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,323
You dupes.

148
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:34,223
Shoots. It's started to rain.

149
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:38,323
Mr. Miyasaka. It seems that even the heavens have forsaken you.

150
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,623
With all that's happening to you, this is more like a joke.

151
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,823
Shut up!

152
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:44,823
Everybody, we're going back to the pension.

153
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:56,323
Come, wipe your body with this.

154
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,623
The bath's ready too, so whenever you're ready,

155
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:01,323
please help yourselves.

156
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:03,223
How about it, everyone?

157
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,023
While dinner's being prepared,

158
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:09,223
would you like to do some recreation to get to know each other.

159
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:11,723
Okay!

160
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,323
That sounds like fun.

161
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,323
Yeah!

162
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,923
You gotta be joking.

163
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:19,123
I mean we're not on some school excursion you now.

164
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:20,623
Give me a break.

165
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:22,223
Most owners of pensions

166
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:26,323
have a tendency to want their guests to get friendly with each other.

167
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:29,923
We've got to do some check on our equipment too.

168
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,423
If you will excuse us.

169
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,423
I'll go first!

170
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,523
The eight of spades.

171
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,023
Well...

172
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:44,823
Eight of diamonds.

173
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:47,223
I...

174
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:49,723
Here, six of hearts.

175
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:53,323
Is Mr. Miyasaka always like that?

176
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,123
I heard that he got in trouble

177
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:58,223
in some kind of incident before in the past too.

178
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:03,323
Mr. Miyasaka is trying desperately to regain the popularity he lost

179
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,923
due to that incident.

180
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,723
He's paying out of his own pocket for this promotion video

181
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,823
that we're shooting now too.

182
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:11,423
He's staking everything he's got on this piece of work.

183
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,823
That's why he's nervous.

184
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:17,623
I'm sorry that we made you feel unpleasant.

185
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,223
It's okay.

186
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,123
Who is it?

187
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,623
It's me.

188
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,123
Oh, what?

189
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,523
You haven't changed clothes yet?

190
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:40,023
Who cares! What do you want?

191
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:43,223
Won't you drink with me before dinner?

192
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,723
With this weather.

193
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:48,123
I'm sure there'll be no more shooting today, right?

194
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,623
He punched me again.

195
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:01,823
Darn!

196
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,523
Darn, Miyasaka. How dare he...

197
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:11,823
Hey, Okita!

198
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:13,023
Yes, sir?

199
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:16,223
What is it, Mr. Takayama?

200
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:19,123
Miyasaka says to bring the camera to his room and roll it

201
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:22,023
because he wants to make a "making of" video.

202
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:25,323
I'm rolling the camera? Not you, Mr. Takayama?

203
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:28,223
Yeah. He's asking for you.

204
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:29,323
Maybe he wants to apologize for what

205
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,023
he did you to a while ago or something.

206
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,623
Here you go.

207
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:43,723
Pass 2 for me.

208
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,623
Pass 3.

209
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,623
I can't make any more passes.

210
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,323
Pass 3

211
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,623
for me too.

212
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:54,423
Gee, Conan, it's not fair for you to stop everything!

213
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:55,523
Unfair?

214
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:58,423
I mean that's how this game seven is played, isn't it?

215
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,823
Bad news!

216
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,723
Mr. Miyasaka is

217
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,623
dead!

218
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,770
What do you mean, Mr. Miyasaka is dead?

219
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,870
I was told to go to Miyasaka's room

220
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,470
because he wanted to shoot a making of film

221
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,170
and wanted me to roll the camera.

222
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,170
Then...

223
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,070
What's wrong?

224
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,270
Oh, Mr. Takayama, Mr. Miyasaka is...

225
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,470
Miyasaka!

226
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,070
No joke?

227
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,070
Okita! Call everyone here right away!

228
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,770
Yes, sir!

229
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,670
Really?

230
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,070
Yes!

231
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,670
No!

232
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,570
Let's hurry over!

233
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,070
You people wait outside.

234
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,270
Mr. Takayama, is Mr. Miyasaka really...

235
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,270
There's no pulse. It's too late.

236
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,670
Mr. Miyasaka?

237
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,670
No.

238
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,370
No!

239
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,670
What's the matter?

240
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,170
What's going on?

241
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,670
Miyasaka...

242
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,770
One stab of the knife through his chest.

243
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,070
-Somehting's wrong. -Conan.

244
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,970
Don't go inside.

245
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,670
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,870
What's this?

247
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,070
That's my liquid foundation.

248
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,570
Why is it in a place like this?

249
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,570
Don't touch it!

250
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,470
We've got to keep the site intact.

251
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,770
Let's leave this room as is, and seal it off.

252
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,970
When the police come, I'll use the master key and open the room.

253
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,670
The police.

254
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,370
A person has died.

255
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,870
I've got to call the police, don't I?

256
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,070
That's true, but...

257
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,970
Miki, I think you should go to your room and rest.

258
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,070
True.

259
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,370
Yes, thank you.

260
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,970
Excuse me...

261
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,670
I called the police

262
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,370
but was told that unless the storm subsides,

263
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,570
they can't send any boats out.

264
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,870
It means that the culprit is among us, doesn't it?

265
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,270
Right?

266
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,570
Because it's storming outside and even the police can't come here.

267
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,970
It's hard to think that someone from outside

268
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,670
committed the crime, isn't it?

269
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,570
I don't want to admit it, but I think so too.

270
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,970
Oh, no.

271
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,270
Uh... what shall we do about dinner?

272
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,470
I'm sorry to say

273
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,670
that we'll just have to let everyone wait until the police arrive.

274
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,170
I don't mind.

275
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,170
Because I don't want to eat dinner together with a murderer.

276
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,670
You sound as if you're not the killer.

277
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,670
What's with you?

278
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,270
Are you suspecting me?

279
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,370
Well...

280
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,270
Let's calm down and organize the circumstances together.

281
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,570
Miki, are you alright already?

282
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,670
Yes, I am.

283
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,170
I'm sorry to have worried you.

284
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,170
So, everyone's here.

285
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,970
Miki, please come here.

286
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,070
Thank you.

287
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,270
Then first, about time that the murder was committed.

288
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,770
It was probably between the time that Mr. Miyasaka left the lobby to

289
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,570
when he was found dead by Mr. Okita.

290
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,670
All during that time we were in the lobby right through.

291
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,370
In other words, me, Ran, Miki, Mr. Kurahashi

292
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,970
and the four kids have an alibi.

293
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,370
I see. The ones with no alibi are...

294
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,870
actress, Saeko. Cameraman, Mr. Takayama,

295
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,270
AD, Mr. Yamamoto, his assistant, Mr. Okita,

296
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,370
and my wife.

297
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,770
I was getting dinner ready all the while!

298
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,670
Yeah, there's no way you could be the culprit.

299
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,270
You met Mr. Miyasaka for the first time today.

300
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,370
So you have no motive.

301
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,270
Which means, that one of the four among us is the culprit?

302
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,070
As record of evidence, I'm going to start rolling the camera from here.

303
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,370
So, who wants to start justifying themselves?

304
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,270
Uh, may I ask a question?

305
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,070
Hey, Conan.

306
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,370
All I want to do is ask a question.

307
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,970
I'd like to ask you, Mr. Okita, but...

308
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,970
Mr. Miyasaka's room is auto lock, isn't it?

309
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,070
How'd you get into the room?

310
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,870
Was the door open?

311
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,370
In other words, when Okita went to the room,

312
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,470
Miyasaka was still alive.

313
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,270
Then after you, you know what, Miyasaka,

314
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,170
you pretended to be the first one to find his body.

315
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,970
You were pissed at Miyasaka about having to do the stunts,

316
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,670
so it's a possibility...

317
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,670
Hey, hold it.

318
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,670
When I got there...

319
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,970
a bottle of cosmetic was stuck by the door

320
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,770
and there was a space open!

321
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,570
It was Saeko's, wasn't it?

322
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,170
Doesn't that mean she went to Miyasaka's room?

323
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,670
Hey! You're suspecting me too?

324
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,170
Why would I have to do something like that in the first place?

325
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,370
You've got motive!

326
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,970
Saeko suspected that Miyasaka and I had an affair

327
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,470
and was jealous about it.

328
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,070
Love entanglement?

329
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,970
If you wanted to go that far, I'll tell you honestly.

330
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,770
It's true that I went to Mr. Miyasaka's room

331
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,770
in order to ask him about his relationship with Miki.

332
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,870
But...

333
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,770
Sorry, I just don't feel up to it now.

334
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,170
He didn't let me into his room and I was shooed away.

335
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,770
But, I didn't take foundation with me.

336
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,970
And yet, I myself don't know

337
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,570
why it was at Miyasaka's room.

338
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,770
There's something I'd like to ask you too, Mr. Takayama.

339
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,170
What is it?

340
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,570
When I found Mr. Miyasaka's dead body,

341
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,970
you arrived there really quickly, didn't you?

342
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,370
Almost as if you were waiting for me to burst out of the room.

343
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,270
It could be that you lied about Mr. Miyasaka calling me,

344
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,770
and you're the real culprit, Mr. Takayama.

345
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,770
Weren't you trying to frame me up as the killer?

346
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,970
What?

347
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,970
I know that

348
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,870
Mr. Takayama owed a lot of money to Mr. Miyasaka

349
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,870
from gambling playing mah-jong.

350
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,670
You idiot!

351
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,870
I went to check you out

352
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,970
because I was worried whether you could shoot the video alright!

353
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,370
My debts had nothing to do with it!

354
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,170
I wonder about that...

355
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,370
How about you, Mr. Yamamoto?

356
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,370
The murder weapon was the knife

357
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,670
that was among your small props, wasn't it?

358
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,270
I'll bet you were outraged at being punched by Miyasaka and did it?

359
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,470
You were being slaved driven all the way up to now too.

360
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,470
So, maybe all that accumulated to hate and...

361
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,270
No, I didn't do it!

362
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,670
I lost that knife when Mr. Miyasaka punched me!

363
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,670
I went to look for it right away,

364
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,470
but it suddenly began raining so hard.

365
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,470
I just couldn't find it.

366
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,970
Really?

367
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,870
What was it?

368
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,870
The uncomfortable feeling I felt when I saw Mr. Miyasaka's dead body.

369
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,170
Something...

370
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,670
Something's not right.

371
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,470
Mr. Okita,

372
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,570
if I remember correctly, the video camera was rolling

373
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,470
when we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room, wasn't it?

374
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,170
Yeah.

375
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,270
I kept it rolling from the time we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room.

376
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,770
That means that everything from the time

377
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,170
that Mr. Miyasaka's dead body was found is recorded, right?

378
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,570
I just thought that if we watched that, you could come up with some clue.

379
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,870
I'm sorry! I can't take it.

380
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,670
Not the video of Mr. Miyasaka's dead body.

381
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:31,470
Conan, Miki is really shocked over Mr. Miyasaka's death,

382
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,470
you know?

383
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,770
Yep. I'm sorry.

384
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,670
Who on earth could've killed Mr. Miyasaka?

385
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,070
Mr. Takayama owed a lot of money to Mr. Miyasaka.

386
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,770
It's possible to think that after he killed Mr. Miyasaka,

387
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,870
he made Mr. Okita go to Mr. Miyasaka's room

388
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,570
and tried to set him up as the culprit.

389
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,170
Mr. Okita was angry

390
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,470
because he was forced to do many impossible stunts.

391
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,170
Did he kill Mr. Miyasaka

392
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,770
and pretend that he was the first one to find the body?

393
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,170
Saeko was jealous of the relationship between Mr. Miyasaka and Miki.

394
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,670
Her liquid foundation bottle was found at the scene of the crime.

395
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,970
Mr. Yamamoto had a grudge against Mr. Miyasaka for punching him.

396
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,470
Saying that he lost the knife could be a lie.

397
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,370
At any rate, there's no mistake that the culprit

398
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,270
is someone who is inside this pension.

399
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,170
"Next Episode" -How long do we have to stay in this room?

400
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,870
Where can we flee to

401
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,370
when we're on an isolated island in the storm?

402
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,770
I'm not the culprit.

403
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,670
Mr. Takayama seems very concerned about the police.

404
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,270
It's the thing that bothered me when I first saw it.

405
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,270
The culprit got away!

406
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,370
I've finally figured out what was bothering me.

407
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,970
Next Conan,

408
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,870
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 2)"

409
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,997
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,997
"Window"

411
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,397
Ran, I've figured out who the culprit is!

412
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,697
Just as expected of you, deduction queen.

413
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:29,697
I haven't fired the needle yet.
