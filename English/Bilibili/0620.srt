1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,540
Let!

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,540
First service.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,440
The net again.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,140
Hey, hey. Wasn't Minerva Grass' serves said to be accurate?

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,540
Yeah. She rarely shoots a double fault either.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,040
I wonder why she's shooting the ball at the net.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,540
Let!

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,040
First service.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,540
All she's doing is touching the net.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,340
Yep. I wonder if she's not in very good condition.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,140
No, her form's how it should be,

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,840
so she should be shooting where she's aiming.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,740
Then, why?

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,340
What's the matter, Minerva?

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,640
Just what are you doing?

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,840
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,340
You must be true to yourself.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,240
The message from the Grass Court Queen,

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,440
will it reach the apprentice of Holmes?

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,340
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:54,449
An eerie coded message awaits us when we arrive in London.

24
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,249
It was a forewarning of murder

25
00:02:57,249 --> 00:03:00,149
from the vicious criminal on the run, Hades Sabara.

26
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,149
We deciphered the code and figured out

27
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,449
that the crime was going to be committed

28
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,349
at the Wimbledon Center Court.

29
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,949
On Baker Street, Ran happened to run into

30
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,649
and get acquainted to a world famous number 1 ranking tennis player

31
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,149
named Minerva Grass,

32
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,649
who plays in the finals of the ladies' single competition.

33
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,549
Although we rushed over to the Wimbledon,

34
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:26,949
we couldn't get into the Center Court

35
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,649
because we didn't have tickets.

36
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:32,449
Darn it! You mean there's nothing we can do

37
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,249
but suck our finger and watch?

38
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:42,449
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Grass Court Queen)"

39
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:55,449
Minerva lost the 1st set 0-6!

40
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,049
Of course.

41
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,549
I mean she kept grazing the net, 2 or 3 times

42
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,749
followed by soft serves.

43
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,949
Maybe something's wrong with her serve

44
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,849
that she is only able to make slice serves.

45
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,749
But it's strange.

46
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,849
It's still first service,

47
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,049
so she could've switched to hard serve

48
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,649
until she hits too hard and gets a fault.

49
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,249
But not only has she not double faulted,

50
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:22,049
she hasn't even faulted a single time, why?

51
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,149
It's on the screen!

52
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,249
The spots where Minerva's serves have landed in this match!

53
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,849
It seems that the positions

54
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,549
where her serves grazed the net are also indicated.

55
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:31,849
They're neatly spaced

56
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:35,049
as if she calculated where each serve would land.

57
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,649
Don't tell me that this is...

58
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:42,549
Is there anything different about Minerva than her usual self?

59
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,449
Something different...

60
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,649
You mean like something is wrong with her serves?

61
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,749
No, like if she's doing something she usually doesn't do,

62
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,349
or something she usually does, but isn't doing today.

63
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:55,849
Come to think of it,

64
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,149
it looks like she's not wearing her wristband

65
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,849
on her right hand today.

66
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,149
She said in an interview

67
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,749
that she makes it a point to wear the wristband

68
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:05,749
that was given to her by her father during all of her finals.

69
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:07,949
I wonder if she forgot it today?

70
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,949
Wristband...

71
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,649
Unbelievable!

72
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:25,849
It's the 2nd set,

73
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,949
and Grass hasn't won a single game yet!

74
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,449
That unrivaled Grass Court Queen, Minerva Grass,

75
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,049
what on earth has happened to her?

76
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,249
Oh my...

77
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,749
I guess we're going to have a disappointing get together tonight.

78
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,849
Yep.

79
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,349
How sad, a fan even gave her a cute stuffed doll too, and yet...

80
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,549
I guess I won't be able to give it to her.

81
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:59,249
It's mail from Holmes' apprentice.

82
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,149
Meet me at Murray Mound?

83
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:06,949
What? The culprit is after big sis?

84
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,249
Are you serious?

85
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:11,349
Yeah. She probably found out about it,

86
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,349
and is trying to tell us about it with her serves!

87
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:16,849
But, how did she find out?

88
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,049
Maybe the culprit told her?

89
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:22,549
By sticking a letter or something on the inside of her wristband.

90
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,649
It wouldn't be possible to do anything

91
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,649
with the racket that she always uses,

92
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,049
but it's the wristband that she only uses during the finals,

93
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,949
it wouldn't be difficult for the culprit to stick something in.

94
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,449
Come to think of it,

95
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,749
sis lost her bag at the hotel the other day,

96
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,949
but we found it right away

97
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,449
and she checked the contents of the bag after finding it too!

98
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,949
Then, it was probably put there, back then!

99
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,149
She probably didn't check inside the wristband at that time.

100
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,049
I'll go tell everybody about it, then!

101
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,349
No!

102
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,649
Huh?

103
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:52,849
I have no idea how the culprit is planning to kill your sister.

104
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,849
But he's heinous enough to bomb the hospital

105
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,449
even after the code was deciphered!

106
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,549
If we make the wrong move and cause a fuss,

107
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,649
canceling the match and all,

108
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,349
he may kill your sister at that instant!

109
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,949
Then, just what are we supposed to do?

110
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,949
Are you telling me to just do nothing and watch?

111
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,649
I'm not just going to do nothing.

112
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,249
So, won't you give me your ticket?

113
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,649
I'll go into the Center Court in your place,

114
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,749
find the culprit and protect your sister no matter what it takes!

115
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:21,849
What? You're going, Conan?

116
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,049
Wouldn't it be better if I go?

117
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,849
Not you, Pops!

118
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,349
Because the culprit may know

119
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,349
that you're a famous detective from Japan.

120
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:36,849
I may be able to catch the culprit off guard since I'm a child!

121
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,249
Okay, I'll give you my ticket.

122
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:43,249
But if I don't go back, mother and Ales may worry.

123
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,449
It'll be okay if you mail Ales and tell him

124
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,249
that you'll wait outside

125
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,749
because you don't want to watch Minerva lose!

126
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:54,449
But, how on earth do you expect to find the culprit inside?

127
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,949
After all, it seems like the culprit, Hades

128
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,849
has been changing his face repeatedly!

129
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,749
I mean as to that, I'll just do what you always do, Pops!

130
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,249
It's the spirit that counts, the spirit!

131
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,949
Sp... Spirit.

132
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:05,949
Conan!

133
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,449
You don't have to go out of your way to nab the culprit,

134
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,949
but make sure that you protect Minerva no matter what it takes!

135
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,449
Because I have something that I have to tell her!

136
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,349
Okay, I got it!

137
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:30,449
Shout... scream... make more noise!

138
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,549
The more noise you make,

139
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,849
the more impact there'll be of the fearful silence that will follow.

140
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,749
A little longer...

141
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,649
Soon, mother...

142
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:46,749
Let!

143
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,549
First service.

144
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,849
Just as I thought.

145
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,949
The thing that she's etching on the court is...

146
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,149
Braille!

147
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,949
She's trying to make Braille letters

148
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:59,249
by dropping her serves at the appropriate locations

149
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,249
so that the culprit won't notice.

150
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,749
The Braille that she learned for her mother

151
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:05,849
whose vision is disabled.

152
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,349
A Braille cell expresses a letter by etching dots

153
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:11,749
in the six positions arranged in a 2 X 3 rectangle.

154
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,249
She hit the net repeatedly with her serves

155
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,949
because in order to etch on the bottom row,

156
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:17,049
she needs to let the ball graze the net

157
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,249
or the ball won't drop where it should.

158
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:20,349
And depending on the letter,

159
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:22,149
she will need to hit a lot of serves to position

160
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,849
as many as five dots in the correct position.

161
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:29,649
If so, the first serve as viewed from her side

162
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:30,849
would be "H".

163
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:32,849
Next, "E".

164
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:35,149
Next, "L".

165
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,549
The fourth, "P".

166
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,449
Connected...

167
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,349
The word "Help" is spelled!

168
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:48,049
She was seeking someone who could read this to help her.

169
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,049
Let!

170
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,049
First service.

171
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,449
Until her service game is up,

172
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,649
she's repeatedly hitting the ball to spell out "Help"

173
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,449
until her service time is over.

174
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,949
Now, what I want to know is

175
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,549
what message did Hades relay to her.

176
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,649
Just as I thought,

177
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,649
there was a paper stuck inside her wristband,

178
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,949
but I can't see at all what's written.

179
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,249
Darn it!

180
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:22,749
I'd like to relay to her in some way that I'm on her side.

181
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,549
But how can I relay it to her

182
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,449
without causing a commotion during the match?

183
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,249
Come on, Minerva!

184
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:30,649
Come on!

185
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:36,049
Come on, Minerva...

186
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,749
Thank you.

187
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:44,549
Yes.

188
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,749
If you really exist in this world,

189
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:51,449
you would appear gallantly and help me.

190
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,449
But of course, you're nothing more than a character on paper.

191
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,649
There's no way that someone like you would exist in this world.

192
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,449
Yes, a person like Sherlock Holmes...

193
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,749
Minerva!

194
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,749
I'll help you!

195
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,349
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

196
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:16,349
Holmes' apprentice?

197
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,149
Conan!

198
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,549
That idiot!

199
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,549
What on earth is he doing?

200
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,549
What a laugh that such a brat is Holmes' apprentice.

201
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,349
He's wearing glasses and short,

202
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:36,249
but really sharp and brainy apprentice of Holmes!

203
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,849
He says he's going to help me...

204
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,849
Does that mean he was able to read my message?

205
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,949
Oh, you can help me? When you're so small?

206
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,649
Of course.

207
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,649
Thank you.

208
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:04,349
Then, I'm counting on you.

209
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,349
Apprentice of Holmes'.

210
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:23,554
Thank you.

211
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:33,254
The last letter are made of four dots.

212
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,054
She shot three times so what remains

213
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,854
is the one beyond in the right corner.

214
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:41,754
That's the only place left.

215
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:49,054
Out!

216
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:51,354
15-40.

217
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,454
Minerva scored a point!

218
00:12:55,454 --> 00:13:00,254
But I wonder what happened to her opponent, Baur?

219
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:01,454
Yeah.

220
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:04,454
I guess she was taken aback when Minerva shot back.

221
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:06,954
It was a slice serve and yet...

222
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,654
It's no wonder that she's taken aback.

223
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:12,354
The Braille Minerva's forming now is not the

224
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:16,654
H, E, L or P that she was repeatedly hitting till now.

225
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:20,054
It's a "G".

226
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:23,454
Since she's starting to form letters that she didn't form before,

227
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:26,254
it's most likely that what she's going to start doing from now is

228
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,554
to let us know what the message that she received was.

229
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,654
Holmes' apprentice...

230
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:35,754
If I'm not mistaken, Apollo told me you're a boy from Japan.

231
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,454
If you call yourself the apprentice

232
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:40,154
of the famous detective that I adore and respect...

233
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,754
Read it like it should be read, okay?

234
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:43,954
The next letter is,

235
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:47,154
the only one out of all the 26 letters of the alphabet...

236
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,354
that can be etched

237
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:54,254
by one dot in Braille!

238
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,554
Yes!

239
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:07,254
Service A!

240
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:08,854
She made it land to the upper left,

241
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,354
so this is literally the Braille for "A".

242
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:14,654
Connecting it with the previous one, we have "G" and "A".

243
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,054
So, what's next?

244
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:22,054
She's changing her serve patterns.

245
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:24,654
I see. She's finally getting serious.

246
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:33,354
Fault!

247
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,854
She missed her serve for the first time.

248
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:37,954
And really off too.

249
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:41,154
Which means that, this is probably where the letter cuts off.

250
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:51,354
"G" is followed by A, M, E.

251
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:54,054
So the first word is "Game"!

252
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:00,854
Let!

253
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,354
Second service.

254
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:05,254
She's got amazing concentration.

255
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:11,854
She accurately changed the angle of her serves that hit the net

256
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:13,554
in order to place each ball in the correct six spots

257
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,954
to represent letters in Braille.

258
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,254
Just as would be expected of the Grass Court Queen.

259
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,354
She can place her serves wherever she wants.

260
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,054
Deuce!

261
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:29,954
And Minerva had the advantage.

262
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:31,954
Deuce again.

263
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:34,454
This is her sixth time.

264
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:35,954
She's doing it deliberately.

265
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:37,254
She's playing deuces on purpose

266
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:38,754
in order to extend the game

267
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,854
and form more Braille letters.

268
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:46,554
The words she formed till now are...

269
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:50,554
Game, Set, Death, M.

270
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:55,854
When the game ends, M will die?

271
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:00,654
Advantage, Ms. Grass!

272
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:03,054
The Braille just now is an "O".

273
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:08,254
After "Death" the letters "M" and "O" follow, which means...

274
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:09,654
No...

275
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,554
The game goes to Ms. Grass!

276
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:19,154
The score now is 3-1, with Baur in the lead.

277
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:22,354
If the game ends, the message ends here too.

278
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:25,054
And the Braille that she just shot was "M".

279
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,354
Put together, it spells "Mom".

280
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,054
Mother.

281
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:33,054
The one that Hades is after is not Minerva.

282
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,354
But, rather her mother.

283
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:41,554
Come to think of it, Ran said...

284
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:45,254
that Minerva lost at last year's French Open,

285
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,454
which was the only time her mother couldn't come to support her.

286
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,654
If Hades had placed a large debt on Minerva's win

287
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:53,154
at that championship game...

288
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:54,454
If he were to wrongfully have held a grudge against her mother

289
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:57,154
thinking that the defeat was due to her mother not coming...

290
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:59,254
It makes sense that he would direct his murderous intent

291
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,854
towards her mother.

292
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,754
But how is he planning to kill her?

293
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,854
Is he nearby?

294
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:12,154
She received a large stuffed doll for big sis from somebody!

295
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,554
It couldn't be...

296
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,254
That stuffed doll that her mother is carrying...

297
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,254
That's right.

298
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:23,254
Hold it tight and don't let go.

299
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:26,654
Because it's the fireworks that will help me celebrate

300
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,854
the end of my revenge.

301
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,354
What? A bomb?

302
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,854
What?

303
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,254
What was that?

304
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:42,054
Is there a bomb inside that stuffed doll?

305
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:43,054
Yeah.

306
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:46,754
Hades is probably planning to kill your mother

307
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:48,654
by blowing it up when the game ends!

308
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:52,054
I'll call mom and tell her to pretend she's going to the ladies room,

309
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,454
and to get out of her seat!

310
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:56,054
No! If you make any suspicious moves,

311
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,354
he may think that we figured everything out,

312
00:17:57,354 --> 00:18:00,954
and push a remote control switch to set off the bomb!

313
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,754
Your mother may be spared,

314
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:07,454
but the crowd of people in the surroundings may get involved.

315
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,054
It'll be one of the worst disasters since the start of Wimbledon!

316
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,954
No...

317
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:13,454
So, there's no other way than to find Hades

318
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:16,654
who is among the people here in the Center Court

319
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,654
and capturing him!

320
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:22,254
But, can you find him?

321
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:27,154
Your mother and Ales weren't in the family box,

322
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:28,654
but do they always sit in that general admission seat there?

323
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:31,454
Yep. Mom said in a magazine interview

324
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:33,054
that she doesn't like to be taken by the TV cameras

325
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:38,654
so she prefers to sit in the general seat under the shade.

326
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,354
In the shade?

327
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,954
If so, Hades may be on the other side

328
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,654
where the sun is shining, then.

329
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,254
Huh? Why?

330
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,554
The video!

331
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:50,154
He video tapes the moments of his crimes each time,

332
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:52,554
and sends them to the police.

333
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:55,354
If he read that magazine interview,

334
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:58,154
it is most likely that he would be sitting right opposite of her,

335
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,754
so that he can have a good shot of the moment of the blast!

336
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:03,554
If so, if we look for a guy with a video camera

337
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,754
sitting on that side of the bleachers...

338
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:08,154
No, there are a lot of them.

339
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,154
We've got to narrow it down to one person.

340
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:12,554
Then... Then, how?

341
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:15,654
Right. How do we find him?

342
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,354
Just how, from among the 15,000 spectators here!

343
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,754
Hey, what's with this cheering?

344
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:26,154
The spectators are coming out to the corridor!

345
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:28,554
Don't tell me that the game ended?

346
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,854
Not yet.

347
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:32,354
The match just entered the tie-break

348
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:35,454
because sis tied, 6-all!

349
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,954
The spectators are probably making a fuss

350
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:39,654
because of the rain.

351
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:41,554
They're suspending the game by 30 minutes,

352
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:43,254
and the spectators are noisy

353
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:45,754
because the roof of the Center Court is closing.

354
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:48,354
Then, isn't your mother going to leave her seat

355
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,854
until the roof closes?

356
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,854
She won't. She has an umbrella besides.

357
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:55,354
Mother... When she lost her vision

358
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:59,054
and couldn't make it to the French Open and sis lost...

359
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:00,754
She really regretted what happened.

360
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:01,954
And since then, she always says that

361
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:04,654
she will never leave her seat until the match ends.

362
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:11,654
When the roof closes,

363
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:12,654
the cheers echo throughout this place,

364
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:15,054
-and it kind of feels strange. -Yes.

365
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,654
But I wonder what happened to Apollo?

366
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,654
When Minerva is competing in such a great match.

367
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,354
True.

368
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:29,154
I'll explain the details later,

369
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:31,154
so don't move from your seat!

370
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:32,854
Apollo.

371
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:34,354
What on earth is going on?

372
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:37,854
Oh, no!

373
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:39,854
The spectators who evacuated to the corridors

374
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,054
are beginning to go back inside.

375
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:43,454
The game's going to resume.

376
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:47,454
If Minerva loses this tie break, the game ends.

377
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,754
Hades will push the switch for the bomb!

378
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:54,454
I've got to find him somehow by then,

379
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,954
but I don't even know what he looks like.

380
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:59,054
How do I look for him?

381
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:05,054
Apollo! Did you text mail Ales like I told you to?

382
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:09,554
Yep. And this may not be relevant,

383
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:12,354
but I've heard about how sis finds the seat

384
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,054
that mom is sitting in during her matches.

385
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,054
I always wondered how,

386
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:18,554
although sis was never told where mom would be sitting,

387
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,554
she always managed to call out to mother

388
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:22,154
after she won a match.

389
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,954
And? How does she do it?

390
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:28,354
She said she lobs the ball really high during the match.

391
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,754
Too high, I should add.

392
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:34,754
She never told me how she found mom, though.

393
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:37,454
She lobs the ball really high, too high...

394
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:46,854
The Queen appears again.

395
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:49,554
Struggle along as much as you can

396
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:51,254
to prolong every second your mother

397
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,854
gets to live as much as possible.

398
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,854
If I lose this tie break,

399
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,654
mother will...

400
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:07,654
Come on, Minerva!

401
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,754
Don't give up the fight!

402
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:15,154
Even though she has a championship point!

403
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:17,954
Hang in there, win the match!

404
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:19,854
Hang in?

405
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:23,254
Grass Court Queen.

406
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:25,154
Can you do it?

407
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,954
Okay!

408
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:34,654
Now, our game is on.

409
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,154
Hades!

410
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:00,054
"Next Episode" -If the opponent scores the next point,

411
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:02,054
Minerva loses...

412
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,554
Big sis.

413
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:06,354
So, you're at the end of your rope.

414
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:09,554
I'll show you... the Grass Court.

415
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:12,354
Queen, Minerva Grass' real power!

416
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:15,554
Show yourself, Hades!

417
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:21,754
May this reach you! Please!

418
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,154
Next Conan,

419
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:28,154
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Zero is Start)"

420
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:31,423
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:33,523
"The lady wearing sunglasses"

422
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,623
It's finally the last episode of the London edition!

423
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,923
I don't want to go home yet!
