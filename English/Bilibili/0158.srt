1
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.066
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.966
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.666
The stage for today's case is the Loop Line.

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.666
There is no end of the line for either the train or the case.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.266
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.366
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.566
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:58.104
"The Loop Line of Silence"

9
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.504
"Second Street Station"

10
00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.804
We missed the train didn't we?

11
00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:15.904
Hey.

12
00:02:15.904 --> 00:02:18.904
Wait. For goodness sake...

13
00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:20.604
Good grief.

14
00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.304
This old man has some serious issues.

15
00:02:23.304 --> 00:02:25.504
We just finished a job,

16
00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:28.204
at least let me have a beer.

17
00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:30.004
Oh big deal.

18
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.904
The job was delivering some papers the client forgot, that's all.

19
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.604
On top of that, since its Sunday, no one was in the office.

20
00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:42.004
That hits the spot, delicious!

21
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:45.004
The train sure is empty, isn't it, Conan?

22
00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:48.204
Probably because it's a Sunday night.

23
00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:49.904
This is the business district.

24
00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:52.504
I am sure it's usually busy on workdays.

25
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.904
Today sure wear me out.

26
00:02:57.904 --> 00:03:00.704
Sorry, it's all my fault.

27
00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:02.804
You really are a klutz.

28
00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:06.204
Kiyomi who started a year before you was a fast learner.

29
00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:09.204
"Seiji Kurata" -By the way, Kiyomi sure rushed home,

30
00:03:09.204 --> 00:03:11.004
I wonder what she had to do,

31
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:12.604
"Shizuka Kawai" -She probably had a date.

32
00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:14.604
After all, Sunday's a day off.

33
00:03:14.604 --> 00:03:16.404
And if it weren't for someone I know,

34
00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.404
we wouldn't have had to work today either.

35
00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:21.104
"Yukiko Mori" -I am really sorry.

36
00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:23.404
I promise to make it up to you soon.

37
00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:25.604
That's what you always say.

38
00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:27.904
Enough, don't be so hard on her.

39
00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:30.904
Yukiko didn't do it on purpose.

40
00:03:30.904 --> 00:03:34.204
There you go again, spoiling the newcomer.

41
00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:36.904
That's why I always look like the mean one.

42
00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:38.404
You know that's not true.

43
00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:40.904
Okay... calm down you two.

44
00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:48.504
The train will be pulling into track 2 momentarily,

45
00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:51.704
-please wait behind the yellow line. -I am going to go buy some juice.

46
00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:54.304
Come back, the train is coming.

47
00:03:54.304 --> 00:03:57.804
Don't worry. Get on without me.

48
00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.304
Good grief.

49
00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:11.604
Conan, come on, hurry.

50
00:04:11.604 --> 00:04:12.704
Alright.

51
00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:26.604
I wonder if Yukiko got on okay.

52
00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:29.304
That girls so irresponsible sometimes.

53
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.704
-Let's go take a look. -Okay.

54
00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:37.804
Pretend we don't know him.

55
00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:47.204
What're you doing, Yukiko?

56
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:50.604
Seiji, I made it just in time.

57
00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:52.204
I spilled some.

58
00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:53.604
Clumsy.

59
00:04:57.504 --> 00:05:01.004
-You know, Yukiko... -Isn't that... Kiyomi?

60
00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:04.104
It is.

61
00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:07.104
She left hours ago, what's she doing here?

62
00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:10.104
She's fast asleep.

63
00:05:10.104 --> 00:05:11.904
You mean she's been sitting here

64
00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:13.904
and rode the train for a whole lap?

65
00:05:13.904 --> 00:05:16.504
She must've been exhausted.

66
00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:19.904
Kiyomi, wake up.

67
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:21.304
Kiyomi.

68
00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:22.304
Hey!

69
00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:32.504
What was that?

70
00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.304
Excuse me.

71
00:05:42.604 --> 00:05:45.604
There's no pulse, she's dead.

72
00:05:46.604 --> 00:05:49.504
Excuse me, are you her friends?

73
00:05:49.504 --> 00:05:51.904
Yes, we're...

74
00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.204
Who are you?

75
00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:55.104
Who, me?

76
00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.104
I am Kogoro Mouri, private investigator.

77
00:05:58.104 --> 00:06:01.304
You mean Kogoro Mouri... the famous...

78
00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:03.804
That's right in the flesh.

79
00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:09.704
It looks like southing pricked her ear lobe.

80
00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:11.604
And her ear's a little black,

81
00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:15.004
like its been pressed back.

82
00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:17.404
Excuse me, sir, her ears...

83
00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:19.204
You keep quiet!

84
00:06:21.504 --> 00:06:23.204
The color of the ears...

85
00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:25.704
It looks like a reaction to poison.

86
00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:28.304
This may be a murder.

87
00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.704
Murder?

88
00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:31.304
Ran, get the conductor

89
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:32.704
and call the police too.

90
00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:33.704
Okay.

91
00:06:36.704 --> 00:06:39.004
What is this mark?

92
00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:41.204
Everyone please stand back.

93
00:06:41.204 --> 00:06:44.404
I don't want anyone in here until the police arrive.

94
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.104
That means you kids too...

95
00:06:48.804 --> 00:06:49.804
Kiyomi.

96
00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:52.104
Please don't touch the body.

97
00:06:52.104 --> 00:06:53.604
I am sorry.

98
00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:00.604
Inspector Megure.

99
00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:04.404
I took down the names and addresses of all the passengers we let off.

100
00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:08.304
The estimated tine of death is approximately 6:30 pm.

101
00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:09.704
Yes, I see.

102
00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:14.004
The body was discovered past 7:30 pm.

103
00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:16.104
It takes 1 hour and 10 minutes

104
00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:18.504
for this loop line to complete one lap so.

105
00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:23.004
So I guess there's no mistake, she died in the train.

106
00:07:23.004 --> 00:07:27.304
Which means the victim died shortly after boarding the train.

107
00:07:27.304 --> 00:07:31.204
The train completed one lap and came back to this station.

108
00:07:32.204 --> 00:07:33.904
What is the cause of death?

109
00:07:33.904 --> 00:07:36.704
It appears she was pricked on the earlobe

110
00:07:36.704 --> 00:07:38.604
with a pin-like object coated with a fast acting poison.

111
00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:42.504
There are no other wounds or signs of a struggle.

112
00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:48.204
This is the victims shoulder bag.

113
00:07:49.604 --> 00:07:52.004
What are you doing?

114
00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:54.404
Sorry.

115
00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:58.704
Sir, wasn't that left open?

116
00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:01.404
Just be quiet.

117
00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:02.904
Just a second.

118
00:08:02.904 --> 00:08:04.404
What you're saying is,

119
00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:08.804
there's a possibility the killer took something out of victims bag.

120
00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:10.904
Inspector, her wallets here.

121
00:08:10.904 --> 00:08:13.404
Nothing seems to have been taken out.

122
00:08:13.404 --> 00:08:16.804
We will let her three friends confirm the contents.

123
00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:18.904
They may notice something.

124
00:08:18.904 --> 00:08:19.904
Yes.

125
00:08:19.904 --> 00:08:21.604
Officer Takagi.

126
00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:23.304
There's more over there.

127
00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:25.304
You're right.

128
00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:26.904
Thanks, Conan.

129
00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:31.604
I like you to confirm these items.

130
00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:33.504
Where's your other friend?

131
00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:38.404
It seen the shock of it is hitting her only now.

132
00:08:38.404 --> 00:08:39.704
I don't blame her.

133
00:08:39.704 --> 00:08:43.504
I will let you two take care of the identification here.

134
00:08:43.504 --> 00:08:45.404
Conan don't.

135
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.904
Come on, let's wait over there.

136
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:49.804
-But, I... -Enough.

137
00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:58.404
How are you feeling?

138
00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.704
Fine, thank you.

139
00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:04.604
I don't remember what Kiyomi always carried with her.

140
00:09:04.604 --> 00:09:07.304
But Seiji might know.

141
00:09:07.304 --> 00:09:08.904
He'd been asking her for a date for the longest time

142
00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:11.304
and he gave her a lot of presents.

143
00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:12.704
Presents?

144
00:09:12.704 --> 00:09:15.704
Were you dating the victim?

145
00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:18.204
No. She kept turning me down.

146
00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:19.304
I see.

147
00:09:19.304 --> 00:09:23.504
That means you had a good motives, revenge.

148
00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:25.204
I'd never.

149
00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:27.404
Shizuka. How could you say such a thing.

150
00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:29.404
Now...

151
00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:32.504
Usually we get along very well.

152
00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:34.604
But because of what happened today...

153
00:09:38.604 --> 00:09:42.304
So, after work, you all went for dinner

154
00:09:42.304 --> 00:09:46.504
but Miss Hashimoto alone left for home?

155
00:09:46.504 --> 00:09:48.004
Yes, that's right.

156
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:51.404
Do you usually work on Sundays?

157
00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:55.004
Our job is advertising design,

158
00:09:55.004 --> 00:09:57.104
but I made a mistake yesterday

159
00:09:57.104 --> 00:09:59.404
and we had to give up our Sunday to finish up.

160
00:10:00.404 --> 00:10:03.804
When is the last time you saw her?

161
00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:05.304
It was at the Second Street Station.

162
00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:07.204
We all walked her to the station.

163
00:10:07.204 --> 00:10:10.504
How did she seem at that time?

164
00:10:10.504 --> 00:10:12.504
We parted at the ticket gate

165
00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:15.204
but she was her usual self.

166
00:10:15.204 --> 00:10:18.804
And that was around 6:30 pm?

167
00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:22.404
The three of you were together

168
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:25.104
until discovering the body, correct?

169
00:10:25.104 --> 00:10:26.504
-Yes. -Yes...

170
00:10:26.504 --> 00:10:30.704
Did Kiyomi have any enemies?

171
00:10:30.704 --> 00:10:35.204
Seiji, you just told us she kept turning you down

172
00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:36.504
you are the most likely.

173
00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:38.704
You, you've got to be kidding.

174
00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:39.704
I'm not the only one.

175
00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:44.104
Yukiko, you hated her for stealing your boyfriend, didn't you?

176
00:10:44.104 --> 00:10:46.104
No, I didn't.

177
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:49.904
And Shizuka, didn't you tell me she stole your design?

178
00:10:49.904 --> 00:10:52.504
What're you trying to say?

179
00:10:52.504 --> 00:10:57.304
-I see, so all of you had motives. -Don't be hasty, Mouri.

180
00:10:57.304 --> 00:11:00.704
The estimated time of her death is somewhere around 6:30 pm.

181
00:11:00.704 --> 00:11:03.304
That's about the time we left her at the station.

182
00:11:03.304 --> 00:11:06.304
Yes, right after you left.

183
00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:10.304
Were you three really together the whole time?

184
00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.704
Yes, we had dinner together.

185
00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:14.304
It's a place we always go to

186
00:11:14.304 --> 00:11:17.104
so you can verify it if you want.

187
00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:19.204
Since they all have alibis,

188
00:11:19.204 --> 00:11:21.704
I am sure we can exclude then from our list of suspects.

189
00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:24.904
I am pretty sure it was a random killing by a crazed person.

190
00:11:24.904 --> 00:11:28.104
We have the names and addresses of the passengers we let off,

191
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:31.904
I just hope the killers among them.

192
00:11:31.904 --> 00:11:35.604
However, since her bag was found open,

193
00:11:35.604 --> 00:11:38.304
I'd like to check through your possessions too.

194
00:11:38.304 --> 00:11:42.304
Why did the killer kill her in the train?

195
00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:45.104
And why stab her in the ears of all.

196
00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:48.004
And her ears were laid flat as if they had been pressed.

197
00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:52.204
It's too strange to be a random killing.

198
00:11:52.204 --> 00:11:59.204
So, you're saying you know no reason for anyone hating her.

199
00:12:04.404 --> 00:12:07.804
An MD player and a headphone with a bent arm.

200
00:12:11.204 --> 00:12:14.504
Every disc has a label on it.

201
00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:24.504
Index labels for the MD.

202
00:12:25.504 --> 00:12:26.704
What's this?

203
00:12:28.404 --> 00:12:31.004
Strange.

204
00:12:31.004 --> 00:12:33.904
None of them have a front label.

205
00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:40.904
This color...

206
00:12:40.904 --> 00:12:42.204
Yes, that's it.

207
00:12:43.504 --> 00:12:46.204
Something was bothering me,

208
00:12:46.204 --> 00:12:47.504
now I know what it was.

209
00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:52.604
Yes, it would be possible to kill Kiyomi

210
00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:57.004
and have an alibi if one were to use that method.

211
00:12:57.004 --> 00:13:00.204
There's no mistake that person is the killer.

212
00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:10.193
If any deduction is correct,

213
00:13:10.193 --> 00:13:12.193
that person is the killer,

214
00:13:12.193 --> 00:13:14.293
but I don't have enough proof.

215
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:17.593
Aren't you through searching our things yet?

216
00:13:17.593 --> 00:13:19.993
I'm sure they're almost done.

217
00:13:19.993 --> 00:13:24.193
He have no reason to steal something out of Kiyoumi's bag.

218
00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:26.293
You people have a lot of nerve.

219
00:13:26.293 --> 00:13:28.293
That's enough, Shizuka.

220
00:13:28.293 --> 00:13:30.193
They're just doing their job

221
00:13:31.793 --> 00:13:32.893
What's that...

222
00:13:39.393 --> 00:13:41.493
What're you doing?

223
00:13:41.493 --> 00:13:42.793
I am sorry.

224
00:13:42.793 --> 00:13:45.193
Conan, look what you did!

225
00:13:45.193 --> 00:13:47.093
I am sorry, Seiji.

226
00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.193
I am really very sorry.

227
00:13:49.193 --> 00:13:50.693
No problem, forget it.

228
00:13:50.693 --> 00:13:52.393
I perspire a lot

229
00:13:52.393 --> 00:13:54.793
so I always carry an extra shirt.

230
00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:59.293
Inspector, would it be alright if I got a shirt from my things?

231
00:13:59.293 --> 00:14:00.493
I guess it's okay.

232
00:14:00.493 --> 00:14:02.193
Hey! Takagi!

233
00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:05.393
That was very naughty, you have to behave.

234
00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:07.993
I am going to apologize to him.

235
00:14:10.693 --> 00:14:15.293
Excuse me, Kiyomi and the three of you were good friends, weren't you?

236
00:14:15.293 --> 00:14:17.493
Sure, I got a little excited back there

237
00:14:17.493 --> 00:14:20.493
and made it sound like we all hated her

238
00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:23.293
but we weren't really on bad terms,

239
00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:25.193
we were all good friends.

240
00:14:25.193 --> 00:14:26.893
Of course you were.

241
00:14:26.893 --> 00:14:28.493
Take today for example,

242
00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.993
Yukiko dropped Kiyomi's MD player and it broke.

243
00:14:31.993 --> 00:14:34.693
But Kiyomi didn't even get mad.

244
00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:36.293
She forgave Yukiko.

245
00:14:37.693 --> 00:14:41.193
Kiyomi and Yukiko were especially close,

246
00:14:41.193 --> 00:14:44.593
I thought they'd fight after she stole Yukiko's boyfriend but...

247
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.193
You're too young to understand.

248
00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:52.493
Didn't Kiyomi get on at the same Second Street Station like us?

249
00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:53.793
That's right.

250
00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:57.893
But she was sitting in the second car wasn't she?

251
00:14:57.893 --> 00:15:00.993
People usually get on the car closest to the ticket gate.

252
00:15:00.993 --> 00:15:05.393
It seems strange to deliberately walk to another car further away.

253
00:15:05.393 --> 00:15:07.493
Not really, when the train stops at Kiyomi's stop

254
00:15:07.493 --> 00:15:11.593
the ticket gate is right in front if you're in the second car.

255
00:15:11.593 --> 00:15:13.493
That's why whenever we take the same train,

256
00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:16.193
we have to walk to the second car.

257
00:15:17.893 --> 00:15:23.393
Which means they knew she'd be in the second car.

258
00:15:23.393 --> 00:15:26.593
I've got it, I've solved everything.

259
00:15:29.493 --> 00:15:32.893
Inspector! We're done looking through all their possessions.

260
00:15:32.893 --> 00:15:36.693
I apologize for the long wait.

261
00:15:36.693 --> 00:15:38.993
You may all leave now.

262
00:15:40.193 --> 00:15:41.693
If something comes up,

263
00:15:41.693 --> 00:15:45.893
I'd appreciate it if you'd give us your cooperation.

264
00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:52.693
Here we go again.

265
00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:57.693
We can't have you leave just yet.

266
00:15:57.693 --> 00:15:59.493
What's the matter, Mouri...

267
00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:01.393
That pose!

268
00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.693
This was no random killing.

269
00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:06.293
The killer is one of you three.

270
00:16:07.293 --> 00:16:08.893
One of us?

271
00:16:08.893 --> 00:16:12.693
And the murder weapon is right among your things.

272
00:16:12.693 --> 00:16:14.993
But Mouri...

273
00:16:14.993 --> 00:16:17.193
We all have alibis, remember.

274
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:19.493
We're having dinner.

275
00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:24.093
But it was still possible to kill her.

276
00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:28.193
Firstly, the killer knew Kiyomi would leave early

277
00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:30.193
so while seeing her off at the station,

278
00:16:30.193 --> 00:16:33.493
the killer checked the schedule of the train she would take

279
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.493
and calculated how long it would take

280
00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:37.393
for it to return carrying Kiyomi's body.

281
00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.593
After that, all the killer had to do was go to dinner,

282
00:16:40.593 --> 00:16:42.193
creating an alibi then retrieve the murder weapon

283
00:16:42.193 --> 00:16:44.793
from the body when it returned.

284
00:16:44.793 --> 00:16:46.093
Weapon?

285
00:16:46.093 --> 00:16:48.293
What kind of weapon?

286
00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:50.393
Don't you know?

287
00:16:50.393 --> 00:16:55.393
Something that would appear natural when put onto the ears.

288
00:16:59.493 --> 00:17:00.793
Yes, I see!

289
00:17:00.793 --> 00:17:02.793
If you planted a poisoned needle in the headphone...

290
00:17:02.793 --> 00:17:04.693
Right.

291
00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:08.793
Which means the killer is Yukiko Mori.

292
00:17:08.793 --> 00:17:10.293
Yes, you.

293
00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:15.193
You broke Kiyomi's MD player

294
00:17:15.193 --> 00:17:20.293
and lent her yours with the poisoned needle in it.

295
00:17:20.293 --> 00:17:22.993
And pretending to buy more juice,

296
00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:26.993
you boarded the front car and retrieved the weapon.

297
00:17:27.993 --> 00:17:33.393
You knew Kiyomi always sat in the second car from the front.

298
00:17:33.393 --> 00:17:36.993
It doesn't take long to get the weapon

299
00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:40.093
since you know where she'd be.

300
00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:43.793
But the cord was caught on her shoulder,

301
00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:47.693
you pulled on it too hard and the headphone got bent.

302
00:17:49.393 --> 00:17:52.193
I see, it certainly is bent.

303
00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:56.693
The mark from the cord was found on her arm.

304
00:17:56.693 --> 00:18:01.393
And her ears were laid back against her head

305
00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:04.093
proving she had a headphone on.

306
00:18:04.093 --> 00:18:06.393
I just went to buy some juice.

307
00:18:06.393 --> 00:18:08.493
I didn't do what you just said.

308
00:18:08.493 --> 00:18:09.993
Your friends body was in front of you,

309
00:18:09.993 --> 00:18:11.893
you should have been in shock.

310
00:18:11.893 --> 00:18:16.393
But for some reason, you fixed the collar on her dress.

311
00:18:16.393 --> 00:18:19.493
I am sure it was because when the cord got caught,

312
00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:22.493
it made the collar stand.

313
00:18:22.493 --> 00:18:25.593
Actually you intended to retrieve the weapon

314
00:18:25.593 --> 00:18:28.893
and leave the body.

315
00:18:28.893 --> 00:18:33.793
But your friends came looking for you from the other car.

316
00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:38.193
So you had to pretend you discovered the body with the other two

317
00:18:38.193 --> 00:18:40.793
and play out your role.

318
00:18:40.793 --> 00:18:45.193
So, the victim pricked her own ears with the poisoned needle

319
00:18:45.193 --> 00:18:48.093
but why kill her in the train of all places?

320
00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:53.193
There aren't too many passengers on this line on Sundays.

321
00:18:53.193 --> 00:18:56.293
Very few people get into the second car.

322
00:18:56.293 --> 00:18:58.693
It's the perfect place when you have to retrieve the weapon

323
00:18:58.693 --> 00:19:00.993
after securing an alibi.

324
00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:03.493
I see.

325
00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:04.793
On top of that,

326
00:19:04.793 --> 00:19:07.693
an unspecified number of people go in and out

327
00:19:07.693 --> 00:19:10.393
so it's easier to make it appear a random killing.

328
00:19:10.393 --> 00:19:13.593
All she had to do was make a mistake at work

329
00:19:13.593 --> 00:19:17.593
so they'd all have to go in on a Sunday...

330
00:19:17.593 --> 00:19:20.493
Proof, where's the proof?

331
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:24.693
I don't see anything that looks like a needle

332
00:19:24.693 --> 00:19:29.393
I believe she used that handkerchief to pull it out

333
00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:32.793
there was a piece of sponge stuck on it.

334
00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:35.493
I was sitting here all the time.

335
00:19:35.493 --> 00:19:38.093
Right here with all of you!

336
00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:41.293
Then your things were being checked,

337
00:19:41.293 --> 00:19:44.493
you said you didn't feel well and went off alone.

338
00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:50.693
You mean she had to be alone so she could take the needle out.

339
00:19:50.693 --> 00:19:53.093
May I see your handkerchief?

340
00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:54.093
Alright.

341
00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:57.493
It's no use now, Inspector.

342
00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:59.393
It's a tiny needle.

343
00:19:59.393 --> 00:20:02.193
She's probably already thrown it away somewhere.

344
00:20:02.193 --> 00:20:04.793
Mouri, are you telling me this is all supposition

345
00:20:04.793 --> 00:20:06.793
and you have no proof?

346
00:20:06.793 --> 00:20:10.093
The proof is in that MD player.

347
00:20:10.093 --> 00:20:11.093
What?

348
00:20:11.093 --> 00:20:12.893
If you mean fingerprints, she was a friend,

349
00:20:12.893 --> 00:20:14.693
it's only natural for hers to be on it.

350
00:20:14.693 --> 00:20:16.493
I didn't lend it to her today.

351
00:20:16.493 --> 00:20:21.393
Then will you take the disc out of it?

352
00:20:23.493 --> 00:20:25.193
What's wrong?

353
00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:32.193
Yukiko, thank you, by Kiyomi.

354
00:20:33.593 --> 00:20:35.793
You didn't lend it to her.

355
00:20:35.793 --> 00:20:38.793
You did say that, didn't you?

356
00:20:38.793 --> 00:20:42.093
If you didn't lend it to her

357
00:20:42.093 --> 00:20:46.793
how was she able to write a message dated today

358
00:20:46.793 --> 00:20:50.293
and with the ballpoint pen we've found among her things?

359
00:20:51.493 --> 00:20:52.993
You're right.

360
00:20:52.993 --> 00:20:54.493
The color of these letters

361
00:20:54.493 --> 00:20:58.893
matches the color of the pen found in her bag.

362
00:20:58.893 --> 00:21:03.793
That's right, Kiyomi left you a message.

363
00:21:03.793 --> 00:21:08.493
She never dreamed you were going to kill her.

364
00:21:13.093 --> 00:21:15.093
Kiyomi.

365
00:21:15.093 --> 00:21:18.993
I just couldn't forgive you.

366
00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:22.093
You stole my boyfriend.

367
00:21:22.093 --> 00:21:24.693
Today is his birthday,

368
00:21:24.693 --> 00:21:27.793
I knew she would rush home.

369
00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:31.193
So, that's why you chose today to kill her?

370
00:23:12.993 --> 00:23:16.493
Takagi, did you find out how she got the poison?

371
00:23:16.493 --> 00:23:17.593
Yes.

372
00:23:19.193 --> 00:23:22.593
It's a fast acting alkaloid poison

373
00:23:22.593 --> 00:23:25.293
they use on darts in South America.

374
00:23:25.293 --> 00:23:28.693
She confessed that she bought some when she was abroad a few days ago.

375
00:23:28.693 --> 00:23:31.993
She coated a tiny needle with it.

376
00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:34.393
Poison for darts...

377
00:23:34.393 --> 00:23:37.393
We took so long identifying the poison.

378
00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:40.493
Mouri, if you hadn't figured things out,

379
00:23:40.493 --> 00:23:42.493
this case might have gone solved.

380
00:23:45.093 --> 00:23:47.893
Poison for darts, yes.

381
00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:51.393
Well, I had a feeling that's what it was.

382
00:23:51.393 --> 00:23:54.193
Really, so you figured that out too?

383
00:23:54.193 --> 00:23:55.993
Mouri, you're great!

384
00:23:55.993 --> 00:23:57.393
Give me a break.

385
00:23:57.393 --> 00:24:01.193
You haven't even figured out I've been knocking you out.

386
00:24:03.993 --> 00:24:06.793
"Next Episode" -What? A curse?

387
00:24:12.393 --> 00:24:13.993
Mr. Oda!

388
00:24:15.393 --> 00:24:17.093
This rope...

389
00:24:17.093 --> 00:24:18.993
That can't be!

390
00:24:18.993 --> 00:24:21.693
His legs don't reach the railing?

391
00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:24.793
Yes, this is definitely a suicide.

392
00:24:24.793 --> 00:24:27.993
No, this is a murder!

393
00:24:27.993 --> 00:24:29.593
Next Conan,

394
00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:33.514
"The Terrifying Legend of the Five-story Pagoda (Part 1)"

395
00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:36.995
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:36.995 --> 00:24:38.295
"Rope"

397
00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:41.595
The next episode is Terror of the Five-story Pagoda.
