1
00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:03.391
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.191
After the tears is the "Black Picture"

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.691
Based on the clues that Heiji Hattori presents,

4
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.091
a great chase for the Black Organization begins.

5
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.291
Who is the man in the picture?

6
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.691
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.191
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.191
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:14.743
So hot!

10
00:02:14.743 --> 00:02:16.843
Why is it so hot?

11
00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:19.643
I mean, trying to pick a fight on my beautiful skin or what?

12
00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:23.143
Really, it's almost the end of August and yet.

13
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.143
If I knew it was going to be like this,

14
00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.443
I should've hurried home like Eisuke

15
00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:28.643
and basked in the cool comfort of home.

16
00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:34.843
Huh? Eisuke did?

17
00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.743
Yeah, he does that all the time now.

18
00:02:37.743 --> 00:02:40.443
It's like he disappears when classes are over.

19
00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:42.343
Could it be he likes some girl

20
00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:44.243
who works in a store in the neighborhood or something?

21
00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:45.743
That clumsy kid?

22
00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:48.543
You think he keeps going to visit with some girls?

23
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:49.943
It's true!

24
00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:53.743
No. He probably realized that

25
00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:57.743
the woman is hospitalized in a hospital somewhere

26
00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.643
and looking all over for her.

27
00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:05.943
The woman called Rena Mizunashi,

28
00:03:05.943 --> 00:03:07.843
who still lies unconscious,

29
00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:10.443
a member of the Black Organization.

30
00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:18.743
"The Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 1)"

31
00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:25.343
Since the F.B.I's got her covered,

32
00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:29.143
I don't think he'll be able to find her that easily,

33
00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:32.443
but I still don't know who Eisuke Hondo really is.

34
00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:36.043
Oh, the phone.

35
00:03:36.043 --> 00:03:39.543
The left is for Conan, so the one on the right...

36
00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:41.843
is for Shinichi Kudo.

37
00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:44.943
Ran, I just remembered something,

38
00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:47.243
so I've got to go home!

39
00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:48.443
Okay.

40
00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:54.443
Yes! Hello?

41
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:57.243
Hey, how long do I have to keep ringing?

42
00:03:57.243 --> 00:04:00.043
Hurry up and answer the phone, idiot!

43
00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:02.143
Sorry, Heiji.

44
00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:04.243
I've got my reasons too.

45
00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:05.943
And, did you find out anything?

46
00:04:05.943 --> 00:04:10.143
Yeah, I caught Mr. Ootaki on his day off and had him check for me!

47
00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:12.543
I told him I didn't know what was going on yet!

48
00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:19.143
He checked the name list of the schools in Osaka going back 20 years,

49
00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:23.443
but found no student by the name of Rena Mizunashi!

50
00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:24.543
So, we both took her picture along

51
00:04:24.543 --> 00:04:26.343
and went around the Tsutenkaku area where a woman resembling her

52
00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:30.043
was said to have taken a picture 10 years ago

53
00:04:30.043 --> 00:04:32.643
and asked around.

54
00:04:32.643 --> 00:04:36.543
Although people knew that she is the announcer that's resting work now,

55
00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:39.943
there wasn't anyone who remembered seeing her when she was young.

56
00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:41.243
I see.

57
00:04:41.243 --> 00:04:43.943
Well, that's all we got on her.

58
00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:47.543
When I showed the picture that you forwarded me of Eisuke Hondo...

59
00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:49.143
Bingo!

60
00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:52.043
I ran into a person who said he knew him when he was a kid!

61
00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:54.243
Really?

62
00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:57.843
Yeah, it was at a Okonomiyaki shop near Tsutenkaku.

63
00:04:57.843 --> 00:05:01.843
He seems to have frequented the shop with his father!

64
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.343
Was his "father" a normal looking person?

65
00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:06.943
It seems that he was a reticent guy.

66
00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:10.143
All I found out was that the father's name was "Hondo."

67
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.243
He was called that way.

68
00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:13.443
Called that way?

69
00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:18.043
Right, he seems to have come with his colleagues occasionally too.

70
00:05:18.043 --> 00:05:20.643
It seems that he stopped coming all of a sudden

71
00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:22.043
from several years ago, though.

72
00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:24.043
What kind of "work" did he do?

73
00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:25.443
I don't know.

74
00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:28.243
But the present manager says that

75
00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:30.443
maybe the previous manager would know.

76
00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:33.643
They seemed to have gotten along.

77
00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:37.143
They used be absorbed in talking even after closing time, it seems...

78
00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:39.243
What were they talking about?

79
00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:41.443
You met that manager too, didn't you?

80
00:05:41.443 --> 00:05:43.243
I couldn't if I wanted to

81
00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:45.643
because he's not of this world anymore.

82
00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:47.043
Hey, don't tell me that...

83
00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:49.543
It has something to do with the guys in black, does it?

84
00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:52.643
No, no! He died of an illness. He was sick.

85
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.543
He seems to have had cancer.

86
00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:56.743
He was pretty old too, you see.

87
00:05:56.743 --> 00:05:59.543
Which means, that's as much information you can get?

88
00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:02.443
No, this is where everything starts!

89
00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:06.443
That manager had a grandchild he really favored.

90
00:06:06.443 --> 00:06:11.143
And I was told that he may have told his grandchild everything!

91
00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:12.343
Grandchild...

92
00:06:12.343 --> 00:06:14.543
The grandchild went to a university in Osaka

93
00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:16.043
and lived here for 4 years.

94
00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.043
He used to frequent the shop too.

95
00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:20.943
The grandchild is thought to have met the man you're asking about too.

96
00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:23.543
And, where is he now?

97
00:06:23.543 --> 00:06:26.343
He seems to be running a model shop in Tokyo.

98
00:06:26.343 --> 00:06:28.743
I asked for his address and phone number.

99
00:06:28.743 --> 00:06:31.543
If you're going to go visit him, be careful.

100
00:06:31.543 --> 00:06:35.643
The father of the guy called Eisuke Hondo is no ordinary guy.

101
00:06:35.643 --> 00:06:36.943
Huh?

102
00:06:36.943 --> 00:06:39.043
The colleagues he used to bring to the shop

103
00:06:39.043 --> 00:06:41.443
almost always changed each time he came,

104
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.643
and more than half of them were foreigners.

105
00:06:43.643 --> 00:06:45.943
Moreover, all of them including his father,

106
00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:48.443
seem to have been dressed in black,

107
00:06:48.443 --> 00:06:50.843
as if they came right from a funeral.

108
00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.543
Are you sure about that?

109
00:06:52.543 --> 00:06:54.343
Yeah. In addition,

110
00:06:54.343 --> 00:06:57.543
it seems that they really hated to have their pictures taken.

111
00:06:57.543 --> 00:06:59.843
That's why their faces are unknown.

112
00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:01.943
One more thing, it seems that the name of his father

113
00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.943
used to change each time he came.

114
00:07:03.943 --> 00:07:06.743
Tsubouchi, Ishikawa and Hondo

115
00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:09.143
were just among the many names he used!

116
00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:13.943
I see, and he was reticent because he was on his guard.

117
00:07:13.943 --> 00:07:18.543
Yeah. So if this grandchild met Hondo's father,

118
00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:19.843
it could be that...

119
00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:23.943
The grandchild who knows their faces is probably being watched.

120
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.043
What? You don't need dinner?

121
00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:29.043
Are you at Doc's house?

122
00:07:30.143 --> 00:07:31.643
Okay.

123
00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:33.843
Gosh, that Conan.

124
00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:37.243
By the way, where's dad?

125
00:07:37.243 --> 00:07:41.143
What? You're going to do some checking on Eisuke Hondo?

126
00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:44.243
-From now? -Yeah, right now!

127
00:07:44.243 --> 00:07:46.343
To be exact, I'm going to see a person

128
00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:49.443
who knows Eisuke Hondo's father, that is!

129
00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:52.343
-Are you going to be all right? -I'll be fine.

130
00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:55.543
I already told Ran that I'll be sleeping over at your place too.

131
00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:56.943
That's not what I meant!

132
00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:00.343
That man is connected with the men in black, isn't he?

133
00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:02.243
That's why I'm in a rush!

134
00:08:02.243 --> 00:08:04.443
If I dilly-dally, she may find out about this

135
00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:07.143
and say she wants to come along too.

136
00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:10.743
-She? -The one who's taking a bath now.

137
00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:13.543
Oh, did you call me?

138
00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:15.143
She's already out.

139
00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:20.443
Oh, yes. I was asked by your grandfather when he was still alive

140
00:08:20.443 --> 00:08:23.543
to hand something over to a man he had close relationship with,

141
00:08:23.543 --> 00:08:27.043
who used to frequent the shop.

142
00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:29.743
I have a pretty good idea who that person is,

143
00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:32.643
but I just want to confirm it.

144
00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:36.143
Something about this being a very important thing.

145
00:08:36.143 --> 00:08:39.843
You mean the customer that used to always bring his son along?

146
00:08:41.143 --> 00:08:43.543
Oh, that's right.

147
00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:47.043
Do happen to know his name or the place that he works?

148
00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:50.143
No. After all, I only met him 2 or 3 times myself.

149
00:08:50.143 --> 00:08:53.043
Then, do you remember any characteristic about him?

150
00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:56.343
There are 2 or 3 people that I also have in mind here too.

151
00:08:56.343 --> 00:09:00.243
I can't remember just like that right now.

152
00:09:00.243 --> 00:09:02.743
Would you like to take a look at a picture of that person?

153
00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:05.243
Huh? Do you have his picture?

154
00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:08.443
I heard that he hated to have his picture taken.

155
00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:12.143
Right, but this picture was taken coincidentally.

156
00:09:12.143 --> 00:09:14.843
It seems that his son was playing around with the camera

157
00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:16.243
and took the picture.

158
00:09:16.243 --> 00:09:20.043
May I go over to take a look at the picture now?

159
00:09:20.043 --> 00:09:22.543
Now?

160
00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:24.143
I'm going to close at 7:00 tonight

161
00:09:24.143 --> 00:09:25.843
and going to the sports gym after that,

162
00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:28.343
so by the time I get home, it'll be past 11:00 p.m..

163
00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:31.943
That's okay! I'll be waiting in front of your place.

164
00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:34.343
Oh, well, okay, never mind the gym.

165
00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:35.543
I'll go straight home!

166
00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:36.743
Are you sure?

167
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.743
Yes, I'd like to hear about grandpa too

168
00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:40.043
because it's been such a long time.

169
00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:41.943
Thank you very much.

170
00:09:50.843 --> 00:09:54.843
Strange. It's way past the promised 8:00.

171
00:09:55.843 --> 00:09:59.443
Just as I was told, this is the right place, though.

172
00:09:59.443 --> 00:10:02.343
I'll go check!

173
00:10:02.343 --> 00:10:04.643
Stay here, Ai!

174
00:10:14.543 --> 00:10:17.043
The room number is...

175
00:10:17.043 --> 00:10:19.843
Room 302.

176
00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:22.343
I told you to stay in the car, didn't I?

177
00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:32.843
No one's in.

178
00:10:44.943 --> 00:10:46.743
Strange...

179
00:10:48.343 --> 00:10:49.443
Hey.

180
00:10:49.443 --> 00:10:51.843
-What the? -Doc?

181
00:10:58.643 --> 00:11:03.043
It's amazing you found your way all the way here.

182
00:11:04.543 --> 00:11:06.643
Gramps.

183
00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:31.651
This is a model gun that I sell at my shop.

184
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:37.251
See, take a good look and you can see that the muzzle is sealed.

185
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:40.751
-You're the one who called a while ago, right? -Yes.

186
00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:41.851
Well...

187
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:43.251
"Souhei Nishizato (32)" -I thought if you were grandpa's acquaintance,

188
00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:45.751
"Shopkeeper of a model shop" -you could easily take a joke like this.

189
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:49.151
Grandpa is a gun and suspense freak that's second to none.

190
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:52.951
Whenever I saw him, this is the kind of welcome I got.

191
00:11:52.951 --> 00:11:56.151
Oh. Right, I see.

192
00:11:56.151 --> 00:11:58.651
It was so out of the blue that I inadvertently was surprised.

193
00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:04.551
I see, he waited outside till we came to ring the doorbell

194
00:12:04.551 --> 00:12:07.251
just so he could do this.

195
00:12:07.251 --> 00:12:10.251
Who are those children?

196
00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:13.151
Oh, my grandchildren. They insisted on coming along.

197
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:14.651
Shouldn't I have?

198
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.851
No, it's okay.

199
00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.451
It's really quite messy, but please come in.

200
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.351
Wow, talk about really messy...

201
00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:39.151
The slippers are distorted out of shape.

202
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.451
I'm sorry, but could I use the restroom?

203
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:45.651
Yeah. Here.

204
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:55.551
It sure is hot.

205
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:02.751
It was pretty humid this afternoon too.

206
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:05.451
I guess heat had no way of escaping the room.

207
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:10.051
And, the album I'm sure was on the very top.

208
00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:11.651
Huh, it's not here.

209
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:14.851
I'm sure I put in here.

210
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:21.351
It's wet.

211
00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:23.051
Is it water?

212
00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:30.351
Wet tissue paper...

213
00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:38.251
Don't you have the picture in your computer?

214
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:39.651
Right!

215
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:43.651
I'll get it out now, so hold on.

216
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.751
Huh? The data's gone.

217
00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:51.151
Strange.

218
00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:53.751
I don't remember deleting it,

219
00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:55.351
and yet, why?

220
00:13:58.051 --> 00:14:01.551
I'm sure that somebody snuck into this room.

221
00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:08.551
Moreover, that person was here till just a while ago.

222
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:12.251
What? Somebody suck into this room?

223
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:15.351
And was here till just a while ago... Oh, no.

224
00:14:15.351 --> 00:14:17.551
There is several evidence of it.

225
00:14:17.551 --> 00:14:19.251
Take the slippers for example.

226
00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:20.951
The slippers by the front entrance

227
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:23.551
are thrown out just like that and scattered.

228
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:26.551
Here.

229
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:29.851
When you came back here from work,

230
00:14:29.851 --> 00:14:32.951
only the slippers in the toilet were nicely in place.

231
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:35.051
That means that it is highly probable that somebody besides you

232
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:38.951
used the restroom while you were out, doesn't it?

233
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:43.851
Yeah, but I place the toilet slippers neatly in place sometimes too.

234
00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:45.251
Only "sometimes", right?

235
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.151
Not "always for sure", right?

236
00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:48.651
I guess so.

237
00:14:48.651 --> 00:14:52.251
That's enough to suspect that someone was here, then!

238
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:54.151
The next thing that caught my eye was...

239
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.051
the drops water on the floor.

240
00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:00.351
Water?

241
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:03.851
See?

242
00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:06.251
It's hard to tell what it is just by looking at it.

243
00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:07.851
But, judging from the fact that

244
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:11.551
it is especially wet around the desk and in front of the shelf,

245
00:15:11.551 --> 00:15:12.651
as well as taking into consideration that

246
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:15.851
the tissue paper in the wastebasket is damp.

247
00:15:15.851 --> 00:15:20.651
It's most likely that this small amount of water is

248
00:15:20.651 --> 00:15:23.951
the sweat of none other than the person who snuck in here!

249
00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:25.351
Sweat?

250
00:15:25.351 --> 00:15:26.551
I see.

251
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.651
Whoever it was that snuck in here in the afternoon

252
00:15:28.651 --> 00:15:30.251
in this stuffy hot room perspired profusely,

253
00:15:30.251 --> 00:15:31.851
and used the tissue paper to wipe off all the sweating,

254
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:34.351
then threw the tissue away into the trash can.

255
00:15:35.251 --> 00:15:36.951
Even so, his sweat poured down on the floor

256
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:38.851
where he most probably stopped to look,

257
00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:42.251
that is, where the bookshelf and desk are.

258
00:15:42.251 --> 00:15:44.451
But, if he was that hot,

259
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:46.551
he could've turned on the air conditioner, couldn't he?

260
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:47.751
Yeah.

261
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:51.351
After all, I leave all the lights in the room on when I'm out,

262
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:54.951
and I always leave the remote controller of the air conditioner on the desk.

263
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:57.351
So, it's not hard to find.

264
00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:00.851
No. He deliberately didn't turn the air conditioner on,

265
00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:04.551
because if the room is cool when you get back,

266
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.251
you'd get suspicious, right?

267
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:09.351
Besides it's hard to accurately tell

268
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:13.651
how long it would take for the room that has been cooled

269
00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:15.551
to return to the original temperature.

270
00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:17.251
True...

271
00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:19.051
And the most conclusive evidence is

272
00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:22.151
the main unit of the computer that is slightly warm yet.

273
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:25.651
You switched it on just now,

274
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:29.651
and yet isn't it strange that the area around the CPU is already warn?

275
00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:32.151
Hey, don't tell me that the guy is after...

276
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:35.151
Yes, I think it's the picture!

277
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:38.851
The one that you said you'd be showing us.

278
00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:42.851
And the picture that may be of the man I'm looking for.

279
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:45.951
After all, the data in the computer is gone

280
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:47.651
and the album that was supposed to be on the bookshelf

281
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:49.151
isn't there, right?

282
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:27.651
By the way, the reason I said that

283
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:30.051
I think the person was here till just a while ago

284
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:34.851
is because the sweat on the floor in this stuffy hot room,

285
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:38.551
as well as the damp tissue paper that was used to wipe it.

286
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:40.151
The surface area of the droplets,

287
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:42.151
the temperature and humidity of the room...

288
00:17:42.151 --> 00:17:43.151
The room was completely closed off

289
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:45.851
and there was no wind blowing through what so ever.

290
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:48.851
There was also the smell of leftover food.

291
00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:53.451
And deducing from how dried the drops of sweat are on the floor,

292
00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:57.951
I think that someone was here till just 10 minutes ago.

293
00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:02.251
Who the heck are you, anyway, kid?

294
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:04.951
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

295
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:06.251
Detective!

296
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.551
The question is,

297
00:18:07.551 --> 00:18:10.651
how the person snuck in here and who it was.

298
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:14.251
It doesn't look as if the door was forced opened or anything.

299
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:16.151
The little window in the kitchen is locked

300
00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:18.151
and everything looks normal.

301
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:21.751
Which means the culprit snuck in from some place other than this room.

302
00:18:24.051 --> 00:18:26.351
The room on this side. I'm going in.

303
00:18:31.851 --> 00:18:33.951
Are these the only two rooms, one here and the one there?

304
00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:35.351
Yeah.

305
00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:38.751
The curtain...

306
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:45.651
The window is open.

307
00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:49.051
Then, the person came in from there. How careless!

308
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:52.651
Well, I leave that window open all the time.

309
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:55.851
I always make georama in this room,

310
00:18:55.851 --> 00:18:59.351
so I color and glue the parts as well as shave them off,

311
00:18:59.351 --> 00:19:01.051
so there's a lot of dust.

312
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.551
That's why I always try to air the room out.

313
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:07.851
Besides, take a look at the street below.

314
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:09.351
There are quite a few shops

315
00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:11.651
and a lot of people go through this street.

316
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.051
If someone were to use a rope to go in and out of here,

317
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:16.251
somebody is bound to notice right away.

318
00:19:16.251 --> 00:19:19.151
Well, I guess it's possible if it were in the middle of the night,

319
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:21.651
but it's still a little before 9:00 in the evening.

320
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:28.651
Then, does it mean that the person didn't sneak in from there?

321
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:31.051
No, it's impossible to, from here!

322
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:33.851
More so in broad daylight.

323
00:19:33.851 --> 00:19:35.451
I'm more concerned about you guys

324
00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:36.851
than about somebody having broken in here.

325
00:19:36.851 --> 00:19:38.551
Huh?

326
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:39.751
I let you in this room because you said that

327
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:42.551
you wanted to give someone who patronized grandpa's shop

328
00:19:42.551 --> 00:19:43.951
something that grandpa asked you to give that customer.

329
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.651
That's why I figured that I should show you a picture.

330
00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:47.451
But you walk in here

331
00:19:47.451 --> 00:19:48.951
and there's this boy who claims he's a detective.

332
00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:52.151
He starts searching all over my room.

333
00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:54.451
I really don't feel all that comfortable, you see.

334
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:57.551
If you have an idea of who that customer is,

335
00:19:57.551 --> 00:19:59.051
all you gotta do is show the stuff

336
00:19:59.051 --> 00:20:00.751
that grandpa gave you to the people you contact,

337
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:04.251
and say, "This is from grandpa, but do you know something about it!"

338
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:07.951
Well, that's...

339
00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:10.351
A wallet!

340
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:13.651
It's a big wallet with a lot of money inside it.

341
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:16.251
Wallet?

342
00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:17.751
A wallet...

343
00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:21.751
Right, that's right. It's a wallet.

344
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:24.751
It seems the person forgot it at the shop.

345
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:26.351
But since it involves money,

346
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:30.551
people may claim it's theirs even if it's not.

347
00:20:30.551 --> 00:20:32.451
I guess it can't be helped if it's a wallet.

348
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:37.751
By the way, does anyone have the spare key to this room?

349
00:20:37.751 --> 00:20:41.151
Well, there are. Three people do.

350
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:43.551
Who are they?

351
00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:46.551
One of them is my ex-girlfriend, Saori.

352
00:20:46.551 --> 00:20:48.651
She used to come here a lot.

353
00:20:48.651 --> 00:20:51.351
It sure was fun when she was around.

354
00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:54.951
Come to think of it, I still haven't got the key back from her.

355
00:20:54.951 --> 00:21:00.051
The other two are my model making friends, Tago and Furusho.

356
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.051
Whenever a georama tournament is approaches,

357
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:04.751
I have the two help me out.

358
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:07.251
I gave them the key to this room so they can come and go as they please.

359
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:10.851
The three people who can easily go in and out of this room

360
00:21:10.851 --> 00:21:13.251
are those three.

361
00:21:13.251 --> 00:21:16.651
But none of them are inclined to commit theft.

362
00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.651
Will you please call them

363
00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:20.751
and ask them what they were doing today anyway?

364
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:22.151
Okay.

365
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:24.951
-Hey. -Conan.

366
00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:30.351
How come you're not calling the police right away?

367
00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:33.551
Don't tell me the one who broke in here is...

368
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:36.251
Not a member of the Black Organization.

369
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:39.051
There are too many clues left behind to have been carried out by them.

370
00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:43.251
Maybe they were flustered because the resident suddenly came back?

371
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:45.451
Because remember, he was supposed to be

372
00:21:45.451 --> 00:21:47.951
at the sports gym until 11:00 tonight,

373
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:50.151
but he suddenly changed his mind.

374
00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:53.251
If so, that somebody still should've been in this room

375
00:21:53.251 --> 00:21:55.851
when we came in.

376
00:21:55.851 --> 00:21:58.251
Well, even if somebody were to be standing guard

377
00:21:58.251 --> 00:22:00.451
and notified the person inside...

378
00:22:00.451 --> 00:22:02.651
They would most likely ambush and kill,

379
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:03.951
rather than leave so much evidence behind.

380
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:12.451
Then, why aren't you calling the police right away?

381
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:15.651
If the police come and start interrogation,

382
00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:18.051
they'll find out immediately that

383
00:22:18.051 --> 00:22:19.651
we're not his grandfather's acquaintance!

384
00:22:19.651 --> 00:22:21.351
So, before that,

385
00:22:21.351 --> 00:22:24.051
I'm trying to make him aware of the situation as soon as possible

386
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:26.951
and catch the one who snuck into this room.

387
00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:30.251
I've got to get it back...

388
00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:34.251
The picture of Eisuke Hondo's father that was taken!

389
00:24:04.051 --> 00:24:07.251
"Next Episode"

390
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:08.851
It's damp.

391
00:24:10.451 --> 00:24:12.351
What?

392
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.851
In front of your very eyes...

393
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:16.251
Don't tell me that it's in this room?

394
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:19.651
Yeah, it's... that!

395
00:24:19.651 --> 00:24:21.751
Don't tell me...

396
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:26.451
Company!

397
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:34.051
Next Conan, "Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 2)"

398
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:51.851
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:54.151
"Washing machine"

400
00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:56.651
-Doc, your laundry... -Thank you always, Ai.

401
00:24:56.651 --> 00:24:57.651
I wish you'd do it yourself!

402
00:24:57.651 --> 00:24:59.247
What a hard-boiled attitude.
