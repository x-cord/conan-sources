1
00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:03,204
My name's Shinichi Kudo.

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,644
I'm a famous high school detective
known throughout the country!

3
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:07,644
But I was forced to take a pill
by some organization...

4
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:09,144
...and became Conan Edogawa!

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:10,514
Doesn't matter if I'm small!

6
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:12,014
My mind's that of a brilliant
17-year-old detective!

7
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:14,584
I can solve cases that not
even adults can handle!

8
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,560
A Murder Behind the Locked
Doors of a Celebrity's Apartment.

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,990
Mori Detective Agency

10
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,770
It's been 3 days since I shrunk.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,340
There still hasn't been any
information about the men in black.

12
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,450
But nobody would ask
a detective like him for help,

13
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,390
much less give him
information about those men.

14
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,220
Yoko-san, you're so cute!

15
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,560
Go, go, let's go!

16
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,690
Come on now,
you're too old to be acting like that.

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,030
You set the example for hopeless men.

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,760
Teitan Elementary School

19
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,170
2 times 2 is 4.
Teitan Elementary School

20
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,830
2 times 3 is 6.

21
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,270
2 times 4 is 8.

22
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,140
I can't take this anymore...

23
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,070
Let's walk home together, Conan-kun!

24
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,640
You must feel kind of lonely since
you just transferred here, right?

25
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,050
So, we'll be your friends!

26
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,150
No, um, I don't really...

27
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,980
Hey, you!

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,920
Are you saying no to Ayumi-chan?!

29
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,890
Violence isn't good, Genta-kun.

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
Shut up! You got a
problem with me, Mitsuhiko?!

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,530
Stop it, Genta-kun!

32
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,400
I gotta go, I'm really busy!

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,730
Wait, Conan-kun!

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,270
Dang it...

35
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,770
I'll never find those men in black
if things keep up like this.

36
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,470
Just be patient, Shinichi.

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,440
Think what would happen
if you rushed things

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,640
and they found out that
you're really Kudo Shinichi.

39
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,810
I know, I know.

40
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,450
It would put not just me but all
the people around me in real danger.

41
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,890
Oh, yes! Ran-kun came by yesterday.

42
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,420
She did?

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,260
Shinichi didn't come
to school again today.

44
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,820
And it doesn't look like
he's been home either...

45
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,320
I think I'll call the police...

46
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,790
Wait!
I think I'll call the police...

47
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,530
Wait!

48
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm sure he's just working on
another one of his strange cases...

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,730
Don't worry. He'll be back home
soon enough, I'm sure of it.

50
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,670
I've got her convinced for the time being,
but how long can we keep this up?

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,710
Ran...

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,880
Oh, that's right!

53
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,720
I made something you'll find
useful for your cases.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,720
This is a Voice-Altering Bow Tie!

55
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,690
"Voice-Altering"?

56
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,660
Turn the dial on the back
and you can make all kinds of voices.

57
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,140
You can sound like an old man,
a child, a man, and even a woman.

58
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm certain it'll come
in handy at some point!

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,010
I doubt that a detective agency
would have much use for this...

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,980
So, that's Conan-kun's house!

61
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,850
We have no choice, we're gonna
force him to be our friend!

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
That's...

63
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,010
The Mori Detective Agency is closed today.
If you've got a job for me...

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,010
...come back... tomorrow...

65
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,850
Oh my god! It's you!

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,880
Yoko Okino!

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,280
That's right.

68
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,150
No way! What would a celebrity
be doing here?

69
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,520
Actually, I want to hire you...

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,400
You appear to be troubled, my dear.

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,030
Yes...

72
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,870
Who the heck are you?

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,840
What?!

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,770
Somebody's spying on you?!

75
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,780
The furniture's been moved
whenever I come home,

76
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,750
somebody's been sending me
candid photos they took of me,

77
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,710
and I've been getting
anonymous phone calls everyday!

78
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,620
How dare they!

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,690
If at all possible, we'd like
you to look into it quietly.

80
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,590
Who're you?

81
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,560
Oh, I'm Yamagishi, her manager.

82
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,030
Her manager?

83
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,960
Very well. I will investigate
as discreetly as possible.

84
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,470
I'll need your address
and phone number here.

85
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,230
Okay.

86
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,140
And if you could autograph this too...

87
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,670
Alright...

88
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,640
Don't forget to write "To Kogoro"...

89
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,310
Now that the great detective
Kogoro Mori is on the case,

90
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,110
you have nothing to fear!

91
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,880
Can I come too?

92
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,680
I've always wanted to
see a celebrity's home.

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Don't you agree, Conan-kun?

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,450
Yeah.

95
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,120
Just don't be getting
in the way! Got it?!

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,060
We won't!

97
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,990
So, this is it?!

98
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,600
This is exactly the kind of place
I thought Yoko Okino might live!

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,930
Hey, not so loud!

100
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,970
Nobody's supposed to know
she lives here, it's a secret.

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,270
The 25th floor, was it?

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,580
Yoko-chan in the flesh... Awesome!

103
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,250
We definitely have to make
friends with Conan-kun!

104
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,880
Agreed.

105
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,810
It's so pretty!

106
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,320
Come on inside...

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,020
What's the matter, Yoko?

108
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,690
You guys!

109
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
This is...

110
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,440
Is everyone all right?

111
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,080
Jeez...

112
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,850
I see.

113
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,820
So, he had already been murdered
by the time you got back?

114
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,150
Yes.

115
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,660
And the person with you
at the time was...

116
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,560
...was I, Kogoro Mori,
Inspector Megure!

117
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,500
Why him, of all people?

118
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,700
It's just like old times!

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,430
Remember all those cases
we worked on together?!

120
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,340
Yes. And thanks to you,
most of them went unsolved!

121
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,340
It certainly is hot in here.

122
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,680
Do you always have
the heater on this high?

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,580
No.

124
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,220
And I'm sure I turned
it off before I left.

125
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,380
That's odd.

126
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,990
That isn't the only thing
that's odd, Inspector.

127
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,520
They're very faint, but there are
damp spots all around the body.

128
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,390
And this chair is the only
thing still standing,

129
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,400
while everything else in the room
has been thrown about.

130
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,300
And this heat...

131
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,970
Was it done to disguise
the time of death?

132
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,670
Kids shouldn't get in the way!

133
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,810
That means you!

134
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,980
Have you determined
the cause of death?

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,280
It would seem this knife
was the cause.

136
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,480
Does that knife belong to you?

137
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Y-Yes...

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,190
You can't honestly suspect Yoko?

139
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,720
Have you seen the victim before?

140
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,660
Um, I'd have to take a closer look...

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,100
So, have you seen him before?

142
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,740
I'm sorry, I guess we haven't.

143
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,700
Right, Yoko?

144
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,470
Yes...

145
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm sure I saw him...

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,480
What was that? What did he pick up?

147
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,350
Don't mind me.

148
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,790
A strand of hair?

149
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
Why would her manager
try to hide this?

150
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,600
Could the murderer have been...?

151
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,500
The murder took place
while the door was locked.

152
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,610
Which means the murderer
was the apartment's resident.

153
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
No! I could never kill anyone!

154
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,710
She's telling the truth, Inspector.

155
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,010
Just because she has
a key doesn't mean...

156
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,750
Don't people usually
have a spare key?

157
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,720
Yeah!

158
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,980
Hey now, stay out of this!

159
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,490
Um, Yamagishi-san has my spare key.

160
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,450
That's it!

161
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,720
Yamagishi! You're the murderer!

162
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,690
Yamagishi!

163
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,100
Yoko gave you the cold shoulder so
you took it out on him, didn't you?!

164
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,070
Hey, now. Where's the proof
that she didn't do it?

165
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,000
Such a beautiful young woman
would never do anything like that!

166
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,510
I see...

167
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,470
Morons.

168
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,310
Yes, I did have her spare key,
but I lost it 2 or 3 days ago...

169
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,650
Stop lying!

170
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm not! I was in the dressing room
at the TV station.

171
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,390
I can vouch for him,
he told me about it!

172
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,450
Well, if that's what
Yoko-san says, then...

173
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,320
I get the feeling that we're still
lacking something really important

174
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,790
that could explain everything here...

175
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,560
An earring?!

176
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,600
Hey, Inspector, under that sofa...

177
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
You kids stay out of this!

178
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,070
Dang it, they all ignore me...

179
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,980
That's it! This thing!

180
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,710
I'll just set it to
an adult's voice, and...

181
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,180
Inspector, there's something
beneath the sofa.

182
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,350
What's this?

183
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,150
An earring...

184
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,360
That's Yuko-san's...

185
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,560
Yuko-san?

186
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,490
Yuko Ikezawa-san.
She debuted the same time I did.

187
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,730
I heard that she was upset that Yoko
got her role in a drama series...

188
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,240
Now I've got it!

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,570
The murderer was Yuko Ikezawa!
Arrest her!

190
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,540
Isn't that right, Inspector?

191
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,380
We'll have to go to the station--

192
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,550
No, let's have her come here
for questioning!

193
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,980
You heard the inspector! Hurry!

194
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,850
Yes, sir!

195
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,920
Yuko Ikezawa did it!
There's no doubt about it!

196
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,590
Judging from the scene of the crime,
the murderer must be Yoko Okino!

197
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,730
The manager's inexplicable action...

198
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,460
And the odd marks left
behind in the room...

199
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,170
All the pieces are here.

200
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,170
The question is how
to put them together...

201
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,725
You've got to be kidding me!

202
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,825
The murder took place in Yoko's place.

203
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,655
She's the one you should suspect.

204
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,625
Yuko-san...

205
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:52,665
I've never been here
before now. I'm innocent.

206
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:54,605
Then what was this doing here?!

207
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:59,835
I thought I lost that somewhere!
I'm glad you found it!

208
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:02,045
It doesn't stop with the earring.

209
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:06,015
The superintendent also said that
he's seen someone who looks like you!

210
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,815
Someone who looks like me?
This is ridiculous.

211
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:09,845
I'm borrowing your bathroom.

212
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,815
Hold it! I'm not done yet!

213
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,285
You never give up, do you?!

214
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:16,355
You think I'm the murderer
just because of an earring?!

215
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,695
I'm really busy, you know!

216
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:24,135
Not nearly as busy as little
Miss Popular Celebrity, though...

217
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:29,365
But if the media gets wind of this,
your image'll take a nosedive!

218
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,775
Maybe you'll lose as
much work as I have!

219
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,545
How dare you threaten her!

220
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:43,115
They both look exactly
the same from behind...

221
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:46,285
And how did she know...

222
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,685
Hey, grownups!

223
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,025
Shut up, boy!

224
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,025
What!?

225
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:53,495
Why, you...!

226
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:57,335
Don't get in the way of their
investigation, Conan-kun.

227
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,505
But if Shinichi were here,
he'd easily solve this case.

228
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,805
Where could that
mystery geek have gone?

229
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:11,245
Don't worry! He'll be back,
I'm sure of it!

230
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,285
I mean, maybe...

231
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,555
What do I have to say
for you to understand?!

232
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:20,525
I already told you I've
never been here before!

233
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:27,895
That's a pretty weird lighter, isn't it?

234
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:32,365
How did you know this was a lighter
if you've never been here before?

235
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:37,205
Yes. Care to explain how you knew?

236
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,145
I know someone who has
one just like it.

237
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,805
And where does this someone live?

238
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:42,705
Well, um...

239
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,075
Where's the bathroom?

240
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,075
I've never been here before,
so I don't know where it is.

241
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,015
Eh? It's in the hallway...

242
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,955
Come to think of it, you knew
where the bathroom was, too!

243
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,925
Which is because you,
Yuko Ikezawa, are the murderer!

244
00:13:56,485 --> 00:14:02,265
You killed that man in this apartment
to create a big scandal around Yoko-san!

245
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:02,865
I didn't.

246
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:04,835
I didn't! I didn't kill him!

247
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,765
All I did was defend myself
when he suddenly attacked me!

248
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,875
I'll admit it, I did sneak
in here several times

249
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,645
using the spare key I stole
from the dressing room.

250
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,715
I wanted to find something,
anything that could cause a scandal!

251
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:22,685
But when I came in this afternoon,
that man suddenly showed up!

252
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,125
I defended myself
with all of my strength...

253
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,225
...and then escaped
as quickly as I could!

254
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,825
Are you sure you didn't really kill him
in the heat of the moment?!

255
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:35,895
I said I didn't kill him!

256
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,865
Inspector!

257
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:40,365
We've learned the identity
of the victim.

258
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,435
Akiyoshi Fujie, 22 years old.

259
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,175
Upon graduating from
Konan High School,

260
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,035
he began working for
Kakubeni Corporation.

261
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,975
Konan High School...

262
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:50,975
Isn't that your old high school,
Yoko-san?

263
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,275
It's just a coincidence!

264
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,415
Isn't that right, Yoko?

265
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:56,445
I... I know him!

266
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:02,885
No, I didn't just know him,
he was my high school boyfriend!

267
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,325
What?!

268
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,255
Yoko!

269
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,295
I'm sorry, Yamagishi-san.
I can't hide it.

270
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:13,265
Don't tell me you did this to
break up with your old flame!

271
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,935
No, I didn't!

272
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:18,075
After all, he was the one
who dumped me.

273
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,635
Who is it?

274
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,045
Who's the murderer?!

275
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:23,045
Yoko Okino?

276
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:25,175
Yuko Ikezawa?

277
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,185
Yamagishi, the manager?

278
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:30,555
Darn it...

279
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,415
We're still missing something
we need to make any deductions!

280
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,485
What is it? What are we missing?

281
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,895
A dent in the floor?

282
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:40,895
Wait a second...

283
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:43,635
Even though the room's in shambles,
this chair is the only thing left standing.

284
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,835
And this room's exceptionally
high temperature...

285
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,935
The water splotches
left around the body...

286
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,905
The hair in the corpse's hand?

287
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,715
A-ha! That's it!

288
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,185
I've finally solved the puzzle!

289
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,045
The murderer...

290
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,655
...is you, Yamagishi!

291
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:09,625
You saw him as an obstacle

292
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,395
because he was capable of starting
a scandal around Yoko-san!

293
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,265
Then you ran into him
while he was hiding in here

294
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,865
and proceeded to kill him!

295
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:19,695
No!

296
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,335
Yamagishi-san isn't the murderer!

297
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,475
What a nice nap...

298
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:26,035
You're conscious again, Genta-kun!

299
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,275
Where's the bathroom?

300
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:27,775
That way.

301
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:30,615
You're the only one left
who could be the murderer!

302
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,045
Forgive me, old man!

303
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,715
Fess up! You'll feel better!

304
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:34,545
Oh no!

305
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:36,745
In that case...

306
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,765
Now then, I'll just set
it to his voice, and...

307
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:50,735
Which is what I would like to say,
but that isn't the case.

308
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:52,165
Yamagishi-san.

309
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:56,465
If you really asked me to help you
so that I would discover the body,

310
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:59,705
you would have also prepared something
to prove your innocence.

311
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,475
Yoko-san, the same goes for you,

312
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:05,615
especially since the 1st person to suspect
would be the apartment's tenant.

313
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:09,615
So, then the murderer...
is Yuko Ikezawa!

314
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:10,415
Now wait just a minute!

315
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:12,115
She didn't do it either.

316
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,385
Even if she did commit the murder
in the heat of the moment,

317
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:16,825
she wouldn't have told us
she ran into him.

318
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,955
But what you're saying is...

319
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,795
Yes, these are only
educated guesses at most.

320
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,765
They don't hold up as proof that
the three of them are innocent.

321
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:27,205
But there is evidence to support it.

322
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:27,765
Yamagishi-san.

323
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:32,075
You pretended to slip and then removed
strands of hair from the body.

324
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,075
What?!

325
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:35,205
I knew it! I knew you were the killer!

326
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:36,405
You're wrong.

327
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,945
The man was stabbed in the back,

328
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:42,615
but he was holding the
stabber's hair in his hands.

329
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:45,115
Don't you find that a bit odd?

330
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,415
Now that you mention it...

331
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:49,525
The one responsible set it
all up to look like a murder...

332
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,395
As if he was killed
by Yoko-san herself...

333
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,495
"Like a murder"?

334
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:56,295
You don't mean...

335
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,165
That's right.

336
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:00,865
The killer is none other than...

337
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:03,265
...the late Fujie-san himself!

338
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,075
A suicide?!

339
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,275
Nonsense! How could he stab
himself in the back with a knife?!

340
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,215
It's a simple trick involving ice.

341
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:17,685
He set the heater on high,
took hairs from Yoko-san's brush,

342
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:22,455
then stood up on a chair
and fell back onto a knife

343
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:24,625
that was held in place
by a block of ice.

344
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,765
You'll find the indentation
mark made by the knife's handle

345
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,065
near where the body was.

346
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,035
The ice shattered and later melted
because of the high heat.

347
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:37,435
However, Fujie-san tried
too hard to frame her.

348
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:38,805
The hair?

349
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:39,735
Yes.

350
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,505
When Yamagishi-san saw it,

351
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:45,475
he tried to hide it because he thought
Yoko-san had indeed killed him.

352
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:49,015
But why would Fujie-kun
do something like this?

353
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:53,285
I would think that it was
because he still loved you.

354
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:58,395
Didn't you realize that the two of you
look exactly the same from behind?

355
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,065
So, he mistook Yuko-san
for Yoko-san and attacked-

356
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:05,335
No. He tried to talk to her.

357
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:09,265
Not realizing he was talking
to Yuko-san and not Yoko-san,

358
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:11,175
he was completely shocked
when she resisted him,

359
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:15,345
and the feelings of his love being driven
to the wall turned into despair and hatred.

360
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:19,415
But he dumped me!
Why would he do that?

361
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:21,245
No, that's not the truth, Yoko...

362
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:26,055
The truth is, I asked him
to break up with you.

363
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:28,555
How could you?

364
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:30,955
Inspector!

365
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,025
What is it?

366
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:34,495
We've found a diary in
the late Fujie-san's house.

367
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:35,025
What?!

368
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:40,705
The diary was filled with his pain.

369
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:41,865
How even after they broke up,

370
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,675
he was unable to forget about her,
so he went to see her.

371
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:49,475
He hoped she would end her career
as a celebrity and come back to him.

372
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:53,145
All he wanted to do was clear
up the misunderstandings.

373
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:56,985
The last thing he wrote was that
he couldn't live like this any longer.

374
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:03,385
It would appear this was a tragic story
that consisted of lies,

375
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:06,455
misunderstandings,
and coincidence.

376
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,795
Hot!

377
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,935
Mori-kun! You were right!

378
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,765
I've changed my mind about you,
"Great Detective"!

379
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,975
I'm exhausted...

380
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:31,155
It was a little scary, but I've
never been that excited before!

381
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:33,355
I think if we make friends
with Conan-kun,

382
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,125
we'll get to experience lots
more thrills and suspense!

383
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,095
Alright then! We've gotta get
Conan-kun to be our friend!

384
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:41,825
Yeah!

385
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:49,605
She's so strong!

386
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:52,235
Already back on her feet
after all that happened...

387
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:06,055
I could never do that. I could never
be as strong as Yoko-san...

388
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,855
I can't even sleep at night
with Shinichi gone...

389
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,595
I'm really hopeless...

390
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,595
It's strange.

391
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,395
Shinichi has been missing
for a week now...

392
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:57,965
Something must have happened to him!

393
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:02,235
But nothing like that would
ever happen to Shinichi!

394
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:06,235
Shinichi... Come back soon!

395
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:14,585
Hello, Mori Detective--

396
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:15,375
Ran.

397
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,115
It's me.

398
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,385
Shinichi?

399
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:23,655
I figured you might be crying
because you're worried about me.

400
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,765
Yeah, right. Why would I be crying?

401
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,735
Where are you right now, Shinichi?

402
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:34,035
I was asked to take a sort
of dangerous case...

403
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:35,705
I'll come back home once
I've taken care of it.

404
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:37,935
So, don't worry.

405
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:40,675
I'm sorry, Ran.

406
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:46,575
When I return to my normal body,
I'll let you hear it...

407
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:48,285
My real voice...

408
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:51,055
My real feelings...

409
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,265
What do you think
these drawings could be?

410
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:06,435
I'll bet it's a treasure map!

411
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:09,435
It's time for some treasure hunting!

412
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:12,405
From this day forth, we'll be known
as the Junior Detective Club!

413
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:16,475
I'm gonna use my share of the treasure
to eat every gourmet meal in the world!

414
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,545
What about you, Conan-kun?

415
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:20,215
I'll save it, I guess...

416
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:25,985
Hey! There it is!

417
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,645
On the next Conan--

418
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:27,646
On the next Conan--
The Case of the Coded City Map.

419
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:31,655
The Case of the Coded City Map.

420
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:50,747
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:50,755
Next Conan's Hint:
Neon Sign.

422
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,054
Neon Sign.
