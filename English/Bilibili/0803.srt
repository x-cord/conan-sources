1
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:04,124
Beware of fire!

2
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:09,224
This feel kind of nostalgic.

3
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:11,024
It's like in a samurai movie.

4
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,724
No, you should call it the Showa Era.

5
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:16,224
An elementary school student saying this is nostalgic.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,724
The Showa Era.

7
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:20,124
Actually, I'm concerned.

8
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:22,124
Because it's been going on for some time already.

9
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:23,724
You mean the arson.

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,124
It's true. There was one four days ago and two days ago.

11
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:30,924
Once in two days means...

12
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,324
Yeah, there may be one tonight.

13
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,124
What?

14
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,324
What's that?

15
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:42,724
No joke!

16
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:44,524
Hello! There is a fire.

17
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,024
Yes! It's burning!

18
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:51,424
Don't tell me that...

19
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,324
Maybe it's an arsonist.

20
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:55,624
No way.

21
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:58,024
Wait.

22
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,724
I know him.

23
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:02,124
What?

24
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:10,124
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

25
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,324
Love and cases come from the same origin.

26
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,124
The evil hands of an arsonist sneak up

27
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,224
to a playground where there are no signs of fire.

28
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:17,924
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,824
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:21,924
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,170
"Pitfall of Fire Prevention"

32
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,870
Is it really true, Genta?

33
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,370
I'm sure.

34
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,970
Whenever I go to buy eel bento,

35
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,670
that guy comes and buys a large serving of seaweed bento.

36
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,070
Not that.

37
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,370
Is he the same person as yesterday's arsonist?

38
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,870
If it's the wrong person, we'll be in big trouble.

39
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,870
Found it.

40
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,170
"Series of Fires at Children's Park. Culprit on the Run"

41
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,370
"Fourth Incident Produces Casualty!"

42
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,770
That's last year's case.

43
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,670
I was concerned about that, too.

44
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,070
The site's the same as this time, right?

45
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,270
Including that site yesterday.

46
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,470
Yeah, at the playground within a range of three kilometers.

47
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,670
It happened consecutively within a period of two weeks.

48
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,070
And finally at the 4th site, there was a casualty,

49
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,470
but no suspects were arrested and the crime stopped all together.

50
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,370
And a year later,

51
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,570
the crime started again at the same site

52
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,570
using the same MO. (Mode of Operation)

53
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,470
It might be the doings of a copycat.

54
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,170
Yeah, but it's also very probable that last year's arsonist revived.

55
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,970
That guy! It's that guy!

56
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,570
Too loud, Genta.

57
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,170
Yes, no mistake about it.

58
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,270
It's the man we saw yesterday.

59
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,770
"Suguru Kamaishi (25)" -Madam, give me the usual.

60
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,170
"Harue Yatabe (48)" -Okay, the usual large seaweed bento.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,170
Your chopped burdocks are the best, Madam.

62
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm not flattering you.

63
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,870
Really? You're going to give me that much?

64
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,070
Is it because I'm a lefty just like you?

65
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,770
Here you go, your change.

66
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,170
Thanks, Madam!

67
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,370
You're really helpless.

68
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,170
You should eat salads sometime, too.

69
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,870
Did I ignite a flame in your heart?

70
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,070
Oh, bad me, an arsonist of love.

71
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,870
Just kidding!

72
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,570
See you.

73
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,870
What a punk.

74
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,770
I'm sure it's him.

75
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,670
Let's expose his true identity.

76
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,370
The Youth Detective Squad is going.

77
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,370
All right.

78
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,370
What now?

79
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,470
I think you should leave this to the police, no?

80
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,070
What? Yeah.

81
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,370
But maybe he was just near the crime site yesterday.

82
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,870
Then I guess we'll just have to find out for ourselves.

83
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,870
Yeah.

84
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,570
I'm starved.

85
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,770
You just ate three meat buns at the convenience store a while ago.

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,370
I should've gotten myself an eel bento instead.

87
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,570
Right.

88
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,670
What if he goes to sleep just like that?

89
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,570
The arsonist has been committing the crime every other day,

90
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,070
so maybe the arsonist won't do anything tonight.

91
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,870
So he fell asleep after all.

92
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,470
Okay, let's go!

93
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,970
We lost him!

94
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,370
Darn!

95
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,570
I wonder where he went?

96
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,070
Until the third crime yesterday,

97
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,770
the crime site was the same as last year.

98
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,870
If the fourth one is to occur from now...

99
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,970
It would be the same fourth crime scene as last year, too.

100
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,670
Wait!

101
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,370
Let's go, Genta!

102
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,070
But I'm starved.

103
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,970
Here. This is the fourth site of the fire.

104
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,470
This is where one person fell victim for the first time last year.

105
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,670
If I remember correctly, a drunk office worker

106
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,470
who wrapped himself in the plastic sheet used for repair of the equipment

107
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,570
fell victim, right?

108
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,070
The park sure is creepy at night, isn't it?

109
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,570
They should set up more lampposts.

110
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah, it's because of all these skyscrapers.

111
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,470
It's still on the bright side, though.

112
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,970
I wonder if there were no eye-witnesses

113
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,170
despite so many people here?

114
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,470
It's towards the aisle facing north, that's why.

115
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,770
The fire is out.

116
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,470
That was close.

117
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,070
We made it in the nick of time.

118
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,570
Thank God we made it.

119
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,870
Are you guys okay?

120
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,370
Arsonist!

121
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,470
Hey, I saved you, you know.

122
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,470
What a thing to say.

123
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,070
Darn, he got away again.

124
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,770
-Again? -Yesterday, too?

125
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,170
I almost got him and then...

126
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,270
Why?

127
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,270
-What? -Don't tell me

128
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,970
you thought that this had something to do

129
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,970
with last year's arson too, sir?

130
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,270
Is that why you were keeping watch?

131
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,470
Yeah, sort of.

132
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,870
So why are you doing something like that?

133
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,770
That's because...

134
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,170
It's only natural, isn't it?

135
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,370
If it's last year's arsonist,

136
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,970
I've got to catch him with my own hands.

137
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,970
What's with you guys, anyway?

138
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,270
We are...

139
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,570
The Youth Detective Squad!

140
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,070
Detective squad?

141
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,770
Thank you for saving us from danger.

142
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,970
We mistook you for being the arsonist. We're very sorry.

143
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,470
Why didn't you hurry up and tell us?

144
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,970
We are on the same side.

145
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,670
The same side?

146
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,170
Yeah, that's right!

147
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,070
I'm a "lone detective squad"

148
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,970
who stood up to catch the hated arsonist

149
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,870
in order to protect this town!

150
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,970
A lone detective squad.

151
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,470
I don't think you need the "squad" if you're alone.

152
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,170
I see.

153
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,370
Then that'll be all for today.

154
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,370
Okay, I'll be going then.

155
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,170
What? Are you leaving?

156
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,270
What about the arsonist?

157
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,470
That's... Leave it to the lone detective squad.

158
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,570
It's too dangerous for only kids to handle.

159
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,370
If so, let's work together.

160
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,970
We're protecting the town, too.

161
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,570
Don't be so unfriendly, mister.

162
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,170
Do you have any other reasons why you don't want to work together?

163
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,270
Of course not.

164
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,270
Then it's all set!

165
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,270
This is the start of a new detective squad!

166
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,670
All right!

167
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,470
Seriously, I can't be wasting my time with brats.

168
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,470
What?

169
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,070
Good morning!

170
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,070
"Sumire Park"

171
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,770
This is the first site of the fire, right?

172
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,470
That swing is what was burned last year.

173
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,670
This year it was this seesaw.

174
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,770
And what are we going to do here?

175
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,570
We're going to reinvestigate the case.

176
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,970
And figure out how the fire was set.

177
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,170
We'll look for eye-witnesses and hear what they have to say.

178
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,770
But if there were such people,

179
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,770
I think the police would've got the arsonist long ago.

180
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,070
Don't you think so, mister?

181
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,470
Yeah, true I guess.

182
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,670
I haven't eaten breakfast yet.

183
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,070
Me neither!

184
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,270
You ate breakfast already, didn't you?

185
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,870
I did, but I'm hungry.

186
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,170
Darn.

187
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,470
What now?

188
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,170
I'm sure that the police are in the process of investigating now.

189
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,770
Yeah, true.

190
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,770
"Tsutsuji Park"

191
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,770
This monkey bar was burned last year.

192
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,370
And that arched bridge was burned in the second fire.

193
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,570
True.

194
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,970
I'm hungry.

195
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,570
I guess I'll go have some ramen.

196
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,470
Yeah, me too!

197
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,470
It's not lunch time yet!

198
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,470
The investigation is first. You too, mister!

199
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,470
Sorry, sorry.

200
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,170
"Himawari Park" -The third one

201
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,970
is the site from the day before yesterday.

202
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,070
The jungle gym was what was burned.

203
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,170
Last year it was that "horse", right?

204
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,770
I'm starved.

205
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,770
Hey, you want to eat eels?

206
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,770
What?

207
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,270
I'll eat!

208
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,770
Is this a coincidence?

209
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,570
Is anything wrong?

210
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,370
It looks so good!

211
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,770
And I got extra!

212
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,070
Are you sure it's okay that we eat, too?

213
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,270
Eat to your heart's content. I got paid.

214
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,370
Thank you!

215
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,870
I ordered you some soup, too.

216
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,770
So go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

217
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,070
Excuse me.

218
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,970
Thanks for the food!

219
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,870
Shoots!

220
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,770
Darn.

221
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,370
He got away.

222
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,770
Yeah.

223
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,570
What's wrong, the two of you?

224
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,770
Wait. Where's the guy?

225
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,870
He got away. He took us in beautifully.

226
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,970
He got away. Why?

227
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,170
I think we'll be getting in the way of what he's trying to do.

228
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,970
About what he's trying to do?

229
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,370
What? Don't tell me...

230
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,770
Then, he's probably the...

231
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,570
Arsonist after all?

232
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,937
"Closed"

233
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:13,737
He deceived us, didn't he?

234
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,037
How could he?

235
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:17,937
It was delicious, but I can't forgive him.

236
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:21,937
It's true that his perseverance wasn't normal.

237
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:23,737
Because...

238
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,237
It's only natural, isn't it?

239
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,237
If it's last year's arsonist,

240
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:29,737
I've got to catch him with my own hands.

241
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:33,737
Either way, there's no doubt that he's in some way involved.

242
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:35,537
Right.

243
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:36,737
Last year's...

244
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,937
"Fourth Incident Produces Casualty!"

245
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,437
This is...

246
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:43,537
What's wrong?

247
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:44,837
Let's go, all of you!

248
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,137
What? Conan?

249
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:48,437
Ai?

250
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:50,237
Wait up!

251
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,537
This is yesterday's...

252
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,737
You guys. Stay here.

253
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:57,837
What?

254
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,337
Just as I thought.

255
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:11,637
I see.

256
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:14,037
That's the story.

257
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:17,437
And where is the person in question?

258
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,437
That's the problem.

259
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:22,337
Over there!

260
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,737
"Ninja Fortress"

261
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,237
I couldn't see last night because it was dark,

262
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:29,637
but this is no coincidence.

263
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,337
It's a countdown.

264
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,037
Just what do you mean?

265
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,837
These characters circled in red were left at each

266
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,537
and every place that was set fire to.

267
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:40,337
The first site.

268
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,537
What're you going to do?

269
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:45,437
I'm sure that the police are in the process of investigating now.

270
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:47,937
Yeah, true.

271
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:48,937
"Houses for lease"

272
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:52,437
That character can be read as "To".

273
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:55,537
The second site.

274
00:14:58,337 --> 00:14:59,937
I'm hungry.

275
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,637
I guess I'll go have some ramen.

276
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:04,637
"Towards Beika"

277
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:07,537
"He".

278
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,537
The third site.

279
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,137
Hey, you want to eat eels?

280
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:16,337
"Walking"

281
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:19,637
"Ho".

282
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,137
And the fourth site is...

283
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,437
"Ninja Fortress"

284
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:28,937
"Ni".

285
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:32,537
To-Heh-Ho-Ni...

286
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:33,637
I see.

287
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:35,137
Iro-Ha-Ni-Ho-Heh-To

288
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,137
written backwards.

289
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:38,437
In other words, it's a countdown.

290
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,937
Yeah. In other words, the crime will still continue.

291
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:44,337
There's going to be a fifth.

292
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:46,437
It was the same last year, too.

293
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,037
But somebody died in the fourth case,

294
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:52,637
so out of fear or because investigations were becoming more severe,

295
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:54,537
the crime was discontinued.

296
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,937
Probably at the fifth site...

297
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:59,337
But why is it always at a playground?

298
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:03,237
And only targeted seesaws, slides and so forth.

299
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,437
Maybe...

300
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,837
"Iroha Toys"

301
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:09,837
This is...

302
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,437
"Iroha Toys" -Iroha Toys.

303
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,437
"Iroha Toys"

304
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,937
This, too.

305
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,337
Same here, too.

306
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,037
This, too!

307
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,037
They all say Iroha Toys.

308
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,637
I thought so.

309
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,037
It's highly likely that the burned playground equipment

310
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:27,437
at the other parks were also of the same company.

311
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:28,637
Look.

312
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,437
"Iroha Toys" -The main factory is near here.

313
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:34,237
Just what does it mean?

314
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:36,437
Did you figure out where he is?

315
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,337
Maybe it's the next...

316
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:41,637
Yeah, it's the fifth and last site where the fire will be set.

317
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,837
They seem to be closed because it's Sunday.

318
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,837
That's... If I'm not mistaken...

319
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:56,937
Look.

320
00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:01,537
The arsonist?

321
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,737
Left-handed.

322
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,337
It's him after all.

323
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,337
Haibara, call 110 and 119.

324
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:07,437
Okay.

325
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:11,437
-Hey! -Conan!

326
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:12,637
Where are you going?

327
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,937
The police will be here any minute!

328
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,537
Who are you?

329
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:47,237
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

330
00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:49,637
You'd better turn yourself in.

331
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:53,537
Madam at the bento shop, the arsonist.

332
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:55,037
No joke?

333
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,037
What about that guy then?

334
00:17:57,037 --> 00:18:02,737
He's also a lefty, but she's the only one who can use that car.

335
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,137
Just as I thought.

336
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:12,337
Why, Madam?

337
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:14,037
Here you go, your change.

338
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:16,037
Thanks, Madam!

339
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,337
You're helpless.

340
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,937
You should eat salads sometime, too.

341
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,737
This is the smell of kerosene.

342
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,537
Don't tell me that...

343
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:29,537
"Closed"

344
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,337
Madam.

345
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:50,337
I wonder where she is.

346
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,137
A year and a half ago,

347
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,637
because of a piece of playground equipment that was out of order here,

348
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:04,237
the child who was playing was seriously injured.

349
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,637
The company put the entire blame on me

350
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:08,737
because I was the head of the factory.

351
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:10,037
They fired me,

352
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,137
and they didn't care about what happened to me after that.

353
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,137
It was no joke!

354
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:17,537
You used to be the head of the factory here?

355
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:20,637
What was the Iroha countdown for?

356
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,037
Why go out of your way to?

357
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:26,537
I wanted to give them what they deserved.

358
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:29,337
To make them repent.

359
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:31,937
If the company said just one word of apology,

360
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,337
I would've stopped the whole thing.

361
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:36,537
The only ones that eventually realized what was going on

362
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,637
turned out to be just all of you.

363
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:42,137
How stupid of me.

364
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,037
Come off it, Madam!

365
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,837
A person died because of you, you know?

366
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,337
Did you forget?

367
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:51,137
No way. This can't be happening.

368
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:55,537
I really loved your chopped burdocks.

369
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,037
I really loved them.

370
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,737
Please arrest me too, officer.

371
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:17,137
What?

372
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,537
You, in fact, witnessed the fourth arson

373
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:21,537
that took place last year, right?

374
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,237
What?

375
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,137
Yeah, exactly.

376
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:26,637
What?

377
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,437
-No. -Seriously?

378
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,237
But why?

379
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,237
This.

380
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:34,537
"Nearby House Robbed!"

381
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,937
A burglar?

382
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:38,637
Yeah, that's me.

383
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,737
You?

384
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:41,637
You're a burglar?

385
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,137
That's right.

386
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:46,837
And one of his crime sites was over there.

387
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:50,537
Near the site of the fire where a person died.

388
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:53,837
I stopped being a burglar since then.

389
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,737
But I was afraid of being arrested

390
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,237
so I never called to turn myself in till now.

391
00:20:58,237 --> 00:20:59,337
I justified myself

392
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:01,237
saying that I didn't get a clear view of the arsonist's face,

393
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:04,137
and so deceived myself as well as others.

394
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,337
But if I had turned myself in back then,

395
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,737
the arsonist would've been arrested sooner.

396
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:14,637
Her feelings of vexation may have already been cleared, too.

397
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:18,337
Then she started to set fire again.

398
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:23,437
That's why I was determined to catch her with my very hands.

399
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:25,937
I was also planning to turn myself in after doing so, too.

400
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,937
But most of all,

401
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:31,137
it's amazing how you figured all this out, sonny.

402
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:34,437
What? Well, that's because...

403
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,837
You discussed it with pops, right?

404
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:39,737
That's right.

405
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:44,037
When I talked to him about the MO of your burglary and your actions,

406
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,837
he made a deduction for me on the phone.

407
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,737
The Sleeping Kogoro.

408
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:49,437
The Sleeping Kogoro?

409
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:51,937
I see. I get it now.

410
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,637
I could never get away with this, then.

411
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:54,737
You got me there.

412
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:27,937
So, a peaceful night returns to the town.

413
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:30,337
As to the playground accident that happened a year ago

414
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,437
that started the series of arsons,

415
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:36,137
the news reported that a reinvestigation of the factory is now underway.

416
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:39,237
Beware of fire!

417
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,737
Beware of fire!

418
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:52,937
"Next Episode" -I know.

419
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:57,837
-No way. -Seriously?

420
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,737
-I know about you, too. -Yes?

421
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,337
That's nothing new.

422
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:08,937
What about this cameraman?

423
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,237
Why's he here?

424
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:15,437
I'm the one who chose Iwami.

425
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:17,537
Next Conan,

426
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:21,637
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 1)"

427
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,680
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,880
"Ebizo Ichikawa"

429
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
-Next year... -Will be Detective Conan's...

430
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
20th Anniversary!

431
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
-It's Kabuki... -Time.
