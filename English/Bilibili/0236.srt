00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,040
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,240
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,940
Today's episode takes place in Shirahama of Southern Kishu.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,840
The footprints of crime on a white sand beach.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,340
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,753
Here!

11
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,053
There you go.

12
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:26,353
Dad, let's go check out souvenirs at the waiting room!

13
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:29,553
We don't have to go look for souvenirs just yet, do we?

14
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:31,953
How cute!

15
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,853
Look! It's Sour Boy.

16
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:37,253
Kishu is a region famous for sour plums!

17
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,853
I'm going to buy some on my way home.

18
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:44,553
What's so cute about a sour looking guy like this?

19
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:45,653
You can say that again.

20
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:49,253
So, where are we going first?

21
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,553
Here.

22
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:54,253
Nanboukumakusunoki?

23
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:58,053
No, it's read Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall.

24
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,353
He's a world famous botanist who was born In Wakayama Prefecture,

25
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:05,353
especially known for his research of plants and fungi.

26
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:09,353
Oh, so such a great researcher existed.

27
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:12,853
I'd advise you to study a bit before traveling.

"Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall"

29
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:25,853
Why don't you stop by for a meal here?

30
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:28,853
The crawfish here is good.

31
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,453
What do you think, dad?

32
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,653
It's still too early.

33
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:36,153
Let's go check out the memorial hall first.

34
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:38,953
"Minakata Kumagusu Memorial Hall Entrance"

35
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:50,053
The road's closed on this side.

36
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,153
This way, Conan!

37
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,653
Okay!

"Shirahama"

40
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:26,453
The sand is really fine and white!

41
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:29,053
I wonder why is it so white?

42
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,353
I once heard that the secret of its whiteness

43
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,353
is due 90% silicate quartz sand.

44
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:38,153
Goodness. He sure is knowledgeable of trivials.

45
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,453
I want to take this sand home!

46
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,253
You know, like fill it up in a bottle like the star sand

47
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,353
and take it with me.

48
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,853
What a girlish taste you got.

49
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,653
You were looking at a weird looking key holder

50
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,453
back at the station too, weren't you?

51
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,953
The one with sour pickled plums attached to it.

52
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,353
But it's so cute!

53
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:02,353
You fool! Only brats like things like that!

54
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:03,853
Brats?

55
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:09,953
Excuse me, but aren't you Mr. Mouri?

56
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,953
-Yes. -I thought so!

57
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,353
I'm a fan of yours!

58
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,653
This is awesome!

59
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,453
I'd like to take pictures of you.

60
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:20,053
Do you know him, Fuji?

61
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,353
What a beauty!

62
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:23,953
He's the renowned detective

63
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:27,053
that you're all familiar with, Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

64
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:35,453
Ran, could you please take a picture of us two?

65
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:36,853
Gosh.

66
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,753
Here goes!

67
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:44,453
By the way, did you come here to investigate a case or something?

68
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:47,153
No, it's just a plain sightseeing tour.

69
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,853
We drew a winning raffle at the shopping arcade.

70
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:51,853
Idiot! Be quiet!

71
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,053
Are you all students?

72
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:58,653
Yes, we're seniors at Naniwa Medical University.

73
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:02,253
So, you're doctors in the making!

74
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:03,953
Let me introduce everyone, then.

75
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,553
The girl who is next to you

76
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:08,553
is the queen of our group, Maki Shinjou.

77
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:10,353
Cut it out, Fuji.

78
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:13,453
Next to her is the gigolo, Tatsuhiko Yura.

79
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,453
This is our Madonna, Madoka Mitsui.

80
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:16,753
How do you do?

81
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,053
She is our whiz kid, Kanako Mihara.

82
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:20,553
Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,453
And I'm the clown of the group, Kota Fuji!

84
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,553
The three here belong to the art club,

85
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,353
and since Maki suggested that

86
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,953
we take a nature sketching trip, we've all decided to come.

87
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:35,553
I guess you could call it a pastime for Ms. Little Richie.

88
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,653
Talk about grateful.

89
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:43,453
She paid for the hotel, train tickets and rent-a-car fee as well.

90
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,453
Yura! You've got no class, talking like that!

91
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:47,853
It's okay.

92
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:49,153
I broke up with her

93
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:51,253
because I didn't like just what she's doing for all of us.

94
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,153
I mean, she spends several thousand yen a month

95
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:55,053
just on cosmetics.

96
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,153
She has them sent from Paris every time a new product comes out.

97
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,453
On the contrary, Madoka has no money like me

98
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:04,853
and doesn't look down on me.

99
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,453
Her childishness is a fly in the ointment, though.

100
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:08,553
Well, aren't you lucky

101
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,553
having found yourself a cutie-pie to go around with?

102
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,653
It doesn't bother me a bit.

103
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:14,453
Hey, hey.

104
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,453
I'm thirsty.

105
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:22,053
Can you go get me something to drink, Kanako?

106
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,253
No way!

107
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,153
Go get it yourself!

108
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,753
I've decided to not listen to your beck and calls anymore!

109
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,353
Kanako.

110
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:34,153
It's true that thanks to you, I was able to made it to college

111
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,653
since you taught me Mathematics

112
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,853
that wasn't my cup of tea during high school.

113
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,053
And I really appreciate what you did back then.

114
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,853
But will you stop bossing me around

115
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,753
harping on how grateful I should be to you?

116
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:47,153
I didn't mean to be bossing you around.

117
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:48,253
Now, now.

118
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,253
We've all come on this trip together,

119
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,853
so why don't we just all go ahead and have a good time?

120
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,753
I'll go get the drinks.

121
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,053
Right,

122
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,153
maybe I'll have Fuji do things for me

123
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,853
instead of Kanako from now on.

124
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,853
I wonder who it was

125
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:04,453
that fainted during practical dissection practice

126
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,553
and was saved by me?

127
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,753
So, something like that happened to you?

128
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:12,453
Oh, come on!

129
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,853
You promised that you'd keep that a secret.

130
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,353
Well, I'm going to get the drinks, so wait for me.

131
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:23,753
Mr. Mouri, what are your plans after this?

132
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,853
Let's see...

133
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:27,553
We're going to the Shirahama Energy Land right over there.

134
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,453
Then, we'll be going to the Undersea Observation Tower

135
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,253
and go around to Sandanbeki.

136
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:34,653
And finally watch the sunset from Senjujiki.

137
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,153
What about tomorrow?

138
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:39,053
We've thinking of going to Adventure World from morning.

139
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,453
Would you like to come along with us, Maki?

140
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,853
It's okay. Because we have other plans.

141
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:46,053
And where are you staying?

142
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:48,653
At the Shinyuzaki Hotel.

143
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,353
I see.

144
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:55,353
Dad, we'd better get going.

145
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:57,053
Yes, I guess so.

146
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,653
I guess we'll be going, then.

147
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:01,453
Have a nice trip.

148
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,153
Please enjoy yourselves!

149
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:08,753
You can't tell if they're getting along or not, right?

150
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:11,853
Well, when you're young, anything can be complicated.

151
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,653
"Sandanbeki" -It's amazing!

152
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:37,453
It's really a bold sheer cliff!

153
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,053
It seems that we can go way over that side.

154
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:41,653
I'm not going!

155
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,253
No way!

156
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:46,153
Then, why don't we go tour the caves?

157
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,353
It seems we can go down

158
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,353
using the elevator from of a temple that building.

159
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:53,553
And after that, we get to watch the sunset at Senjujiki, right?

160
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:55,653
Yes! I'm sure that it'll be super beautiful!

161
00:09:57,953 --> 00:09:59,753
"Senjujiki"

162
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:03,453
What a scenic masterpiece!

163
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,553
I'm sure glad we came.

164
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:09,253
Yes, it was worth coming even if it was only to see this sunset.

165
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,453
Mr. Mouri.

166
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:13,453
Maki!

167
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:16,153
Did you come to watch the sunset, too?

168
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:20,053
Yes, since we haven't seen the view of the sunset here yet.

169
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,953
By the way, Mr. Mouri, do you like to drink?

170
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:25,453
Yes! I like it very much!

171
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,753
If so, why not stop over at Toretore Market

172
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,653
before going to Adventure World tomorrow?

173
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,653
Toretore Market?

174
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,553
Aside from fresh seafood,

175
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,853
they have a whole line of marvellous locally brewed sake.

176
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:41,053
Locally brewed sake?

177
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:43,453
You can send it home by courier service, too.

178
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:46,453
I've also written the bus route to the market from Shinyuzaku.

179
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:50,353
There is a bus stop called Bus Depot near Toretore Market.

180
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:51,753
There is no bus that goes directly

181
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:55,253
from Toretore Market to Adventure World,

182
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,753
and you'll have to get off once at Shirahama,

183
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,653
but it shouldn't take that long.

184
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,153
Thank you so much for your kindness!

185
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,253
We'll visit there for sure!

186
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:07,453
-Goodbye, then. -Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness!

187
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,453
Thank you so very much!

188
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,553
It seemed as if Maki came all the way here

189
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,253
just to give us information about the market, didn't it?

190
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:25,453
I guess she's just a kind person.

191
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:32,253
"The next day"

192
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:40,653
"Shinahama"

193
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,553
"Sandanbeki"

194
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:52,453
"Adventure World"

195
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,353
"Toretore Market"

196
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,953
The bus for Adventure World is bus number three.

197
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:20,353
The next bus to Adventure World is at 10:15 am.

198
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:24,153
We still have about 20 minutes to go.

199
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,053
Maybe we should go walking around the area.

200
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,353
What's wrong, Conan?

201
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:38,753
I felt like someone was watching me.

202
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,453
I guess it's just my imagination though.

203
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,453
If you want it so badly, why don't you just buy it now?

204
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,153
-It's okay. -Hey.

205
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:51,653
Let's go take a look in the souvenir shop outside, too.

206
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:52,853
Let's go, Conan.

207
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:59,553
We've only got 7 to 8 minutes left, so we'd better get going.

208
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,953
Would you mind if I stop over at the store of the station?

209
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,953
What? We don't have time, you know.

210
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,453
Hurry it up, okay?

211
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:14,553
So, you're going to buy it after all.

212
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,653
Not again.

213
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,753
It's just as if someone is watching me.

214
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:25,653
-This please. -Okay.

215
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,953
Hey, hurry up, the bus is going to leave!

216
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:32,353
Only one more left?

217
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,753
Somebody else beside Ran has bought it.

218
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:37,453
Thank you very much.

219
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,553
Maki!

220
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,153
Maki!

221
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,353
Thanks again!

222
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,153
Be careful!

223
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:04,253
Conan, that bus is headed for Sandanbeki!

224
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,461
"Adventure World"

225
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,361
Nice shot!

226
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,761
Conan, wave your hand.

227
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,261
I'm fine.

228
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,461
He's only a kid and yet he's embarrassed.

229
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,561
Isn't that you, Mr. Mouri?

230
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,361
I didn't think that I'd run into you here.

231
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,461
You're...

232
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,861
Fuji! Kota Fuji!

233
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,961
So, you've come here.

234
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,961
Is everyone else here, too?

235
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:05,961
No. The three went out to sketch from morning,

236
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,561
and Maki was saying that she was going to go driving until sundown.

237
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:14,261
I saw her around 10 am sharp at Shirahama Station!

238
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:17,961
Oh, I see.

239
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,261
-Hey, over that side! -Let's go and see!

240
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:21,761
That's a laptop, right?

241
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:23,761
Do you always carry it around with you?

242
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:27,761
Yes, that's why Yura call me a computer freak.

243
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,861
Huh? What was that?

244
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,661
Oh, excuse me.

245
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,661
Hello?

246
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,361
What? Calm down and tell me again, Madoka.

247
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:41,061
What? Maki is dead?

248
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:42,761
What? Hold on!

249
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,661
Madoka, this is Mouri!

250
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,961
Where and in what condition is the body?

251
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,761
In the bushes at Sandanbeki.

252
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,961
Stabbed in the chest with a knife...

253
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,761
Sandanbeki?

254
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,661
That suspicious looking silhouetted figure

255
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:59,961
was on board the bus to Sandanbeki.

256
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,461
Darn it!

257
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:06,961
I'm on the way there along with Mr. Mouri and his family!

258
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:09,461
Did you called the police?

259
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,561
Did you tell Yura and Kanako?

260
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:12,661
Not yet?

261
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,961
Okay! I'll inform them, then.

262
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:25,561
Hey, didn't we just go pass the entrance of Sandanbeki?

263
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,161
Madoka is somewhere far inside.

264
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,961
This way!

265
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,161
-Madoka! -Fuji!

266
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,761
Madoka, where is Maki?

267
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:57,061
In the bushes over there.

268
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,261
One stab right into her chest.

269
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:07,761
She probably died on the spot.

270
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,461
Maki's wallet is nowhere in sight.

271
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:16,461
This is most likely to be a robbery turned murder case.

272
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,561
There are no signs of any struggle in the area.

273
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:22,161
If so, the murderer could've been an acquaintance.

274
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,461
Strange.

275
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,561
If I remember correctly, Maki's key holder

276
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:32,261
had the key for the rental car on it, too.

277
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,961
Does that mean that the killer took it along and fled with the car?

278
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:38,861
But what's with this key holder then?

279
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,361
What is it?

280
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,161
Work gloves?

281
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:49,061
Why does she have work gloves on her?

282
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,561
Haven't I told you time and again

283
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:52,961
not to mess around the scene of a crime?

284
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,261
I'm sorry!

285
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,361
Let's wait for the police to come

286
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,461
-for further investigation. -It hurts.

287
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,661
This sand is...

288
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:05,861
Huh?

289
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:11,161
This is...

290
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,061
Thank you for waiting.

291
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,161
I'm Oura from Wakayama Prefectural Police Department.

292
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,261
Nice to meet you.

293
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,661
I'm Ando from the Shirahama East Police Station.

294
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,261
Nice to meet you.

295
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,561
I am honored to be able to work with you,

296
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:34,161
the renowned detective, Mr. Mouri, on this case.

297
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,961
Please do give us precise advice if needed.

298
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:39,761
Oh, no.

299
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:43,661
Cooperating with the police is the duty of any civilian!

300
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:45,861
I'll help in whatever way I can!

301
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:49,661
Let me introduce you to the friends of the victim, then.

302
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,561
This Kota Fuji who rushed over here together with us

303
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:55,861
from Adventure World.

304
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:59,661
She is Kanako Miyahara who came over here from Engetsu Island.

305
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:02,261
She is the one who first found the body, Madoka Mitsui.

306
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:06,861
And he is Tatsuhiko Yura who came here from Shirahama.

307
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:10,261
Ms. Madoka Mitsui,

308
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:14,261
please tell us the situation when you found the body.

309
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:17,861
I heard Beethoven playing.

310
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,161
Beethoven?

311
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:25,861
I was sketching on the far end of Sandanbeki.

312
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:30,761
I heard the melody of a cell phone ringing behind me.

313
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:33,861
So I went towards the bushes where the music was coming from.

314
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,861
I didn't know what to do,

315
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,461
so I called Fuji right away.

316
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:49,961
I see that Maki was lying on the ground fairly close to you.

317
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:52,461
Nevertheless, you didn't realize that a crime was being committed?

318
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:56,161
I was faced in the opposite direction

319
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,661
and the sound of the waves was pretty loud.

320
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,961
But you heard the melody of the cell phone?

321
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,261
Well...

322
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,961
It's only natural.

323
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,661
Electronic sounds like those of cell phone are made to be audible.

324
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:14,561
Well, I guess so.

325
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,661
Officer Ando, please give us a report on the autopsy.

326
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,461
Yes, sir.

327
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:22,761
The cause of death is shock by a stab wound.

328
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:25,061
There are traces of the corpse being moved after death,

329
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,561
and the estimated time of death...

330
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,261
In other words, the time the murder is thought to have been committed.

331
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,361
Judging from the condition of the body,

332
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:34,361
it's between 9:00 to 11:00 this morning.

333
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:36,161
No. I'm sure the time the murder was committed

334
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:38,161
can be narrowed down a bit more.

335
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:42,361
-What? -We ran into Maki at Shirahama Station.

336
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,261
It was around 10 when we saw her.

337
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:47,461
What? Are you sure about it?

338
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:52,461
After bowing to us, she left immediately in her car.

339
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:57,761
We were going to get on the 10:15 bus headed for Adventure World,

340
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,361
so I'm sure there's no mistake.

341
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:00,761
Officer Ando.

342
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,561
How long does it take to get from Shirahama Station

343
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,461
to Sandanbeki by car?

344
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,761
Well, since it's the tour season now,

345
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:10,161
it should take less than 14 minutes.

346
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:11,861
Let's say it takes about 14 minutes,

347
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:15,561
so she arrives at Sandanbeki about 10:24.

348
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:18,361
If she parks the car in the alley closest to the scene of the crime,

349
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:22,061
it would take her two minutes to get there.

350
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,261
If we assume she was killed immediately,

351
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:27,161
the time the murder was committed, no matter how early,

352
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,361
it would be around 10:26!

353
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:32,761
Yes, which means that the time the murder had been committed

354
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,661
is narrowed down to approximately 34 minutes.

355
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,361
By the way, Maki's wallet

356
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,861
seems to have disappeared from among her personal belongings.

357
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:42,161
Just a few minutes ago,

358
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:44,661
the car that the victim was thought to have been driving

359
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:45,761
was found near Sansho Shrine

360
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,961
about three kilometers away from here.

361
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,661
And an empty wallet was found inside the car.

362
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:51,961
It's Maki's!

363
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,961
So, we've already gotten to the bottom of this case...

364
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,661
Wait!

365
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:59,361
Was the key of the car found?

366
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,461
The key was in the ignition of the car.

367
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:06,461
Did you only receive one key from the rental car shop?

368
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:08,461
I think so.

369
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,861
I don't think they normally give you two keys, do they?

370
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:15,061
This is a case of murder-robbery!

371
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,061
After the killer killed Maki,

372
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,861
the killer stole the car and fled on it,

373
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:22,561
and abandoned it near Sansho Shrine!

374
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:26,361
No, murder-robbery is probably just a camouflage.

375
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:28,361
It's most likely that this murder was committed

376
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,961
by an acquaintance of hers.

377
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:33,861
If so, the murderer is among the people here.

378
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:08,061
"Next Episode" -You're the one with the problem.

379
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:14,761
It was unfortunate that Maki witnessed you.

380
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:16,261
So, you killed her to make sure that

381
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:18,161
she wouldn't leak your secret.

382
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,461
Southern White Sand Beach...

383
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:25,161
You're the killer!

384
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,061
Next Conan,

385
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,182
"South Kishu White Sand Beach Mystery Tour (Part 2)"

386
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,479
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,279
"Cosmetics"

388
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,979
Have you figured out the killer?

389
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,579
It must be the one that bought Sour Boy!

390
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:44,879
Really?
