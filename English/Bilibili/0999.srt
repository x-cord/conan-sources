Dad, don't drink too much.

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.820
I know.

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.250
Anyway, listen to this.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.760
What is it?

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.170
It's about the other day.

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.510
What a masterpiece.

12
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.270
While heading home the other day, I saw
a strange man in front of my house.

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.770
Totally suspicious, right?

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.680
So I reported him to the police.

15
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.610
You're calling me suspicious?
That's ridiculous.

16
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.430
I came to check on my coworker
who lives in this apartment,

17
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.530
but I forgot his room
number, so I texted him.

18
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.040
Sorry about that. My mistake.

19
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.040
You're the guy who should've
minded his own business!

20
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.040
Can you believe that happened?

21
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.380
You sure do love to meddle
in other people's business.

22
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.550
I prefer to think of myself as considerate.

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.760
Besides, it's his fault
for behaving suspiciously.

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.040

37
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.271
By the way, something else
happened to me the other day.

38
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:36.281
I was waiting in line to use the ATM

39
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:40.281
when I noticed a man behaving strangely.

40
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:45.791
He was standing in front of the ATM without
using it while talking on the phone.

41
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:48.231
Yes, yes. I understand.

42
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.401
What? Next month, too?

43
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.491
Next month will be difficult.

44
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:56.051
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

45
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:59.361
I figured it must be phone fraud,

46
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:01.821
so I reported him to the police immediately.

47
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:06.511
This really isn't phone fraud.

48
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:09.931
My mother called me. It has
nothing to do with this.

49
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:12.211
I was transferring money to my workplace.

50
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:14.241
So it was a mistake.

51
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:18.441
Kotani, what have you done?!

52
00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:20.471
The other party hasn't receive the funds yet!

53
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.821
It's causing a huge problem!

54
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:23.791
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:26.031
You'll pay for this.

56
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:28.661
Can you believe what happened?

57
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.331
He's hardly fit to be a working

64
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:50.181
What's his deal?

65
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.961
What is it, kid?

66
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:53.911
Nothing.

67
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:57.011
He's just drunk.

68
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.791
Excuse me. Are you all right?

69
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:05.071
Yeah.

70
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:08.391
Excuse me. Could I get another beer?

71
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.311
Yes, sir.

72
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:12.451
Dad, if you get drunk, I'm leaving you here.

73
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:13.931
I'll be fine. Make it a large.

74
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:16.071
Conan-kun, have you had some of this?
I'll be fine. Make it a large.

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:28.451
Anyway, I'm a genuinely good guy.

79
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.351
I can't ignore someone who's in trouble.

83
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:41.331
No. Could I get another beer?

84
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:43.871
Okay, one beer.

85
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:49.881
I'm going to the bathroom.

86
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.261
Take a right outside the restaurant.

87
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:53.251

Someone help!

92

Conan-kun.

93
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.011
What's the matter?

94
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:44.091
Kusano was taking a while
to return, so I came here.

95
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:48.501
Ran, call an ambulance.

96
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.171
Okay.

97
00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:50.471
And the police.

98
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:51.571
Got it.

99
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:54.411
Damn. He's dead.

100
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:01.151
No...

101
00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:04.081
No way. No way!

102
00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:07.361
Wh-What's going on here?

103
00:08:17.918 --> 00:08:22.008
Kusano-san was struck on both
the front and back of the head.

104
00:08:22.788 --> 00:08:24.998
The weapon is the deck
brush next to the body.

105
00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:30.648
For some reason, there's a roll of toilet
paper stuck inside the hand drier.

106
00:08:31.748 --> 00:08:33.978
There are signs of a struggle.

107
00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:37.528
What's that?

108
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:40.278
Hey!

109
00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:44.568
I'm always telling you not to
wander around crime scenes.

110
00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:46.508
Sorry.

111
00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:02.848
Let's go over your story again.

112
00:09:02.848 --> 00:09:06.418
Your coworker Kusano-san was spending
a long time in the bathroom,

113
00:09:06.418 --> 00:09:08.688
so you went to check on him, correct?

114
00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:10.258
Yes.

115
00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:14.228
I left the restaurant and was
heading towards the bathroom

116
00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:18.078
when I nearly ran into a man
wearing a cap low over his eyes.

117
00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:21.698
The man headed towards the stairs.

118
00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:25.998
I ignored him and stopped
in front of the bathroom.

119
00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:29.918
I heard the hand drier
running inside the bathroom,

120
00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:33.928
so I thought Kusano would be coming
out right away and waited for a while,

121
00:09:34.968 --> 00:09:37.148
but he didn't come out.

122
00:09:37.908 --> 00:09:40.558
You didn't see anyone other than that man?

123
00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:43.078
No, I'm absolutely certain.

124
00:09:43.498 --> 00:09:46.308
That man who passed by
me must be the culprit.

125
00:09:47.148 --> 00:09:49.478
If only I'd gotten a better look at his face.

126
00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:58.988
Immediately after that, you heard
Yamanashi-san's voice and came here, right?

127
00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:03.588
Yeah. When we arrived,
Yamanashi-san was sitting here.

128
00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:07.368
I checked Kusano-san's pulse,
but he was already dead.

129
00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:11.628
Mori-san, you didn't see the
man in the cap, did you?

130
00:10:11.628 --> 00:10:15.128
There wasn't anyone here when we arrived.

131
00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:17.658
What about you two, Ran-san and Conan-kun?

132
00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:20.588
I didn't run into anyone on the way here.

133
00:10:20.588 --> 00:10:24.188
I didn't see the man in the cap either.

134
00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:25.138
I see.

135
00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:30.268
We've started an emergency search for him
and are gathering information in the area.

136
00:10:30.268 --> 00:10:33.268
I hope we find some useful information.

137
00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:37.898
Since his wallet is still here, it looks
like the motive was a grudge and not theft.

138
00:10:38.178 --> 00:10:42.448
Most likely. That's how we're
investigating the case.

139
00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:48.628
But what we don't understand concerns
the elevator next to the bathroom.

140
00:10:49.088 --> 00:10:51.158
Why did the culprit walk all the way to
the stairs instead of using the elevator?

141
00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:53.538
Bathroom
Elevator
Why did the culprit walk all the way to
the stairs instead of using the elevator?

142
00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:54.968
Restaurant
Stairs
Bathroom
Elevator
Why did the culprit walk all the way to
the stairs instead of using the elevator?

143
00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:55.668
Bathroom
Elevator
Stairs
Restaurant

144
00:10:55.798 --> 00:10:58.218
That's obvious.

145
00:10:58.218 --> 00:11:02.558
If someone found Kusano-san while
he was waiting for the elevator,

146
00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.678
he'd have nowhere to run.

147
00:11:03.888 --> 00:11:09.648
But, Mori-kun, the culprit deliberately
activated the hand drier before he fled.

148
00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:11.838
Creating noise for a prolonged period of time

149
00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.688
would mean someone would
notice something was off sooner.

150
00:11:13.888 --> 00:11:17.688
In other words, didn't he do it so
the body would be discovered quickly?

151
00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:19.448
I see.

152
00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:24.818
If the culprit bothered
to do that, that means...

153
00:11:25.128 --> 00:11:26.538
That means...?

154
00:11:27.428 --> 00:11:28.808
What does it mean?

155
00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:31.528
If the culprit wanted to
hang around the bathroom,

156
00:11:31.528 --> 00:11:35.828
blending in with the customers at the various
restaurants on this floor would be the natural choice.

157
00:11:36.368 --> 00:11:40.838
The culprit could've used the confusion cause
by the discovery of Kusano-san's body to flee.

158
00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:46.218
None of the restaurants reported
a customer wearing a cap.

159
00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:51.718
So the man came here, attacked
Kusano-san, and left.

160
00:11:51.908 --> 00:11:55.798
And it doesn't make sense
since he couldn't have known

161
00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.228
when Kusano-san would go to the bathroom.

162
00:11:58.058 --> 00:12:00.858
You don't know what you're
talking about, kid.

163
00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:03.738
No, he's right. It doesn't make sense.

164
00:12:03.738 --> 00:12:07.428
Yes, Inspector. Now that you
mention it, you're right.

165
00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:10.738
Perhaps it was an indiscriminate murder.

166
00:12:12.388 --> 00:12:17.178
For the time being, we'll have to keep
all manner of possibilities in mind.

167
00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:21.198
Hey, mister forensics officer.

168
00:12:21.998 --> 00:12:25.228
Did you retrieve the belongings
that were in the drain?

169
00:12:25.228 --> 00:12:26.888
Of course.

170
00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:28.508
You mean this?

171
00:12:28.758 --> 00:12:30.128
I knew it.

172
00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.898
He's lying.

173
00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:35.838
You brat!

174
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:38.518
How many times do I have to
tell you not to scamper around?

175
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:40.808
Sorry.

176
00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:43.818
Scamper, scamper.

177
00:12:43.978 --> 00:12:45.218
Scamper, scamper.

178
00:12:45.218 --> 00:12:47.368
Scamper away, little froggies.

179
00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:48.928
Scamper away together.

180
00:12:50.488 --> 00:12:51.508
Mori-kun?

181
00:12:51.508 --> 00:12:52.578
Could it be?

182
00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:55.968
Yes, indeed.

183
00:12:56.398 --> 00:12:58.808
I've figured out the truth behind this case.

184
00:13:03.288 --> 00:13:04.668
Allow me to be direct.

185
00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:11.428
The culprit in this murder is the man
who discovered the body, Yamanashi-san.

186
00:13:13.678 --> 00:13:17.938
Him? But what about the man wearing the cap?

187
00:13:18.148 --> 00:13:19.908
No such man exists.

188
00:13:20.338 --> 00:13:24.438
We were fooled by Yamanashi-san's lie.

189
00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:29.028
You're lying!

190
00:13:29.028 --> 00:13:30.388
What proof do you have?

191
00:13:30.388 --> 00:13:32.118
I really did see him.

192
00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:34.448
Allow me to explain.

193
00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:40.218
It's possible that this case couldn't have
been solved by anyone other than me,

194
00:13:40.218 --> 00:13:42.128
who arrived just after Yamanashi-san.

195
00:13:43.668 --> 00:13:47.758
In fact, one clue is
disappearing as we speak.

196
00:13:48.358 --> 00:13:49.798
A clue?

197
00:13:51.088 --> 00:13:54.448
In order to cover the sound
of Kusano-san's scream,

198
00:13:54.448 --> 00:13:58.538
you attacked him the moment he put
his hands inside the hand drier.

199
00:14:07.858 --> 00:14:11.358
Then you activated the hand drier once again

200
00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:15.868
so a third party would discover the body.

201
00:14:20.408 --> 00:14:24.268
However, something unexpected occurred.

202
00:14:26.288 --> 00:14:29.048
How could you?

203
00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:35.788
You'll pay for this!

204
00:14:48.028 --> 00:14:51.108
You believed the hand
drier hadn't drowned out

205
00:14:51.108 --> 00:14:54.468
the loud noises made during your scuffle,

206
00:14:58.678 --> 00:15:03.828
so you hastily changed your plan
and decided you'd discover the body.

207
00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:08.688
It's an emergency!

208
00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:11.088
Someone help!

209
00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:14.858
Conan-kun.

210
00:15:19.948 --> 00:15:21.008
What's the matter?

211
00:15:21.708 --> 00:15:24.868
Kusano was taking a while
to return, so I came here.

212
00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:29.528
Ran, call an ambulance!

213
00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.158
Okay.

214
00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:31.458
And the police.

215
00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:32.468
Got it.

216
00:15:33.608 --> 00:15:35.488
Damn. He's dead.

217
00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:45.878
Naturally, there's no man wearing a cap.

218
00:15:46.368 --> 00:15:49.998
It's a lie you made up to
confuse the investigation.

219
00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:51.898
That's a false accusation.

220
00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:54.948
How can you call someone
a liar without any proof?

221
00:15:54.948 --> 00:15:57.008
Do you have any proof?

222
00:15:57.008 --> 00:16:01.678
The first piece of evidence I mentioned
earlier is already disappearing.

223
00:16:02.098 --> 00:16:05.158
When I saw you in front of the bathroom,

224
00:16:05.158 --> 00:16:07.018
I felt as though something was off.

225
00:16:13.718 --> 00:16:16.308
The cuff of your pants was wet,

226
00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:22.158
probably because Kusano-san
grabbed it when he woke up.

227
00:16:22.158 --> 00:16:23.198
What?

228
00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:26.588
What are you talking about?

229
00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:28.788
That's just speculation.

230
00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:29.788
This is nonsense.

231
00:16:29.968 --> 00:16:31.968
Then allow me to confirm something.

232
00:16:31.968 --> 00:16:37.308
When you opened the bathroom door, you were
shocked to see Kusano-san on the floor.

233
00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:39.068
Then you shouted for help.

234
00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:43.348
In other words, you haven't set
foot inside the bathroom, correct?

235
00:16:43.568 --> 00:16:44.588
That's right.

236
00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:47.898
Maybe you just thought
my pant cuffs were wet.

237
00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:50.518
Look. They're not wet.

238
00:16:50.698 --> 00:16:55.128
Now that they're dry, I can't prove it.

239
00:16:55.908 --> 00:16:59.258
But what about your shirt sleeve button?

240
00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:02.308
Shirt sleeve button?

241
00:17:02.798 --> 00:17:06.038
When did you lose that?

242
00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:07.968
I...

243
00:17:08.688 --> 00:17:14.148
Forensics recovered the button
from the bathroom drain earlier.

244
00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:17.738
Hey, Mister Forensics Officer.

245
00:17:18.928 --> 00:17:22.268
Did you retrieve the belongings
that were in the drain?

246
00:17:22.268 --> 00:17:23.898
Of course.

247
00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:25.428
You mean this?

248
00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:34.928
Kusano-san's body was
covering the bathroom drain.

249
00:17:35.918 --> 00:17:41.198
If you haven't set foot inside the bathroom,
then how did your button get in there?

250
00:17:44.658 --> 00:17:49.938
Yes, because that button came off
during your scuffle with Kusano-san.

251
00:17:50.698 --> 00:17:53.188
It proves you're the culprit.

252
00:17:57.078 --> 00:17:59.788
Well, Yamanashi-san?

253
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.338
Why did you kill your coworker Kusano-san?

254
00:18:05.058 --> 00:18:07.368
I hated him.

255
00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:10.128
Because of his meddling...

256
00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:15.468
My sister was coming home
late from work one night

257
00:18:15.468 --> 00:18:16.028
Help me!
My sister was coming home
late from work one night

258
00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:16.838
Help me!

259
00:18:16.838 --> 00:18:17.138
when she happened to witness a phantom
slasher stab someone to death.
Help me!

260
00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:20.898
when she happened to witness a phantom
slasher stab someone to death.

261
00:18:25.698 --> 00:18:25.938
Police Box

262
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.328
The culprit pursued her.

00:18:27.698 --> 00:18:29.198

fault that my sister died,

273
00:18:52.058 --> 00:18:53.978
I wanted to kill him.

274
00:18:55.108 --> 00:18:57.368
Damn. Damn it!

275
00:18:57.368 --> 00:18:59.618
He was a truly terrible person!

276
00:18:59.618 --> 00:19:01.088
Considerate? Yeah, right!

277
00:19:01.088 --> 00:19:03.158
He was always sticking his
nose where it didn't belong!

278
00:19:03.668 --> 00:19:07.658
Despite the injustice you experienced,
what you did was still a crime.

279
00:19:08.268 --> 00:19:10.658
It's unforgivable.

280
00:19:11.548 --> 00:19:16.438
There's someone here who
chose not to commit a crime,

281
00:19:16.968 --> 00:19:18.418
even though he faced injustice like you.

282
00:19:18.668 --> 00:19:19.418
Huh?

283
00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:20.548
What?

284
00:19:22.188 --> 00:19:24.068
Yes, you.

285
00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:27.058
You had your eye on Kusano-san.

286
00:19:28.158 --> 00:19:29.828
You in the hoodie.

287
00:19:37.908 --> 00:19:40.258
The man from the restaurant?

288
00:19:40.838 --> 00:19:45.698
You clearly bore some
grudge against Kusano-san.

289
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:55.338
Yes.

290
00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:59.288
Because of his meddling,
I was fired from my job.

291
00:20:00.478 --> 00:20:05.798
Lately I'd been keeping an eye on him
and had been rehearsing my own murder.

292
00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:07.548
You what?

293
00:20:07.798 --> 00:20:09.488
Not only that, but today

294
00:20:09.488 --> 00:20:15.558
I'd planned to kill him using exactly
the same method you deduced, Mori-san.

295
00:20:16.108 --> 00:20:16.808
What?

296
00:20:17.148 --> 00:20:18.348
Unbelievable.

297
00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:05.558
So when the murder occurred,

298
00:21:05.558 --> 00:21:09.028
I thought I might've done it. I was scared.

299
00:21:09.348 --> 00:21:11.448
But you didn't do it.

300
00:21:11.448 --> 00:21:15.288
You made yourself stay in the
restaurant. You controlled yourself.

301
00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:19.238
But if he hadn't acted,

302
00:21:19.238 --> 00:21:22.918
I think I probably would've
attacked Kusano-san.

303
00:21:23.098 --> 00:21:26.378
You've been watching Kusano-san for a while.

304
00:21:26.378 --> 00:21:30.938
You've probably had plenty of
chances to kill him until now.

305
00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:33.628
I...

306
00:21:34.908 --> 00:21:42.648
I believe you deliberately
chose not to commit a crime.

307
00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.298
M-Mori-san...

308
00:23:26.608 --> 00:23:27.928
Hup.

309
00:23:31.248 --> 00:23:33.468
Ma'am, allow me to hold that.

310
00:23:33.468 --> 00:23:34.788
What are you doing?

311
00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.728
You're not trying to rob me, are you?

312
00:23:36.728 --> 00:23:39.498
What? Of course not.

313
00:23:42.138 --> 00:23:44.638
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

314
00:23:45.068 --> 00:23:49.398
Jeez, it's so hard to be considerate.

315
00:23:50.238 --> 00:23:51.688
