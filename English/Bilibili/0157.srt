1
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.266
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.966
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.966
In today's episode, Doctor Agasa causes a ruckus.

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.066
A bomb is involved in the mystery.

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.566
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.466
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.766
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:56.304
We snuck into an abandoned building

9
00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:59.304
to practice for our school play.

10
00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.004
An escaped prisoner,

11
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.004
being chased by Officer Sato and Officer Takagi bursts in.

12
00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.404
He makes it to the next building from the rooftop.

13
00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:11.304
Officer Sato captures the suspect in the toilet...

14
00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:13.804
but due to a slight mistake,

15
00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:16.504
the two are stuck and unable to get free.

16
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:22.204
The suspect, Mr. Higashida pleads his innocence.

17
00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.304
He says he tried to escape so he could go to Chicago

18
00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:27.904
to attend his daughter's wedding.

19
00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:32.104
That's how Officer Takagi and the Youth Detective Squad

20
00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:34.704
are sent out to find the real killer.

21
00:02:36.904 --> 00:02:43.004
"Metropolitan Police Officer Love Story 2 (Part 2)"

22
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.204
There are four things out of place.

23
00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:47.804
The first thing is the color of the mattress,

24
00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:51.504
sheets, pillow and the curtain beside the bed.

25
00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.004
Everything from the kitchenware,

26
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:56.604
to the dishes down to the interior is in beige.

27
00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:59.804
Why then is only the bed and curtain in gray?

28
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.104
I suppose it's just coincidence.

29
00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:06.704
But there were beige sheets and curtains in the closet.

30
00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:08.904
The second thing is, why was this calendar

31
00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:10.504
taken off the wall next to the bed.

32
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:16.304
See, this is this year's Tokyo Spirits calendar,

33
00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:17.704
it was in the closet.

34
00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:21.204
It matches the spot on the wall perfectly.

35
00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:23.904
She probably took it down

36
00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.704
because the team's not doing so good lately.

37
00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.704
But look.

38
00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:31.504
Her whole schedule until December is written in.

39
00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:33.604
You're right.

40
00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:34.804
The third thing is,

41
00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:37.504
there're slight traces the furniture's been moved.

42
00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:39.704
The men from the crime lab mentioned that too,

43
00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:41.804
they said she'd probably rearranged the room.

44
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.904
But don't you think it's strange

45
00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:48.004
she wouldn't notice she'd crushed something this valuable

46
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.104
when she moved the chest?

47
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:51.604
It's just a box of matches.

48
00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:52.704
Open it up.

49
00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:56.004
There's a piece of paper inside.

50
00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.604
Why this is?

51
00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.004
It's her marriage registration.

52
00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:03.104
She was getting married.

53
00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:05.504
But the groom's name hasn't been filled in.

54
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:08.004
His seal is on it though.

55
00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:09.904
The fourth thing is the cactus.

56
00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:11.104
On the day of the murder,

57
00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:14.004
it had been raining heavily since morning.

58
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.804
Would a cactus lover such as her leave the pots outside?

59
00:04:17.804 --> 00:04:20.404
Which means someone besides the victim

60
00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:25.004
moved things around for some unknown reason.

61
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:27.104
Yes, here it is.

62
00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:30.704
This is the gold dolphin cactus the pub owner gave her

63
00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.004
on the day she was killed.

64
00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.604
But the thorns are bent, poor thing.

65
00:04:35.804 --> 00:04:37.304
It can't be...

66
00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:38.804
You don't mean, this room?

67
00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:41.504
Shall we go check it out then?

68
00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:45.004
His apartment is in this condominium building too, isn't it?

69
00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:47.504
Yes, let's go.

70
00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:02.004
What's this?

71
00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:06.304
Hey, you kids. You will catch cold if you sleep here.

72
00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:07.404
Land lord.

73
00:05:07.404 --> 00:05:09.104
I'm very surprised.

74
00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:11.004
Tear you up all night investigating?

75
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.104
Yes.

76
00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:15.604
But fortunately, we were able to solve the crime...

77
00:05:15.604 --> 00:05:17.504
completely.

78
00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:19.904
Your cooperation was greatly appreciated.

79
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:21.304
Don't mention it.

80
00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:24.304
I'm glad I was able to help.

81
00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:28.704
Now how do we get the killer to confess?

82
00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:29.904
Hey!

83
00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:31.404
Is anybody in there?

84
00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:32.604
Hey!

85
00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:35.804
Good grief, this is the fifth time

86
00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:37.604
the cops asked us to search the place.

87
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:40.404
The place was locked up, no one could've gotten in.

88
00:05:40.404 --> 00:05:41.904
Hey!

89
00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:43.604
The lock's been broken.

90
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:44.804
Are you serious?

91
00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:51.204
That weird guy playing cops and robbers with those kids probably did this.

92
00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:52.404
That a bother.

93
00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:53.804
The place is going to be blown up

94
00:05:53.804 --> 00:05:56.204
but I will put a new lock on anyway.

95
00:05:56.204 --> 00:05:58.704
By the way, what was the name of that bomb again?

96
00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:01.304
Boy, did you forget already?

97
00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:03.404
It's the Tropical Rainbow.

98
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.304
What? Takagi was seen in Haido?

99
00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:15.404
Are you sure?

100
00:06:15.404 --> 00:06:20.804
Yes. A young couple sat a man that looked just like Officer Takagi.

101
00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:23.704
And? What about Sato? There they together?

102
00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:28.104
Well, it seems he wasn't with Officer Sato,

103
00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:29.904
he was with or 5 little kids...

104
00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:31.304
You idiot!

105
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:33.604
What kind of police officer plays with little kids

106
00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:34.804
while he's in the middle of a case?

107
00:06:34.804 --> 00:06:36.804
It's the wrong guy, keep looking!

108
00:06:36.804 --> 00:06:39.104
Incompetents, the whole lot of then.

109
00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:40.804
Excuse me, Inspector Megure.

110
00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:42.804
Yes, Shiratori, what is it?

111
00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:44.804
I realize it's a long shot but,

112
00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.604
the kids couldn't be those pint sized detectives

113
00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:49.804
from Mouri's office, could it...

114
00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:51.804
It can't be.

115
00:06:51.804 --> 00:06:56.204
But it could explain why Officer Sato hasn't called in.

116
00:06:56.204 --> 00:06:58.604
Do you mean she's...

117
00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:01.504
She's probably being kept hostage by the killer.

118
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.904
Oh God, so it's true.

119
00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:13.204
Listen, kids.

120
00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:16.404
If you're sleepy, why don't you go on home?

121
00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:17.704
No way.

122
00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:20.304
Don't be mean, we want to help too.

123
00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:21.304
Not listen.

124
00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:24.504
Please let us help you.

125
00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:26.404
I bet you want to catch the killer by yourself

126
00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.004
so you can take all the credit and look good.

127
00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:33.404
Well... That's what we police are supposed to do, it's our job.

128
00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:36.304
The time... we don't have much time left.

129
00:07:37.404 --> 00:07:40.404
Come on, let's get going

130
00:07:40.404 --> 00:07:42.804
to the real killer's home.

131
00:07:44.304 --> 00:07:47.304
Five minutes until the time limit.

132
00:07:47.304 --> 00:07:49.904
It looks like they couldn't do it.

133
00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:54.304
Don't cry.

134
00:07:54.304 --> 00:07:57.704
We weren't able to get you to your daughter's wedding

135
00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:00.104
but I promise we'll get the real killer

136
00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.804
and prove your innocence.

137
00:08:03.804 --> 00:08:05.204
You know, it's strange...

138
00:08:05.204 --> 00:08:09.804
The custodians should have arrived already to clean the toilets.

139
00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:12.004
Maybe they're closed today?

140
00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:14.904
That's impossible, today's Sunday.

141
00:08:14.904 --> 00:08:19.604
And listen, you can hear all the people's voices.

142
00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:22.604
They're probably lined up outside waiting for it to open.

143
00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:26.604
"Farewell to the Haido City Art Museum"

144
00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:29.204
"Bombing even countdown, 34 Minutes 04 Seconds"

145
00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:31.804
"Kitagawa"

146
00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:34.504
Why? You're that police officer I met last night.

147
00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:36.104
Hello again.

148
00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:37.404
Didn't you hear me?

149
00:08:37.404 --> 00:08:40.204
I said I already talked to the police.

150
00:08:40.204 --> 00:08:43.604
I know but I'd like to know

151
00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:46.104
about when you discovered the more body.

152
00:08:46.104 --> 00:08:47.704
I already told you,

153
00:08:47.704 --> 00:08:50.904
both Higashida and Ms. Muranishi didn't report to work

154
00:08:50.904 --> 00:08:53.904
and they didn't answer their phone so I went to the apartment.

155
00:08:53.904 --> 00:08:56.104
I rang the buzzer but there was no answer

156
00:08:56.104 --> 00:08:57.404
so I asked the landlord to use the master key

157
00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.104
and open to check there was no landlord to use the door,

158
00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:01.404
Ms. Muranishi's place was first.

159
00:09:01.404 --> 00:09:03.904
The door chain was on and for some reason,

160
00:09:03.904 --> 00:09:09.504
Higashida was asleep on her bed I shouted from outside the door

161
00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:11.404
and got him to wake up and unhook the chain,

162
00:09:11.404 --> 00:09:13.404
then the landlord and I went in

163
00:09:13.404 --> 00:09:17.304
and found Ms. Muranishi dead on the bathroom floor.

164
00:09:18.404 --> 00:09:20.704
And that's it, end of story.

165
00:09:21.704 --> 00:09:23.404
Mr. Kitagawa.

166
00:09:23.404 --> 00:09:26.804
That's all I have to say, now please leave.

167
00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:29.604
Please let me ask you some questions.

168
00:09:29.604 --> 00:09:34.504
What is it? Don't tell me you suspect me?

169
00:09:34.504 --> 00:09:37.504
No, nothing like that.

170
00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:39.404
Of course we do!

171
00:09:40.404 --> 00:09:42.404
You're the killer, aren't you?

172
00:09:42.404 --> 00:09:44.404
Don't try to lie to us!

173
00:09:44.404 --> 00:09:47.104
You can't get away with committing a murder!

174
00:09:47.104 --> 00:09:51.004
Kids, quiet. Behave.

175
00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:53.104
Stop that... there's a way to do these things.

176
00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:55.404
Who the heck are these kids?

177
00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:57.104
-We're the Youth Detective Squad. -We're the Youth Detective Squad.

178
00:09:57.104 --> 00:09:59.904
There's no case we can't solve.

179
00:10:01.204 --> 00:10:02.604
This is...

180
00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.604
Good grief, I don't know what this is all about

181
00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.604
but give me a break.

182
00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:11.304
Under those circumstances I couldn't possibly be the killer.

183
00:10:11.304 --> 00:10:15.404
Then why change the color of the sheets and the curtain?

184
00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:17.204
You did it, didn't you?

185
00:10:17.204 --> 00:10:19.704
You changed the color of the sheets and curtains

186
00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:22.104
from beige to gray.

187
00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:24.604
Hey!

188
00:10:25.704 --> 00:10:27.704
I've had just about enough.

189
00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:30.404
Take these kids and get out here right now

190
00:10:30.404 --> 00:10:32.504
or I'll sue you for defamation of character.

191
00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:36.904
We were just at the department store near here

192
00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:38.804
and got all the proof we need.

193
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.204
What?

194
00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:42.904
You bought gray blanket covers,

195
00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:45.404
sheets and curtains,

196
00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:46.904
we have the salesclerk's testimony.

197
00:10:46.904 --> 00:10:48.604
So what?

198
00:10:48.604 --> 00:10:53.104
I bought them to replace the ones in my place which were old.

199
00:10:53.104 --> 00:10:56.104
But I didn't like then so I threw then away.

200
00:10:56.104 --> 00:10:58.804
You also took Ms. Muranishi's calendar off

201
00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:01.804
and put her cactus pots out on the veranda, didn't you?

202
00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:06.104
But then you had no choice.

203
00:11:06.104 --> 00:11:08.704
Higashida is anti-Spirits,

204
00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:10.004
if he saw that calendar

205
00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:12.204
and the cactus he'd never bought in his supposed room,

206
00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:14.304
although he was drunk,

207
00:11:14.304 --> 00:11:17.604
you couldn't risk the chance he'd notice.

208
00:11:17.604 --> 00:11:20.604
That's right, you removed everything

209
00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:23.504
that would identify it as her room,

210
00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:25.204
then you changed the curtains and bedding,

211
00:11:25.204 --> 00:11:26.504
rearranged the furniture

212
00:11:26.504 --> 00:11:29.004
to make it look like his room

213
00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:31.604
then after you killed Ms. Muranishi

214
00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:34.104
and brought Higashida to her room,

215
00:11:34.104 --> 00:11:36.304
having gotten him drunk earlier that evening at the pub,

216
00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.604
you created an illusion...

217
00:11:39.904 --> 00:11:42.704
and made him believe he was in his own place.

218
00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:46.404
He was drunk,

219
00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:50.104
you had him put the door chain on himself.

220
00:11:50.104 --> 00:11:51.204
After you made sure it was done,

221
00:11:51.204 --> 00:11:54.604
all you had to do was have him lock the door.

222
00:11:54.604 --> 00:11:56.804
He was so drunk, he went straight to bed.

223
00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:59.804
The next morning, he would be found in a locked apartment

224
00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:02.904
along with her body.

225
00:12:02.904 --> 00:12:05.004
That's how it happened.

226
00:12:06.604 --> 00:12:08.604
What about the video cord?

227
00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:12.904
That about the cord they found wrapped around her neck?

228
00:12:12.904 --> 00:12:16.304
His fingerprints were on it.

229
00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:19.204
Haibara, did you find it?

230
00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:20.704
Just as I'd imagined.

231
00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:25.704
One video cord is missing from his unit.

232
00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:29.304
Higashida was an expert with video equipment.

233
00:12:29.304 --> 00:12:32.104
You probably asked him to hook up your video,

234
00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:35.004
then used the cord as the weapon, didn't you?

235
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.004
On top of that,

236
00:12:36.004 --> 00:12:38.604
you took off from work the day of the murder that afternoon,

237
00:12:38.604 --> 00:12:42.404
you climbed the emergency stairs to get to her apartment.

238
00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:45.904
You used the spare key she gave you to get in,

239
00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:49.504
fixed the apartment up, then waited for her to get back from work

240
00:12:49.504 --> 00:12:52.804
and when she did, you strangled her, there's our evidence.

241
00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:55.404
What evidence? That's ridiculous!

242
00:12:55.404 --> 00:12:56.904
Show me the evidence then!

243
00:12:56.904 --> 00:13:00.104
Show me the evidence that proves I killed her.

244
00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:02.104
There is no such thing.

245
00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:06.804
I did take that day off but I did not see her.

246
00:13:10.504 --> 00:13:13.104
Sir, what happened to you?

247
00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:16.904
How'd you hurt that finger...

248
00:13:27.904 --> 00:13:30.704
I wonder what the music's for?

249
00:13:30.704 --> 00:13:34.704
Oh well, it's nice to have music to wait by.

250
00:13:34.704 --> 00:13:35.904
"Farewell to the Haido City Art Museum"

251
00:13:35.904 --> 00:13:38.104
"Bombing even countdown, 10 Minutes"

252
00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:41.504
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

253
00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:43.004
In another 10 minutes,

254
00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:45.404
we will be biding farewell to the Haido City Art Museum

255
00:13:45.404 --> 00:13:47.804
which has served us for 40 years.

256
00:13:47.804 --> 00:13:49.604
Thank you for your service.

257
00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:51.804
Did he say biding farewell?

258
00:13:51.804 --> 00:13:55.204
And now I would like to call up the city's genius, Doctor Agasa

259
00:13:55.204 --> 00:13:57.604
to say a few words,

260
00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:01.104
he has given us full cooperation in celebrating this event.

261
00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:12.004
I am Doctor Agasa, as just introduced.

262
00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:15.704
The Tropical Rainbow bomb that I invented

263
00:14:15.704 --> 00:14:18.704
will provide a beautiful and colorful end

264
00:14:18.704 --> 00:14:21.304
befitting our art museum.

265
00:14:21.304 --> 00:14:23.104
-What? -What?

266
00:14:23.104 --> 00:14:25.104
What did he say?

267
00:14:26.104 --> 00:14:28.204
I'm sure he said bomb.

268
00:14:28.204 --> 00:14:30.204
Oh no...

269
00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:31.904
This can't be happening!

270
00:14:37.894 --> 00:14:42.294
Come on. That about your thumb you have a bandage on it

271
00:14:42.294 --> 00:14:43.994
so it must be hurt.

272
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:48.094
So what if I did hurt it?

273
00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:50.194
Take these kids and get out of here.

274
00:14:50.194 --> 00:14:51.694
Please pardon me.

275
00:14:51.694 --> 00:14:53.794
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

276
00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.494
I knew it.

277
00:14:57.494 --> 00:15:01.494
Explain this. How did you hurt your thumb?

278
00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:03.094
Well...

279
00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:06.594
We will know right away when've get that finger

280
00:15:06.594 --> 00:15:08.494
and the damaged cactus analyzed back at headquarters.

281
00:15:08.494 --> 00:15:11.594
Ms. Muranishi brought that cactus home that day.

282
00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:12.694
After you killed her,

283
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:15.394
you rushed to put the cactus on the veranda, we're going to prove this.

284
00:15:15.394 --> 00:15:18.294
So now, answer my question.

285
00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:22.494
You said you didn't see her the day she was killed

286
00:15:22.494 --> 00:15:24.094
but if that's so,

287
00:15:24.094 --> 00:15:26.694
why was your blood on the cactus thorn when

288
00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:29.594
Ms. Muranishi just got it from the pub owner that evening?

289
00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:34.294
What?

290
00:15:34.294 --> 00:15:37.094
Takagi was at the crime scene?

291
00:15:37.094 --> 00:15:38.994
Yes, he searched the place

292
00:15:38.994 --> 00:15:40.394
and then it seems he headed for the home of Mr. Kitagawa,

293
00:15:40.394 --> 00:15:42.294
the man who discovered the body.

294
00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:43.694
Alright.

295
00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:45.894
The fool, what's he up to?

296
00:15:45.894 --> 00:15:47.694
He supposed to be looking for the prisoner.

297
00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:50.294
At any rate, let's go there.

298
00:15:50.294 --> 00:15:53.294
Three minutes to ignition.

299
00:15:53.294 --> 00:15:57.594
To do the honors will be our own Doctor Agasa.

300
00:15:57.594 --> 00:16:00.194
Hello...

301
00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:02.894
I don't believe it. The battery's dead.

302
00:16:02.894 --> 00:16:06.894
What about your gun? We could shoot the chain...

303
00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:09.894
I shot two into the drain pipe, once at the lock,

304
00:16:09.894 --> 00:16:11.394
fired two warning shots,

305
00:16:11.394 --> 00:16:13.594
I used up all five bullets.

306
00:16:13.594 --> 00:16:16.394
Why didn't you save one bullet for later?

307
00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:18.694
Because you kept running!

308
00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:22.394
Oh brother! Takagi, where are you?

309
00:16:23.694 --> 00:16:25.694
I can't get through.

310
00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.694
I wonder what's going on with Officer Sato.

311
00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:29.394
It's already past 10 am.

312
00:16:29.394 --> 00:16:32.894
I bet someone from the art museum found then.

313
00:16:32.894 --> 00:16:35.294
Yeah, sure, but let's hurry back anyway.

314
00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:46.194
Takagi! What do you think you're doing?

315
00:16:46.194 --> 00:16:47.994
Inspector Megure.

316
00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:49.994
I've captured the real murderer.

317
00:16:49.994 --> 00:16:51.394
Never mind that...

318
00:16:52.394 --> 00:16:53.894
Real murderer?

319
00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:54.994
Yes.

320
00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:57.494
Ms. Muranishi was persistently pursuing Mr. Kitagawa here

321
00:16:57.494 --> 00:17:00.594
to marry her so he killed her.

322
00:17:00.594 --> 00:17:04.594
He tried to frame his co-worker, Mr. Higashida with the crime.

323
00:17:04.594 --> 00:17:06.594
He's confessed to everything.

324
00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:09.594
Inspector! Hurry, contact the chief of the Haido Police Station

325
00:17:09.594 --> 00:17:13.594
and have him start the paperwork to get Mr. Higashida released.

326
00:17:13.594 --> 00:17:15.794
Sure.

327
00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:17.894
So, where is Officer Sato?

328
00:17:17.894 --> 00:17:21.894
She is with Mr. Higashida at the Haido Art Museum.

329
00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:24.894
Stop kidding around.

330
00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:26.594
After all right about now, that place's...

331
00:17:29.094 --> 00:17:31.494
Well, it's time. Friends!

332
00:17:31.494 --> 00:17:35.194
Gather around me and I will countdown together!

333
00:17:36.394 --> 00:17:39.394
What? There's people still inside the museum?

334
00:17:39.394 --> 00:17:40.494
That's impossible.

335
00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:44.094
Hello, you still there?

336
00:17:44.094 --> 00:17:46.294
What's going on? Answer me!

337
00:17:46.294 --> 00:17:49.094
Darn, there's no time left. Hurry.

338
00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:52.994
Hurry...

339
00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:55.894
Let's start.

340
00:17:55.894 --> 00:18:00.694
10, 9, 8, 7,

341
00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:05.394
6, 5, 4, 3,

342
00:18:05.394 --> 00:18:08.094
2, 1!

343
00:18:13.694 --> 00:18:15.594
Doctor Agasa?

344
00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.494
Just in the nick of time.

345
00:18:27.994 --> 00:18:30.594
There! At least you can move around now.

346
00:18:30.594 --> 00:18:31.894
Where's Takagi?

347
00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:33.394
Oh, him...

348
00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:36.694
Officer Sato!

349
00:18:36.694 --> 00:18:38.494
Takagi!

350
00:18:38.494 --> 00:18:40.194
Officer Sato!

351
00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:41.694
Takagi!

352
00:18:41.694 --> 00:18:44.594
Officer Sato. I did it!

353
00:18:44.594 --> 00:18:46.994
I did it! Officer Sato!

354
00:18:48.094 --> 00:18:50.894
The toilet... Where is it?

355
00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:52.594
I've been holding it in since yesterday.

356
00:18:52.594 --> 00:18:53.994
There plumbing's off in the building

357
00:18:53.994 --> 00:18:55.494
and you so late,

358
00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:57.194
so come on and tell me quick.

359
00:18:57.194 --> 00:19:00.294
I think there's one in the game center around the corner.

360
00:19:01.794 --> 00:19:03.794
Officer Sato...

361
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.394
Officer Takagi.

362
00:19:06.394 --> 00:19:07.394
Yes?

363
00:19:07.394 --> 00:19:10.194
Officer Sato was crying wasn't she?

364
00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:12.294
Takagi.

365
00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:13.694
Yes.

366
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.894
You scum. What'd you do to Miwa?

367
00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:19.994
Nothing, I don't know what you mean.

368
00:19:27.394 --> 00:19:31.094
Officer Sato!

369
00:19:32.594 --> 00:19:34.894
I see a marriage registration in the box of matches.

370
00:19:34.894 --> 00:19:37.694
It was hidden under the matches.

371
00:19:37.694 --> 00:19:40.394
The two had the keys to each other's room.

372
00:19:40.394 --> 00:19:44.694
I think she left those matches in her place to surprise him

373
00:19:44.694 --> 00:19:48.094
when he used then to light his cigarettes.

374
00:19:48.094 --> 00:19:49.794
Right, Conan?

375
00:19:50.794 --> 00:19:54.094
That Takagi surprised me.

376
00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:57.794
He turned the whole case upside down in one night.

377
00:19:57.794 --> 00:19:59.394
It couldn't be helped.

378
00:19:59.394 --> 00:20:00.994
When the body was discovered,

379
00:20:00.994 --> 00:20:03.494
the police had Mr. Higashida the most likely suspect

380
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.294
handed to them on a silver platter.

381
00:20:06.294 --> 00:20:07.994
We had many reasons for doubting Mr. Higashida's guilt

382
00:20:07.994 --> 00:20:11.794
and we started our investigation objectively,

383
00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:14.694
not like the other detectives.

384
00:20:14.694 --> 00:20:17.094
That's what Officer Takagi said.

385
00:20:18.694 --> 00:20:20.394
What a guy.

386
00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:21.994
He's a smart aleck.

387
00:20:31.294 --> 00:20:33.494
"Narita Airport"

388
00:20:33.494 --> 00:20:37.094
What a relief. He made it for the flight.

389
00:20:37.094 --> 00:20:38.594
Yes.

390
00:20:38.594 --> 00:20:39.794
On the other hand,

391
00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:42.594
Inspector Megure gave an earful.

392
00:20:42.594 --> 00:20:46.094
That was he said, "Don't you trust us?"

393
00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:55.394
May I ask you one question?

394
00:20:55.394 --> 00:21:00.194
Officer Sato, what do you think of Inspector Megure...

395
00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:02.994
do you like him?

396
00:21:02.994 --> 00:21:06.794
Oh my, how did you know?

397
00:21:06.794 --> 00:21:08.894
The truth is I do.

398
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.094
I see.

399
00:21:12.094 --> 00:21:15.394
After all, he's like a father to me.

400
00:21:15.394 --> 00:21:17.294
Like a father?

401
00:21:17.294 --> 00:21:19.894
Yes, a father.

402
00:21:19.894 --> 00:21:22.594
My father was a police officer too.

403
00:21:22.594 --> 00:21:25.394
He was killed on the job when I was in grade school,

404
00:21:25.394 --> 00:21:27.894
that's why I can't help seeing my father in him.

405
00:21:27.894 --> 00:21:30.794
In that broad build of Inspector Megure...

406
00:21:36.594 --> 00:21:39.194
What? You look like you think I have a father-complex.

407
00:21:39.194 --> 00:21:40.794
No.

408
00:21:40.794 --> 00:21:42.294
Well, I guess I will go to dad...

409
00:21:42.294 --> 00:21:45.294
I mean the Inspector and get yelled at.

410
00:23:20.294 --> 00:23:23.894
The blowing up of the art museum which had been postponed

411
00:23:23.894 --> 00:23:25.894
was carried out the next day with no problem.

412
00:23:33.794 --> 00:23:36.594
Tropical Rainbow's a huge success.

413
00:23:38.194 --> 00:23:41.194
By the way, our school play was changed

414
00:23:41.194 --> 00:23:44.694
from Masked Yaiba to Detective Story.

415
00:23:44.694 --> 00:23:47.494
Dad.

416
00:23:47.494 --> 00:23:49.594
That a horrible case.

417
00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:52.094
This tragedy was brought about because this father and daughter

418
00:23:52.094 --> 00:23:54.394
didn't understand one another.

419
00:23:54.394 --> 00:23:57.294
Father!

420
00:23:58.594 --> 00:23:59.794
Ran and I are always misunderstanding each other

421
00:23:59.794 --> 00:24:01.994
and what was the case of death?

422
00:24:03.594 --> 00:24:09.194
"Next Episode"

423
00:24:11.894 --> 00:24:13.494
What is the cause of death?

424
00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:15.194
It appears she was pricked on the earlobe

425
00:24:15.194 --> 00:24:18.094
with a pin-like object coated with a fast acting poison.

426
00:24:19.194 --> 00:24:20.594
This color...

427
00:24:20.594 --> 00:24:21.994
Yes, that's it.

428
00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:23.394
It would be possible to kill Kiyomi

429
00:24:23.394 --> 00:24:27.394
and have an alibi if one were to use that method.

430
00:24:28.394 --> 00:24:29.594
Next Conan,

431
00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:33.515
"The Loop Line of Silence"

432
00:24:34.296 --> 00:24:36.996
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:38.696
"Pink ballpoint pen"

434
00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:41.196
The next stage is the Kanjo train line in Yamanote.

435
00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:42.796
What? A lymph node?
