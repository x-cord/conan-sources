1
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.340
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.040
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.640
A robber steals and runs away.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.740
When he is cornered, he disappears beyond time and space!

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:01.725
Here!

9
00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:08.725
Tell Dr. Agasa this cell phone saved my life, will you?

10
00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:11.925
So I guess she didn't find out

11
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.225
who you are.

12
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:15.225
Yeah, that was close though.

13
00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:18.725
Seems Ran no longer thinks I'm Shinichi Kudo.

14
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.525
Well, I'm pretty sure I could hide it.

15
00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:24.125
Who would believe a story about a guy

16
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.625
who got shrunk by a drug, right?

17
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.325
You better thank me.

18
00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:30.925
You made it through

19
00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.825
because I sent you so many e-mails to your cell phone

20
00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:35.325
so that Ran would believe

21
00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:38.225
that you were Conan.

22
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.225
Yeah.

23
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:41.325
More importantly, are you really sure that

24
00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:43.725
she's not suspicious about you anymore?

25
00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:45.425
Yeah.

26
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:47.725
That actually made my morning quite an ordeal, though.

27
00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.525
Hey Conan, I didn't know you were that smart!

28
00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:53.525
Or like...

29
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:57.025
Here! Extra rice for the future detective!

30
00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:58.125
Or like...

31
00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.325
Conan, you have to hear this!

32
00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:00.825
It's Shinichi's voice!

33
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:03.025
You've reached Shinichi Kudo.

34
00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:06.725
I'm not available right now. Please leave a message after the tone.

35
00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:07.725
Or like...

36
00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:11.925
You told her the cell phone number?

37
00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.925
Hey, don't worry!

38
00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:16.525
I'll turn on the answerphone when I'm with her, okay.

39
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.525
Whatever you say, but you gotta be careful.

40
00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:21.225
If she finds out who you are, then...

41
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:23.125
I know!

42
00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:27.825
I'll keep her away from the Black Organization no matter what.

43
00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:29.925
She's a strong girl, you know.

44
00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:31.825
More than you think.

45
00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.325
No, don't move!

46
00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:34.625
Stop!

47
00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:37.225
You mean, as in Karate?

48
00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.425
Hey man! Look at that!

49
00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:43.425
What is it?

50
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.725
Officer Takagi?

51
00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:52.525
Officer Takagi is acting somewhat strange.

52
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:54.125
Looks like he's having a hard time.

53
00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.825
There must be something going on!

54
00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:56.925
Definitely!

55
00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:03.525
All right.

56
00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.025
Look, he went inside the jewelry store!

57
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.625
Don't tell me he's gonna rob that store.

58
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:14.825
What are you, stupid?

59
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:16.925
There's only reason men go to jewelry store.

60
00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:18.925
To buy a present.

61
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:23.025
It could be for his mother, sister, wife or somebody else.

62
00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:25.925
But his face was all red and looked restless when he went inside.

63
00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:29.225
So probably it's for his girlfriend, I think.

64
00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:39.025
Eighty thousand yen.

65
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:41.125
It's expensive after all.

66
00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:44.125
I still have to pay the loan for the ring I bought last time.

67
00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.725
But...

68
00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:47.325
That must be it!

69
00:04:47.325 --> 00:04:49.625
Trust me. Miwako was staring at this brooch.

70
00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.925
She wasn't even blinking at all!

71
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.025
But you didn't hear this from me, okay?

72
00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:57.925
Look, coincidence makes girls believe in destiny

73
00:04:57.925 --> 00:04:59.625
and that's where the love deepens!

74
00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:02.225
Love...

75
00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:06.925
Sir? Would you like to take a look at it?

76
00:05:06.925 --> 00:05:08.325
No, thanks.

77
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:10.725
Is it a present for child?

78
00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:11.825
What?

79
00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:13.925
Child?

80
00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:17.325
How about this? The one with lots of diamonds. What do you think?

81
00:05:17.325 --> 00:05:20.425
Well, I think it's too gorgeous for Officer Sato.

82
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:22.225
Guys, how did you know that...

83
00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:25.525
I remember Officer Sato was saying her birthday was in April!

84
00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.425
The birthstone of April is diamond.

85
00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:29.325
Then, this one is perfect!

86
00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:30.425
Guys...

87
00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:33.925
Who said I was buying Officer Sato a present?

88
00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.525
Oh, so you're not?

89
00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:38.325
You were right.

90
00:05:43.225 --> 00:05:44.225
Sorry.

91
00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:47.325
Actually, could I see that brooch, please?

92
00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:48.925
Of course.

93
00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:50.225
This is the one, right?

94
00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:54.825
This is pretty good!

95
00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:56.225
It's got a nice design too!

96
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.925
Oh, how nice for Officer Sato!

97
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.525
You think so?

98
00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:12.825
"A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 1)"

99
00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:19.425
Hey!

100
00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:26.725
"Put the jewels in this bag!"

101
00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:28.525
Jewel robbery?

102
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.125
What are you waiting?

103
00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:34.525
Use your tranquilizer gun.

104
00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:35.725
I can't.

105
00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:37.525
He's wearing a helmet and a heavy coat,

106
00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:39.425
the needle wouldn't go through.

107
00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:42.325
We don't know whether it's a real gun or not.

108
00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:44.125
I can't use my high-power kicking shoes

109
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:46.625
in this situation either.

110
00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:48.325
Now, guys, go...

111
00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:01.725
No, don't take that!

112
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:02.725
Yes!

113
00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:03.825
Now!

114
00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:07.925
"Police Sergeant, Wataru Takagi" -Police!

115
00:07:07.925 --> 00:07:09.925
I was on patrol,

116
00:07:09.925 --> 00:07:12.525
so there are several police officers in this area!

117
00:07:12.525 --> 00:07:14.325
It would be best if you just give up

118
00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:15.625
and throw down your weapon!

119
00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:21.725
He smiled?

120
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:29.425
Wait!

121
00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:32.125
Where are your officers? I don't see any!

122
00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.725
Stop!

123
00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:34.925
Of course, there's no officer!

124
00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:36.625
What?

125
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.325
I'm off duty today!

126
00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:41.225
That was a total bluff!

127
00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:42.925
Where did he go?

128
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:48.125
Over there! He's climbing the stairs!

129
00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:52.225
You're not gonna get away!

130
00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:19.425
You guys stay here, okay?

131
00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:20.625
Okay!

132
00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:26.025
There's no way out.

133
00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:28.725
Now.

134
00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:31.025
Just put down your gun and...

135
00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:35.525
Wait a second!

136
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.025
Oh, my God!

137
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:49.325
Did something fall?

138
00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:51.225
Yeah. What was that huge noise?

139
00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:52.625
You see anything?

140
00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:53.725
No.

141
00:08:53.725 --> 00:08:56.025
"Moving company" -Hey, somebody go up and check it!

142
00:08:58.225 --> 00:08:59.525
Police.

143
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:01.225
Does this truck belong to you?

144
00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:02.425
Yeah.

145
00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.125
What happened?

146
00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:07.125
It looks like something fell on the container.

147
00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:09.325
Yeah. Actually...

148
00:09:10.825 --> 00:09:13.325
What is going on? What was that noise?

149
00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:17.725
Somebody's dead!

150
00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:19.325
What?

151
00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.725
That's what happened.

152
00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.625
So, until the ambulance and the police come,

153
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:25.325
please do not move anything including the stuff.

154
00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:26.425
Stuff too?

155
00:09:26.425 --> 00:09:29.425
Yes. We have to maintain the scene the way it is.

156
00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:32.025
Oh, no. You can't do that!

157
00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:34.925
Look, we have to move all the stuff in by today.

158
00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.625
Okay, we'll wait until the ambulance comes,

159
00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:39.325
but after that, you let us to do our job!

160
00:09:39.325 --> 00:09:41.925
All right. Why don't I speak to your client, then?

161
00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:44.825
Okay. Mr. Nekota should be in his office.

162
00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:46.325
Hey, get him over here.

163
00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:47.325
Sure.

164
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:49.725
What is this? What's going on?

165
00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:52.025
Mr. Nekota, somebody's here for you.

166
00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.725
"Sakanobu Nekota (51)" -You've barely moved anything yet.

167
00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:56.425
Come on, hurry up!

168
00:09:56.425 --> 00:10:00.125
Actually, a man fell on our moving truck so...

169
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.825
-A man? -Right.

170
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:04.925
So I'm wondering if you could stop moving your stuff for a while?

171
00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:08.325
Okay, fine. Call your friends and do what you have to do. Just be quick!

172
00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:10.625
You're not the only one who got a schedule, okay?

173
00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:12.725
I guess it's our fault, isn't it?

174
00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:15.825
Yeah. If we hadn't chase him down to the roof...

175
00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.725
He wouldn't have had to jump off the building,

176
00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:21.625
Come on.

177
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:24.625
We got an officer with no weapon and five kids.

178
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.625
Even if we did corner on the roof of the building,

179
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:29.325
he had a gun and he could've used it,

180
00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:32.325
at least to threaten us and run away.

181
00:10:32.325 --> 00:10:36.225
So you are saying that man planned to commit suicide from the beginning?

182
00:10:36.225 --> 00:10:37.625
Yes.

183
00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:41.725
Or maybe he was absolutely confident that he was not going to die.

184
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.325
Nonetheless, I think this case...

185
00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:47.125
is not a simple jewel robbery.

186
00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:52.225
It's not a suicide either.

187
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:00.188
So, you're saying that

188
00:11:00.188 --> 00:11:03.188
you were chasing this guy who robbed the jewelry store

189
00:11:03.188 --> 00:11:05.188
who happened to jumped off the building and killed himself?

190
00:11:05.188 --> 00:11:06.388
Yes.

191
00:11:06.388 --> 00:11:09.888
He went over the fence on the roof of this building.

192
00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:13.288
And crashed onto the container of this truck right here.

193
00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:15.588
What were you doing?

194
00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:17.988
The media is gonna attack us again.

195
00:11:17.988 --> 00:11:23.188
A reckless chase of a hero-wannabe officer led to an unnecessary death.

196
00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:24.888
No way.

197
00:11:24.888 --> 00:11:27.288
We weren't just a hero-wannabe!

198
00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:29.788
We were chasing him all the way from the store!

199
00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:33.188
We were doing really good until we cornered on the roof.

200
00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:36.388
It happened all of a sudden.

201
00:11:36.388 --> 00:11:38.688
There's no way we could stop him!

202
00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:39.688
Right, Conan?

203
00:11:39.688 --> 00:11:42.788
Yeah. He jumped off the building without any hesitation.

204
00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.988
As if he planned to do it from the beginning.

205
00:11:49.288 --> 00:11:50.788
I see. So...

206
00:11:50.788 --> 00:11:53.288
You guys were there when the robber broke

207
00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:55.088
into the jewelry store, correct?

208
00:11:55.088 --> 00:11:59.388
Yes, we saw Officer Takagi walking into that store.

209
00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:03.588
Oh, Takagi goes to a jewelry store on his day off.

210
00:12:03.588 --> 00:12:05.588
For what kind of occasion?

211
00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:10.288
No, that was for...

212
00:12:10.288 --> 00:12:14.588
I didn't know you liked jewelries and stuff, Takagi.

213
00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:15.688
It's surprising!

214
00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:20.288
It was for you, Officer Sato!

215
00:12:20.288 --> 00:12:23.988
So, did you find any jewelry you like?

216
00:12:23.988 --> 00:12:25.688
Actually...

217
00:12:25.688 --> 00:12:28.588
The robber took it just before he bought it!

218
00:12:28.588 --> 00:12:30.388
I dropped it on the floor.

219
00:12:30.388 --> 00:12:32.788
Did the culprit take it with him?

220
00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:34.788
Yeah, he picked it up

221
00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:37.888
and put it in the pocket of his raincoat!

222
00:12:37.888 --> 00:12:40.188
Then that thing is supposed be in his pocket still.

223
00:12:40.188 --> 00:12:43.588
But the thing is, I went on the truck

224
00:12:43.588 --> 00:12:45.888
and checked his pocket before you guys came.

225
00:12:45.888 --> 00:12:49.088
But the brooch was not there at all!

226
00:12:49.088 --> 00:12:50.888
A brooch.

227
00:12:50.888 --> 00:12:53.888
It's a present for your mom, isn't it?

228
00:12:53.888 --> 00:12:57.688
No, that's a present for you.

229
00:12:57.688 --> 00:13:00.088
No way.

230
00:13:00.088 --> 00:13:03.888
Well, perhaps, the robber threw it away or dropped it.

231
00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:07.788
Or maybe it just popped out of his pocket when he fell on the container.

232
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:10.988
In either case, I think you should forget about that brooch.

233
00:13:12.088 --> 00:13:15.188
Even if it's found, prosecutors will keep it for a while

234
00:13:15.188 --> 00:13:17.588
since it's material evidence.

235
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:21.588
Who would want a jewelry that has a bloody past anyway, right?

236
00:13:21.588 --> 00:13:23.388
That's true.

237
00:13:24.788 --> 00:13:27.388
Well, I wouldn't mind at all.

238
00:13:27.388 --> 00:13:30.088
Even if it's got someone's blood on it, you can just wipe it off.

239
00:13:30.088 --> 00:13:31.388
Jewelries have nothing to do with crime.

240
00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:32.688
Yeah, that's what I thought!

241
00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:36.488
Oh, also, there're some other strange things.

242
00:13:36.488 --> 00:13:39.088
The robber was wearing a helmet,

243
00:13:39.088 --> 00:13:41.488
but there's no way he could bleed that much on his head.

244
00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:44.188
Unless he removed his helmet while falling down.

245
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.488
I see.

246
00:13:51.488 --> 00:13:52.588
And one more thing,

247
00:13:52.588 --> 00:13:55.588
When Officer Takagi said "police" to the robber in the store,

248
00:13:55.588 --> 00:13:58.888
the robber actually smiled.

249
00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:02.488
As if he was waiting for the police officers to come!

250
00:14:02.488 --> 00:14:03.888
Smiled?

251
00:14:03.888 --> 00:14:06.088
-Are you sure? -Yes.

252
00:14:06.088 --> 00:14:07.988
If he did smile,

253
00:14:07.988 --> 00:14:11.188
then that means he was well prepared for his getaway.

254
00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:13.788
Maybe there was something that supposedly guaranteed his life

255
00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:16.888
even after jumping off the building.

256
00:14:16.888 --> 00:14:20.588
So, removing his helmet while falling down

257
00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:23.188
was actually a part of his escape plan?

258
00:14:23.188 --> 00:14:27.188
I don't know. Anyway, we have to identify the dead body first.

259
00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:28.888
Sir, you can't come in!

260
00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:31.288
No, he looks like someone that I know.

261
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:33.888
Oh! It's really Mr. Atomura after all!

262
00:14:33.888 --> 00:14:34.888
What?

263
00:14:34.888 --> 00:14:37.288
I own a restaurant over there,

264
00:14:37.288 --> 00:14:39.488
and he was one of the regular customers.

265
00:14:39.488 --> 00:14:42.488
I think he's working for Mr. Nekota's company.

266
00:14:42.488 --> 00:14:43.988
Nekota?

267
00:14:43.988 --> 00:14:45.288
Do you know him?

268
00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:49.188
Yes. The robber fell on the moving truck

269
00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:54.888
which was carrying the stuff of Mr. Nekota, the man over there.

270
00:14:58.488 --> 00:14:59.688
Mr. Atomura?

271
00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:01.188
He's Mr. Atomura!

272
00:15:01.188 --> 00:15:02.588
Why did you?

273
00:15:02.588 --> 00:15:06.188
Okay, so he is one of your staff, right?

274
00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:08.688
Yes, until last week though.

275
00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:10.088
Until last week?

276
00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:13.888
He had been working for me since the company was established,

277
00:15:13.888 --> 00:15:15.588
but we're facing some financial difficulties right now,

278
00:15:15.588 --> 00:15:17.788
so I had to make him leave unfortunately.

279
00:15:17.788 --> 00:15:20.788
It was necessary because our company needs to scale back.

280
00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:24.288
But I didn't know it was going to end up like this.

281
00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:27.488
So the fact you're moving today is also for the scale back?

282
00:15:27.488 --> 00:15:28.588
You got that right.

283
00:15:28.588 --> 00:15:33.188
This building's got a smaller space but also a cheap rent.

284
00:15:33.188 --> 00:15:36.488
Where was the previous office by the way?

285
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:40.188
It's the building, right across this one, on the top floor.

286
00:15:42.888 --> 00:15:44.788
It's really close.

287
00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:47.988
Then, shall we go and see the previous office?

288
00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:50.188
Why do you need to?

289
00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:54.188
Because if he did plan to commit the robbery,

290
00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:57.488
then maybe there are clues about his plan in your office, right?

291
00:15:57.488 --> 00:15:58.988
I understand.

292
00:15:58.988 --> 00:16:01.088
Hey, sir.

293
00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:04.588
Have you met these officers before?

294
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:07.088
No. Why would I have?

295
00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:09.888
I've never done anything bad before!

296
00:16:13.488 --> 00:16:17.388
"Nekota Food Import Company" -This was Mr. Atomura's locker.

297
00:16:17.388 --> 00:16:21.288
And this is the desk he was using before.

298
00:16:21.288 --> 00:16:22.688
I see.

299
00:16:22.688 --> 00:16:25.588
You got a lot of things in this office still.

300
00:16:25.588 --> 00:16:29.488
Yes, we decided to buy new lockers, desks and chairs

301
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.488
to make a clean start.

302
00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:32.988
So that's why things are still here.

303
00:16:32.988 --> 00:16:37.288
It seems there's nothing that's related to the robbery.

304
00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.488
There's nothing in his desk too.

305
00:16:39.488 --> 00:16:41.888
But, it's kind of strange, I think.

306
00:16:41.888 --> 00:16:44.388
This man was fired a week ago,

307
00:16:44.388 --> 00:16:46.588
but a lot of his stuff is still in this office.

308
00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:47.888
Oh that.

309
00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:52.188
I didn't want the workers to be upset over the dismissal.

310
00:16:52.188 --> 00:16:55.188
So I decided to keep it secret until our new company gets stable,

311
00:16:55.188 --> 00:16:59.088
I told them he was on a business trip.

312
00:16:59.088 --> 00:17:00.988
I asked him to come and get his stuff

313
00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:02.988
after moving the office, secretly.

314
00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.088
Hey, look!

315
00:17:04.088 --> 00:17:06.588
Isn't that the truck that the guy crashed?

316
00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:07.588
Oh, yeah, it is!

317
00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:09.988
We can see the truck in front of this building.

318
00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:12.088
That means this place is right across

319
00:17:12.088 --> 00:17:13.488
the building that the robber jumped off.

320
00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:18.988
Maybe he was trying to make a jump from there to here.

321
00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:21.188
What do you think?

322
00:17:21.188 --> 00:17:22.788
That's impossible.

323
00:17:22.788 --> 00:17:25.688
He was holding a bag of jewelries, remember?

324
00:17:25.688 --> 00:17:29.388
Even the world-class long jumpers can go around nine meters or so.

325
00:17:29.388 --> 00:17:32.888
A normal person wouldn't even think about jumping off,

326
00:17:32.888 --> 00:17:35.288
unless he was like your superhero, Masked Yaiba.

327
00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:36.688
What's wrong with you?

328
00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:39.288
Masked Yaiba will never steal things!

329
00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:40.488
Yeah, you're right.

330
00:17:40.488 --> 00:17:41.688
Hey, guys.

331
00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:43.388
Look, you can't go there.

332
00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:45.788
Hey, can I ask you something?

333
00:17:45.788 --> 00:17:47.188
Where were you when the moving people got here?

334
00:17:48.988 --> 00:17:51.388
I was in my house that's below this room.

335
00:17:51.388 --> 00:17:52.588
Your house?

336
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:53.688
I see.

337
00:17:58.588 --> 00:18:00.988
Below that office is his living space.

338
00:18:00.988 --> 00:18:03.888
That office is four stories above which is the ninth floor.

339
00:18:03.888 --> 00:18:05.488
So this house is on the fifth floor.

340
00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:09.488
-What is this? -It's a strange helmet, isn't it?

341
00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:10.488
Hey!

342
00:18:10.488 --> 00:18:12.888
Is that for a sports bicycle?

343
00:18:12.888 --> 00:18:16.988
Yes, I was into triathlon when I was young.

344
00:18:16.988 --> 00:18:18.188
Are you done now?

345
00:18:18.188 --> 00:18:20.288
Look, we knew each other for a long time,

346
00:18:20.288 --> 00:18:23.188
but there's nothing that belongs to him in here!

347
00:18:24.988 --> 00:18:26.988
Oh, I'll get it.

348
00:18:30.288 --> 00:18:32.888
Hi. How can I help you?

349
00:18:32.888 --> 00:18:36.588
People told me that police officers are here.

350
00:18:36.588 --> 00:18:37.888
Something happened?

351
00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:42.288
Oh, Officer. You know there was a jewel robbery over there, right?

352
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:45.488
I just thought that this is something about it.

353
00:18:46.588 --> 00:18:50.488
My name is Isaka. I'm living on the sixth floor.

354
00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:52.688
Three days ago, around 2 am midnight...

355
00:18:52.688 --> 00:18:55.188
I woke up because I heard this noise from the window.

356
00:18:55.188 --> 00:18:57.288
And when I looked at it,

357
00:18:57.288 --> 00:19:00.888
there was a thin long stick shadow, on the curtain!

358
00:19:02.688 --> 00:19:04.688
So I woke my husband up right away.

359
00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:07.688
He checked the terrace, but nothing was there.

360
00:19:08.788 --> 00:19:12.188
My husband said it was just a dream,

361
00:19:12.188 --> 00:19:14.488
but I thought I should tell you guys about this.

362
00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:18.388
Is your house right above this house?

363
00:19:18.388 --> 00:19:21.888
Yeah. It's number 605, just right above.

364
00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:24.188
Then, did you hear the same noise

365
00:19:24.188 --> 00:19:25.988
when there was the robbery over there?

366
00:19:25.988 --> 00:19:28.388
No, because I was watching TV.

367
00:19:28.388 --> 00:19:29.988
Honestly, I didn't even know about the robbery

368
00:19:29.988 --> 00:19:32.288
until I heard the police car siren.

369
00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:34.188
Excuse me.

370
00:19:34.188 --> 00:19:38.088
Is it okay if we start moving the stuff now?

371
00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:41.988
Looks like we need to take two or three more trips to move everything.

372
00:19:41.988 --> 00:19:43.688
Two or three more trips?

373
00:19:43.688 --> 00:19:45.288
From the old office?

374
00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:47.488
Yes, we got a lot of stuff

375
00:19:47.488 --> 00:19:50.388
because the whole ninth floor was our office.

376
00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:53.488
We got storage, meeting room and all that.

377
00:19:53.488 --> 00:19:55.588
Well, we're not totally done with your old office,

378
00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:57.588
but it seems it really was a suicide.

379
00:19:57.588 --> 00:19:59.988
True, we got the pictures of the scene,

380
00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:01.488
and the fake gun the robber used to threaten people.

381
00:20:01.488 --> 00:20:03.688
We also got the jewelries back.

382
00:20:03.688 --> 00:20:05.488
Except that brooch,

383
00:20:05.488 --> 00:20:08.888
because everything was in the bag.

384
00:20:08.888 --> 00:20:10.988
So I think you can start moving now.

385
00:20:10.988 --> 00:20:14.488
But you leave the cover on the container.

386
00:20:14.488 --> 00:20:16.588
You can start now, but once you're done,

387
00:20:16.588 --> 00:20:20.188
the police going to take the truck for a while, okay?

388
00:20:20.188 --> 00:20:21.488
Okay.

389
00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:23.788
-All right, let's get to work! -Okay.

390
00:20:23.788 --> 00:20:25.088
Hey, wait! Hold on!

391
00:20:26.788 --> 00:20:31.488
Where did you guys park the truck when you were moving the stuff

392
00:20:31.488 --> 00:20:33.788
from the old office to that container?

393
00:20:33.788 --> 00:20:35.588
We parked the truck

394
00:20:35.588 --> 00:20:36.988
"Movers destination. Former office" -at the back of this building.

395
00:20:36.988 --> 00:20:38.988
"Movers destination. Former office" -That's where the back entrance is.

396
00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.688
We used the back street when we carried the stuff

397
00:20:41.688 --> 00:20:43.588
just to avoid the crowd.

398
00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:46.088
Did you hear anything when you were there?

399
00:20:46.088 --> 00:20:47.888
Yeah, I heard a noise.

400
00:20:47.888 --> 00:20:49.888
What kind of noise?

401
00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:51.988
That was jackhammer from the water supply work

402
00:20:51.988 --> 00:20:53.688
they've been doing since last week.

403
00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:56.688
That was annoying.

404
00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.488
"Back Door" -Noise of water supply work.

405
00:20:58.488 --> 00:21:01.188
"Mr. Nekota's house" -The back street is narrow

406
00:21:01.188 --> 00:21:02.888
and does not have many passersby as well.

407
00:21:02.888 --> 00:21:04.688
"The place culprit jumped down"

408
00:21:04.688 --> 00:21:07.488
What's also annoying was the Nekota guy.

409
00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:09.288
He told us what to do like a kindergarten teacher!

410
00:21:09.288 --> 00:21:12.288
Yeah. He told all of us, including the driver,

411
00:21:12.288 --> 00:21:15.988
to come upstairs, just to teach us which thing goes first and stuff.

412
00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:20.188
We also had to wait for a while in front of his office, you know?

413
00:21:20.188 --> 00:21:22.788
Plus, he canceled us twice in a row.

414
00:21:22.788 --> 00:21:24.388
Canceled?

415
00:21:24.388 --> 00:21:27.888
We were actually supposed to do the moving the day before yesterday,

416
00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:30.388
but he called us that morning and said he can't make it.

417
00:21:30.388 --> 00:21:32.188
Yesterday was too. It was a nice day.

418
00:21:32.188 --> 00:21:34.288
Actually, it really was a perfect day for moving.

419
00:21:34.288 --> 00:21:36.688
Well, he booked us for three days just in case

420
00:21:36.688 --> 00:21:38.788
he might have to cancel.

421
00:21:38.788 --> 00:21:40.488
Sure the pay was good but...

422
00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:42.788
We don't wanna work for a guy like him ever again.

423
00:21:42.788 --> 00:21:44.788
I get it! It's the rain!

424
00:21:44.788 --> 00:21:46.888
Thank you so much! Good luck with the moving!

425
00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:50.488
Hey, Conan!

426
00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:54.488
Where is the bedroom?

427
00:21:55.888 --> 00:21:56.988
I found it!

428
00:21:58.988 --> 00:21:59.988
It's here!

429
00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:03.888
If my deduction is correct...

430
00:22:03.888 --> 00:22:04.988
Then, probably...

431
00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:09.388
It's wet!

432
00:22:13.588 --> 00:22:15.688
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

433
00:22:16.988 --> 00:22:19.988
Mr. Atomura was murdered by Mr. Nekota,

434
00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:23.488
who disguised the murder as suicide.

435
00:22:26.688 --> 00:22:30.588
With the time lag and the gap between the buildings.

436
00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:03.488
"Next Episode" -Why are you not getting mad at us?

437
00:24:03.488 --> 00:24:05.488
We're kids, you know.

438
00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:09.988
Talk about a trick that is unbelievably reliant on luck.

439
00:24:09.988 --> 00:24:12.288
But it's only kid's shallow cleverness after all.

440
00:24:12.288 --> 00:24:14.988
I can't believe you're actually listening to them!

441
00:24:14.988 --> 00:24:18.788
we were important witnesses of the jewel robbery.

442
00:24:18.788 --> 00:24:21.588
And the brooch that I was going to buy...

443
00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:29.588
Next Conan, "A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 2)"

444
00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:32.715
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:34.715
"Rain"

446
00:24:34.715 --> 00:24:37.215
With this brooch, I'll approach Ms. Sato!

447
00:24:37.215 --> 00:24:38.415
That's not funny.

448
00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:39.515
It isn't?
