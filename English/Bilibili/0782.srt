1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
"Haido Central Hospital"

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.340
Camel!

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.640
Jodie!

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.440
Is everything okay?

5
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.240
What do you mean?

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.840
That guy who is a member of the Organization, Amuro.

7
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.140
I hope you didn't leak any information out taken in by his glib talk?

8
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.140
No.

9
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.240
Rather, you said the same thing just a while ago too, didn't you?

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.140
What? A while ago?

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740
And how did it go?

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.840
That guy called Kusuda.

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.540
Just as you assumed.

14
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.840
He seems to have shot himself to death.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.940
In his own car.

16
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.040
So, it was just as I thought.

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.540
What? Vermouth did?

18
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.940
Are you saying that the Jodie I saw a while ago

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.740
was Vermouth in disguise?

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.440
There was such an incident.

21
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.340
About the time the whereabouts of Kusuda became unknown.

22
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640
Just about the same time,

23
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.540
there was a man who was shot in the head and burned.

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.140
Right.

25
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.440
FBI agent,

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.540
Shuichi Akai.

27
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.740
Don't tell me.

28
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340
That he's alive?

29
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.140
Yes. If my deduction is correct.

30
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640
"Kudo"

31
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.340
Yes.

32
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.940
Delivery.

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.040
Good evening.

34
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.640
How do you do?

35
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.640
I'm Tohru Amuro.

36
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640
I see.

37
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.440
But, this is not our first meeting, is it?

38
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.840
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.240
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

40
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.140
A battle never seen before.

41
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.840
A one-to-one fight between Amuro and Okiya.

42
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.740
His name is Detective Conan.

45
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:34.641
Next up is the award for Production Design.

46
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.741
-The presenter is Mr. David Carpenter! -Please have a seat.

47
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.941
Thank you.

48
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:47.141
David, the work you've done this year has been fantastic.

49
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.641
Your performance in your latest film was incredible.

50
00:04:56.641 --> 00:05:00.041
Your voice was trembling when you received the award last year.

51
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.341
Thank you for waiting.

52
00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:02.741
You ended up with the nickname

53
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.941
-Do you like mysteries? -"Trembling David".

54
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:06.941
Yes, sort of.

55
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.641
Then, let's start from there.

56
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:13.941
Well, it's just a simple exchanging the corpse trick.

57
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:17.341
It's a common mystery plot.

58
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:28.141
"The Scarlet Return"

59
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:33.841
A man was shot in the head at Raiha Pass.

60
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:37.141
He was burned along with his car.

61
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:41.341
The fingerprints taken from his right hand, which barely escaped the fire,

62
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.041
matched the fingerprints on a boy's phone

63
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:48.341
he had picked up while he was still alive,

64
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:52.241
verifying the dead man's identity.

65
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.341
But, it's strange.

66
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.341
Strange?

67
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:59.841
The fingerprints that were left on the cell phone.

68
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.841
That man was a lefty

69
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:03.141
but for some reason

70
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.141
the fingerprints found on the cell phone were of the right hand.

71
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:11.041
Don't you think it's strange?

72
00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:12.841
Maybe he just happened to be using his right hand

73
00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:16.541
at the time he picked up the cell phone?

74
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:21.041
Or maybe he had no choice but to pick it up with his right hand.

75
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:23.641
Why is that?

76
00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:29.641
Because that cell phone was picked up by another man who was right handed

77
00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:33.341
before that man in question picked it up.

78
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:35.541
Another man?

79
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:36.641
Yes.

80
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:40.441
It seems that they were actually trying to make

81
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:44.441
three people pick up that cell phone.

82
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:50.741
Now, here's a question for you.

83
00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:52.741
The first man they wanted to pick up the phone

84
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:55.341
was a fat man with greasy hands.

85
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.641
Next, a skinny man with braces on his neck.

86
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:04.341
And finally an elderly man with a pacemaker

87
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.841
Out of these three, there were only one whose fingerprints remained.

88
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:11.141
Who do you think it was?

89
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:14.441
The second skinny man.

90
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:16.641
Because the fingerprints that remained

91
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:21.641
after the first fat man picked it up were wiped clean.

92
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.441
I'm sure they'd be hesitant

93
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:27.341
to make the other two pick up a greasy cell phone.

94
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:31.141
And the third elderly man, afraid that the cell phone

95
00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:34.341
may affect his pacemaker

96
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:37.741
so he probably didn't even pick it up, I guess?

97
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.941
Yes.

98
00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:46.141
But the skinny man who came after the man in question who was killed,

99
00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:48.541
was also holding the same cell phone, wasn't he?

100
00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:51.341
Then the fingerprints of that man would also be there.

101
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:54.741
What if something was done to keep the fingerprints from being detected?

102
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.341
That man probably figured that

103
00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.441
something like this would come up

104
00:07:58.441 --> 00:08:01.241
and put something on his fingertips beforehand.

105
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.241
Coating.

106
00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:04.541
That's right.

107
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:05.741
I'm sure that Shu back then,

108
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:09.741
coated his fingertips with a transparent adhesive or something.

109
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:12.741
And just to be safe, he coated the fingertips of both his hands.

110
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.041
What do you mean?

111
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.741
When he held Conan's cell phone!

112
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:19.241
By coating his fingertips,

113
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:23.841
he would be able to keep his prints off Conan's cell phone.

114
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:27.641
That's why Shu dropped the canned coffee back then.

115
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:32.341
The coating made his fingers slippery.

116
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:39.341
Then what about the prints that were on that cell phone?

117
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:41.041
They weren't Shu's.

118
00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:45.541
They were the prints of Rikumichi Kusuda who held it before he did.

119
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:50.741
Which means the corpse that was shot in the head

120
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:52.241
and burned at Raiha Pass...

121
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:56.341
Yes, it was the corpse of Rikumichi Kusuda.

122
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.241
I'm not sure of the circumstances

123
00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:03.341
but Shu probably dressed the corpse with the same clothes as his,

124
00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:06.341
and pretended to be shot by Rena Mizunashi.

125
00:09:06.341 --> 00:09:09.441
Then, he switched places with the corpse with precise timing!

126
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:12.341
I see.

127
00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:15.241
It's quite an interesting mystery

128
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.641
but that man who pretended to be shot,

129
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:21.541
how did he leave the place later?

130
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.541
Before I answer your question,

131
00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:25.941
will you turn the TV off?

132
00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:28.441
After all, we're having an important conversation.

133
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:30.141
What's the problem?

134
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:33.341
I'm interested in the Macademy Awards.

135
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:40.441
So, how did that man leave?

136
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:44.241
I think that man and woman were in this together.

137
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:49.241
He probably snuck into that woman's car and fled.

138
00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:52.341
By deceiving the eyes of the man

139
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:55.441
who was standing guard watching from a distance.

140
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:57.641
A man was standing guard?

141
00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:02.641
Yes, so the man who was standing guard was totally deceived.

142
00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.641
After all, the man who was shot

143
00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:09.841
bled from his head and fell to the ground.

144
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.741
Bled from the head?

145
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:13.741
But that was also fake.

146
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:18.541
Because the man who was shot was always wearing a black knitted cap.

147
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:23.541
I hear that there is a professor living in this neighborhood

148
00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:26.241
whose inventions put even the MI6 to shame.

149
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.641
It would be extremely simple for him

150
00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:31.641
to invent a gadget that would make blood splatter out from his knitted cap

151
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:33.941
even if shot with blanks.

152
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:36.341
So you're saying that

153
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:41.041
he asked the woman working with him to shoot him in the head with blanks?

154
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:44.041
No, the one who ordered her to shoot him in the head

155
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:46.141
was the man who was standing guard.

156
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:48.441
He had already foreseen what was going to happen.

157
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:51.941
He knew that the man who was standing guard would unmistakably do so

158
00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:54.541
when finishing someone off.

159
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:56.941
It's unbelievable.

160
00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:00.641
But Mr. Akai touched that cell phone

161
00:11:00.641 --> 00:11:04.441
only before he let them recapture Rena Mizunashi, right?

162
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:06.741
Does that mean that Mr. Akai had already assumed that

163
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:11.741
she would be ordered to kill him at that time?

164
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:13.241
Yes.

165
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:16.241
Shu would have.

166
00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:19.841
That man's pretty good, isn't he?

167
00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:22.841
It's as if he's the main character of a spy novel.

168
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:27.341
But the one who schemed this plan is someone else.

169
00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:30.441
Why don't you use the cell phone with his fingerprints on?

170
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:34.441
I'll lend you my cell phone for a while then.

171
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:37.141
No. It's not Shu.

172
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:38.541
Right.

173
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:41.341
It's someone else.

174
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:43.441
Don't tell me that it's.

175
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:45.341
Ms. Jodie.

176
00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:49.141
What I'm trying to say is...

177
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:51.641
Hang in there, okay?

178
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:53.141
As proof of that,

179
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:58.841
the man mumbled the following before he was shot.

180
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.541
I didn't think you'd go this far.

181
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:02.541
Is what he said.

182
00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:06.041
"I didn't think you'd go this far"?

183
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:10.741
To me, it just sounds like he's lamenting his misfortune.

184
00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:13.941
Yes. Under ordinary circumstances.

185
00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:17.441
But if you add certain words to it...

186
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:25.141
The meaning drastically changes.

187
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:32.341
"I didn't think you'd go this far..."

188
00:12:35.241 --> 00:12:37.241
"in your prediction".

189
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:41.841
Right.

190
00:12:41.841 --> 00:12:48.341
They were words he used to praise a certain boy who set up this plan.

191
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.841
I see.

192
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:51.241
Interesting.

193
00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:57.341
I'm going to press on the gas a bit.

194
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:00.641
Unknown cars are pursuing us from behind.

195
00:13:06.441 --> 00:13:10.241
And where and what has Mr. Akai been doing since?

196
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:12.841
Don't you have anyone in mind?

197
00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:15.341
Like somebody who has the same habit of talking.

198
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.641
Same habit of talking?

199
00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:20.441
Remember? Mr. Akai used to always say,

200
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:24.241
"The odds are 50/50, so we're in the same boat."

201
00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:26.741
I'm sorry, are you okay?

202
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:30.241
But we're both at fault and the ratio is 50/50.

203
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:34.141
You were negligent of the things around you so you're to blame too.

204
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.541
Figuring things out from there was easy.

205
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:40.541
After the Raiha Pass incident,

206
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:45.641
all I had to do was find a suspicious person who appeared around that boy.

207
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:49.341
And this is where I landed.

208
00:13:49.341 --> 00:13:52.941
I haven't figured out what the relationship

209
00:13:52.941 --> 00:13:57.341
between that boy and Yusaku Kudo is yet but...

210
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:03.341
It's certainly clear that you're living here thanks to that boy.

211
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.541
It's him, him!

212
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.441
I told you before, haven't I?

213
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:17.141
About the weird man wearing glasses

214
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:19.141
that I bumped into at Beika Department store.

215
00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:22.241
I'm waiting to be contacted.

216
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:25.241
My people are pursuing your friends at this moment

217
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:27.841
in order to capture and confine them.

218
00:14:27.841 --> 00:14:31.041
I figured that you would be more cooperative

219
00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:34.141
if you feel that your friends' lives are at stake.

220
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:37.341
But I'd prefer that you'd take that mask off

221
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:40.641
before they contact me.

222
00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:42.641
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

223
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:46.741
No.

224
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:48.741
FBI agent.

225
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:55.041
Shuichi Akai!

226
00:15:05.058 --> 00:15:07.958
But I'd prefer that you'd take that mask off

227
00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.758
before they contact me.

228
00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:12.458
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

229
00:15:13.858 --> 00:15:15.458
No.

230
00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:17.458
FBI agent.

231
00:15:18.558 --> 00:15:20.358
Shuichi Akai!

232
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:24.158
If that's what you wish,

233
00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:25.658
I have no choice.

234
00:15:27.358 --> 00:15:29.258
I'd appreciate it.

235
00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:43.658
No joke.

236
00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:45.758
They're barricading us with their cars?

237
00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:47.558
Take care not to bite your tongue.

238
00:15:47.558 --> 00:15:49.758
Clench your teeth!

239
00:16:14.458 --> 00:16:15.958
What're you doing? After them!

240
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.258
Yes, sir!

241
00:16:18.258 --> 00:16:19.558
Just as expected of you, Camel.

242
00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:22.358
Who are they, anyway?

243
00:16:22.358 --> 00:16:24.358
One of them I guess.

244
00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.758
Since they found out that Shu is alive,

245
00:16:26.758 --> 00:16:28.558
I guess they're trying to get a hold of us

246
00:16:28.558 --> 00:16:31.458
to use us as bait to lure Shu out.

247
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:32.958
Which means,

248
00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.558
just because I leaked the information about Kusuda kills himself,

249
00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:39.058
I jammed up Mr. Akai's plan.

250
00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:41.358
You've no time to be bothered about it.

251
00:16:41.358 --> 00:16:44.558
Concentrate on shaking them off for now!

252
00:16:44.558 --> 00:16:47.558
It's the same as what happened two years ago.

253
00:16:47.558 --> 00:16:49.558
I did it again.

254
00:16:49.558 --> 00:16:52.258
I'm sorry. Mr. Akai.

255
00:16:58.158 --> 00:17:00.058
Just what're you doing?

256
00:17:02.658 --> 00:17:04.858
I've got a slight cold.

257
00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.258
May I put my mask back on?

258
00:17:07.258 --> 00:17:09.258
I don't want you to catch my cold.

259
00:17:09.258 --> 00:17:11.158
It's not that mask.

260
00:17:11.158 --> 00:17:15.358
I'm telling you to tear that disguise off, Shuichi Akai!

261
00:17:15.358 --> 00:17:18.458
Disguise? Shuichi Akai?

262
00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:21.358
What on earth have you been talking about all this time?

263
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:26.058
Now, let's go on to announcing the Best Script Award.

264
00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:31.958
The winner of this honorable award is the best seller novelist,

265
00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.758
who says this is the first time he has ever written the script for a movie.

266
00:17:36.758 --> 00:17:39.658
The star of the Night Baron series.

267
00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:42.058
Mr. Yusaku Kudo!

268
00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:45.558
The title of the piece is "The Scarlet Agent"!

269
00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:46.958
He did it!

270
00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.258
Shinichi's father really won the award!

271
00:17:50.258 --> 00:17:52.358
"Award for Best Original Script Author Kudo Yusaku wins Macademy"

272
00:17:52.358 --> 00:17:54.958
There's a news flash about it too!

273
00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.258
Don't you think it's fantastic, dad?

274
00:17:58.658 --> 00:18:00.958
He's asleep and drooling.

275
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958
How can two fathers be so different?

276
00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:06.958
We've got trouble.

277
00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.758
The steering wheel keeps veering to the right.

278
00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:11.058
What do you mean?

279
00:18:11.058 --> 00:18:14.158
Just a while ago when I made it up the rock,

280
00:18:14.158 --> 00:18:17.158
the tire and foil were damaged and the rim bent,

281
00:18:17.158 --> 00:18:19.358
so air is leaking out of the tire.

282
00:18:19.358 --> 00:18:20.458
What?

283
00:18:22.858 --> 00:18:25.958
They'll catch up with us if things go as is!

284
00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:29.558
Just what are you up to?

285
00:18:29.558 --> 00:18:32.858
What do you mean?

286
00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:34.958
I just took a quick glance

287
00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.358
but there are two at the front entrance,

288
00:18:37.358 --> 00:18:39.358
three in the corridor

289
00:18:39.358 --> 00:18:44.658
and there seem to be five hidden cameras set up in this room.

290
00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:46.658
Are you planning to record this scene

291
00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:49.958
and send it over to the FBI or something?

292
00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:56.158
Or is somebody else in another room watching us?

293
00:19:05.358 --> 00:19:07.058
Camel, do something!

294
00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:09.158
They're right over there already.

295
00:19:09.158 --> 00:19:11.458
Do what, though?

296
00:19:14.558 --> 00:19:18.458
I'm sure that Mr. Akai would do something to get out of this situation.

297
00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:21.658
Shu...

298
00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:27.158
Does this person resemble me or sounds like me to begin with?

299
00:19:27.158 --> 00:19:30.358
You can disguise the face and use a voice changer for the voice.

300
00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:34.258
Just where on earth are you and what are you doing?

301
00:19:34.258 --> 00:19:35.758
Voice changer?

302
00:19:36.858 --> 00:19:42.258
I went around this vicinity at noon today and did some research

303
00:19:42.258 --> 00:19:45.558
to see if there's any inventions that Dr. Agasa, your neighbor, invented,

304
00:19:45.558 --> 00:19:51.158
that was well reputed but not marketed.

305
00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:53.558
And found that it was the choker type voice changer.

306
00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:56.158
It is wrapped around the neck and uses the vibration of the throat

307
00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:58.358
to create any type of voice at will.

308
00:19:58.358 --> 00:20:01.658
It is useful to cope with phone calls from stalkers.

309
00:20:04.658 --> 00:20:07.158
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:20:08.358 --> 00:20:13.058
And the size of it is just right to hide...

311
00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:18.658
Answer me, Shu!

312
00:20:18.658 --> 00:20:20.758
under your turtle neck!

313
00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:01.558
Darn it. The tire's going to run out of air.

314
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.058
I guess this is it.

315
00:22:08.058 --> 00:22:09.358
We're doomed.

316
00:22:15.858 --> 00:22:18.158
Open the roof.

317
00:22:18.158 --> 00:22:19.258
What?

318
00:22:19.258 --> 00:22:21.258
Open it, Camel.

319
00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:22.658
Yes, sir!

320
00:22:46.058 --> 00:22:47.558
Shu!

321
00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:49.358
Mr. Akai!

322
00:22:51.658 --> 00:22:53.358
Akai?

323
00:22:53.358 --> 00:22:54.658
What the heck?

324
00:22:54.658 --> 00:22:56.558
Hey! Back the car down.

325
00:22:56.558 --> 00:22:58.358
We've got to wait for orders.

326
00:23:00.858 --> 00:23:02.358
"Incoming call"

327
00:23:03.058 --> 00:23:05.658
Your phone's ringing.

328
00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:11.658
What's up? What took you so long?

329
00:23:14.058 --> 00:23:16.958
Akai, what?

330
00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.958
-Five seconds. -What?

331
00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:22.558
Drive a little more and there'll be a straight road of 200 m.

332
00:23:22.558 --> 00:23:24.358
When you get there, hold the steering wheel steady

333
00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:26.658
and drive at fixed speed for five seconds.

334
00:23:26.658 --> 00:23:29.658
I'll put an end to this ridiculous chase.

335
00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:31.358
Roger!

336
00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:34.558
I mean, where and what were you doing all this time?

337
00:23:34.558 --> 00:23:37.058
Why are you in the car?

338
00:23:37.058 --> 00:23:41.858
Everything worked out as the boy said it would.

339
00:23:47.758 --> 00:23:49.658
"Next Episode" -You mean Conan?

340
00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:50.658
Yeah.

341
00:23:50.658 --> 00:23:55.258
Knowing that you were suspicious of whether I was dead or not,

342
00:23:55.258 --> 00:23:57.358
he assumed that you'd be coming to Raiha Pass,

343
00:23:57.358 --> 00:23:59.058
and he was definitely right about it.

344
00:23:59.058 --> 00:24:00.058
Too reckless!

345
00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:03.158
The tire's flat and the car's swerving, you know?

346
00:24:03.158 --> 00:24:05.958
As long as the movements are regular,

347
00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:07.458
they can be calculated.

348
00:24:12.158 --> 00:24:17.758
Next Conan, "The Scarlet Truth"

349
00:24:33.158 --> 00:24:35.558
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:37.958
"The Macademy Awards"

351
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.158
Hey, boy. How is it?

352
00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:42.358
I'm busy so don't talk to me now!
