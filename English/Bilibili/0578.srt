1
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:06,099
It's from 4 pm tomorrow, finally.

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,199
-Yes. -Right.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,799
Competition for first place

4
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:12,099
between the Tokyo Spirits and Big Osaka.

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,399
Since they were beaten by Big Osaka before,

6
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:16,799
the Spirits have to beat them this time.

7
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,699
But...

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,599
Since Hide of the Spirits

9
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:22,999
won't be able to play tomorrow because he's hurt,

10
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:26,299
I'll bet they'll be beaten up pretty badly.

11
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:30,499
Yes. Mr. Higo of Big won with the hat trick too,

12
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,499
so I'm sure that the big scorer

13
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,699
and victory will go to Big this year.

14
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:35,899
What?

15
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,999
Well, Mr. Higo won't be able to play in tomorrow's game

16
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,199
either because of the all the yellow card warnings he got.

17
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,299
What? Is that so?

18
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,199
I saw it on today's sports paper.

19
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,999
"Two great players unable to play in the competition".

20
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,499
Come to think of it,

21
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:55,699
when Mr. Higo got the yellow card in a previous game,

22
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,999
the commentator seemed really disappointed,

23
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,399
so I felt a strange uncomfortable feeling.

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,499
But I guess he got caught in a really sly strategy.

25
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:05,899
A sly strategy?

26
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,199
She know what a hat trick is and yet,

27
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:11,599
she knows nothing about the yellow card accumulation warning?

28
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,299
But it's tough for both teams

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,199
since their point getters will not be able to play.

30
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:19,199
Talking of tough...

31
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:21,699
I've got to have a bad tooth pulled out

32
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:22,999
at the dentist tomorrow.

33
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,899
Oh no. That sounds tough.

34
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:26,899
Darn, Hide's not playing

35
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,799
and I don't want to go to the dentist either.

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,299
I wish that tomorrow never comes!

37
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,199
Hey, you shouldn't say that.

38
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,199
What?

39
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:38,399
Tomorrow is filled with hope.

40
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,699
Especially for children like you.

41
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,699
What's with you, mister?

42
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,999
"Kyozo Daita (62)" -Well, I'm just a retired man

43
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:48,699
who's passing time away, a mere passerby.

44
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,599
Then, do you have something interesting

45
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,399
happening to you tomorrow, mister?

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,399
Yes, I've got so much happening I don't know what to do.

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,999
I'm going to Osaka tomorrow

48
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,499
to watch a soccer game and...

49
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,599
Soccer?

50
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,999
After that, I've got an appointment

51
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,299
to see an old friend that I haven't seen

52
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,999
in ten years to drink with him...

53
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,599
The finale of the sequential drama

54
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,699
that I've been hooked on is also tomorrow.

55
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,399
And the Summer Big lottery!

56
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,999
The winning ticket will be announced tomorrow too.

57
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:18,699
I bought a lot this time so I'm really excited...

58
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,599
A purse snatcher?

59
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,199
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

60
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,299
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

61
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,299
There is a big fuss over some lottery tickets.

62
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,799
The phantom of FBI agent Akai appears off and on.

63
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

64
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,499
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

65
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:39,599
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

66
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:29,505
"A Red Omen That Summons Danger"

67
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,905
Thief!

68
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,705
You guys stay right here!

69
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:35,105
Conan.

70
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,105
Hold it!

71
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,205
I said hold it!

72
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:48,905
-Hey... -What's up?

73
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,405
He got away.

74
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,105
Conan.

75
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,605
Where's the purse snatcher?

76
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,305
He got away?

77
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,505
Yes.

78
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:04,405
I did get the man's bag back, though.

79
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,905
The zipper wasn't opened

80
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,205
so I don't think anything was stolen,

81
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,305
but I think you should confirm the contents.

82
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,205
Thank you.

83
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,605
Let's see.

84
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:19,405
My wallet, house key,

85
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:24,905
notebook, soccer ticket, glasses case.

86
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,905
Nothing seems to have been stolen.

87
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:30,305
There's a picture on your glasses case.

88
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,005
This is a picture of my granddaughter

89
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:35,705
who's turning seven this year.

90
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,305
These glasses are what my granddaughter chose

91
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,605
for my birthday present.

92
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,305
That's why it's a thing a really cherish.

93
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,105
Seven years old...

94
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,405
She's the same age as me.

95
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,705
Does she go to Teitan elementary school?

96
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:54,905
No. I wonder what school it was?

97
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,105
Here, your lottery tickets.

98
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:00,605
I think I retrieved everything I saw.

99
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:03,105
You picked them up for me?

100
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:04,905
I picked some up too.

101
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,405
I picked three up.

102
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,905
I picked up five.

103
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:10,905
Thank you so much for everything.

104
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:13,105
You not only got my bag back for me,

105
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,705
you even picked my lottery tickets up for me too.

106
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,105
It's only natural.

107
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,805
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

108
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:21,005
We're always there for people in trouble.

109
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,305
Youth... Youth Detective Squad?

110
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:28,205
Yes. We've cooperated to solve real cases at times too.

111
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,705
We know a lot of police officers too.

112
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:33,405
That's really something.

113
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:34,605
So, I'd like to treat you,

114
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:36,705
the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

115
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,805
to dessert but do you have time?

116
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:40,805
We do! We do!

117
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,305
We've got a lot of time!

118
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,805
Then, shall we go to a cake shop nearby.

119
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,305
-All right! -All right!

120
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,105
The game you're going to go see tomorrow

121
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,205
is the Big vs. Spirits game?

122
00:06:57,205 --> 00:07:00,005
Right, I've got the ticket too, see.

123
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:02,805
I've bought tickets for a good seat.

124
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,105
Awesome.

125
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:07,105
I like both Hide and Higo,

126
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,605
so I can't wait to see them compete against each other.

127
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:10,805
What?

128
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,105
No. I mean... those two are...

129
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,905
It's you, Omi.

130
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,505
Let's stay up all night tomorrow, like old times.

131
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:27,305
What? You've come up with something

132
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,805
so you've got to go home by 10 pm at night?

133
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:33,005
Hey, hey, then we'll only be able to drink together

134
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,205
for just about an hour!

135
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,705
Would you like to start drinking from about 7 pm then?

136
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:40,205
After all, we're both retired and have a lot of time on our hands.

137
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:43,705
I'll contact the shop then.

138
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:47,105
Okay, then, I'll be looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.

139
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:50,005
Don't let my aged face surprise you.

140
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:51,305
See you.

141
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:59,305
Got to change the time we start drinking to 7 pm at night.

142
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,305
Really...

143
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,605
Your schedule for tomorrow is filled.

144
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,105
It is, isn't it?

145
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:08,705
Washing machine is written on your schedule today?

146
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,605
Yes. I'm going to Akihabara to buy myself one from now.

147
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:14,905
The one I have now broke down.

148
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:16,105
I've been going to the coin laundry

149
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:18,205
because of this recently.

150
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,705
Well, taking loose coins with me,

151
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:21,405
wearing a T-shirt and jersey bottom

152
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:23,105
and going to do my wash,

153
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:25,605
reading the newspaper passing my time away

154
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,905
isn't all that bad and I kind of enjoy it.

155
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:31,405
Talking about coin laundry...

156
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:32,705
I just can't wait to see

157
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:36,005
Detective Saimonji's "Coin Laundry Murder".

158
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:38,105
The case will be solved in tomorrow's episode, right?

159
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:41,805
Yes, yes, I'm hooked on that drama too.

160
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:45,305
I can't wait to figure out who the culprit is.

161
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,705
According to my deduction,

162
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:48,905
I think it's that nice looking person...

163
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,505
I know!

164
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:54,305
Who the culprit of that drama.

165
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:56,505
Because I read the original novel before.

166
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:58,605
-What? -No... joke?

167
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,105
Don't tell us,

168
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,405
because I'm looking forward to finding out.

169
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,405
Of course, I won't tell you.

170
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:08,205
Won't you tell me secretly who the culprit is?

171
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:10,905
What? Are you sure? It's going to be aired tomorrow.

172
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,205
Well, I've got a drinking date,

173
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,305
and I won't be able to see it live anyway so...

174
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,305
But, aren't you going to recorded or something anyway?

175
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:21,505
Then, I'd suggest that you watch it closely.

176
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:24,705
Yes. I guess so.

177
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:31,205
See you, then. Thanks so much for everything today.

178
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,005
Youth Detective Squad.

179
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,805
My name is Kyozo Daita.

180
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:40,005
If we meet again somewhere, remember me, okay?

181
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,605
-Okay! -Okay!

182
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,605
He sure was a strange man.

183
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:50,205
Yes. He was full of hope for tomorrow.

184
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,705
He sure was.

185
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:56,105
"Beika Station"

186
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,505
The train will be entering platform two.

187
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:03,205
Please stand behind the white line for your safety.

188
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:12,405
Yoshimi, hang on.

189
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:20,305
I'll help you in a minute...

190
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:23,105
It's going to hurt...

191
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:24,905
If you get run over by the train.

192
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:38,305
Beika, Beika Station.

193
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,005
Thank you for riding with us today.

194
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:45,105
Please do not forget your belongings.

195
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:13,605
You were planning to throw yourself on the tracks, weren't you?

196
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,005
To make money for your granddaughter's surgery, right?

197
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,005
What?

198
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:22,305
Did you have a very expensive life insurance or something?

199
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,205
How'd you know?

200
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,805
Because although you're saying

201
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:28,605
that you're looking forward to tomorrow,

202
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,305
you're thinking that you could care less about tomorrow.

203
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:34,005
I could care less?

204
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,505
The Big vs. Spirits game.

205
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,305
Although you're going all the way to Osaka to watch the game,

206
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,905
you don't even know that Hide and Higo aren't going to be playing.

207
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:41,505
It's strange that you're going to that game

208
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,605
that's going to start at 4 pm

209
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,005
and coming back to Tokyo in three hours

210
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,305
to go drink with a friend.

211
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,105
The game's going to take at least two hours.

212
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,105
You couldn't possibly make it back to Tokyo from Osaka

213
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:53,305
in just an hour that you have left.

214
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:56,605
Besides! The lottery tickets that we picked up,

215
00:11:56,605 --> 00:12:00,005
you put them back in your bag without even checking.

216
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,105
It's strange that you also wanted to know

217
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:03,605
result of the drama that will be aired tomorrow too.

218
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:07,405
It's almost as if you're sure that there's no tomorrow for you.

219
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:09,205
That's how we figured out

220
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:12,205
you were planning to die today.

221
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:16,505
Well, Conan told us all this, though.

222
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:20,305
You drank because you wanted to make it look like you got drunk

223
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,005
and accidentally fell of the platform.

224
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:24,705
If after the accident, a soccer game ticket and lottery ticket

225
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:26,705
are found in your possession

226
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,105
followed by the testimonies of us and other people,

227
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:33,705
the authorities will found that you were looking forward to tomorrow,

228
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:36,105
nobody would think that you committed suicide

229
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,705
in order to get hold of your life insurance money.

230
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:39,005
In other words,

231
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,605
your insurance policy was one in which you can't receive money after death,

232
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:43,305
if you commit suicide, right?

233
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,405
But, how did you ever find out about my granddaughter's illness?

234
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,405
If the glasses that your granddaughter

235
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:51,605
sent you was the treasure you cherished most,

236
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,905
you should at least have known

237
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,305
the name of the school she goes to.

238
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,405
But, you didn't know.

239
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,005
Which means that she may be in a circumstance

240
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:02,005
that is keeping her from going to school.

241
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:05,705
That's how I deduced that she maybe in a hospital somewhere.

242
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:11,305
Yes. She's been in the hospital since six months ago.

243
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:14,905
She has a heart problem.

244
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,505
We finally found a good doctor

245
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,105
and she was scheduled to undergo surgery abroad soon,

246
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:20,605
but the surgery fee is so high.

247
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:26,005
That I had no choice but to do this.

248
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,105
But, even if she gets better after the surgery,

249
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:32,305
if she finds out that her grandpa is gone, she'll be sad.

250
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:35,405
Besides, didn't you buy a lot of lottery tickets?

251
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:37,305
You could have a winning ticket.

252
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:39,105
I would never have a winning ticket.

253
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,605
How could the same person win a succession

254
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,305
of winning lottery tickets amounting to a billion yen?

255
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:44,605
-What? A succession... -What?

256
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,105
You mean you already won once?

257
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:50,005
Yes. At the end of last month.

258
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:53,305
I thanked God with all my heart.

259
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:56,805
But, I lost the winning lottery ticket.

260
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:59,505
And I can't find them no matter where I look.

261
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,705
-What? -What?

262
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:04,905
Could it be that you confirmed the winning lottery ticket number

263
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:07,605
at the laundry when you were reading the papers?

264
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:11,505
Yes. When I got home, the ticket was gone.

265
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:14,805
So, I could've dropped it on my way home.

266
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:17,305
What about the other tickets?

267
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,905
I didn't want to get mixed up

268
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,605
so I threw them away right then and there.

269
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:24,405
Then, I'm sure you put your winning ticket away somewhere.

270
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,605
But, it would be dangerous

271
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,705
to shove it into your jersey pants pocket.

272
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:30,505
You would've put it into your wallet,

273
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,405
but you were holding a lot of loose coins,

274
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,405
so I presume you didn't have it with you, right?

275
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:39,505
If so, the only place left that you would put it would be...

276
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,105
in the glasses case you had with you then, wouldn't it?

277
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:45,505
I see.

278
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,605
I found it.

279
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:54,405
But, how did you figure out he brought his glasses case along?

280
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:57,505
Because when he wrote in his notebook,

281
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,305
he was squinting.

282
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:02,305
Those glasses are probably for myopia.

283
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,705
If he confirmed the winning ticket reading the newspaper,

284
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,605
he should've brought it along with him!

285
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,605
He never opened his glasses case after he lost the ticket

286
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,205
because he felt bad towards his granddaughter

287
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,305
and couldn't wear his glasses.

288
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,805
Besides, he didn't need his glasses for myopia

289
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:19,005
to look for what he lost.

290
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:22,905
I even thought of robbing a bank too,

291
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:24,605
but I'm glad I didn't.

292
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,305
Hey, hey.

293
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:32,105
No, no, you shouldn't do bad things.

294
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,805
Right, right.

295
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,005
Thank you so very much,

296
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,805
members of the Youth Detective Squad.

297
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:44,405
I'll be sure to pay you back for your kindness some day later.

298
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,905
See you.

299
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,105
What a guy.

300
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:53,005
We just ran into a band of bank robbers the other day too.

301
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:57,805
Yes. That really got us nervous, didn't it?

302
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:00,205
Yes, yes, there were people

303
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,505
that we knew among the customers there too.

304
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:05,605
Someone you knew? Not teacher Jodie?

305
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,305
Remember? The man who was riding the same bus

306
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,405
when there was the bus-jack.

307
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:12,505
Yes, the guy with the mean looking eyes, right?

308
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,105
I saw him too.

309
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,405
I'm sure he had a burn mark on his right eye.

310
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:20,605
I don't remember a guy like that during the bus-jack.

311
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,605
Nope. During the bus-jack he didn't have a burn.

312
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,205
I think he was wearing a black knitted cap

313
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:27,605
and a mask over his mouth.

314
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:31,405
What?

315
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,427
"Mouri Detective Agency"

316
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,027
What? Akai?

317
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,027
Yes, he mentioned over the phone

318
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,527
about a red long sleeve T-shirt.

319
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,627
Something about solving the mystery of red T-shirts

320
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:55,627
that come in the mail every week.

321
00:16:57,827 --> 00:16:59,427
The person will be coming after lunch tomorrow

322
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:02,227
and wants dad to help.

323
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,727
She was talking about the color red.

324
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:09,427
And? Did you get the name

325
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,527
and address of the guy who called?

326
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,927
No, because after saying what he had to say,

327
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,127
he hung up.

328
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:19,527
Well, it's just probably some university girl

329
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:21,927
being chased around by a stalker or something.

330
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:24,427
The voice of the person sounded mechanical

331
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:27,327
and I couldn't figure out if it was a woman or a man.

332
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,327
It's sort of scary.

333
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,927
If it seemed like a bad case,

334
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,427
we can refuse when that person comes.

335
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:41,027
Either way, the person who is troubled with red T-shirts

336
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,427
is coming here tomorrow anyway.

337
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:46,927
That person isn't coming here to the agency

338
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:48,627
but rather to the sports goods floor

339
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,727
of the Beika Department Store on 3rd Avenue.

340
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,027
What?

341
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,027
Why do we have to go all the way to meet this person

342
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:57,027
that we know nothing about from our side?

343
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:00,427
But... We already ate it all up.

344
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:01,727
-What? -What?

345
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,527
We ate it?

346
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,927
When I came back from school today,

347
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,827
I found an envelope in the mailbox with the words

348
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:10,127
request for work fee.

349
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,627
I looked inside and found 100,00 yen inside.

350
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:15,127
Then, don't tell me that this sushi.

351
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,527
Yes, I also paid up the debts that we owed

352
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,427
to Poirot with the money.

353
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:23,027
I mistakenly thought that it was payment

354
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,527
for the case that you solved last week.

355
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:28,827
By the I was told on the phone

356
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:31,827
that the money is inside the mailbox,

357
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:34,727
I had already ordered the sushi.

358
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,427
My God.

359
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,627
Beika Department Store.

360
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,427
That's right near the Teito Bank

361
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,927
that was robbed the other day.

362
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,527
"Beika Department Store"

363
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,327
The mystery of the red T-shirt?

364
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,327
A person who wants you to solve the mystery

365
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,127
will be coming here?

366
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,927
Yes, after lunch.

367
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,127
Have you seen such a person?

368
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:04,827
No. But why here?

369
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:08,327
Well... I wonder why?

370
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,727
Maybe it's a different place?

371
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:14,927
Hey, hey, are you saying that we have to look around this entire floor?

372
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,127
Come to think of it,

373
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:19,127
there was a person who came to ask about a hat.

374
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,027
What? A hat?

375
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,427
See, that foreigner over there.

376
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,827
Hey, come on, don't let me keep repeating myself!

377
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,227
The design in the back of this cap

378
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,427
is the original design of this department store!

379
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,027
In other words, it's limited edition item of this store, isn't it?

380
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:36,427
Don't you remember the customer who bought this here?

381
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:40,527
No. Besides, I've never heard if the customer

382
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,727
that you are referring to has ever come here either.

383
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:47,227
Hey... it's about time you tell me, isn't it?

384
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,427
What are you getting at?

385
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,227
What about the customer who bought that cap?

386
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:52,127
Never mind, you just be quiet.

387
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:54,927
Jodie?

388
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,027
Agent Camel too?

389
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:59,027
What brings you here?

390
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:02,127
I happen to be checking on something.

391
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:05,127
By the way, your Japanese is fluent.

392
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,927
Well, that's...

393
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:10,227
because Camel here.

394
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:14,427
Right. My Japanese improved.

395
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:17,127
Because I love Japan. Does it bother you?

396
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,027
No.

397
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,327
She cuts out explaining.

398
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,827
Jodie, isn't she the FBI agent

399
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:26,327
who was teaching English at high school?

400
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:29,027
Didn't you go back to the States?

401
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,327
No, because I still have some petty business

402
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,427
to take care of here in Japan.

403
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,427
He... he's my partner, Agent Camel.

404
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:39,027
I think I'll be in Japan for a while.

405
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,927
If we meet again someday, please remember me.

406
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,927
Well, I guess it has nothing to do with the mystery...

407
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,227
Of the red T-shirt.

408
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:55,227
Okay, let's try the golf goods sales floor next then.

409
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:58,327
Excuse me, do you know the foreign lady just now,

410
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:00,727
didn't she mention something other than the cap?

411
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,627
Yes, she kept asking if a man with

412
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:06,527
a burn mark on the right side of his cheek

413
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,527
came to buy the cap.

414
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:11,027
A burn mark on the right cheek?

415
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,927
Which means that even Jodie saw him.

416
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:16,127
That man that was among the customers

417
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,727
during the bank robbery.

418
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,827
Shu.

419
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,527
Come on, Conan, let's go.

420
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,027
Thank you.

421
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:25,027
No problem.

422
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,227
Excuse me.

423
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:32,827
Yes?

424
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:36,027
Could I ask you something?

425
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:38,427
"Beika Department Store"

426
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,727
"National delicious things exhibition"

427
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:40,827
"Rental large disposal market"

428
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:41,927
"Clearance sale now being held"

429
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:50,427
Really, I tell you.

430
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:53,527
It's after 1 pm already.

431
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:55,527
The client hasn't shown up yet.

432
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:58,627
We're done.

433
00:21:58,627 --> 00:21:59,727
Finished. That's it.

434
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:04,927
We're going home.

435
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,727
I wonder what this paper bag is?

436
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:13,227
Maybe somebody forgot it?

437
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:16,727
I don't think you should touch it.

438
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:17,927
What?

439
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:22,927
I'm sure the contents is a bomb.

440
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,927
-Bomb? -A bomb?

441
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,527
A bomb?

442
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:29,027
Just how do you know?

443
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:31,527
That's because...

444
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:32,827
I...

445
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:38,627
Look at me.

446
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:40,927
That's why.

447
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,727
-A bomb? -A bomb?

448
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:13,127
Get out of here! This area is dangerous.

449
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:17,727
Why do you have something like that on your body?

450
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,227
He wanted to find

451
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:22,227
the sender who puts of the 13 red T-shirts in this bag.

452
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,727
He needs to be found at any cost.

453
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,527
Red T-shirts?

454
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,727
What is he after anyway?

455
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:33,227
Next Conan,

456
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:36,517
"The 13 Black Suggestions"

457
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:54,237
Next Conan's Hint:

458
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:56,137
"Receipt".

459
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:57,837
In the next episode, the men dressed in black...

460
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,137
All of you sitting in front of the TV set watching

461
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:00,337
should be attentive too.

462
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:01,337
Okay.
