Moonshade Island Village Office

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.490
Based on that,
Moonshade Island Village Office

3
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.990
I believe only a few minutes have passed
since the victim Mayor Kuroiwa's death.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
Asai Narumi (26)
Doctor

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.940
A-A few minutes?
Asai Narumi (26)
Doctor

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.790
Yes.
Asai Narumi (26)
Doctor

7
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.620
That seems correct.
Asai Narumi (26)
Doctor

8
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.170
That seems correct.

9
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.280
There's only five and a half minutes of
silence at the beginning of this tape

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.010
of the "Moonlight Sonata"'s second movement.

11
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.490
I see.

12
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.750
Inspector.

13
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.260
There's a musical score written in blood
beneath the chair the victim was sitting in.

14
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.270
What?

15
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.100
More musical scores.

16
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.740
Could this also be a dying
message left by the victim?

17
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.740
No.

18
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.610
If he had the time and strength to write all this
with his own blood, he would've called for help.

19
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.620
Stay out of this!

20
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160
You idiot! That's valuable evidence!

21
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.890
It's okay.

22
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.290
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

23
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.130
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

24
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.460
The sound of a piano rings
out across a remote island!

25
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.720
What conclusion will it pass down?

26
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.350
Always determining the one truth

27
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.070
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

28
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.650
his name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.991
Let's jump right into it, Nishimoto-san.

33
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.611
You're the person who
discovered Kuroiwa-san's body.

34
00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:17.461
Nishimoto Ken (55)
Unemployed

35
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:20.541
Kuroiwa told me to meet him
in the broadcast room at 6:30.
Nishimoto Ken (55)
Unemployed

36
00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:21.491
Kuroiwa told me to meet him
in the broadcast room at 6:30.

37
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:27.271
Kuroiwa-san did say he was
meeting someone this evening.

38
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:29.631
Are you sure you didn't tell him to meet
you there so you could kill him?

39
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:30.631
O-Of course not!

40
00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:33.211
Then why did he want to meet you?

41
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.191
I...

42
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.601
Looks like I'm right.

43
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:40.191
The culprit isâ€”

44
00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:41.391
It's Shimizu!

45
00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:41.601
With mayoral election candidates
Kawashima and my dad out of the way,

46
00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:44.811
Murasawa Shuichi (27)

Kuroiwa Reiko (27)
Kuroiwa's Only Daughter

Kawashima and my dad out of the way,

47
00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:45.021
the mayor's seat automatically becomes his!
Kuroiwa Reiko (27)

48
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:48.811
the mayor's seat automatically becomes his!

49
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:49.771
Don't be ridiculous!

50
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.081
Shimizu Masato (49)
Mayoral Election Candidate

51
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:52.281
There's no way I'd kill two
people just to become the mayor!
Shimizu Masato (49)
Mayoral Election Candidate

52
00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:53.261
There's no way I'd kill two
people just to become the mayor!

53
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:54.591
What are you looking at, Conan-kun?
There's no way I'd kill two
people just to become the mayor!

54
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:55.271
What are you looking at, Conan-kun?

55
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.281
This musical score left at the crime scene.

56
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:02.081
I think this is probably a coded
message left by the culprit.

57
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:06.081
Do these sharps and flats mean anything?

58
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:08.701
They refer to the black keys on the piano.

59
00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:09.461
What?

60
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.941
You know, because they're symbols
for a half step up or down.

61
00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:16.261
The keys...

62
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.441
Hurry up and catch the murderer, Inspector!

63
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:21.441
Otherwise, more people will die!

64
00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:23.891
You know you're next.

65
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:25.101
Hirata Kazuaki (31)
Secretary to the Mayor
You know you're next.

66
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.741
Conan-kun?

67
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.601
Once you figure out the
key to this code, it's simple.

68
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:34.871
They've assigned the letters of the alphabet to
the keys of the piano in order from left to right

69
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.611
and written the corresponding
sounds as a musical score.

70
00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:44.871
Reading the sheet music left at Kawashima-san's
murder according to that assumption, we get...

71
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.621
"You know you're next."

72
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:50.661
See?

73
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:52.221
Wow!

74
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:55.051
Th-Then what about the
musical score written in blood?

75
00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:56.421
Let's see.

76
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:02.081
"The hellfire's grudge is settled."

77
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.681
Th-The hellfire's grudge? Could it be?

78
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.601
The pianist who burned
himself to death 12 years ago?

79
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:09.941
It's him.

80
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:15.071
I knew it. He's alive.

81
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:17.581
Aso Keiji is alive!

82
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:19.361
He's not alive.

83
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:23.491
The corpse found in the ruins
matched his dental records.

84
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:24.991
That was definitely him.

85
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.671
Everything burnt to the ground.

86
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:31.621
All that was left was the sheet
music inside his fireproof safe.

87
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.001
Sh-Sheet music?!

88
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:36.041
Where is that sheet music now?

89
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.581
In the community center's safe.

90
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.671
I believe I have the keys at the substation.

91
00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:42.761
Then hurry up and bring them here!

92
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.891
Yes, sir.

93
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.641
I'll go with you!

94
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:52.271
Hey, did Aso-san really set
his own house on fire?

95
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.901
Yeah, according to the witnesses.

96
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:56.781
What witnesses?

97
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:00.971
The previous mayor
Kameyama-san, Kawashima-san,

98
00:06:00.971 --> 00:06:04.911
the current mayor Kuroiwa, and Nishimoto-san.

99
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.281
What?

100
00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:08.791
Aside from Nishimoto-san, they're all dead.

101
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.121
Then what about that Murasawa guy?

102
00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:15.751
He came to this island about three years ago.

103
00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:19.131
He got engaged to the mayor's
daughter just the other day.

104
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:23.031
Really? What about the mayor's
secretary Hirata-san?

105
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.411
He's a strange fellow.

106
00:06:25.411 --> 00:06:27.511
I don't know what he was doing,

107
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:31.521
but I often saw him secretly meeting with
Kawashima-san at the community center.

108
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.761
What about Shimizu-san?

109
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.761
He's a respectable man.

110
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:38.901
His only flaw is that he's a bit short-tempered.

111
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.321
Huh? That's odd.

112
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.331
I know I put it around here somewhere.

113
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.581
Jeez. We've been looking
for over an hour already.

114
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.461
Ah, here it is. This is the key.

115
00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:55.711
Then let's hurry back to Inspector Megure.

116
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:56.291
Sure.

117
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.561
You're too late.

118
00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:57.961
What?

119
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:01.681
Everyone got tired of waiting and left.

120
00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:02.091
What?!

121
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.091
They let the suspects leave, too?

122
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:10.851
Yeah. Since the culprit's last message
said, "The hellfire's grudge is settled,"

123
00:07:11.221 --> 00:07:13.851
they thought there wouldn't
be anymore murders.

124
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:14.901
That can't be!

125
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.861
There's still the third movement
of the "Moonlight Sonata."

126
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:20.191
I'm going to the community center!

127
00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:21.861
Wait, Conan-kun.

128
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.111
Officer, hurry.

129
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:26.911
We need to check that sheet
music as soon as possible.

130
00:07:26.911 --> 00:07:28.621
Don't rush me.

131
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.991
Hey, did you just hear a strange noise
coming from the room with the piano?

132
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.481
Did you?

133
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:45.801
Bastard!

134
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.231
Murasawa-san?

135
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:54.731
Ran?

136
00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:57.691
Ran-neechan!

137
00:07:58.541 --> 00:07:59.461
What's wrong?

138
00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:04.111
Nishimoto-san...

139
00:08:04.861 --> 00:08:07.721
Officer, contact the Inspector immediately!

140
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.251
Got it.

141
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:13.671
That was the sound of this stopping.

142
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.551
It contains a 60 minute tape.

143
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:21.891
Since each side is 30 minutes, Nishimoto-san
probably died within the last 30 minutes.

144
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:23.831
Conan-kun.

145
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.301
Look next to Nishimoto-san's feet.

146
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:26.801
Huh?

147
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:29.261
Sheet music.

148
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:33.261
What does it say this time?

149
00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:35.061
"Suicide note."

150
00:08:36.031 --> 00:08:40.221
Suicide note? You mean Nishimoto-san...

151
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.651
He killed himself, huh?

152
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:48.621
According to this note, he regretted
killing Kawashima and Kuroiwa.

153
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:51.231
So it was Nishimoto who killed them.

154
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:56.661
His motive was that he
didn't want the mistake

155
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.201
he committed with Kawashima,
Kuroiwa, Kameyama,

156
00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:04.221
who died two years ago, and Aso,

157
00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:06.461
who killed himself 12 years ago, to be exposed.

158
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.131
Even the pianist Aso?

159
00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:10.261
Yeah.

160
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.221
It says that Aso came up with the code.

161
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.571
They must've done something using this code.

162
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.941
I see.

163
00:09:19.941 --> 00:09:25.481
Nishimoto believed the sheet music that
survived the fire described their old secret.

164
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:29.611
In order to destroy the sheet
music, he broke into the safe,

165
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:33.841
but couldn't find the sheet
music, so he killed himself.

166
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:34.551
No...

167
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:36.191
I don't think he killed himself.

168
00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:36.701
What?

169
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.461
Look closely at the spot
where the body's feet were.

170
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:43.211
There's nothing there for him to step on.

171
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.931
Normally a person wouldn't be able to
do that without a step of some kind.

172
00:09:46.931 --> 00:09:50.471
In other words, it's hard to
imagine that this was a suicide.

173
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.721
I saw someone suspicious.

174
00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:53.831
What?

175
00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:55.851
There were two people in the piano room.

176
00:09:56.241 --> 00:10:01.451
One of them broke the window and fled,
but the other one was Murasawa.

177
00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:03.851
He was on the floor because
someone struck him.

178
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:06.861
Doctor Narumi's examining him
in the piano room right now.

179
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:08.871
You should've told us that sooner.

180
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:17.811
Officer, did you find Aso-san's sheet music?

181
00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:18.331
No.

182
00:10:18.731 --> 00:10:21.661
After all, it happened 12 years ago.

183
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.581
I have no idea where I put it.

184
00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:28.471
I believe he has a concussion,

185
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.031
but I can't say for certain unless I
examine him properly at the clinic.

186
00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:32.541
I see.

187
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:36.451
By the way, Kuroiwa-san, what
was Murasawa-san doing here?

188
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:38.181
I don't know!

189
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:40.681
I'd like to know the answer
to that question, too.

190
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:44.001
What's this?

191
00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:44.981
Don't touch that!

192
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:47.211
It belongs to Shuichi.

193
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:48.521
What is that?

194
00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:51.941
I don't know, but it seemed important to him.

195
00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:56.031
That's a tuning hammer used to tune pianos.

196
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:58.111
Does that mean he...?

197
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:02.911
In any case, gather all the
suspects at the village office.

198
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:04.581
We're going to interview them again.

199
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.391
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.091
What is it, Conan-kun?

201
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.891
The suspicious person who
fled through the window

202
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:21.931
was searching the bottom
of the piano before they ran.

203
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:24.951
I thought there might be something here.

204
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:31.821
What? Seriously?

205
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:33.371
It's a secret door.

206
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:38.951
What is this? Could it be?

207
00:11:49.378 --> 00:11:52.468
Judging by the methods used,

208
00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:54.388
the three murders that have taken place

209
00:11:54.388 --> 00:11:57.728
on this island were almost certainly
committed by the same person.

210
00:11:58.188 --> 00:11:59.518
What is it?

211
00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.728
Something's not right.

212
00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:06.958
Ever since I saw the code left at the second
crime scene, something has seemed strange.

213
00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:08.598
Inspector Megure.

214
00:12:09.338 --> 00:12:12.428
The photos we took of the scene of
Kuroiwa's murder have been developed.

215
00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:14.048
Thank you.

216
00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:15.778
Could you lay them out over there?

217
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:16.428
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:19.578
Doctor Narumi, is Murasawa-san still unconscious?

219
00:12:19.578 --> 00:12:22.588
Reiko-san is taking care of him, but he still hasn't regained consciousness.

220
00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:29.248
What's this thing shining by Kuroiwa-san's neck?

221
00:12:30.318 --> 00:12:32.828
It disappeared after the body was moved.

222
00:12:33.298 --> 00:12:34.588
Um, Inspector?

223
00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:36.848
Could I go buy something to drink?

224
00:12:37.318 --> 00:12:39.178
I'm thirsty.

225
00:12:39.598 --> 00:12:41.038
Very well.

226
00:12:45.938 --> 00:12:47.218
Hey, mister.

227
00:12:47.698 --> 00:12:49.698
You've got white powder on your sleeve.

228
00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:56.078
Wow, that's a lot of foreign money.

229
00:12:56.698 --> 00:12:59.598
I like foreign coins.

230
00:12:59.598 --> 00:13:00.978
Really?

231
00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:03.418
K-Kid!

232
00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:09.398
I finally found the sheet
music Aso-san left behind.

233
00:13:09.398 --> 00:13:10.448
Let me see that.

234
00:13:10.448 --> 00:13:11.588
Hey.

235
00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:15.398
"To my son Seiji."

236
00:13:16.928 --> 00:13:22.058
I thought Aso-san had a wife and
daughter who he took with him.

237
00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:25.438
Come to think of it, he had a son, too.

238
00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:31.148
He fell terribly ill as a child and
was hospitalized on the mainland.

239
00:13:31.148 --> 00:13:33.188
I believe his name was...

240
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:34.418
Seiji.

241
00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:36.698
Could it be?

242
00:13:46.788 --> 00:13:49.128
I see. So that's how it is.

243
00:13:49.388 --> 00:13:54.808
The reason the culprit moved Kawashima-san
to the piano room after drowning him.

244
00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:58.848
The meaning behind the music
left at all three crime scenes.

245
00:14:00.168 --> 00:14:03.638
And the mystery of the code written in blood.

246
00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.658
It's definitely them. They're the culprit.

247
00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:11.148
What's wrong with you?

248
00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:14.368
Why'd you suddenly run
into the broadcast room?

249
00:14:15.048 --> 00:14:19.658
In any case, tomorrow morning we'll
interview you two and Murasawa-san,

250
00:14:19.868 --> 00:14:21.498
who's resting at the clinic.

251
00:14:21.498 --> 00:14:26.658
Inspector, I've figured out most of what happened on this island.

252
00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:28.418
Dad?

253
00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:33.278
First, the person who knocked out
Murasawa-san in the piano room tonight

254
00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:35.648
was Hirata-san.

255
00:14:36.538 --> 00:14:41.058
He suffered the injury on his left hand when he broke through the window and fled.

256
00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:47.878
Hirata-san was using the secret door
on the underside of the piano

257
00:14:48.428 --> 00:14:49.448
to conduct drug deals with Kawashima.

258
00:14:49.448 --> 00:14:50.768
D-Drugs?!

259
00:14:51.238 --> 00:14:53.738
He probably struck Murasawa-san

260
00:14:53.738 --> 00:14:58.258
and ran because he saw him
collecting the leftover drugs.

261
00:14:58.258 --> 00:15:01.568
Then he got into an argument over
the drugs with Kawashima, and...

262
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.448
N-No!

263
00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:06.578
However, Hirata-san isn't
connected to the three murders.

264
00:15:06.728 --> 00:15:07.448
What?

265
00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:11.958
If he were the culprit, he wouldn't have
moved the body into the piano room.

266
00:15:12.268 --> 00:15:15.728
After all, the drugs left in
the piano could be discovered.

267
00:15:15.968 --> 00:15:17.478
I see.

268
00:15:17.478 --> 00:15:20.828
Then there's Murasawa-san,
who was knocked out.

269
00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:21.938
He's the culprit?

270
00:15:21.938 --> 00:15:22.578
He isn't the culprit either.
He's the culprit?

271
00:15:22.578 --> 00:15:23.928
He isn't the culprit either.

272
00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:24.848
What?

273
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.598
The culprit prepared a suicide note
to disguise his murder as a suicide,

274
00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:33.108
but they fled in such a hurry that
they forgot to leave a step.

275
00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:36.338
It's hard to imagine someone who did
that would go to the piano room.

276
00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:37.908
Y-You're right.

277
00:15:38.108 --> 00:15:40.158
Then who killed them?

278
00:15:40.368 --> 00:15:43.408
Direct your attention to the second case.

279
00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:49.218
Kuroiwa-san was allegedly murdered only a
few minutes before his body was discovered.

280
00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:53.208
Recall how the code written in blood

281
00:15:53.808 --> 00:15:59.508
didn't smear even though
Conan fell on top of it.

282
00:16:00.388 --> 00:16:03.378
However, at room temperature,

283
00:16:03.378 --> 00:16:05.418
it takes blood 15 to 30 minutes to dry.

284
00:16:06.858 --> 00:16:11.018
Because there were only five
minutes and 30 seconds of silence

285
00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:13.938
at the start of the tape that was playing,

286
00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:18.148
we believed the murder occurred only a few
minutes before the body was discovered.

287
00:16:19.158 --> 00:16:23.478
But by playing the tape from the blank B side,

288
00:16:23.478 --> 00:16:27.998
the culprit delayed the music
by over 30 minutes

289
00:16:28.778 --> 00:16:31.168
using the tape player's auto-reverse feature.

290
00:16:31.438 --> 00:16:32.918
Auto-reverse?

291
00:16:33.148 --> 00:16:36.238
Normally, once a tape player
finishes playing the A side,

292
00:16:36.238 --> 00:16:41.778
you flip over the cassette and
begin playing the B side.

293
00:16:41.778 --> 00:16:45.868
But the auto-reverse feature inverts the
tape head to play the opposite side.

294
00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:48.508
Take a look at the crime scene photos.

295
00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:53.638
There's a switch shining next to the body's neck,

296
00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.848
but in the photo taken after
the body was moved, it's gone.

297
00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:03.378
It proves the culprit deactivated the
auto-reverse while the police weren't looking.

298
00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:07.078
But the only person who
approached the body then was...

299
00:17:08.138 --> 00:17:10.868
The only person besides the police
who could approach the body

300
00:17:11.358 --> 00:17:16.878
or fake the estimated time of death was
the person who examined it, Doctor Narumi.

301
00:17:18.408 --> 00:17:20.378
You're the only one who could have done it.

302
00:17:20.378 --> 00:17:22.258
Doctor Narumi?

303
00:17:23.258 --> 00:17:26.808
The reason you left a few minutes of
silence at the beginning on the tape

304
00:17:26.808 --> 00:17:28.468
that played during the first murder

305
00:17:28.918 --> 00:17:33.338
was to make us believe
the culprit once again

306
00:17:33.338 --> 00:17:36.728
used that same silence during the
second murder to flee the crime scene.

307
00:17:37.238 --> 00:17:40.588
Furthermore, you drowned Kawashima-san

308
00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.398
so the coroner would return to
the mainland with the body,

309
00:17:43.948 --> 00:17:46.738
and so you'd be asked to examine
the body during the second murder,

310
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.238
allowing you to enact your trick.

311
00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:54.208
Doctor Narumi's motive for
these three murders

312
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.658
can be traced back to 12 years ago.

313
00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:58.128
12 years ago?

314
00:17:58.608 --> 00:18:03.828
12 years ago, the pianist Aso Keiji-san
burned himself to death.

315
00:18:04.428 --> 00:18:07.038
However, he was actually murdered

316
00:18:07.548 --> 00:18:11.748
by Kawashima-san, Kuroiwa-san,

317
00:18:11.748 --> 00:18:12.988
and Nishimoto-san,

318
00:18:13.668 --> 00:18:17.268
who were killed in this case, as well as
Kameyama-san, who died two years ago.

319
00:18:17.518 --> 00:18:19.398
H-He was murdered?

320
00:18:19.868 --> 00:18:24.048
They used Aso-san's
international performances

321
00:18:24.558 --> 00:18:28.508
to purchase drugs and used the secret
door in the piano to sell them.

322
00:18:29.188 --> 00:18:33.368
However, Aso-san told them that he
wouldn't work with them anymore.

323
00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:42.918
All of this is described in the sheet music
found in the burnt remains of the house.

324
00:18:43.218 --> 00:18:50.178
Just before his death, Aso-san wrote
a confession to his son Seiji.

325
00:18:50.408 --> 00:18:51.578
His son?

326
00:18:52.038 --> 00:18:54.808
Wait, Seiji? Could it be?

327
00:18:54.808 --> 00:18:55.258
Asai      Narumi

328
00:18:55.258 --> 00:18:57.268
Doctor Narumi's actual name is Seiji.
Asai      Narumi

329
00:18:57.268 --> 00:18:58.218
Asai          Seiji
Doctor Narumi's actual name is Seiji.

330
00:18:58.218 --> 00:18:58.758
Asai          Seiji

331
00:18:58.758 --> 00:19:00.858
He's actually Aso Keiji's son, Aso Seiji.
Asai          Seiji

332
00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:02.678
Aso           Seiji
He's actually Aso Keiji's son, Aso Seiji.

333
00:19:02.678 --> 00:19:03.068
Aso           Seiji

334
00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:04.628
No way.

335
00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:08.098
So he did it to avenge his father?

336
00:19:08.098 --> 00:19:09.248
Inspector!

337
00:19:09.618 --> 00:19:11.218
Asai Narumi is missing.

338
00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:11.828
What?

339
00:19:13.618 --> 00:19:15.678
Find him! Don't let him escape!

340
00:19:15.678 --> 00:19:16.818
He'll be there,

341
00:19:17.328 --> 00:19:19.458
where his father's piano was donated.

342
00:19:20.298 --> 00:19:22.068
The Moonshade Island community center!

343
00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:29.928
It's over, Dad.

344
00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:31.888
It's all over.

345
00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:34.818
It's not over yet.

346
00:19:36.098 --> 00:19:37.728
You can't die.

347
00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:39.728
Conan-kun.

348
00:19:40.228 --> 00:19:43.728
It's written right here in the
sheet music your father left you.

349
00:19:43.948 --> 00:19:47.738
"Seiji, at least you can live a decent life."

350
00:19:48.928 --> 00:19:51.758
If he'd written that,

351
00:19:51.758 --> 00:19:54.638
then maybe I wouldn't have needed to do this.

352
00:19:54.638 --> 00:19:55.248
What?

353
00:19:56.328 --> 00:20:00.338
I couldn't believe that my father had done that.

354
00:20:00.948 --> 00:20:04.128
I couldn't believe he'd killed my mother
and sister before killing himself.

355
00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:09.488
So after graduating from medical school, I
came to this island in order to find the truth.

356
00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:15.108
I disguised myself as a woman doctor so people
wouldn't discover that I was Aso Keiji's son.

357
00:20:15.718 --> 00:20:20.608
Since the reading of my name isn't written on
my medical license, nobody suspected me.

358
00:20:21.978 --> 00:20:25.248
I learned what happened to my father

359
00:20:25.248 --> 00:20:29.598
when the previous mayor Kameyama
told me to meet him here in this room.

360
00:20:30.148 --> 00:20:33.828
When he learned that I was Aso Keiji's son,

361
00:20:33.828 --> 00:20:36.658
he suddenly became frightened
and told me everything.

362
00:20:36.908 --> 00:20:41.918
About the drugs, the code,
and my father's murder.

363
00:20:42.638 --> 00:20:45.768
Once he finished talking, he
was suddenly wracked with pain.

364
00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:49.788
He died of a heart attack.

365
00:20:50.848 --> 00:20:55.178
That's when I came up with these murders...

366
00:20:55.818 --> 00:21:02.058
while playing the "Moonlight Sonata" my
father loved next to his body as a requiem.

367
00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:08.108
In any case, let's get out of here, Seiji-san.

368
00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:09.948
There's still time.

369
00:21:10.238 --> 00:21:11.778
It's too late.

370
00:21:11.978 --> 00:21:12.678
What?

371
00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:16.488
My hands are like theirs now.

372
00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:19.498
Covered in blood.

373
00:21:20.018 --> 00:21:21.248
Seiji-san...

374
00:21:25.758 --> 00:21:26.638
Conan-kun?

375
00:21:26.638 --> 00:21:27.548
Damn it!

376
00:21:27.548 --> 00:21:28.698
Don't!

377
00:21:29.258 --> 00:21:30.568
Let go!

378
00:21:32.388 --> 00:21:34.198
What's that sound?

379
00:21:35.028 --> 00:21:36.298
A code.

380
00:21:36.758 --> 00:21:41.648
He's playing the piano amidst those flames.

381
00:22:53.088 --> 00:22:55.588
Special Thanks
To everyone who loves Conan

382
00:23:08.718 --> 00:23:12.818
The community center continued to burn until
morning, when it finally burnt down completely.

383
00:23:13.328 --> 00:23:20.058
Apparently Murasawa-san missed the pianist
Aso Keiji and occasionally tuned that piano.

384
00:23:21.438 --> 00:23:23.458
It's what he was doing the night he was struck.

385
00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:26.838
Anyway...

386
00:23:27.418 --> 00:23:31.228
I wonder why Doctor Narumi
sent Dad that letter.

387
00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:37.298
He probably wanted someone to stop
him from murdering those people.

388
00:23:38.688 --> 00:23:43.348
Hey, what was the code Doctor Narumi played?

389
00:23:43.778 --> 00:23:45.728
I forgot already.

390
00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:48.478
I can tell by the look on your
face that you haven't.

391
00:23:48.898 --> 00:23:48.938
Thank you,

392
00:23:48.938 --> 00:23:50.058
Come on, tell me.
Thank you,

393
00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:50.698
little detective.
Come on, tell me.
Thank you,

394
00:23:50.698 --> 00:23:51.448
Thank you,
little detective.

395
00:23:51.448 --> 00:23:52.638
I'll tickle you.
Thank you,
little detective.

396
00:23:52.638 --> 00:23:54.118
Stop!
Thank you,
little detective.

397
00:23:54.118 --> 00:23:54.138
Stop!
