1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,540
In order to appear as guests on a travel program

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,940
to be aired on Nichiuri TV,

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,540
we headed off to Hiroshima.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,340
Strange things begin to happen

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,540
one after the other to the TV staff.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,540
We get to know a woman, Yayoi

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,140
who works for a long established shop,

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,740
Misenya that is known for their special maple buns,

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,940
and find out about the legend of the 7 wonders

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,940
that is known in the Misen area,

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,940
and the connection it may have to the strange things that are happening.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,740
Moreover, we find that

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,940
the suspicious man that had been asking around about the TV staff

14
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,340
seemed to be Yayoi's older brother, Shinroku.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
Could there be any connection

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,740
between the accident that happened two years ago,

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,740
of the parents of Yayoi and her older brother falling to their deaths

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,740
from the Misen and the TV crew?

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,640
Moreover, the director Mr. Koshiji is attacked

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,540
and Misenya catches fire.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,540
Was Shinroku responsible for all this?

22
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,840
Or...

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,640
Brooding over passing seasons

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,740
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,440
The seven mysteries are solved.

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,540
At the end of the trip, an unexpected culprit is caught.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:43,087
"Hiroshima, Miyajima 7 Wonders Tour (Hiroshima Edition)"

31
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:49,287
"Kenichi Miyamoto (55)" -I am Inspector Miyamoto

32
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:50,587
from the Hiroshima Prefectural Police.

33
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,287
How is Mr. Koshiji?

34
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,587
How's his condition?

35
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:56,987
He's unconscious and in critical condition.

36
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:59,587
-Oh, no. -How terrible.

37
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:02,387
I'm sure that guy's the culprit!

38
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:04,587
Right, Mr. Detective?

39
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,887
No, no decisive conclusion yet.

40
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,987
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

41
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,887
I've heard of your great reputation many times.

42
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:11,987
Hello.

43
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,287
As to the culprit

44
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:16,987
are referring to Mr. Shinroku Ayase at Misenya here?

45
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:17,987
What?

46
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:21,187
Excuse me, but you're Mr. Ayase's younger sister?

47
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:22,787
Do you remember seeing this?

48
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,487
This is... My older brother's!

49
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,587
It seems to have been found

50
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,387
at the site where Mr. Koshiji was attacked.

51
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:30,787
Am I right, sonny?

52
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:32,787
Yep, that's right.

53
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:34,987
And, what was the cause of the fire?

54
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:38,087
Although it's not conclusive yet, the fire started

55
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,587
most likely by the boundary between the shop next door and here.

56
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,787
Since there was nothing to start the fire,

57
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:44,387
the possibility of arson is high.

58
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,087
Inspector!

59
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,487
When the fire broke out,

60
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,587
it seems that a person who resembles your older brother

61
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,487
was seen in the vicinity.

62
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,487
What?

63
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,987
Then, it's true...

64
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,987
That her older brother...

65
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,387
He attacked Mr. Koshiji,

66
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:03,687
and set fire to his own house?

67
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,887
No! It's a lie!

68
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:08,587
My older brother would do nothing like that!

69
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,287
Yayoi.

70
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,587
True.

71
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,887
If say, Shinroku were the culprit,

72
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,987
why would he set fire to his own house?

73
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,587
-What's up, sonny? -Huh?

74
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:21,287
Talking about fire...

75
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:22,887
could this be one of the 7 wonders,

76
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,787
inextinguishable fire, a symbol of it?

77
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,687
-True! -Another one of the seven wonders!

78
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:30,987
What's this about?

79
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,787
Well, I do think it's just a mere coincidence, but...

80
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,687
I see.

81
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:41,387
In other words, as to your parents' death,

82
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,287
at about the same time they got into an accident,

83
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:48,087
your older brother had his doubts about the TV crew that were here,

84
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,187
so taking advantage of the seven wonders.

85
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,687
I'm just stating a possibility.

86
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,887
But...

87
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,787
I confirmed with Yayoi a while ago,

88
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:03,387
her parents got into the accident the day after we left.

89
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,487
Which means that

90
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,487
Mr. Koshiji has nothing to do with the accident of her parents.

91
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,987
However, Shinroku who didn't know about this, misunderstood and...

92
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:14,787
Either way, we, the police need to know

93
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:19,387
the whereabouts of Mr. Shinroku Ayase as soon as possible, too.

94
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,187
Where are you, Shinroku?

95
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:25,487
Although he's in hiding,

96
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,687
it can't be concluded that Shinroku is the culprit yet.

97
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,587
Somebody may be making it look that way,

98
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:35,387
so it could be that the culprit is among those people there too.

99
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,487
But, when Mr. Koshiji was attacked,

100
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:41,287
Mr. Hamada, Mr. Shimokura and Mr. Yatsukawa

101
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,287
were with us at the Ordination Platform.

102
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:46,587
Ms. Miyake was with Pops.

103
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,987
In the midst of the fire, Mr. Kitamura

104
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:52,187
called from his hotel, in Hiroshima.

105
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,687
It takes 10 minutes to Miyajimaguchi Station.

106
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,087
From there to Hiroshima Station where the hotel is,

107
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,987
it takes 25 minutes by train.

108
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,287
If he returned to the hotel after attacking Mr. Koshiji,

109
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,887
he wouldn't make it back in time.

110
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:07,787
Which means that the only one without an alibi is Mr. Kamisuwa.

111
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:09,387
Come to think of it, even back then...

112
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:12,687
Fire... He was there...

113
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:15,987
Bad news! Misenya's on fire!

114
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:17,687
What?

115
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,287
Fire, on that fire?

116
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:23,887
It seems he mistook fire to be something else.

117
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,187
Wait a sec.

118
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,587
Time wise there's no way

119
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,587
that Mr. Koshiji could've known about the fire.

120
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:32,487
In that case, the "kaji" blurted out by Mr. Koshiji was...

121
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:33,587
Could it be that...

122
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:34,887
"Misenya"

123
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:37,987
Sonny. Is this the picture you wanted?

124
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,687
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:43,987
I had one extra one left that I had printed.

126
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,987
The one that I had decorated in the shop burned.

127
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:53,487
Maybe the arsonist wasn't after Misenya, but rather...

128
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:57,487
"Atomic Bomb Dome"

129
00:06:57,487 --> 00:07:01,287
The following day, we returned to Hiroshima,

130
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,387
and joined Mr. Kitamura who was resting at the hotel.

131
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:09,387
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you yesterday.

132
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,687
Are you okay?

133
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,987
Yes, totally recovered.

134
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,287
Do you have any idea who could've given you

135
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:17,687
the drink that gave you the stomachache?

136
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,887
You mean if it's symbolic of anything...

137
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,487
I heard about it a while ago, and was surprised.

138
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,487
Talking of ideas...

139
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,487
All I ate was the lunch box that was brought to us on the site.

140
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,887
Maybe somebody put something inside it.

141
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,987
So, what should we do from now?

142
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,987
After what Mr. Koshiji went through,

143
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:41,287
maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...

144
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,087
What is it, try me.

145
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,387
I don't think a chance like this comes by often.

146
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:49,387
"Renown Detective of Gourmet Tour Solves the Case!"

147
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,487
I'm sure we'll get high viewer rating!

148
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,387
I agree.

149
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:57,087
-I'd hate to back off like this! -Right!

150
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,287
I'm sure that Mr. Koshiji is also vexed!

151
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:03,287
I'd to clear my name too. Please!

152
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:09,287
Okay, I'll tell the higher ups.

153
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,587
Yatsukawa, you take charge of directing in place of Koshiji.

154
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:13,587
Yes, sir!

155
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,787
So, Mr. Mouri.

156
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,687
The contents of the plan may be a bit changed,

157
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,587
but we'd appreciate your cooperation.

158
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,787
You can count on me for things like that!

159
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:24,787
That's...

160
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,287
-All right! -Let's get to it!

161
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,487
We're counting on you, Mr. Hamada!

162
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:31,787
Will do!

163
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:33,487
Maybe...

164
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:37,187
Let's say that if Shinroku believed that

165
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:41,387
the TV staff who came here two years ago

166
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,487
had something to do with the death of his parents,

167
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:47,487
it's possible to think that he attacked the TV crew

168
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,087
taking advantage of the legend of the 7 wonders of Misen

169
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,787
where his parents' died!

170
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:53,787
But the people who came to Miyajima two years ago

171
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:57,387
are Mr. Koshiji, Mr. Kitamura and Ms. Miyake.

172
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,287
So, isn't it strange that salt would be inserted

173
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:02,687
in Mr. Yatsukawa's coffee, symbolizing the Ebb and Flow Rock,

174
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:03,887
despite he is not having been here?

175
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,687
That's true.

176
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:09,687
Well, it's probably because he's also a staff member.

177
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:13,287
You mean, he who hates Peter harms his dog?

178
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,487
Right! That's it!

179
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,287
Which means, I'm next in line as the culprit's target?

180
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:20,687
It could be me.

181
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:25,587
No matter who the culprit is,

182
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,687
it's for sure that he's going to do something

183
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:31,787
symbolized by the Dragon Fire Cedar of the 7 wonders!

184
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:37,387
We decided to visit Shinroku's friend who resides in Hiroshima.

185
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:40,087
Well, I haven't seen Shinroku

186
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:42,687
for more than half a year already, you see.

187
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,487
"Rainbow Arch Bridge" -After his parents' passed away,

188
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,187
Shinroku went bad,

189
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:49,687
and Yayoi who was going to a two year college in Osaka,

190
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,187
returned to Miyajima.

191
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:54,887
Is he really the culprit?

192
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,587
Come to think of it,

193
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,887
there was no condo.

194
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,287
Don't tell me that...

195
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:08,287
"Hiroshima Castle"

196
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,287
Shinroku?

197
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:16,387
I wonder, I have no idea either.

198
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,287
Hey, hey.

199
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:21,487
May I ask you something about 2 years ago?

200
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,087
Yep, about what?

201
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:34,787
I see. Just as I thought!

202
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:40,087
Shoots! Mr. Kamisuwa's gone!

203
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,887
Where is he? Where'd he go?

204
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,287
Yayoi?

205
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,134
Mr. Kamisuwa!

206
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:10,834
Yayoi?

207
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,734
Why...

208
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,134
A dragon pattern?

209
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,434
The last of the 7 wonders that's left.

210
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,534
This symbolizes the Dragon Fire Cedar?

211
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:25,434
Mr. Kamisuwa's cell phone.

212
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,034
Was he attacked from behind while he was on the phone?

213
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:33,834
Did you see the culprit?

214
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,334
No. When I got here,

215
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:39,434
Mr. Kamisuwa was already on the ground.

216
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,534
Then, what brought you here?

217
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,434
I got a call from someone

218
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,934
who said he was calling on behalf of my brother.

219
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,434
The person told me that my brother said

220
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:48,834
he wanted to tell only me about what really happened,

221
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,934
so for me to come to Hiroshima Castle.

222
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:54,934
Someone on behalf of your brother... Really?

223
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,934
-Huh? -Are you suspecting Yayoi?

224
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,734
If the motive of your older brother

225
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,334
was to avenge his parents' death,

226
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,634
the same would apply to you his younger sister as well.

227
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,634
Oh, no?

228
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,634
Next, it's me.

229
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,734
Mr. Kamisuwa who didn't come here together

230
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:13,434
with the staff two years ago was attacked too, so...

231
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,334
If the culprit is attacking at random,

232
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,934
we could be attacked again, too.

233
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,134
Are you saying that

234
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:21,934
I may not get away with plain salt the next time around?

235
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:24,834
Because the culprit's attacking at random, you see, at random!

236
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,934
Darn it! What a rat!

237
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:36,334
I'm not letting the culprit do as he pleases any further!

238
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,334
It's our turn next!

239
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,934
What?

240
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,934
Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa?

241
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,634
They passed away?

242
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,834
No joke?

243
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,334
We just got a call from the hospital.

244
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,334
Too bad.

245
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,434
Oh, no.

246
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,334
Was the killer that guy, Shinroku Ayase after all?

247
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,334
Yes. We got an arrest warrant for him just now.

248
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:03,134
That rat!

249
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,034
How dare he kill Mr. Kamisuwa too!

250
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,734
We have him in our custody.

251
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,434
It was just as Mr. Mouri had deduced!

252
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:37,534
He's the culprit!

253
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,834
-What? -Oh, no?

254
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,034
No way!

255
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:43,034
You...

256
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,734
Dad.

257
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:53,134
Well, I don't have the slightest idea what's going on either.

258
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:05,334
So, this is the much rumored Sleeping Kogoro!

259
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,634
Mr. Kitamura.

260
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:11,234
You're the culprit who caused all the incidents up to now!

261
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,334
You worked up an elaborate scheme,

262
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,134
which made it look as if Shinroku committed

263
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:18,134
the series of incidents involving the 7 wonders

264
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:20,934
in order to avenge the death of his parents.

265
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:24,334
Your purpose for doing what you did

266
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,834
was to kill the director Mr. Naoto Koshiji!

267
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,234
What?

268
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,234
What do you mean?

269
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:32,034
Let me explain.

270
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:34,834
First of all, what gave you the idea of

271
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,734
putting the blame on Shinroku?

272
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:40,734
It was because Mr. Kitamura, you were responsible

273
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:44,134
for his parents falling to their death!

274
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,234
No joke?

275
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,434
In autumn, two years ago,

276
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,834
after you finished the interview,

277
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,934
you alone decided to stay back in Miyajima

278
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,734
because your hobby was walking through the mountains.

279
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,634
I heard about it from Conan.

280
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:57,234
Isn't that right, Ms. Miyake?

281
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:00,034
-Yes. -When you climbed Misen,

282
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:02,934
you entered the off limits area

283
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:07,034
and the parents of Shinroku and Yayoi cautioned you for being there.

284
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:09,634
I don't know what happened there

285
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:13,234
but as a result, their parents fell to their deaths.

286
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:19,334
Shinroku searched the site and found an accessory

287
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,134
that turned out to be

288
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:24,434
the mascot on the zipper of the jacket you were wearing.

289
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:29,134
It's the same as the one you have on your bag right now!

290
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:30,834
Conan!

291
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,934
Yes!

292
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,434
Here you go.

293
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,934
The zipper of Mr. Koshiji's jacket...

294
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,134
Really! It's the same thing!

295
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:42,834
Back then, two years ago,

296
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:46,434
Mr. Koshiji happened to borrow your jacket and was wearing it.

297
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:49,134
I think he said, he had a slight cold and was a bit cold,

298
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:50,634
so he wanted to borrow it.

299
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:52,634
Shinroku found the zipper mascot

300
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,534
at the site where his parents fell to the death.

301
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,834
Mr. Kitamura, you're the one who dropped it, aren't you?

302
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,134
What on earth happened back then?

303
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,934
It... It was an accident!

304
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:06,034
We got into a slight argument and it happened...

305
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,634
I didn't think something like that was going to happen!

306
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,734
Let's have the police thoroughly check out

307
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:13,134
what really happened then.

308
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:17,634
Shinroku realized the meaning of the thing that he found,

309
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:20,234
only two weeks ago,

310
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:23,234
after seeing the photo taken two years ago that

311
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:26,834
the owner of the souvenir shop had decorated in a picture frame in his shop.

312
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,534
That's why Shinroku mistakenly thought that

313
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:33,134
Mr. Koshiji was involved with the death of his parents.

314
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:34,134
Right.

315
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:38,534
So, Shinroku went to Tokyo to confirm the truth of the matter.

316
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:41,734
Isn't that right, Shinroku?

317
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,334
Yes, sir. Exactly.

318
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,634
I went to Tokyo

319
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:50,334
and started to investigate the surroundings of

320
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,034
the director called Mr. Koshiji.

321
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:53,434
Then, I was told,

322
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:57,434
"I'll take you to see him. You can count on me."

323
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,934
Mr. Kitamura approached you.

324
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:01,934
Yes, sir.

325
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,434
You called Shinroku over to Hiroshima

326
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,234
when the crew came to film the program,

327
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,434
and confined him to this room all the while.

328
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,434
Then you attacked Mr. Koshiji taking advantage of the 7 wonders.

329
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,634
You also burned the photos that would serve as evidence

330
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:18,234
after disguising yourself as Shinroku, Mr. Kitamura.

331
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,634
Well, but...

332
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,834
Mr. Kitamura had an alibi, didn't he?

333
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,134
Mr. Kamisuwa called this hotel

334
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:27,234
and confirmed that he was sleeping,

335
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:30,534
and at the time of the fire, Mr. Kitamura himself called.

336
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,434
The person that the hotel maid saw sleeping in bed

337
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:36,734
when she checked the room

338
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,934
was actually Shinroku who was sleeping

339
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,834
under the influence of sleeping pills.

340
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,434
After shaving and matching the hairstyle,

341
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:46,234
it would be hard to correctly identify the person

342
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:48,734
even if the police were to confirm how he looks later.

343
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,634
In the meantime, Mr. Kamisuwa saw through Mr. Kitamura's trick.

344
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:55,834
The condo's not there.

345
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:01,834
Yes, he realized that the condo that is in view from this window

346
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:05,234
was not displayed on the screen of the telephone TV.

347
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,834
I confirmed what was going on.

348
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,534
Yes, true.

349
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:13,734
Near the Miyajimaguchi arrival and departure port of the ferry...

350
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:16,734
another chain of our hotel is there.

351
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:19,434
The interior is exactly the same as it is here.

352
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:22,334
The hotel was used as a stand-in.

353
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,934
He crossed the sea with the ferry,

354
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,634
checked in at the hotel that was nearby,

355
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,734
called Mr. Kamisuwa from there

356
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,234
and established an alibi.

357
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:37,034
But there was only one difference between the two guest rooms.

358
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,034
It's the color of the curtains!

359
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,834
The ones here are sky blue,

360
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,534
but the ones at Miyajimaguchi are peppermint green.

361
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,634
That's why he couldn't close the curtains.

362
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,234
But because of the difference in the night scenery,

363
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:51,934
Mr. Kamisuwa realized this.

364
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,834
So...

365
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,834
Hello. Is this the Red Leaf Hotel?

366
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,634
You broke the cell phone

367
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:05,034
because you wanted to hide the fact that

368
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,434
Mr. Kamisuwa called the hotel.

369
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,834
You were also thinking of putting the blame on Yayoi

370
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,434
who you called simultaneously, if you could possibly could.

371
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:15,234
What?

372
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:18,234
There seems to have been rumors from before

373
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:21,034
that someone was running an illegal casino.

374
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:25,034
Isn't that someone you, Mr. Kitamura?

375
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,634
Those words that Mr. Koshiji mentioned...

376
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:32,134
Kaji (Fire)... ita (He was there)...

377
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,234
He actually wanted to say,

378
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,834
"Casino... Kitamura was there"!

379
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:40,434
Mr. Koshiji knew what you were doing behind the scenes.

380
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:44,234
Didn't he try to convince you to turn yourself in?

381
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,334
But you went off and told Mr. Kamisuwa that

382
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,434
you thought Mr. Koshiji was doing something suspicious.

383
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,034
That's why during the shooting,

384
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:54,834
Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji were both acting awkwardly.

385
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,434
Weren't you also planning to frame Mr. Koshiji who had been killed

386
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:02,434
as the one who was running the illegal casino?

387
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:07,034
I started the casino just for fun at the beginning.

388
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:09,234
But I got stuck in it over time

389
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:12,934
and by the time, I realized what was going on, I couldn't quit!

390
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,934
I had no other choice!

391
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,334
Because you had no choice,

392
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,934
you attacked Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa,

393
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,034
then tried to put the blame on Shinroku

394
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:23,334
and tried to get rid of him too?

395
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,534
What makes you think that such a selfish justification

396
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:28,134
is going to get you through?

397
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:42,934
That's right, I forgot to mention that

398
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:47,334
Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa are not dead.

399
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,234
-What? -What?

400
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:52,334
We got word from the hospital that they got better

401
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,934
and that they've overcome the critical moment.

402
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:57,534
It was all done under my orders.

403
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:01,034
I apologize for ending up in somehow deceiving all of you.

404
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,634
But I thought that by doing this,

405
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,534
the real culprit would relax

406
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:08,534
and go on to try to get rid of Shinroku.

407
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:37,634
Later, Mr. Koshiji and Mr. Kamisuwa's wounds

408
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:39,734
were well on their way to recovery.

409
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,334
Shinroku also returned to stay with Yayoi

410
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:44,334
and they were safely reunited joyously.

411
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,534
It's hot!

412
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:53,634
Delicious!

413
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:56,734
Hiroshima Okonomiyaki is the best!

414
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,934
The beer is just great, too!

415
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:03,034
A second serving, please!

416
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:06,834
But, what's going to happen about putting the program on air?

417
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:10,134
Hey, hey. We're in trouble if they don't air it.

418
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,734
I mean, this is the first time

419
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:14,234
I'll get to see the fantastic deduction I made with my own eyes, you see.

420
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,734
True, because it's a fact that you're always asleep,

421
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:19,434
Sir Sleeping Kogoro.

422
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:22,134
By the way, I wonder what's up with Sonoko?

423
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,434
Speak of the devil.

424
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:27,834
Sonoko! What on earth...

425
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,734
Just what's taking you so long, Ran?

426
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:31,534
Hurry and come over here.

427
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,534
It really feels good this island!

428
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:35,134
Island?

429
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:39,134
Really, it's really great here in Miyakojima!

430
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:43,034
You made a mistake and went to Miyakojima.

431
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,834
Okay, cut!

432
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,234
"Next Episode" -I hear that the program that kiddies like

433
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:53,234
Kamen Yaiba Show is produced here too.

434
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,134
I went to see it last week, too.

435
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:05,134
The back of the corpse is wet.

436
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,634
It wasn't raining anymore and yet, why?

437
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:09,734
This is probably a case of homicide

438
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,634
made to look like suicide!

439
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:17,034
Next Conan, "Alibi of a Fall"

440
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:19,961
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:21,961
"Fountain Pen"

442
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,261
Are you still drinking?

443
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,961
Just one more last drink!

444
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,965
-Let's go already, Ran. -Let's.
