The Red Sheep game was just a game

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,608
in which a girlfriend
tests her boyfriend's courage.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:12,912
However, Ran and I
witnessed a murder thought to be

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,910
caused by someone
wearing a red sheep costume.

00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,117

The murder victim

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,710
(Tetsusaburou Wakabayashi (45) )
was the head cook of La Mucho, Mr. Wakabayashi.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,322
He became acquainted
with a woman named Anri

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,124
through a dating app.

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,900
Anri was kidnapped by Red Sheep,

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,780
( Motojirou Hirasawa (40) / Kokichi Mukai (45) )
who demanded ransom and killed Mr. Wakabayashi.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,830
( Daiki Kamio (25) )
who demanded ransom and killed Mr. Wakabayashi.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,560
( Ryouta Beppu (20) / Ami Takigawa (20) )
who demanded ransom and killed Mr. Wakabayashi.

(Beika Costumes Rental Storehouse)

14
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,204
This is the place.

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,417
Ouch.

16
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,720
Gosh.

17
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,728
Red Sheep!

18
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,204
This has to be the one.

19
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,207
The horns left marks on the ceiling.

20
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,450
Was it only the red sheep costume
that was taken out?

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,614
( Hideto Iwami (50) )
Yes. It had never been popular at all until recently,

22
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:21,910
( Hideto Iwami (50) )
but someone borrowed it once three weeks ago.

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,110
but someone borrowed it once three weeks ago.

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,520
Three weeks ago?

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,290
That's when Red Sheep started appearing
on social media, right?

26
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,900
Do you know who borrowed it?

27
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,800
Yes. There's a record of it.

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,332
This is the person
who borrowed the costume.

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,304
(Red Sheep, Motojiro Hirasawa)

30
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,800
Motojiro Hirasawa?

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,610
Isn't Motojiro Hirasawa

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,712
one of the restaurant's managers?

33
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,318
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration of

34
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,420
unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,921
The Red Sheep from memory.

36
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,723
What is the truth inside the costume?

37
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,325
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,126
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,729
His name is Detective Conan!

(Temporarily Closed)
Is it true that you've figured out

44
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,610
who the culprit is?

45
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,411
Yes, Inspector.

46
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,314
I have identified some conclusive evidence.

47
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,319
Detective, if we're being called here...

48
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,610
Does that mean the culprit
behind Wakabayashi's murder is among us?

49
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,826
That is indeed the case!

50
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,829
The one who murdered
Mr. Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi...

51
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,000
was you!

52
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,150
Motojiro Hirasawa!

53
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,030
Hold on a second!

54
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,405
Hirasawa, you rented
this red sheep costume

55
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:38,111
at Beika Costume Rental three weeks ago.
Is that right?

56
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,800
There was a record of it
at the rental company.

57
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,218
That is correct,

58
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,070
but I would never kill Wakabayashi!

59
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,920
Then, why did you rent this costume?

60
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,929
This year is the fifth anniversary

61
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,132
of the opening of the restaurant.

62
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,300
I thought I could use the red sheep costume

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,601
(La Mucho's fifth anniversary)
I thought I could use the red sheep costume

64
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,850
(La Mucho's fifth anniversary)
to promote the anniversary event.

65
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:08,708
But wasn't this costume also used
for a festival ten years ago?

66
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,210
Why would you use such an old costume?

67
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,914
The costume itself was designed by me.

68
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,600
I thought your main job
was that of an interior designer.

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,223
At that time, I did every single job I could.

70
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,926
I also wore the costume at that festival.

71
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,829
So, that's why I was attached to it.

72
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,230
I didn't want to forget

73
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,090
the hardships I encountered back then.

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,700
But when I told Wakabayashi

75
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,700
that I wanted to use the costume at the event...

76
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,505
What are you thinking?

77
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,507
This creepy costume

78
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,410
doesn't fit the image of this restaurant!

79
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,413
He was unusually resistant to the idea.

80
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,515
So, I let go of the idea,
even though I was reluctant to.

81
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,018
Did you kill Wakabayashi
out of resentment, then?

82
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,319
I couldn't have!

83
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,722
Wakabayashi was my business partner.

84
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,870
That's how important he was to me.

85
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,428
If so, then you would know everything
about Mr. Wakabayashi.

86
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,031
- What is it?
- Mr. Wakabayashi received an email threat...

87
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,480
on his computer at 10 p.m. last night, right?

88
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,150
The banks would have been closed by then,

89
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,930
so how could he prepare the 50 million yen?

90
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,750
In other words,
the culprit would have known

91
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,500
Wakabayashi could prepare
that amount of money in short order.

92
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,218
I had nothing to do with it!

93
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,320
But I saw it.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,123
When hearing that the ransom
was 50 million yen,

95
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,170
I saw Mr. Hirasawa's eyes glance
towards the kitchen for a second.

96
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,530
It must be because you knew that

97
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,400
the 50 million yen was in the kitchen.

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,202
50 million yen in the kitchen?

99
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,306
Inspector, it seems this kitchen cupboard
has been moved before.

100
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,208
It left tracks on the floor.

101
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,510
Inspector, there's a hidden safe!

102
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,122
There's no cash in the safe.

103
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,925
But there is a notebook.

104
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,400
It looks like a ledger to me.

105
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,050
Is this your secret ledger?

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,003
I'm very sorry.

107
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,506
Actually, I under-report the sales every year

108
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,950
and keep the balance as cash in that safe.

109
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,611
In other words, it's tax evasion.

110
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,610
Yes.

111
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:31,217
But Wakabayashi and I
should be the only ones in the know.

112
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,050
From what you're saying,

113
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,522
you wanted to keep the 50 million yen
from tax evasion to yourself,

114
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,925
so you kidnapped Wakabayashi's girlfriend

115
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,200
and used Red Sheep to swindle it out of him.

116
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,931
What do you say to that, Hirasawa?

117
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,302
But if Mr. Hirasawa was the culprit,

118
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,000
would he have used his name
at the costume rental shop?

119
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,307
What?

120
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,911
Besides, Red Sheep went viral
two to three weeks ago.

121
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,215
Since Mr. Hirasawa returned
the costume three weeks ago,

122
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,860
don't you find it a bit strange?

123
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,360
You may be right.

124
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,122
The costume rental shop owner
said that the costume

125
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,620
has been taken out
since it was returned, didn't he?

126
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,428
There are traces of someone taking it out

127
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,920
in the middle of the night
for the last two or three weeks.

128
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,401
Is there someone trying
to frame Hirasawa for the crime?

129
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,400
Speaking of which...

130
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,709
Do you have the box
that had the costume with you?

131
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,300
You said the delivery company
would be coming to pick it up.

132
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,015
Right. Was that the box
that had the costume in it?

133
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,660
There's no way we could have known that!

134
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:43,150
Mr. Hirasawa,
was there a shipping label on the box?

135
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,425
- Yes.
- There's usually a column for writing...

136
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,927
what's in the box on those labels.

137
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,010
What did you write?

138
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,332
If I recall, I wrote "one costume set".

139
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,401
How could we have remembered that?

140
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,703
We didn't see any shipping label on the box!

141
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,705
The costume rental storehouse was old,

142
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,008
and the door wasn't even locked.

143
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,050
You could have easily taken out the costume
if you wanted.

144
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,314
That can't be!
There's no way we would know

145
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,010
that the lock to the storehouse was broken!

146
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:14,620
Huh? But Uncle Kogoro only said that
the door wasn't locked.

147
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,320
He didn't say anything
about the lock being broken.

148
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,370
It's just as the kid says!

149
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,730
There is a padlock attached
to the storehouse door,

150
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,780
but it can be removed easily.

151
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,503
Only the culprit would know that.

152
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,705
You tricked him into saying that!

153
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,207
He just happened to say the wrong thing!

154
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,210
Ami, it's no use.

155
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,810
Ryota.

156
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,716
Detective, we were Red Sheep all along.

157
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,620
Ami wore the red sheep costume...

158
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,920
and I recorded the videos.

159
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,270
We then uploaded the videos online.

160
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,230
So you were the ones behind it after all.

161
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,150
Things are clearer now.

162
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,400
The Red Sheep that Ran and I saw

163
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,450
was tall enough that
its horns scraped the ceiling.

164
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,708
But the Red Sheep on social media

165
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,300
was too short to be able to do so.

166
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,915
It means that the person
who killed Mr. Wakabayashi

167
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,300
is much taller.

168
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,560
I can't believe you did that!

169
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,421
It's the owner's fault!

170
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,023
He heard that you were going
to use the red sheep costume

171
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,625
to hand out flyers,

172
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,670
so he thought he should tarnish its image!

173
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,129
What?

174
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,331
It was supposed to be a one-time thing,

175
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,300
but once it got so popular on social media,

176
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,102
we had fun doing it.

177
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,605
Hold on! Who told you that the costume

178
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,500
was to be used to hand out flyers?

179
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,011
Hirasawa, did you tell anyone about this?

180
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,913
No, Wakabayashi was the only one I talked to.

181
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,290
I didn't tell anyone else about it.

182
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,490
So, that means you two
were eavesdropping on their conversation.

183
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,224
You must have heard about the 50 million yen

184
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,670
in the hidden safe at that time.

185
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,627
Excuse me, Detective Mouri.

186
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:06,032
Weren't they with you
at the time of the incident?

187
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,220
That's right! We have an alibi!

188
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:16,108
In that case, who was the one
who murdered Wakabayashi?

189
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:28,020
The murderer may well be someone else.

190
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,023
But there's no doubt that
you two kidnapped Anri

191
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,327
and demanded the 50 million yen
ransom from Wakabayashi.

192
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,650
The Red Sheep in this video was you, wasn't it?

193
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,650
It's not.

194
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,750
Don't lie to me!

195
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,250
Didn't you say that you were Red Sheep?

196
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,910
I am the Red Sheep from the Internet videos,

197
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,512
but not this one.

198
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,160
There's no way
there are two different Red Sheep.

199
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,117
If I start counting how many sheep there are,

200
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,650
I'll be asleep in no time.

201
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,222
One sheep, two sheep,

202
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,825
- three sheep...
- Come on, now.

203
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,526
And that is that!

204
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,530
Pardon me.

205
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,904
Everyone, allow me
to make a slight correction.

206
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:25,490
The Red Sheep in the video on that tablet
is not Ami.

207
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,650
It's not Ami?

208
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,615
That's right.

209
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,418
Mouri, what do you mean by that?

210
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,520
Ami is not the Red Sheep in the threat,

211
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,380
but the woman being taken hostage.

212
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,126
What?

213
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,929
What do you mean, Ami is the hostage?

214
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,910
Yes.

215
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,560
Anri, the woman Wakabayashi
knew through the dating app

216
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,150
and who became his girlfriend,

217
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,606
is none other than Ami herself.

218
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,310
What are you saying?

219
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,450
Ami is my girlfriend!

220
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,500
There's no way
that she is the head cook's girlfriend!

221
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,719
Wakabayashi didn't know the names or faces

222
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,500
of the restaurant's part-timers, right?

223
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,624
So, even if Ami pretended to be Anri,

224
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,770
he wouldn't have realised it.

225
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,420
Ami, tell me it isn't true.

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,130
In that case,
who's the Red Sheep in this video?

227
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,702
Hirasawa.

228
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,905
Is it true that everyone at the restaurant

229
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,400
referred to Wakabayashi as the head cook?

230
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,090
Well, yes. He was dissatisfied with it, though.

231
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,313
He could have set his name to "Chef"
in the dating app

232
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,460
because he was dissatisfied with his job title.

233
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,319
And there are two people here

234
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,722
who happened to call Wakabayashi "Chef".

235
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,925
One of them is Ami.

236
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,828
Ryota is right!
We've never even talked to the chef,

237
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,032
and I don't think
he even knows what we look like!

238
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,702
And the other is you, Kamio.

239
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,307
A month ago,
I recommended the dating app to the chef

240
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,700
because he didn't have any experience with women.

241
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,113
But aren't "chef" and "head cook" the same thing?

242
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,317
Are you suspecting me
just because I called him "chef"?

243
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,818
That isn't all.

244
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,919
Conan.

245
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,690
Will you explain
what happened using the sheep's head?

246
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,324
Yes, sir!

247
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,429
There's a helmet attached
to the inside of the costume's head

248
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,731
so that it could be put on more easily.

249
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,500
Mr. Kamio, can I put this on your head?

250
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,903
Well...

251
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,900
Kamio, please follow Conan's instructions.

252
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,309
Okay.

253
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,615
Stay still and don't move your arms.

254
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,025
Kamio.

255
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,530
Kamio, your nice hair has been messed up.

256
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,900
Oh, man.

257
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,504
Yesterday, your hair
was messed up the same way.

258
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,310
I remember you fiddling with your hair

259
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,060
the entire time very clearly.

260
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,116
Well, I came here on my motorbike yesterday,

261
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,717
so that was why it was messed up.

262
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,619
But didn't you say
that you haven't been on your motorbike

263
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,360
ever since you caused an accident?

264
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,425
I was at home all day yesterday.

265
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,029
I haven't ridden my motorbike
since I had that accident.

266
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,431
That's right. I heard him say that.

267
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,580
Finally, there is one other piece
of conclusive evidence.

268
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,505
Officer Takagi, will you examine Kamio's watch?

269
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,500
Yes.

270
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,350
Please excuse me.

271
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,410
Take a good look.

272
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,313
Is there red fibre stuck to the strap?

273
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,860
I do see something
that's red and looks like a thread.

274
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:57,010
That must be the nylon fibre
that's all over the costume.

275
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,526
The fact that it is on the watch strap

276
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,930
is proof that he wore the costume.

277
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,032
It must be because
I put on the headpiece just now!

278
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,500
It got on the watch earlier!

279
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,105
No. Conan must have told you
not to move your arms.

280
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,606
That's right.

281
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,810
You did not touch the costume at all.

282
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:24,316
Kamio, you probably
planted a listening device in the kitchen

283
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,819
and found out certain information
about the restaurant.

284
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,160
That's how you found out
about the 50 million yen in the safe.

285
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,750
Ami.

286
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,828
Looks like it's over.

287
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,031
Gosh! I knew I should've quit
working with such low pay

288
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,030
at this restaurant sooner!

289
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,905
Ami, don't tell me
you've been working with Kamio...

290
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,900
That's right. We've been at it for a while now.

291
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,511
I just wanted to mess with you.

292
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,913
I used the Red Sheep game to invite you out

293
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,916
so that I had an alibi.

294
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,160
No way.

295
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,222
I assume Mouri's deduction was correct, then.

296
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,225
It's true that Ami and I

297
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,927
planned to steal 50 million yen from the chef

298
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,670
and sent the email threat to him
for that reason.

299
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,900
But that was all there was to our plan.

300
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,003
We didn't even get the 50 million yen,

301
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,600
and we didn't kill the chef!

302
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,908
Are you still saying that?

303
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,400
Conan and Ran witnessed you
escaping the crime scene!

304
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,914
We definitely saw Red Sheep running away

305
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,850
while holding a black bag!

306
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,260
Like I said, that wasn't me!

307
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,220
It wasn't me.

308
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,260
What do you mean by that?

309
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,025
After Ami went to Beika Park,

310
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:44,650
I put the costume in the boot
and took a break.

311
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,432
And then...

312
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,400
When I woke up,
the costume was already gone!

313
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,705
Gone?

314
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,300
That's right!
The red sheep costume disappeared!

315
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,115
They're gone? The red sheep costume?

316
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,817
And the 50 million yen, too?

317
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,520
That's it! Could it be...

318
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,714
Inspector, I have secured the crime scene!

319
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,816
Please come in.

320
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,821
Were you the one
who murdered Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi

321
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,325
and stole the 50 million yen?

322
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,126
What are you talking about?

323
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,632
50 million yen in cash weighs about five kilos.

324
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,800
So that's why...

325
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,150
Ouch.

326
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,005
Gosh.

327
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,260
That penguin costume
hung a bit lower than the rest,

328
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,813
and I hit my head on it.

329
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,224
I only wanted to catch the culprit.

330
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,027
The culprit?

331
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,431
I wanted to catch the scoundrel

332
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,400
who keeps taking out the costume at night

333
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,202
without paying the rental fee,

334
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,560
so I waited inside to see
if I could ambush them.

335
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,909
That's when I overheard their plan.

336
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,312
They said they would be stealing 50 million yen

337
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,660
from a man named Wakabayashi.

338
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,521
My company is about to go out of business,

339
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,523
but they were about to get their hands on

340
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,125
so much money partly as a joke.

341
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,727
For that amount of money,
I wouldn't mind snatching it away from them.

342
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,030
So I followed them.

343
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:15,690
If I wore the costume,
no one would know who I am.

344
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,617
Leave the money on the ground and run.

345
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,321
He listened to me

346
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,070
and put the 50 million yen in front of me.

347
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,326
Why did you kill Wakabayashi

348
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,150
while you were trying to steal the money?

349
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,702
When I opened the bag to check its contents,

350
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,904
I found a kitchen knife inside!

351
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,706
There was a kitchen knife in the bag?

352
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,909
Mr. Wakabayashi
hid his kitchen knife in the bag

353
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,300
so that he could protect himself.

354
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,815
And when we saw each other's faces...

355
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,500
I didn't mean to kill him!

356
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,309
If only he hadn't seen my face...

357
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,213
(Mouri Detective Agency)

358
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,517
What's wrong with Uncle Kogoro?

359
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,420
It seems he can't sleep at night.

360
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,822
Sheep keep appearing in his dreams.

361
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,424
Sheep?

362
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:16,928
I guess even he's scared of the Red Sheep.

363
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,031
He keeps saying,
"Go away!" in his sleep, too.

364
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,930
Don't come here!

365
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:28,006
Go away!

366
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,308
I told you not to come.

367
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,310
Don't come closer.

368
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,015
I don't think that's what it is.

369
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,822
I'll drink as many as you give me!

370
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,025
(Next Episode)
Mr. Yamakabe, who made his name...

371
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,727
by selling imported goods,

372
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,830
was strongly recommended
to write an autobiography.

373
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,131
There are unfortunate signs

374
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:57,002
left behind of the car being used
to transport the body.

375
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,403
When the accident occurred,

376
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,506
did Temukai's car have a full tank?

377
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,950
It has been a while, Temukai.

378
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,014
We'll save the inspector!

"Megure And The Danger Of Police Detective Life"

380

Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,006
"Clay"

382
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,009
- Wake up, Dad!
- If this is a dream, don't wake me.

383
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,811
-Rest up.
- Okay.
