1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,390
A racing second hand, a shooting comet,
a wind-up doll, and a crowd!

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,960
Mystery-solving logic drenches
dry hearts and sand walls!

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,840
Today's case is about
greed and 1 billion yen in gold!

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,050
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,800
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:37,917
The Ryujin-Maru
disappeared seven years ago

7
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:42,627
with 1 billion yen in gold onboard,
but suddenly reappeared!

8
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,547
But the gold was gone.

9
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:51,667
The old man was invited to the island,
which had garnered attention

10
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,137
because of the ghost ship.

11
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:59,827
We came here as tourists,
but the mayor's true motive

12
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:03,687
was to have the old man
locate the missing gold.

13
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,737
Someone tried to kill
him at his lecture.

14
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,607
The culprit was Hamada,
the lighthouse keeper with facial burns.

15
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:18,037
And the suspicious travel agent
Uehara seemed to know him.

16
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:21,207
Who exactly are these two?

17
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:25,207
That night, the old man
was attacked by a warrior.

18
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:29,997
After narrowly escaping death,
he chased his assailant.

19
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:33,217
Someone knocked him
unconscious and framed him...

20
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,747
...as Hamada's killer!

21

The Ghost Ship Murder Case (Part 2)

The Ghost Ship Murder Case (Part 2)

24
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,367
Mori-san!

25
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:49,677
Even if you're a famous detective,

26
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,167
Takeo Mikami (50)
Even if you're a famous detective,

27
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,527
you can't get away with murder!
Takeo Mikami (50)

28
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:57,747
You got it all wrong! This guy
suddenly attacked me in my sleep!

29
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:01,287
I chased him here,
got hit from behind,

30
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:03,497
and when I woke up he was dead!

31
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:07,747
You probably just
killed him in a rage!

32
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:08,747
I didn't do it!

33
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:12,667
But this outfit
he's wearing is kept in

34
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,417
the Suigun Artifact Museum...

35
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:17,037
Why another Suigun outfit?

36
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:19,927
Could it be the curse?!

37
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,637
Don't be a fool!

38
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:23,827
No, it has to be!

39
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:26,607
I bet Hamada got possessed
and dressed up like this!

40
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,817
Be quiet! The curse is
just a superstition!

41
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,737
Then why's he dressed like that?!

42
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:33,957
Well, that's--

43
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:37,777
Now, now. There's no
point in arguing here.

44
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,447
This sword wound is what killed him.

45
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:45,417
Did his sleeve come
off during the struggle?

46
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,837
Those are rope marks!

47
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:53,617
Covered in cuts. But these ones are--

48
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:57,177
Children shouldn't
look at such things.

49
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,207
Yeah!

50
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,347
Wait! Where are you going,
Conan-kun?

51
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,867
Conan-kun! You'll get in
trouble for barging in here!

52
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,667
No doubt about it.
Hamada-san was killed here!

53
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,077
It's dry.

54
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,367
Is that blood?!

55
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,577
Ran! Get that officer!

56
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,417
It does look like
he was murdered here.

57
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,787
But that doesn't clear
the detective's name...

58
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:37,927
But...

59
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:42,497
The ghosts got mad because
an outsider was poking around!

60
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:43,937
Hold on...

61
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,037
You're gonna protect him?!

62
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:47,347
You'll be cursed too, you know!

63
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:49,077
Hey, you! Stop that!

64
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,767
This doesn't look good...

65
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,817
There it is!

66
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:01,207
What? What's here? The Suigun?!

67
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,037
Hilarious.

68
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,827
Come again?!

69
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:10,287
I don't know who did it,
but if they think they can frame me

70
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:13,957
with such a childish trick,
they're greatly mistaken!

71
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,167
You mean you didn't do this?!

72
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,577
Of course I didn't!

73
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:21,337
He was dead long before I got here.

74
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,637
Don't give us that crap!

75
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:26,167
The pool of blood on
the boat is proof.

76
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,957
If I killed him, then he
only died thirty minutes ago!

77
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:32,647
But the blood on the boat
is completely dry!

78
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:36,857
However you look at it,
three to four hours have passed!

79
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,817
Now that you mention it--

80
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:42,327
My attacker was someone
other than Hamada.

81
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,987
That person killed him!

82
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:50,577
After killing him, they attacked
me in Suigun armor!

83
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:55,917
To lure me here and frame me
as Hamada's murderer.

84
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,577
But...

85
00:05:57,577 --> 00:06:02,247
That person tied Hamada up
in the boat and tortured him!

86
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,247
The rope marks on
his wrists are proof!

87
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:15,647
And the cuts all over his body are
too numerous and shallow to be fatal.

88
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,477
He's right!

89
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:22,247
In other words, the killer
tied him up and tortured him.

90
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:24,697
Who'd do something so horrible?!

91
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:28,287
Hamada was probably
connected to the Ryujin-Maru.

92
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,117
He was probably on it!

93
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,537
How do you know about that?!

94
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:37,047
The Ryujin-Maru's telescope
was on the lighthouse.

95
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,757
Eh? How do you know about that?

96
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,077
Uh oh!

97
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,177
There's nothing a great
detective doesn't know!

98
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:47,247
Say, Hamada appeared
seven years ago, too...

99
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:51,687
So it was the gold's location
that the killer got from Hamada?

100
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:56,147
Yes. Hamada most likely
knew where it was.

101
00:06:56,827 --> 00:07:02,007
And he moved
to the island to guard it.

102
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:09,487
But he feared I would find it,
so he attempted to kill me.

103
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:16,997
Conan and Suzu-kun even saw
him leave from the backstage door.

104
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:18,417
Suzu did?

105
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:24,577
But there was yet another
person looking for the gold.

106
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,467
In that person's eyes,
Hamada and I were both obstacles.

107
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:32,457
That would explain the set up here!

108
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:34,937
But there's no one here like that--

109
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,497
It's him! That other person from Tokyo!

110
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:39,857
The travel agent?!

111
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:42,687
He was fighting with Hamada!

112
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,497
What?

113
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,897
Where is he staying?

114
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,657
The inn, I think.

115
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:51,247
That's great, Dad!

116
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:53,577
I didn't do it! Believe me!

117
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,037
No, we know you didn't!

118
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,647
Officer! Get going!

119
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:06,287
We've never arrested anyone before!

120
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,617
Geez. What're you here for then?

121
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:09,607
What's the matter?

122
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,427
He's got cold feet!

123
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,447
I shall go.

124
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:14,637
Deputy Mayor!

125
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:18,107
I'll try to convince him
to turn himself in.

126
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,247
But...

127
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:22,247
It was the town hall
that asked him here.

128
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,957
It's my responsibility
as Deputy Mayor.

129
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:37,867
It's been five minutes now...

130
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,757
Kinoshita-san!

131
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:52,407
Are you alright?!

132
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,717
He ran off...

133
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,287
He escaped out the back! After him!

134
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:02,647
I tried to persuade him,
but he suddenly shot at me...

135
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:05,107
We need to get you to a doctor!

136
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:08,067
I'll be all right.
It's just a scratch.

137
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:14,607
No sign of him around
the back road. Go ahead.

138
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:19,367
No sign of him here either. Go ahead.

139
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,917
Good work. Sorry, but could
you leave some guards

140
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,417
and come back for now?

141
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,427
Hey, now! There's still this area!

142
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:34,347
You can't ask us to check
the Suigun Cave...

143
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:40,997
Nobody would dare go near that place.
A single officer isn't really--

144
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,407
What kind of cowardice is this?!

145
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:45,167
Then why don't you go?!

146
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,317
Get serious! Why me?

147
00:09:54,247 --> 00:10:00,247
If Uehara killed Hamada-san,
he must've learned the gold's location.

148
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:04,707
But if so, then why did he
need to search the lighthouse?

149
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:15,347
No Entrance

150
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,497
Moss?

151
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:28,327
And this is the kind
that grows on land!

152
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,697
I was right; this boat didn't sink!

153
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:38,117
But would it be possible to hide it
from the islanders for seven years?!

154
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,047
Wait a minute!

155
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,507
There's the Suigun Cave.

156
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:52,757
No one would go near there! What if--

157
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:59,977
He would've noticed it had
he looked through the telescope!

158
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:03,437
There was no need
to torture Hamada-san!

159
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:08,227
Suigun Cave

160
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:12,197
Not good. I'll get stopped if I'm seen.

161
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,037
Oh, it's just you.

162
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:19,487
Don't you 'oh' me!
You wanna go to the cave, don't you?

163
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:20,997
Yeah.

164
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,227
I happen to know a secret path.

165
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:23,827
What?!

166
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,097
Where?! Tell me!

167
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:30,117
How rude! Can't you ask politely?

168
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,377
Please.

169
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:33,587
That's all?

170
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,297
What else should I do?!

171
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:41,567
You dummy! What're you thinking?!

172
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,707
If you don't want to, then fine.

173
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:43,687
Darn it...

174
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,767
Here is fine.

175
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:54,487
OK! I'll show you the way!
Follow me!

176
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:56,447
What a bossy kid...

177
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,957
See! Here it is!

178
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:06,227
You're not going in, are you?

179
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,327
I am.

180
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,077
But...

181
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,047
I thought you didn't
believe in superstitions?

182
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:15,327
Of course I don't! I only asked
because I'm concerned about you!

183
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:17,707
You can stay here if you're scared.

184
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,747
Wait!

185
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:23,887
It's just a superstition, right?

186
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,759
It looks like Hamada-san
used to look after this.

187
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,599
The ghosts are mad!

188
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,689
Conan-kun! You'll be punished!

189
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:07,549
Another cave.

190
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:10,129
Those weren't ghosts just now.

191
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,169
It was just a draft
resonating inside the cave.

192
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:14,239
Are we going in?

193
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:14,869
Yeah.

194
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:23,339
These stairs aren't natural.
Someone purposely made them.

195
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:27,759
It's bright up ahead!

196
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,509
You should make stairs
that don't break, you know?

197
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,969
This moss! This is the place!

198
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:50,799
Is this--

199
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,239
Conan-kun!

200
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,449
It's so pretty!

201
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,919
There's no moss here.
It broke apart recently.

202
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,939
Ah. The storm opened
up the exit and--

203
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,259
Looks like something slid down.

204
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,649
No doubt about it.
The Ryujin-Maru was hidden here.

205
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,129
The passageway that
the Ryujin-Maru stayed in

206
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,299
was demolished by
the storm and reopened.

207
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,469
What is it?!

208
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,939
A suicide?!

209
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:58,349
No, this was no suicide!
In which case, the killer is--

210
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:11,419
Hello? Yes. Yes.

211
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,379
That would really help us out!

212
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,109
Yes. Thanks a lot.

213
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,549
Detective Mori! The fishermen
are going to lend us a boat

214
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:23,329
to go by the Suigun Cave!

215
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,829
Alright! Let's go, Ran!

216
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:27,879
Wait, Dad! Have you seen
Conan-kun?

217
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,249
Who cares?! He's probably
off playing somewhere!

218
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:32,669
Now hurry!

219
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,099
He probably killed himself after
accepting that he couldn't escape.

220
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:43,969
Kinoshita-san...

221
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,849
I followed you
when I saw you go inside.

222
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,809
Well, let's go back to town.

223
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:49,799
Yeah.

224
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:53,239
What's wrong?

225
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:57,219
This was no suicide.
He was murdered.

226
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,379
You can't be serious!

227
00:15:58,379 --> 00:15:59,699
Look at his wound.

228
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:04,629
The hole on the right is bigger
than the one on the left.

229
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,329
This proves the bullet went
from left to right.

230
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:11,629
Yet the gun is in his right hand.

231
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:16,589
Isn't it unnatural to shoot from
the left with your right hand?

232
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,099
In that case, there's no longer
any need to hide the truth.

233
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,309
Why?!

234
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,269
Conan-kun doesn't seem surprised.

235
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:35,739
You shot yourself
in the arm, didn't you?

236
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,449
You even realized that?!

237
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:41,379
There were burn marks
on the hole in your shirt.

238
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,449
Which means that you fired
with the muzzle pressed against it.

239
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:48,469
You said that you
were suddenly shot at.

240
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:52,419
Nobody would 'suddenly'
shoot in such a way.

241
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,919
You impress me.

242
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,379
You also killed Hamada-san.

243
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,129
That's right. I always
thought he seemed suspicious.

244
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,349
So I checked the lighthouse
while he was gone.

245
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,309
I take it you found the telescope?

246
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:14,669
Yes. I planned to look for
the gold someday at my leisure.

247
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:18,739
But the greedy mayor
started needlessly prying...

248
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:24,279
Daddy's not greedy! He said
you used the town's money!

249
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:32,589
I became nervous;
Kogoro Mori is a peerless detective.

250
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:38,549
I was worried he might find the
gold first if he started investigating.

251
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:42,089
And he got involved, too.

252
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:47,719
So you tricked the old man and
framed him as Hamada-san's killer.

253
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:51,049
I mistakenly underestimated him, though.

254
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,379
But you did learn the gold's
location from Hamada-san...

255
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:58,149
He finally told me about
this place after a bit of pain.

256
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,219
Just as Mori said,
he had been on the Ryujin-Maru.

257
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:05,079
I take it this guy was, too?

258
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,409
Yes. Hamada threw him and the
owner into the stormy ocean

259
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,689
to keep all the gold for himself.

260
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:17,129
Hamada. His real name
was apparently Aoki.

261
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,799
He brought the Ryujin-Maru
in here to escape the storm.

262
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,599
But the storm tore rocks off
and sealed the exit.

263
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:32,309
He probably didn't plan to,
but there were no other hiding places.

264
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,879
The islanders stayed away
because of the 'curse.'

265
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:40,919
Even more so after he killed
the professor to make it look like

266
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,069
the Suigun curse.

267
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:44,989
What happened to his face?

268
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,629
I hear he burned it himself

269
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,999
because he feared someone
might recognize him...

270
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,219
You pretended to get shot by
Uehara-san to let him escape, huh?

271
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,969
If he were arrested, Hamada-san's
killer and the gold's location

272
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,009
would be found out.

273
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:06,639
That's right. He did seem
vaguely aware of this place.

274
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,929
Why are you letting me run?

275
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,389
Never mind that; you're a
dead man if they catch you now!

276
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,549
I'll hold onto this.

277
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,189
Your situation will get even
worse if you're caught with it.

278
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,159
Thanks...

279
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:38,959
Kinoshita-san!

280
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:43,009
Then you beat him to
the cave and killed him.

281
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,719
That's right.
Now our discussion is over!

282
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:55,589
Nobody'll find your bodies here! Ever!

283
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:58,719
Conan-kun!

284
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,319
Did you find the gold?

285
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:03,919
It's probably buried
around here somewhere.

286
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,009
I'll leisurely look for it
after things cool down.

287
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,239
What's so funny?!

288
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:13,299
You'd never find it in 100
years with your intelligence!

289
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,199
What did you say?!

290
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,249
You still don't know?

291
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,209
You mean you know where?!

292
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,419
Yeah. At your feet.

293
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:24,509
Go!

294
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:40,729
The gold was in these blocks
used as part of the stairs.

295
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:44,469
Wow! I love you, Conan-kun!

296
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,739
Hey, now...

297
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:48,859
An earthquake?!

298
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:51,199
There it is!

299
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:58,259
Take this board to the exit!
I'll bring Kinoshita-san!

300
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:58,999
Right!

301
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,459
Conan-kun! Hurry!

302
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,129
Hurry!

303
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,639
Conan-kun!

304
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:38,719
There's probably no way
to dig out the gold

305
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,669
in the completely-collapsed cave.

306
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,469
I doubt anyone would
spend over a billion yen

307
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:49,089
just to dig out a billion yen.

308
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,389
In the end, the greed-inducing
gold returned to the earth,

309
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,289
along with the Suigun curse.

310
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:30,259
You idiot! If I hadn't gone to
rescue you in the fishing boat,

311
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,149
there's no telling
what would've happened!

312
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:39,969
What are you doing to my
Conan-kun?!

313
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:41,169
Yikes!

314
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:57,469
It's empty!

315
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,599
I don't get it! Where did
the killer disappear to?!

316
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:07,439
Wait! Could it be?!
Only he could've done it!

317
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:09,419
On the next Conan--

318
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,419
The Giant Monster Gomera Murder Case.

319
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,312
Next Conan's Hint:

320
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:16,313
Next Conan's Hint:
Paint.

321
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:18,561
Paint.
