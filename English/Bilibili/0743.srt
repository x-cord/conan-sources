1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,540
They said it wasn't going to rain today, and yet...

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,040
"Chain of Robberies Underway"

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,140
Ran!

4
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,540
Conan! Dad!

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,040
You came for me. Thanks!

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,640
Gosh. It's already past 21:00, you know?

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,540
I'm sorry. Club activity was extended.

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,940
Here, your umbrella.

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,040
Thanks, Conan!

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,040
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
are slashed by the light of deduction.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
There is a series of burglaries.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,940
A coincidental prank takes an unexpected turn!

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:52,628
"Coincidences Come in Twos"

18
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:54,328
You'd better be careful.

19
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:59,128
They say dangerous people have been appearing in this area recently.

20
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:01,228
You mean the robber wearing a hood, right?

21
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,628
I think it was...

22
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:04,728
The so-called hood man.

23
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,728
The one who attacks women using a police stick

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,828
and snatch their bags.

25
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:12,828
Yeah. They all got away with slight wounds till now,

26
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,428
but if the perp's not arrested soon,

27
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,828
his crime will start escalating and...

28
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,828
Hey, are you all right?

29
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,328
A man wearing a hood went that way.

30
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,828
I got it!

31
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:34,428
Hey, sir.

32
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,928
Conan.

33
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:39,528
How come your clothes aren't wet, sir?

34
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,628
What's wrong, Conan?

35
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,428
We've got to hurry or the perp will...

36
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:48,028
It suddenly started to rain.

37
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,428
Your shoes are muddy. Your pants are wet.

38
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:53,228
But you don't have an umbrella,

39
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:56,828
yet your clothes aren't wet. That's strange, isn't it?

40
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,028
True.

41
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:03,328
Weren't you wearing something on top of your clothes till now?

42
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,628
Like a jacket with a hood on?

43
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,028
Darn it!

44
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:10,328
Hold it!

45
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,328
Out of the way!

46
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:21,528
Well, I guess this was to be expected.

47
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,528
Hey, are you okay?

48
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:25,228
I'm fine.

49
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,928
Not you.

50
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:30,828
By the way, what about the scream we just heard?

51
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,828
This way!

52
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,028
Are you all right, Miss?

53
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:53,028
Well, thank you, Mr. Mouri.

54
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:56,228
We were having a tough time nabbing the hooded perp, you see.

55
00:04:56,228 --> 00:05:00,228
Well, it was really no big deal, just the usual, Inspector.

56
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,728
This is a hospital, you know.

57
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:08,028
Shut up. I know.

58
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:09,228
Okay then, Inspector,

59
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:11,428
if there is anything I can help you with again, contact me anytime.

60
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,828
Yes.

61
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,028
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,728
Excuse me.

63
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,128
How was she?

64
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:25,128
She's fine. Her CT and EEG came out okay.

65
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:27,228
They say it's all right for her to leave.

66
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,728
I'm glad.

67
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,828
Thank you very much.

68
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,728
Thanks to all of you, I'm fine.

69
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:35,828
Oh, right! I've got to call my roommate,

70
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:38,228
because I'm sure she's worried.

71
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:41,328
But I'm sure glad that she wasn't all that hurt.

72
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:45,128
Things could've been worse.

73
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:48,528
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

74
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,228
Yes, Sato speaking.

75
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,228
Strange.

76
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,428
What's wrong?

77
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:57,428
Yoko's... My roommate's not answering the phone.

78
00:05:57,428 --> 00:06:00,228
She should've finished work long ago.

79
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,128
What?

80
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,428
A corpse of a woman was found

81
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,128
near the site we were at just a while ago?

82
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,328
Yes! Yes!

83
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:12,128
Mizuki, do you know what kind of clothes Yoko was wearing?

84
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:16,928
Huh? I think it was a white jacket and a beige skirt.

85
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,428
Ms. Tachibana, are you sure?

86
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:23,828
Yes.

87
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,628
Hey. Don't tell me...

88
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:29,128
No way...

89
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,828
What a bummer.

90
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,928
No mistake!

91
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,728
It's Yoko!

92
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:51,828
When she left this morning, she was just fine.

93
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,428
To think that it was the last I would see of her...

94
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,428
I had no idea!

95
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,528
Yoko!

96
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,528
Mizuki.

97
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:04,928
Ran. Stay with her, will you?

98
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:13,228
Judging from the circumstances,

99
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:15,528
it's been 1 to 3 hours since she died.

100
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:17,028
Yeah.

101
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:21,428
She works for an apparel shop near here,

102
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:24,328
and seems to have been attacked on her way home.

103
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:27,928
She's been slugged on the back of her head with a stick like object.

104
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,428
The method that the perp wearing the hood used up till now.

105
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,628
That is, the area he prevailed in, the time span,

106
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,328
everything matches.

107
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,928
Cash has been taken from the victim's wallet, too.

108
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:42,328
It's most likely that he was going to just leave a slight wound behind

109
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,828
but something came up and he ended up killing Yoko.

110
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,928
He then attacked Mizuki

111
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,528
when he was still in this excited state of mind.

112
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:57,428
What an incident. Roommates both attacked successively.

113
00:07:57,428 --> 00:08:01,428
But that led to arresting the perp.

114
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,428
The bond that they had

115
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:06,628
may have summoned such a miracle.

116
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,528
What is it?

117
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,628
The smell of coffee.

118
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,228
This is...

119
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:27,628
You brat! Snooping around again.

120
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,628
Where are you all going?

121
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,328
We're going to have Ms. Tachibana

122
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,628
tell her story at headquarters too, you see.

123
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,528
We've got to get a written statement from her

124
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,028
regarding her own case, too.

125
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:42,028
I was thinking of going along with Mizuki.

126
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,828
I wanna go, too.

127
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,828
It's okay, isn't it, Pops?

128
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:53,028
I'd like to confirm.

129
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,528
The one who attacked you...

130
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,128
Are you sure it's that man?

131
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:04,628
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

132
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,228
Okay.

133
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,928
Doesn't he look sort of angry?

134
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:15,628
Yeah. He confessed to the series of robberies, but...

135
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,528
He insists that he didn't kill Yoko

136
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,928
and refuses to admit it.

137
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:22,328
About attacking Ms. Tachibana,

138
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,428
he says that he just didn't know what to do

139
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:26,228
because she had seen his face

140
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:29,028
and had no intention of killing her.

141
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:32,528
What's going on?

142
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,028
Tell us!

143
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:36,028
Come on, officer!

144
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:38,928
Like I'm telling you, we are in the midst of investigation now.

145
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,528
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

146
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:43,628
Conan. Well...

147
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:46,728
But you've already caught that hooded man, right?

148
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,928
Are you all...

149
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:51,628
Right, we're victims of the hood man!

150
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:55,428
You're going to get our wallets back for us for sure, aren't you?

151
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,728
My driver's license was in there, too!

152
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,728
Are you really looking for it?

153
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,228
Wait a sec.

154
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:04,228
Did all of you get your wallets taken?

155
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,228
-Yes, that's right! -Yes, that's right!

156
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,728
What's going on?

157
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:11,828
Yoko who was killed had cash stolen from her,

158
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:14,428
but the wallet was left back at the scene.

159
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,428
Then, Officer Takagi, I'll leave them all to you.

160
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,828
Yes, I'll drive them all home.

161
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,828
Wait, Officer Sato.

162
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:23,828
What?

163
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:25,828
There's thread on your skirt.

164
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:27,828
No joke? Oh, no!

165
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,228
I left the basting thread on.

166
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,528
Basting thread?

167
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:35,128
On the slits of brand new skirts

168
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:38,128
threads called basting threads are sewn on,

169
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,828
so that the two sides of the slits don't fall out of place.

170
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:44,428
See? It's joined together loosely

171
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:47,828
by making a knot at the tip.

172
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:51,328
The skirt that I wore to work today ripped.

173
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,828
So, this is a new skirt I hurriedly bought.

174
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:58,128
I see.

175
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
Yes, Mouri here.

176
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,620
Inspector!

177
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,620
What? Really?

178
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,020
Okay.

179
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,720
Did something come up?

180
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,220
The blood that was found on the special stick that the hood man used

181
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,920
was concluded to be Yoko's.

182
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,020
What?

183
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,620
All's done, then.

184
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,120
Yeah. We've got concrete evidence, too.

185
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,720
It's been concluded that the hood man killed Yoko, too!

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,420
I'm happy for you, Mizuki.

187
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Yes. I'm sure that Yoko in heaven is happy, too.

188
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,120
Boy did I eat, I'm full.

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,020
Miss, beer and fried chicken please.

190
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,320
That's enough, already!

191
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,520
Who cares! The case has been solved, you know.

192
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,620
I'm just telling you to respect TPO!

193
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,820
Mizuki just lost her best friend, you know.

194
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,420
Well, well, come on, both of you.

195
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,120
Yoko and I used to do things like argue and chat here, you see.

197
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,420
I kind of happened to recall that.

198
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,720
Mizuki.

199
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,620
But I'm glad the perp was arrested.

200
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm really grateful to all of you.

201
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,820
Hey, Dad!

202
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,920
That's my hot towel.

203
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,620
Yours is that one!

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,720
-Is that so? -Gosh. I don't believe it.

205
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,020
Sorry, sorry. I'll give it back to you, there.

206
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,720
No! I could never use this!

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,620
Who cares! What's the diff?

208
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,320
It's not the same!

209
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
I see.

210
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,920
That's what it was.

211
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,120
Don't, Ms. Tachibana!

212
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,520
No, let me. This is my token of appreciation.

213
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,320
No. We don't want problems later. Okay?

214
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,020
I see.

215
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,720
Thank you, for your consideration.

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,320
It'll be 10,250 yen.

217
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Huh? It's pretty expensive.

218
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,820
I wonder if I have enough?

219
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,420
Thank you.

220
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Sorry, Takagi.

221
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,820
Thank you so very much.

222
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,420
I know it's going to be hard on you,

223
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,120
but try to look on the bright side of things.

224
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,020
Call me anytime you get lonely.

225
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,220
I'll run right over...

226
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,720
I'm sorry. Don't let it bother you.

227
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I'll see you then.

228
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,320
Dad?

229
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,220
Mr. Mouri?

230
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,820
I finally got to the point thanks to the pain.

231
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,420
This case is still not over!

232
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,420
Mr. Mouri, it's not over?

233
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,920
The one who killed Yoko isn't the hood man.

234
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,420
What're you talking about?

235
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,720
You said there was proof just a while ago.

236
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,420
No. If he's the perp, some things don't fit.

237
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,220
Things don't fit?

238
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,820
Cash was removed from Yoko's wallet

239
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,220
and the wallet was left at the scene.

240
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,620
But that's what the perp was after, right?

241
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,820
No. In the three previous cases,

242
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,220
the perp stole the wallet and all.

243
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,020
Why was it different just this time?

244
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,920
It's true that it's a bit strange.

245
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,620
But that's not strong enough to go on.

246
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,020
Next for the wound on the corpse.

247
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Yoko's wound was found on the left back of her head.

248
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Yoko was attacked from behind.

249
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,120
This means that the perp held the stick in his left hand,

250
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,920
and slugged Yoko.

251
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,720
In other words, the perp is left-handed.

252
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
But the hood man is...

253
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,420
Right handed!

254
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,220
By the way, Mizuki.

255
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,520
You made the call using your left hand,

256
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,720
and tried to pay using your left hand.

257
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,320
It's true that I'm left-handed.

258
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,720
But there are many other left-handed people, aren't there?

259
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,420
There's more.

260
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,220
On the white inner shirt that Yoko was wearing,

261
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,820
there was a still new coffee stain on it.

262
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,920
But the stain was cut off at the partition of the skirt and her shirt,

263
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,320
and there was no stain on her skirt.

264
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,520
A basting thread was on the skirt.

265
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
A basting thread?

266
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,920
Yes.

267
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
The basting thread that is found on brand new skirts

268
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,120
so that the cloth won't fall out of place.

269
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,020
Just in case,

270
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,720
I confirmed this with the store manager where Yoko works.

271
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,220
It seems that Yoko,

272
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,320
just before leaving the apparel shop that she works for,

273
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,320
spilled some coffee on the clothes and skirt she was wearing.

274
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,520
That's why she bought a new jacket and skirt on the spot,

275
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,820
changed clothes and left the shop.

276
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,120
That's why the coffee stain on her shirt was cut half way.

277
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,620
The basting thread was still on her skirt.

278
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,520
So, what?

279
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,920
You talked to Yoko's corpse saying...

280
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,520
When she left this morning, she was just fine.

281
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,820
To think that it was the last I would see of her...

282
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,220
I had no idea!

283
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,520
Yoko!

284
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,420
You saw Yoko in the morning and never since,

285
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,020
still how did you know

286
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,720
what clothes she'd be wearing when she came back from work?

287
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,420
Mizuki?

288
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,020
Well, maybe in the morning,

289
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,620
she was wearing clothes of a similar color.

290
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,720
That's why I probably mistook what I saw.

291
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Mizuki, this.

292
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Pops said to look at it.

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,420
-This is... -This is...

294
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,720
I had the store manager sent it to me.

295
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,920
This is a picture of Yoko before she changed clothes.

296
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,220
Please tell me, Mizuki.

297
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,220
How could that ever look like a white jacket and beige skirt?

298
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,620
You saw Yoko after work, didn't you?

299
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
But Mr. Mouri,

300
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,120
just that isn't enough to say that Mizuki killed Yoko, is it?

301
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,820
No. It's true that everything is circumstantial evidence.

302
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,020
They're not conclusive.

303
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
How rude

304
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,620
to treat me like a perp with just something like that.

305
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,820
Yoko was my best friend, you know!

306
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,520
Right, Dad.

307
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,720
You need concrete proof to say something like that.

308
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,920
Concrete proof?

309
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,020
I've got it.

310
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,720
Right here.

311
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,720
Mizuki. For some reason

312
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
you put the wallet that you took out

313
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
at the family restaurant into your pocket.

314
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
Why didn't you put it into your bag where you took it out of?

315
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,620
You were afraid, weren't you?

316
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,220
That when you put the wallet back,

317
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,820
someone would be able to see inside your bag, right?

318
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,620
In your bag,

319
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,020
you had something that you didn't want us to see.

320
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,920
Isn't that right?

321
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,820
I thought it was strange to begin with.

322
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,420
Tonight was a night so cold that you had to wear a jacket.

323
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,420
But you were dressed very lightly.

324
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,020
But if something came up

325
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,120
that made you have to take off your jacket...

326
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,520
Then, it's understandable why you're dressed like that.

327
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,620
You probably have the jacket

328
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,620
that has Yoko's blood stains on it inside your bag.

329
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,320
No, that's not all.

330
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,820
The special stick that the hood man had to begin with

331
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,320
should also be inside your bag.

332
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,620
Then the hood man...

333
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
What about the one he had?

334
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,920
That's indeed the weapon that Mizuki used to kill Yoko.

335
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Isn't that right?

336
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,420
First, in order to make it look as if the hood man did it,

337
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,920
you checked out the special stick he used

338
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
when carrying out his serial thefts,

339
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,420
and bought the same one.

340
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,520
You killed Yoko with that special stick.

341
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
But on the way back home,

342
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,420
you were ironically attacked by the real hood man.

343
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,320
How unfortunate.

344
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,720
However, a chance came about that changed your luck around.

345
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
Hey, are you all right?

346
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,820
A man wearing a hood went that way.

347
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,020
Back then, it dawned on you.

348
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,520
You used the accident of being attacked by the real hood man

349
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,520
to full advantage.

350
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,120
I see! She switched her own stick

351
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,920
with the one the hood man had!

352
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,720
That's why Yoko's blood

353
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,020
was detected on the stick of the hood man.

354
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,020
Yeah. I was just about to be deceived, too.

355
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,820
But during that hot towel incident, it finally dawned on me.

356
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,120
I figured that maybe the murder weapon may have been switched

357
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,520
at one point just like the hot towel was.

358
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,220
Mizuki.

359
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,920
You were accompanied by Ran

360
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,320
right through after you were rescued.

361
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,020
You didn't have time to get rid of your jacket or the stick.

362
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,920
So, please show it to us.

363
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,520
The contents of your bag.

364
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,620
Mizuki.

365
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,520
Yoko was really like the sun.

366
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,820
She was cheerful and selfish.

367
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,720
The world always revolved around her.

368
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,520
In front of such a sun,

369
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,020
I was no more than a powerless moon!

370
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,520
With all of what she had,

371
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,720
she still took everything away from me.

372
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,920
My clothes, my money and the one that I loved, too.

373
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,120
She thought that it was natural and all hers to own.

374
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,120
I put up with all of it, though.

375
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,920
Until I heard that one phrase.

376
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm sorry. Mizuki will be back soon, so...

377
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,220
I wish the hood man would get rid of her or something.

378
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,020
She's really a nuisance.

379
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,020
That's why I finally did it,

380
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,920
under the pretense that the hood man did it!

381
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,120
Hey, dad.

382
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,920
You picked on the food again, didn't you?

383
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,520
You ate my cake!

384
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,620
No, I didn't.

385
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,220
I know I usual do but this time,

386
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,020
that thief cat did it.

387
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,420
You're blaming Goro again.

388
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,920
This is a really perfect crime here.

389
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,620
"Next Episode" -Yeah.

390
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,020
You were listening to the phone conversation?

391
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,520
Your collar's stretched out and your underwear is showing.

392
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,820
This is called off-shoulder and I'm showing it on purpose!

393
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,320
-Drowned. -Drowned.

394
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,420
What?

395
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
We're arresting you right here

396
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,020
and now as a murderer!

397
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,920
What?

398
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,220
Next Conan, "Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part1)"

399
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,020
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,720
"Bowling alley"

401
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,820
At the bowling alley...

402
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,320
Karate vs. Jeet Kune Do.

403
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,120
Why there?
