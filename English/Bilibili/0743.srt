1
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.540
They said it wasn't going to rain today, and yet...

2
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.040
"Chain of Robberies Underway"

3
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.140
Ran!

4
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.540
Conan! Dad!

5
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.040
You came for me. Thanks!

6
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.640
Gosh. It's already past 21:00, you know?

7
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.540
I'm sorry. Club activity was extended.

8
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.940
Here, your umbrella.

9
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.040
Thanks, Conan!

10
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.040
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

11
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040
are slashed by the light of deduction.

12
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.640
There is a series of burglaries.

13
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.940
A coincidental prank takes an unexpected turn!

14
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.040
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:52.628
"Coincidences Come in Twos"

18
00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:54.328
You'd better be careful.

19
00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:59.128
They say dangerous people have been appearing in this area recently.

20
00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:01.228
You mean the robber wearing a hood, right?

21
00:03:01.228 --> 00:03:02.628
I think it was...

22
00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:04.728
The so-called hood man.

23
00:03:04.728 --> 00:03:06.728
The one who attacks women using a police stick

24
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.828
and snatch their bags.

25
00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:12.828
Yeah. They all got away with slight wounds till now,

26
00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:14.428
but if the perp's not arrested soon,

27
00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.828
his crime will start escalating and...

28
00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:26.828
Hey, are you all right?

29
00:03:26.828 --> 00:03:29.328
A man wearing a hood went that way.

30
00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:30.828
I got it!

31
00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:34.428
Hey, sir.

32
00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:35.928
Conan.

33
00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:39.528
How come your clothes aren't wet, sir?

34
00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:43.628
What's wrong, Conan?

35
00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:45.428
We've got to hurry or the perp will...

36
00:03:45.428 --> 00:03:48.028
It suddenly started to rain.

37
00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:51.428
Your shoes are muddy. Your pants are wet.

38
00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:53.228
But you don't have an umbrella,

39
00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:56.828
yet your clothes aren't wet. That's strange, isn't it?

40
00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.028
True.

41
00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:03.328
Weren't you wearing something on top of your clothes till now?

42
00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:07.628
Like a jacket with a hood on?

43
00:04:07.628 --> 00:04:09.028
Darn it!

44
00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:10.328
Hold it!

45
00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:12.328
Out of the way!

46
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.528
Well, I guess this was to be expected.

47
00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.528
Hey, are you okay?

48
00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:25.228
I'm fine.

49
00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:27.928
Not you.

50
00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:30.828
By the way, what about the scream we just heard?

51
00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:32.828
This way!

52
00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:39.028
Are you all right, Miss?

53
00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:53.028
Well, thank you, Mr. Mouri.

54
00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:56.228
We were having a tough time nabbing the hooded perp, you see.

55
00:04:56.228 --> 00:05:00.228
Well, it was really no big deal, just the usual, Inspector.

56
00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:05.728
This is a hospital, you know.

57
00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:08.028
Shut up. I know.

58
00:05:08.028 --> 00:05:09.228
Okay then, Inspector,

59
00:05:09.228 --> 00:05:11.428
if there is anything I can help you with again, contact me anytime.

60
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:12.828
Yes.

61
00:05:15.028 --> 00:05:17.028
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:18.728
Excuse me.

63
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.128
How was she?

64
00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:25.128
She's fine. Her CT and EEG came out okay.

65
00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:27.228
They say it's all right for her to leave.

66
00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:28.728
I'm glad.

67
00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.828
Thank you very much.

68
00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:32.728
Thanks to all of you, I'm fine.

69
00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:35.828
Oh, right! I've got to call my roommate,

70
00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:38.228
because I'm sure she's worried.

71
00:05:38.228 --> 00:05:41.328
But I'm sure glad that she wasn't all that hurt.

72
00:05:41.328 --> 00:05:45.128
Things could've been worse.

73
00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.528
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

74
00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:50.228
Yes, Sato speaking.

75
00:05:50.228 --> 00:05:52.228
Strange.

76
00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:53.428
What's wrong?

77
00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:57.428
Yoko's... My roommate's not answering the phone.

78
00:05:57.428 --> 00:06:00.228
She should've finished work long ago.

79
00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:02.128
What?

80
00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.428
A corpse of a woman was found

81
00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:05.128
near the site we were at just a while ago?

82
00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:08.328
Yes! Yes!

83
00:06:08.328 --> 00:06:12.128
Mizuki, do you know what kind of clothes Yoko was wearing?

84
00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:16.928
Huh? I think it was a white jacket and a beige skirt.

85
00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:20.428
Ms. Tachibana, are you sure?

86
00:06:20.428 --> 00:06:23.828
Yes.

87
00:06:23.828 --> 00:06:26.628
Hey. Don't tell me...

88
00:06:26.628 --> 00:06:29.128
No way...

89
00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:30.828
What a bummer.

90
00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.928
No mistake!

91
00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:45.728
It's Yoko!

92
00:06:47.528 --> 00:06:51.828
When she left this morning, she was just fine.

93
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.428
To think that it was the last I would see of her...

94
00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:56.428
I had no idea!

95
00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:58.528
Yoko!

96
00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:01.528
Mizuki.

97
00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:04.928
Ran. Stay with her, will you?

98
00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:13.228
Judging from the circumstances,

99
00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:15.528
it's been 1 to 3 hours since she died.

100
00:07:15.528 --> 00:07:17.028
Yeah.

101
00:07:17.028 --> 00:07:21.428
She works for an apparel shop near here,

102
00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:24.328
and seems to have been attacked on her way home.

103
00:07:24.328 --> 00:07:27.928
She's been slugged on the back of her head with a stick like object.

104
00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:30.428
The method that the perp wearing the hood used up till now.

105
00:07:30.428 --> 00:07:32.628
That is, the area he prevailed in, the time span,

106
00:07:32.628 --> 00:07:34.328
everything matches.

107
00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:37.928
Cash has been taken from the victim's wallet, too.

108
00:07:37.928 --> 00:07:42.328
It's most likely that he was going to just leave a slight wound behind

109
00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:45.828
but something came up and he ended up killing Yoko.

110
00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:48.928
He then attacked Mizuki

111
00:07:48.928 --> 00:07:51.528
when he was still in this excited state of mind.

112
00:07:53.128 --> 00:07:57.428
What an incident. Roommates both attacked successively.

113
00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:01.428
But that led to arresting the perp.

114
00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:03.428
The bond that they had

115
00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:06.628
may have summoned such a miracle.

116
00:08:10.728 --> 00:08:12.528
What is it?

117
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.628
The smell of coffee.

118
00:08:20.628 --> 00:08:22.228
This is...

119
00:08:23.528 --> 00:08:27.628
You brat! Snooping around again.

120
00:08:27.628 --> 00:08:30.628
Where are you all going?

121
00:08:30.628 --> 00:08:32.328
We're going to have Ms. Tachibana

122
00:08:32.328 --> 00:08:34.628
tell her story at headquarters too, you see.

123
00:08:34.628 --> 00:08:36.528
We've got to get a written statement from her

124
00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:38.028
regarding her own case, too.

125
00:08:38.028 --> 00:08:42.028
I was thinking of going along with Mizuki.

126
00:08:42.028 --> 00:08:43.828
I wanna go, too.

127
00:08:43.828 --> 00:08:45.828
It's okay, isn't it, Pops?

128
00:08:51.528 --> 00:08:53.028
I'd like to confirm.

129
00:08:53.028 --> 00:08:55.528
The one who attacked you...

130
00:08:55.528 --> 00:08:58.128
Are you sure it's that man?

131
00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:04.628
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

132
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:06.228
Okay.

133
00:09:06.228 --> 00:09:08.928
Doesn't he look sort of angry?

134
00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:15.628
Yeah. He confessed to the series of robberies, but...

135
00:09:15.628 --> 00:09:17.528
He insists that he didn't kill Yoko

136
00:09:17.528 --> 00:09:19.928
and refuses to admit it.

137
00:09:19.928 --> 00:09:22.328
About attacking Ms. Tachibana,

138
00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.428
he says that he just didn't know what to do

139
00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:26.228
because she had seen his face

140
00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:29.028
and had no intention of killing her.

141
00:09:30.428 --> 00:09:32.528
What's going on?

142
00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:34.028
Tell us!

143
00:09:34.028 --> 00:09:36.028
Come on, officer!

144
00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:38.928
Like I'm telling you, we are in the midst of investigation now.

145
00:09:38.928 --> 00:09:41.528
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

146
00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:43.628
Conan. Well...

147
00:09:43.628 --> 00:09:46.728
But you've already caught that hooded man, right?

148
00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:48.928
Are you all...

149
00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:51.628
Right, we're victims of the hood man!

150
00:09:51.628 --> 00:09:55.428
You're going to get our wallets back for us for sure, aren't you?

151
00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.728
My driver's license was in there, too!

152
00:09:57.728 --> 00:09:59.728
Are you really looking for it?

153
00:09:59.728 --> 00:10:01.228
Wait a sec.

154
00:10:01.228 --> 00:10:04.228
Did all of you get your wallets taken?

155
00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:06.228
-Yes, that's right! -Yes, that's right!

156
00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:07.728
What's going on?

157
00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:11.828
Yoko who was killed had cash stolen from her,

158
00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.428
but the wallet was left back at the scene.

159
00:10:15.628 --> 00:10:18.428
Then, Officer Takagi, I'll leave them all to you.

160
00:10:18.428 --> 00:10:20.828
Yes, I'll drive them all home.

161
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.828
Wait, Officer Sato.

162
00:10:22.828 --> 00:10:23.828
What?

163
00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:25.828
There's thread on your skirt.

164
00:10:25.828 --> 00:10:27.828
No joke? Oh, no!

165
00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:30.228
I left the basting thread on.

166
00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:32.528
Basting thread?

167
00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:35.128
On the slits of brand new skirts

168
00:10:35.128 --> 00:10:38.128
threads called basting threads are sewn on,

169
00:10:38.128 --> 00:10:40.828
so that the two sides of the slits don't fall out of place.

170
00:10:40.828 --> 00:10:44.428
See? It's joined together loosely

171
00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:47.828
by making a knot at the tip.

172
00:10:47.828 --> 00:10:51.328
The skirt that I wore to work today ripped.

173
00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:53.828
So, this is a new skirt I hurriedly bought.

174
00:10:56.028 --> 00:10:58.128
I see.

175
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.720
Yes, Mouri here.

176
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.620
Inspector!

177
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.620
What? Really?

178
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.020
Okay.

179
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.720
Did something come up?

180
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.220
The blood that was found on the special stick that the hood man used

181
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.920
was concluded to be Yoko's.

182
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.020
What?

183
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.620
All's done, then.

184
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.120
Yeah. We've got concrete evidence, too.

185
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.720
It's been concluded that the hood man killed Yoko, too!

186
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.420
I'm happy for you, Mizuki.

187
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.420
Yes. I'm sure that Yoko in heaven is happy, too.

188
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.120
Boy did I eat, I'm full.

189
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.020
Miss, beer and fried chicken please.

190
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.320
That's enough, already!

191
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.520
Who cares! The case has been solved, you know.

192
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.620
I'm just telling you to respect TPO!

193
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.820
Mizuki just lost her best friend, you know.

194
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.420
Well, well, come on, both of you.

195
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.720
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.120
Yoko and I used to do things like argue and chat here, you see.

197
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.420
I kind of happened to recall that.

198
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.720
Mizuki.

199
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.620
But I'm glad the perp was arrested.

200
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.420
I'm really grateful to all of you.

201
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.820
Hey, Dad!

202
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.920
That's my hot towel.

203
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.620
Yours is that one!

204
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.720
-Is that so? -Gosh. I don't believe it.

205
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.020
Sorry, sorry. I'll give it back to you, there.

206
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.720
No! I could never use this!

207
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.620
Who cares! What's the diff?

208
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.320
It's not the same!

209
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.320
I see.

210
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.920
That's what it was.

211
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.120
Don't, Ms. Tachibana!

212
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.520
No, let me. This is my token of appreciation.

213
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.320
No. We don't want problems later. Okay?

214
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.020
I see.

215
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.720
Thank you, for your consideration.

216
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.320
It'll be 10,250 yen.

217
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.320
Huh? It's pretty expensive.

218
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.820
I wonder if I have enough?

219
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.420
Thank you.

220
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.420
Sorry, Takagi.

221
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.820
Thank you so very much.

222
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.420
I know it's going to be hard on you,

223
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.120
but try to look on the bright side of things.

224
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.020
Call me anytime you get lonely.

225
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.220
I'll run right over...

226
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.720
I'm sorry. Don't let it bother you.

227
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.820
I'll see you then.

228
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.320
Dad?

229
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.220
Mr. Mouri?

230
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.820
I finally got to the point thanks to the pain.

231
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.420
This case is still not over!

232
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.420
Mr. Mouri, it's not over?

233
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.920
The one who killed Yoko isn't the hood man.

234
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.420
What're you talking about?

235
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.720
You said there was proof just a while ago.

236
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.420
No. If he's the perp, some things don't fit.

237
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.220
Things don't fit?

238
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.820
Cash was removed from Yoko's wallet

239
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.220
and the wallet was left at the scene.

240
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.620
But that's what the perp was after, right?

241
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.820
No. In the three previous cases,

242
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.220
the perp stole the wallet and all.

243
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.020
Why was it different just this time?

244
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.920
It's true that it's a bit strange.

245
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.620
But that's not strong enough to go on.

246
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.020
Next for the wound on the corpse.

247
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.020
Yoko's wound was found on the left back of her head.

248
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.020
Yoko was attacked from behind.

249
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.120
This means that the perp held the stick in his left hand,

250
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.920
and slugged Yoko.

251
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.720
In other words, the perp is left-handed.

252
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.720
But the hood man is...

253
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.420
Right handed!

254
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.220
By the way, Mizuki.

255
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.520
You made the call using your left hand,

256
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.720
and tried to pay using your left hand.

257
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.320
It's true that I'm left-handed.

258
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.720
But there are many other left-handed people, aren't there?

259
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.420
There's more.

260
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.220
On the white inner shirt that Yoko was wearing,

261
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.820
there was a still new coffee stain on it.

262
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.920
But the stain was cut off at the partition of the skirt and her shirt,

263
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.320
and there was no stain on her skirt.

264
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.520
A basting thread was on the skirt.

265
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.520
A basting thread?

266
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.920
Yes.

267
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.920
The basting thread that is found on brand new skirts

268
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.120
so that the cloth won't fall out of place.

269
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.020
Just in case,

270
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.720
I confirmed this with the store manager where Yoko works.

271
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.220
It seems that Yoko,

272
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.320
just before leaving the apparel shop that she works for,

273
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.320
spilled some coffee on the clothes and skirt she was wearing.

274
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.520
That's why she bought a new jacket and skirt on the spot,

275
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.820
changed clothes and left the shop.

276
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.120
That's why the coffee stain on her shirt was cut half way.

277
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.620
The basting thread was still on her skirt.

278
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.520
So, what?

279
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.920
You talked to Yoko's corpse saying...

280
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.520
When she left this morning, she was just fine.

281
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.820
To think that it was the last I would see of her...

282
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.220
I had no idea!

283
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.520
Yoko!

284
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.420
You saw Yoko in the morning and never since,

285
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.020
still how did you know

286
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.720
what clothes she'd be wearing when she came back from work?

287
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.420
Mizuki?

288
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.020
Well, maybe in the morning,

289
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.620
she was wearing clothes of a similar color.

290
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.720
That's why I probably mistook what I saw.

291
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.720
Mizuki, this.

292
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.720
Pops said to look at it.

293
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.420
-This is... -This is...

294
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.720
I had the store manager sent it to me.

295
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.920
This is a picture of Yoko before she changed clothes.

296
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.220
Please tell me, Mizuki.

297
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.220
How could that ever look like a white jacket and beige skirt?

298
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.620
You saw Yoko after work, didn't you?

299
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.720
But Mr. Mouri,

300
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.120
just that isn't enough to say that Mizuki killed Yoko, is it?

301
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.820
No. It's true that everything is circumstantial evidence.

302
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.020
They're not conclusive.

303
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.020
How rude

304
00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.620
to treat me like a perp with just something like that.

305
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.820
Yoko was my best friend, you know!

306
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.520
Right, Dad.

307
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.720
You need concrete proof to say something like that.

308
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.920
Concrete proof?

309
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.020
I've got it.

310
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.720
Right here.

311
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.720
Mizuki. For some reason

312
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720
you put the wallet that you took out

313
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.120
at the family restaurant into your pocket.

314
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.720
Why didn't you put it into your bag where you took it out of?

315
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.620
You were afraid, weren't you?

316
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.220
That when you put the wallet back,

317
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.820
someone would be able to see inside your bag, right?

318
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.620
In your bag,

319
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.020
you had something that you didn't want us to see.

320
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.920
Isn't that right?

321
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.820
I thought it was strange to begin with.

322
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.420
Tonight was a night so cold that you had to wear a jacket.

323
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.420
But you were dressed very lightly.

324
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.020
But if something came up

325
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.120
that made you have to take off your jacket...

326
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.520
Then, it's understandable why you're dressed like that.

327
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.620
You probably have the jacket

328
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.620
that has Yoko's blood stains on it inside your bag.

329
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.320
No, that's not all.

330
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.820
The special stick that the hood man had to begin with

331
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.320
should also be inside your bag.

332
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.620
Then the hood man...

333
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.620
What about the one he had?

334
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.920
That's indeed the weapon that Mizuki used to kill Yoko.

335
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.720
Isn't that right?

336
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.420
First, in order to make it look as if the hood man did it,

337
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.920
you checked out the special stick he used

338
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920
when carrying out his serial thefts,

339
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.420
and bought the same one.

340
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.520
You killed Yoko with that special stick.

341
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.120
But on the way back home,

342
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.420
you were ironically attacked by the real hood man.

343
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.320
How unfortunate.

344
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.720
However, a chance came about that changed your luck around.

345
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.320
Hey, are you all right?

346
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.820
A man wearing a hood went that way.

347
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.020
Back then, it dawned on you.

348
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.520
You used the accident of being attacked by the real hood man

349
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.520
to full advantage.

350
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.120
I see! She switched her own stick

351
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.920
with the one the hood man had!

352
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.720
That's why Yoko's blood

353
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.020
was detected on the stick of the hood man.

354
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.020
Yeah. I was just about to be deceived, too.

355
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.820
But during that hot towel incident, it finally dawned on me.

356
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.120
I figured that maybe the murder weapon may have been switched

357
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.520
at one point just like the hot towel was.

358
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.220
Mizuki.

359
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.920
You were accompanied by Ran

360
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.320
right through after you were rescued.

361
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.020
You didn't have time to get rid of your jacket or the stick.

362
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.920
So, please show it to us.

363
00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.520
The contents of your bag.

364
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.620
Mizuki.

365
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.520
Yoko was really like the sun.

366
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.820
She was cheerful and selfish.

367
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.720
The world always revolved around her.

368
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.520
In front of such a sun,

369
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.020
I was no more than a powerless moon!

370
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.520
With all of what she had,

371
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.720
she still took everything away from me.

372
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.920
My clothes, my money and the one that I loved, too.

373
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.120
She thought that it was natural and all hers to own.

374
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.120
I put up with all of it, though.

375
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.920
Until I heard that one phrase.

376
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.520
I'm sorry. Mizuki will be back soon, so...

377
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.220
I wish the hood man would get rid of her or something.

378
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.020
She's really a nuisance.

379
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.020
That's why I finally did it,

380
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.920
under the pretense that the hood man did it!

381
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.120
Hey, dad.

382
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.920
You picked on the food again, didn't you?

383
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.520
You ate my cake!

384
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.620
No, I didn't.

385
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.220
I know I usual do but this time,

386
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.020
that thief cat did it.

387
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.420
You're blaming Goro again.

388
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.920
This is a really perfect crime here.

389
00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.620
"Next Episode" -Yeah.

390
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.020
You were listening to the phone conversation?

391
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.520
Your collar's stretched out and your underwear is showing.

392
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.820
This is called off-shoulder and I'm showing it on purpose!

393
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.320
-Drowned. -Drowned.

394
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.420
What?

395
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.420
We're arresting you right here

396
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.020
and now as a murderer!

397
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.920
What?

398
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.220
Next Conan, "Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part1)"

399
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.020
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.720
"Bowling alley"

401
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.820
At the bowling alley...

402
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.320
Karate vs. Jeet Kune Do.

403
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.120
Why there?
