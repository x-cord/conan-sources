1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,610
Let's get right down to business.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,510
Will you show it to me?

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,510
"Masako Fukuhara (53), Yuka Fukuhara (26)" -That mysterious Buddha statue.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,510
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,710
This way, please.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,510
It's the 11-faced Kannon inside this miniature shrine.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,910
And you're saying that although no one touches it,

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,910
it turns sideways and backwards on it's own?

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,910
Yes.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,810
If it's true, that's really mysterious.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,510
It's true.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,710
And after that happens, something bad actually happens.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,010
Well, let me take a look at it.

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,510
Please.

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,310
Oh, no. What shall I do?

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,710
Don't tell me something bad is going to happen again.

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,310
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,110
The image of the Buddhist statue that turns it's back on it's own

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,310
causes a very queer case.

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,010
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,410
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:14,867
"A Mysterious Prophetic Statue of Buddha"

25
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,367
There's nothing strange about it.

26
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,767
There's nothing to worry about.

27
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:34,767
If something does happen, I'll be here this time.

28
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,067
I don't want to see your face!

29
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,167
Get out of here!

30
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,267
"Eizen Fukuhara (23)" -All you ever do is play around everyday

31
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,567
without even working.

32
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,367
"Eikyo Fukuhara (56)" -And now you're stealing like a thief?

33
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,567
How wretched!

34
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,467
I just borrowed it!

35
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:00,567
Either way, it's easy money that you got from the temple supporters, right?

36
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,367
You don't have to act so big shot.

37
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,167
If you borrowed it, give it back!

38
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,067
So long as I give it back, right?

39
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,667
I don't want to see your face either.

40
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,767
That fool...

41
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,367
I'm sorry that you had to see that shameful sight.

42
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,367
They are my father and younger brother.

43
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:29,067
He mentioned that your brother was playing around everyday?

44
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,467
He went to head temple

45
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,867
so that he could take over for father,

46
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,167
but he came back in less than a month.

47
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:41,167
After that he didn't go back to school or work

48
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,067
and all he does is play around with bad friends.

49
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,367
"Junkoh Wakuda (28)" -He's undergoing ascetic practices here.

50
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,767
His name is Junkoh.

51
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:07,567
Junkoh. This is Detective Mouri, Ran

52
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:12,067
and Conan who came from Tokyo.

53
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,467
How do you do?

54
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,767
I'm Junkoh.

55
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,067
Welcome.

56
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:23,967
Junkoh, we just looked and the Kannon statue was facing backwards.

57
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,267
I hope nothing bad happens.

58
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,167
I sure hope so.

59
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:39,667
I'm sorry that I'm drinking before the head priest.

60
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:43,067
Father will eat alone, after he finishes chanting the sutras,

61
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,067
so please make yourself at home.

62
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:50,767
You cook too, Junkoh?

63
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,567
That's part of training too.

64
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:57,667
Junkoh is a much better cook than I am.

65
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,067
What's this?

66
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,267
That's nothing to brag about.

67
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:08,867
Oh, Father, this is Mr. Mouri who has come from Tokyo.

68
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:12,267
He's going to investigate the 11-faced Kannon.

69
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,667
The Buddha letting the living know

70
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,367
that something bad is going to be happening.

71
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,467
It's not something that a detective can handle.

72
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,767
You'd better hurry on and leave.

73
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,767
Yuka, Junkoh,

74
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,267
your weddings are going to be held in September.

75
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,267
I'm going to say my nightly sutra.

76
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:38,667
Let me go with you, then.

77
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,967
It's fine.

78
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,667
Discuss the wedding or whatever with Yuka.

79
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,167
Come...

80
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,667
Ran and Conan, eat your dinner.

81
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,267
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:53,667
He's not a bad person but he's stubborn.

83
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,067
This is delicious!

84
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,467
Our temple supporter gave this to us.

85
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,167
Please help yourself to it, Conan.

86
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:07,367
Thank you.

87
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,167
How about you, Ran?

88
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:13,567
I don't want to eat at this time because I'll get fat.

89
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,067
That's how girls your age are.

90
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,667
I used to be that way too, when I was young.

91
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,767
Don't you have to feed it, mother?

92
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,567
I'll go later

93
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,067
because we have guests tonight.

94
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,067
Do you have a pet?

95
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,167
No.

96
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,267
But you'll find out when you come with me later.

97
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,767
I wonder what it is?

98
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:44,867
What is the bad thing that the Buddha told you about?

99
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,567
Last year, a person, who went to pick edible plants in the mountains,

100
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,467
was attacked by a bear.

101
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:54,167
Yes, although his life was spared.

102
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:57,167
They were saying that when the bear got out of hibernation,

103
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,167
there was still snow left and it probably couldn't find food.

104
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:04,667
Before that, we were all relieved that the typhoon went by,

105
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,267
but there was a landslide and a house collapsed.

106
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,967
You mean that statue had it's back turned both times?

107
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:19,367
I guess I'll go get your mattresses ready for you then.

108
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,167
Dad, why don't you stop drinking already

109
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,967
and eat dinner?

110
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,767
Don't worry, why don't you watch TV or something?

111
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,467
Come to think of it, Father sure is late.

112
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,267
Maybe he's praying with all his might

113
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,567
for the happiness of both of you?

114
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,867
Dad.

115
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,067
Come on, it's bath time.

116
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,267
What're you going to do?

117
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,667
I guess no bath for me tonight.

118
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,667
That's why I told you not to drink so much.

119
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,467
The priest is still chanting his sutra.

120
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,167
How embarrassing.

121
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:01,967
What?

122
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,067
Everybody stay back.

123
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,267
Pops!

124
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:26,267
It's not long since he's been stabbed.

125
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,267
Only a few minutes have passed.

126
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,967
Ran, call the police.

127
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:31,967
Okay.

128
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,067
There are no signs of struggle.

129
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,367
Pops!

130
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,967
This...

131
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,967
It looks to have been moved recently.

132
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,567
What's this scratch?

133
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,867
"Officer Shimokawa (48), Officer Hayashi (32)" -Which means,

134
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:14,767
after the priest came here to chant the sutra,

135
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,667
you were all together right through?

136
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,667
Yes, until the 8 pm bell rang,

137
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,367
we were all together.

138
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:27,567
It's probably the doings of someone who came from outside.

139
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:31,867
We had the forensics check the doors and windows in front

140
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:36,067
but there are no traces of anyone having come in from outside.

141
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,067
I see.

142
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,867
Well, if a stranger had come in,

143
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,667
the priest wouldn't continue chanting the sutra

144
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:45,867
without doing anything about it.

145
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,867
Inside that golden chandelier like thing,

146
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,667
there's something stuck to it.

147
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,167
I'm telling you,

148
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,267
stop getting in the way of investigation!

149
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,367
It's cellophane tape.

150
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,267
It was on the inside of the canopy on the left side.

151
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,167
Who are you?

152
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,367
What're you guys? What're you doing at my house?

153
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,467
Tell me your name.

154
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,967
I'm the son of the owner of this house.

155
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,267
Eizen!

156
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,567
What's up? A robbery or something?

157
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,867
Father's...

158
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,967
What's going on?

159
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:32,067
Your father has been murdered by someone.

160
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,367
Where were you until now, Eizen?

161
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,167
I was with my friends.

162
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,267
Who the heck are you anyway?

163
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:42,567
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

164
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,967
Could you give us the name of your friend?

165
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:48,567
Why do I have to tell you?

166
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,967
You were scolded by your father this afternoon, weren't you?

167
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,667
He told you to give back the money,

168
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,867
and you shouted back that you would, then left.

169
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,567
If you can't return the money,

170
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:02,567
that would be a motive for you to kill your father.

171
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,067
You got to be kidding.

172
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,867
It's true that I borrowed money but just a measly 300,000 yen!

173
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:10,467
Do you think I'd kill somebody for such chicken feed!

174
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,267
And, what's your friend's name?

175
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:16,367
Manami Sakurai. She's a hostess for a shop called Romance.

176
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,467
Debt's built up after I kept going there for sometime

177
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,967
so I borrowed some money from the reception hall in the temple

178
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,767
that was supposed to be used for repairs.

179
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:26,767
The cellophane tape was on the left of the canopy.

180
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,167
And on that side...

181
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,467
What was that?

182
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,467
What's wrong, Conan?

183
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,767
An animal fled just now.

184
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,867
That's a tanuki (Japanese racoon dog).

185
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,667
I told you a while ago, right?

186
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:48,367
Mother feeds it so it comes around at night.

187
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,567
Really?

188
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,467
It seems to be living in the thicket in back of the mountain

189
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,167
around the road that leads to the waterfall.

190
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,367
What a surprise that was!

191
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,967
It surprised you, didn't it?

192
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,867
It's an automatic bell hammer.

193
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,167
Father and Junkoh...

194
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:20,867
go off to see the temple supporters sometimes.

195
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,067
This is...

196
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,834
Yes, thank you.

197
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,534
If you will excuse me.

198
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,934
It has been confirmed that Eizen

199
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:09,034
had been at a shop called Romance until 30 minutes ago.

200
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:12,634
See, I told you. I got an alibi.

201
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,334
How dare you suspect me.

202
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,834
Pops. Take a look at this.

203
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:21,134
This was found near the tanuki's den.

204
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,634
What is it at a busy time like this?

205
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:26,034
Conan, don't get in their way.

206
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:29,234
But, it's important.

207
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,334
Please come with me.

208
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:38,034
The tanuki got it's food every night at this bell tower.

209
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,334
So what?

210
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:45,034
This bell is hammered automatically.

211
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:49,034
The bell rang when we were in the dining room too, right?

212
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:51,034
So, what?

213
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:53,734
I think the tanuki found this salami here

214
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,934
and took it back to it's den.

215
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,434
Here?

216
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,834
I see, so that's what it was...

217
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,834
The one who killed Eikyo

218
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:06,334
didn't come to the main building at all.

219
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:10,134
So, in this case, the alibi is meaningless.

220
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:14,134
Eizen, you could've committed the crime too.

221
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,334
Just what do you mean?

222
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,234
Let me explain.

223
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,434
The salami was placed on this side of the chain,

224
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:25,534
in other words, on the side where the wooden hammer move when it rung

225
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:27,434
and pulled the string through the hole of the chain.

226
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,834
Then, the string was stretched over to the window

227
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:34,234
all the way into the main building of the temple.

228
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,934
After that, the tip of the string was pulled through the space

229
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,434
in the canopy and into the main building.

230
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:42,234
The tip string was pasted onto the knife using cellophane tape.

231
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:46,434
When the time came and the hammer is pushed forward,

232
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:49,134
the string that are connected to the knife is pulled

233
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:51,434
and the knife falls.

234
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,834
After that, the tanuki takes the salami back to it's den

235
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,634
without leaving a single trace of the trick behind.

236
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:04,934
By this method,

237
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:08,634
the perpetrator didn't have to be here to kill Eikyo.

238
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,334
Therefore, everybody who was at this temple back then,

239
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:15,534
including Eizen is a suspect.

240
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,434
Right, he's right.

241
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,134
However...

242
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:24,534
However, the one who killed Eikyo...

243
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,334
is none other than you,

244
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:27,634
Junkoh!

245
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:32,134
What makes you so sure?

246
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:33,934
The one who could've done this

247
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:36,334
has constant access to the main temple building,

248
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,934
like preparing books for sutras giving offerings.

249
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,534
Therefore, no one else except Junkoh.

250
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,834
I did it!

251
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,734
I did it exactly as Mr. Mouri had explained.

252
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:51,534
Darn it! Why'd you kill Father?

253
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:56,134
The fact is I have a fiancee.

254
00:16:56,134 --> 00:17:00,834
But, the priest insisted that I marry Yuka.

255
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:03,634
At first I was hesitant to answer

256
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,734
but thinking of all the things he did for me,

257
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,634
I just couldn't make myself refuse the offer.

258
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:12,634
So in time, the priest believed that I had approved

259
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,934
and even planned the wedding date...

260
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,634
Then, this was all because of me.

261
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,434
All because I didn't reject what Father said.

262
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:26,034
I sort of had an idea of how Junkoh felt.

263
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:29,834
But I didn't want to get Father angry so...

264
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:32,234
You should've just said no!

265
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,634
Even if the old man got angry,

266
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,134
all you had to do was leave this temple!

267
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,834
I had no intention of wanting to kill him.

268
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,434
I just wanted to scare him

269
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,134
and tell him that bad things happen in this temple,

270
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:47,734
so I would like to quit training here.

271
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:57,534
So I made the Kannon statue inside the miniature shrine turn it's back

272
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,034
and moved the desk slightly to the side

273
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,834
so that the knife wouldn't touch his body when it came falling.

274
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,334
Excuse me.

275
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,034
Pops Kogoro told me to tell you.

276
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,634
Detective Mouri?

277
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,634
He said that he wants you to try dropping a knife

278
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:18,234
from the same height as where the cellophane tape was.

279
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:21,034
I guess I've got to do it

280
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,134
if it's a request from Detective Mouri.

281
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,234
Here goes!

282
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:33,034
I thought so...

283
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,834
It's impossible to kill him with this trick.

284
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:45,134
Forensic officer, is this white powder from taking fingerprints?

285
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:46,634
No, it's not.

286
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,334
It's plain rice powder.

287
00:18:56,634 --> 00:19:00,634
Junkoh, we'll hear the rest of your story at the station.

288
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,634
Junkoh.

289
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:06,934
Were you the one who moved the Kannon all this time?

290
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:11,334
No, the only time I turned it backwards was today.

291
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,134
Please wait.

292
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:27,034
It's most likely that Junkoh used that trick to try

293
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,934
and scare Eikyo.

294
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,034
However, he's not the one who killed Eikyo.

295
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,734
What?

296
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:37,834
Rather, it's impossible to kill someone using that method.

297
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,334
Even if he were hit, at most, he would only end up hurt.

298
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:44,134
So, who is the actual killer?

299
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:48,534
That's you, his wife, Masako, correct?

300
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:54,334
You saw Junkoh setting up the trick, didn't you?

301
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:57,234
So you tried to frame him for the murder.

302
00:19:57,234 --> 00:20:00,434
Just what do you think you're saying, detective?

303
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,634
By the corpse on the side of the desk,

304
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,734
some rice powder was found.

305
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:06,934
After dinner,

306
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:11,334
the only ones who ate sweet mochi rice were you and Conan.

307
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:14,634
If it were before the victim started chanting the sutra,

308
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,534
he would've wiped it off.

309
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,434
In other words, the perpetrator is the only one

310
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,334
who could've left the powder there!

311
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,234
That's right.

312
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:27,434
I was fed up already!

313
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,834
I didn't even want to see his face!

314
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,734
That's why I killed him.

315
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:04,334
He shouts when things don't go his way.

316
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:07,334
He has to have a say in the littlest things.

317
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,634
He complains as if he's some big shot.

318
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,534
He thinks his children and I are his slaves

319
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:15,334
and tries to take complete control over us.

320
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:22,934
I'm so glad he's gone, good riddance!

321
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:27,634
Mother.

322
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,934
Mom.

323
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:57,434
I'm sorry to have gotten you messed up in all this.

324
00:22:57,434 --> 00:23:00,934
Rather, I'm more worried about you.

325
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:05,034
We couldn't solve the mystery of the statue that faces backwards

326
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:07,034
so we weren't of much help.

327
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:10,034
I knew about it from the start.

328
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:12,434
What?

329
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,034
You said that it would always turn backwards

330
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:18,434
after a heavy rain or when there's a lot of water after snow melts, right?

331
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:22,434
It happens when the water of the waterfall in the backyard increases

332
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,034
and the low frequency sound wave,

333
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,534
resonates with the air in the miniature shrine

334
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:29,334
making the statue turn little by little.

335
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,334
Is that so?

336
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:36,134
You really know odd things, don't you?

337
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:38,234
I called Shinichi

338
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:41,334
and he told me what to say.

339
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,934
Why won't Shinichi just come here

340
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:46,834
and solve the case instead of calling?

341
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:51,034
I am solving the case.

342
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,434
"Next Episode" -This is our lab.

343
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,634
I see.

344
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,634
This is my robot.

345
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:03,234
God knows why he made something like that.

346
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:06,634
Who looks most suspicious?

347
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:09,334
I think it's Mr. Tanizaki.

348
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,834
Isshiki, turn off the main gas switch.

349
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,434
Horiuchi, call the ambulance.

350
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:18,934
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

351
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:24,334
Next Conan, "The Mechanical Witness"

352
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:27,277
Next Conan's Hint:

353
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:29,177
"Mouse"

354
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,977
Tanuki, mouse so the hint goes.

355
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:32,077
It has to do with animals?

356
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,777
Get a load of the next hint then!
