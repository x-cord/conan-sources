"Hatobue Lodge"

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,440
We came to the Hatobue Lodge guest house in Nishiokuho.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,740
Popular entertainer Otaro Minakitaya,

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,440
also known as the Prince of Beer, was staying there as well.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,340
For some reason,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,440
Miona, daughter of guest house manager, Asako Yuri,

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,440
was afraid of the Masked Comet Byun TV show

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,640
that aired seven years ago.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,840
Meanwhile, a man's body was discovered in a lake

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,440
seven kilometers east of the guest house.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,240
The body was Otaro's former partner, Kyujiro Minakitaya.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,640
And that night, Otaro was found dead as well.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,240
When the countdown reaches zero,

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,340
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,540
Both members of the former comedy duo are dead.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,840
What did the Masked Comet do?

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,240
His name is Detective Conan.

20
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:55,881
"Eyewitness Testimony Seven Years Later (Part 2)"

21
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:00,481
The deceased is Otaro Minakitaya,

22
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,381
born Kotaro Minamida.

23
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:07,481
Who was the last one to see Otaro?

24
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,281
"Makoto Muramatsu (48)" -Probably me.

25
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,981
"Shinsuke Ohara (29)" -Otaro came to the dining room

26
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,681
as I was cleaning up before I headed home.

27
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:16,381
He took beers and a bottle opener from the room.

28
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:19,581
Around what time was that?

29
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,381
It was about 11.

30
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,881
Did anyone enter the dining room after that?

31
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:25,881
I couldn't sleep,

32
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:29,081
so I went down to the dining room for a beer.

33
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,581
That was around midnight.

34
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,881
How long were you here?

35
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,881
I spent about 30 minutes

36
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,581
attaching beer caps to a cow magnet.

37
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:39,281
Then I went back to my room to sleep.

38
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:44,981
And Fujiyoshi discovered the dining room in disarray around two.

39
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,281
It must have happened during that hour.

40
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,781
Otaro must have died around the same time.

41
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:52,881
Yes.

42
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:54,981
Shirogane, what about you?

43
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:57,581
I was sleeping in my room.

44
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,981
How about you?

45
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:03,381
I was sleeping in my room in the annex next door with my daughter.

46
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,881
I woke up when Ran called me.

47
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:10,381
I was at home and returned when I received a phone call.

48
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,781
It was an accident.

49
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,781
He got drunk and fell when he stepped on an empty bottle.

50
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,981
His head struck an empty bottle, and he died.

51
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,681
It's unfortunate that both members of the former comedy duo

52
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:26,081
suffered accidental deaths one after another.

53
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,981
The situation has changed.

54
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,381
What?

55
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:34,081
The water found in Kyujiro's lungs

56
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,381
was ordinary tap water.

57
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,381
What?

58
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,681
In other words, he was dumped in the lake

59
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,481
after being killed elsewhere?

60
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,681
Yes.

61
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,981
Hold on.

62
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:50,281
Does that mean Otaro could've killed him?

63
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:55,081
Kyujiro was investigating Otaro, wasn't he?

64
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:59,181
We found this listening device in Otaro's room

65
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:01,681
with Kyujiro's fingerprints on it.

66
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:05,381
Maybe he discovered a major secret using that bug

67
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,781
and was killed to keep him quiet.

68
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,381
What major secret would that be?

69
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,481
Muramatsu, it's an emergency.

70
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,581
What is it?

71
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,481
What's going on?

72
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:23,581
We've determined the bloody fingerprint on the table belonged to Otaro,

73
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,381
but that fingerprint...

74
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,981
What is it?

75
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,681
In the case seven years ago,

76
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:31,181
the culprits threw the masks they were wearing

77
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:34,181
into a ditch and fled.

78
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:38,081
There was a single fingerprint they failed to wipe clean.

79
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,781
The culprit's fingerprint?

80
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:40,881
Could it be...

81
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:44,081
It matched Otaro's fingerprints.

82
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,481
Seriously?

83
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:51,581
In other words, Otaro was one of the two culprits.

84
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,081
And Kyujiro was killed by Otaro

85
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:56,681
because he learned his secret.

86
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,781
Which means

87
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:02,481
we can't simply assume Otaro's death was an accident.

88
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:08,781
Was the witness in the seven year old case is Miona?

89
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:18,181
The witness in the seven year old case was indeed Miona,

90
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:20,481
who was five years old at the time.

91
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,881
What?

92
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,481
I was assigned to the Haido City station at the time.

93
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:27,281
I was involved in the investigation.

94
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,781
Did Miona see the culprits' faces?

95
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,081
It's not clear if she did.

96
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,181
It must have been traumatizing for her.

97
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,781
Her memory is hazy.

98
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:41,081
Then the reason Otaro frequented this guest house

99
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,981
where Miona lived...

100
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:46,481
He was watching to see if she'd regain her memory.

101
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,781
What?

102
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,881
Boss!

103
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,381
Thank you.

104
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:55,181
That's why Miona was afraid of

105
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,781
discussions about the Masked Comet.

106
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:04,381
That case was the reason Masked Comet Byun was canceled.

107
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,381
The case did have an impact,

108
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:09,881
but ratings and merchandise sales

109
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:11,581
were failing to meet expectations.

110
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,181
They were considering ending the show early.

111
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,581
That case wasn't the only reason.

112
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:19,981
How do you know so much about it?

113
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,181
I'm actually a scriptwriter, not a freelance writer.

114
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:28,181
I was the head writer for Masked Comet Byun.

115
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,181
What?

116
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:33,281
-Really? -Did you know about Miona?

117
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:36,281
You had a newspaper clipping about the case.

118
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:43,681
Naturally, Miona's identity was kept anonymous as the time,

119
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,681
but some heartless people publicly revealed her name online.

120
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:51,781
When I visited this town a year ago to cover a story,

121
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:54,081
I saw Miona.

122
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,981
I was worried about her and the damage she suffered.

123
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:58,881
I decided to visit the guest house

124
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,181
since I wasn't busy with work.

125
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,381
Didn't you know, too, Ide?

126
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,381
What? Well...

127
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:09,281
Yeah, I knew.

128
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,781
I investigated everything I could about the case.

129
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,481
Why would you do that?

130
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:15,381
Because...

131
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,081
the financial company employee who was murdered

132
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,981
was my father.

133
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:22,781
What?

134
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:26,281
Ide is my mother's maiden name.

135
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,081
At the time of the case,

136
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:33,181
I was too busy caring for my traumatized mother to worry about it.

137
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,481
But when my mother passed away two years ago,

138
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,781
I suddenly became interested in the case.

139
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:40,781
I learned about Miona while doing my research.

140
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:44,381
So you even got a mask.

141
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,881
I thought she might remember something.

142
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:50,781
I didn't think it would be so traumatizing for her.

143
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,381
I'm really sorry!

144
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:01,681
Come to think of it, there was a key on the table at the crime scene.

145
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,281
Does anyone know what it was for?

146
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:06,581
I was wondering about that, too.

147
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:08,381
When I saw it before,

148
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,181
he said it was a key to the door to happiness.

149
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,081
The door to happiness?

150
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:17,081
What does that mean?

151
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,881
I seem to be hungry.

152
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,081
The sun's rising.

153
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:32,581
I'll make something light.

154
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:37,981
I'm sorry for making you worry.

155
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,781
She seems to have calmed down.

156
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,281
That's great.

157
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,781
I asked Miona yesterday,

158
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:46,681
but you used to live in Haido City, right?

159
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:48,581
When did you move here?

160
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,081
We moved to Nishiokuho after the incident.

161
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,181
I thought living in a quiet place

162
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:57,481
would help heal her psychological wounds.

163
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,481
When did you start working at this guest house?

164
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,381
Right after we moved.

165
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,581
I used to work as a hotel receptionist.

166
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,581
Excuse me.

167
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,481
There you are.

168
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:12,981
I made sandwiches.

169
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,381
Let's eat in the other room.

170
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,081
Thank you.

171
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,881
Ohara, are you originally from this town?

172
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:23,481
No. I moved here about four years ago.

173
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,181
After graduating from culinary school,

174
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,781
I saw a want ad for this place.

175
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,581
Really?

176
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:33,681
Kyujiro's hair was found in Otaro's car.

177
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,281
We can leave now, can't we?

178
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:40,981
Hold on.

179
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,281
Otaro's death was an accident, right?

180
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,681
In that case...

181
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:48,181
No, we can't assume it was yet.

182
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,681
Are you saying it was murder?

183
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:53,281
There's no one here who would...

184
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,481
It was you, wasn't it?

185
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:59,981
What... what are you talking about?

186
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,181
Didn't he kill your father?

187
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:04,781
I just learned that!

188
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:07,481
Maybe Kyujiro told you.

189
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:10,281
Yeah. Maybe you killed Kyujiro, too.

190
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,381
That's insane.

191
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,881
When Kyujiro was killed,

192
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:18,181
I was on the same train as Mouri's family.

193
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:21,181
Mouri, are you certain of that?

194
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,781
Now that you mention it, I didn't see him on the train.

195
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:27,681
He spoke to us after we got off.

196
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:29,981
How can you be so heartless?

197
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,781
See?

198
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,081
The mark drawn in blood

199
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,081
was the same as the one on your shirt, right?

200
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:36,181
What?

201
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,381
Fujiyoshi, calm down.

202
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:42,181
Wasn't your show canceled because of the case?

203
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,781
Are you sure you didn't resent him?

204
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,781
You really shouldn't say that.

205
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:49,781
If you're such a great detective, solve the case!

206
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:55,781
Yeah, but the crime scene was locked.

207
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:04,381
The door was definitely locked and bolted.

208
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:07,981
On top of that, the window was locked, too.

209
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,981
Huh?

210
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,281
Seven empty bottles, six bottle caps.

211
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:18,481
There's one missing.

212
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:19,981
Where is it?

213
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,781
Huh?

214
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:27,181
They're shaped differently.

215
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,481
And what's this key for?

216
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:35,781
What's this key doing here?

217
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,981
It's that blue beer.

218
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,581
I was completely deceived by its appearance.

219
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:45,681
The key to the door to happiness...

220
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,181
So that's what that means!

221
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,581
Hold on.

222
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:50,981
Then that means...

223
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:54,081
Could it be...

224
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,181
I knew it.

225
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,681
That must be it.

226
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:00,881
The size of the thumbturn, the position of the bolt...

227
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,081
I'm starting to see the truth behind this case.

228
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:17,948
Mouri, what is the meaning of this?

229
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,348
Everyone.

230
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,948
I will now reveal the truth behind the case.

231
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:24,948
Really?

232
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:26,848
Way to go, Detective!

233
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:31,048
First, Otaro did not kill Kyujiro.

234
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:34,148
-What? -But his hair was found in his car.

235
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,648
Otaro drove a convertible.

236
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:40,548
Could you transport a body in that?

237
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,648
He even owns a sedan.

238
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:43,948
You're right.

239
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,148
The hair was a camouflage planted by the culprit

240
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:50,348
to frame Otaro.

241
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:53,648
However, driving the convertible he recently purchased

242
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:54,948
was a miscalculation.

243
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:57,748
Then that person killed Otaro as well?

244
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:59,248
I know who did it, of course,

245
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:01,448
and how they created the locked room.

246
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,548
But the window was locked,

247
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:07,548
and the door was locked and deadbolted.

248
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,448
How did they do it?

249
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,748
Very well. Allow me to demonstrate.

250
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,148
Conan!

251
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:15,548
Here!

252
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:18,948
I'll take this bottle opener

253
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:20,848
and place it here.

254
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:22,448
And use this magnet...

255
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,148
The cow magnet.

256
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:25,848
To fix it in place.

257
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,648
If you close the door

258
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:32,848
and use the magnet to move the bottle opener...

259
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:38,648
You can lock the door and deadbolt at the same time.

260
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:42,648
Then if you remove the magnet and shake the door a little...

261
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,448
I see.

262
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:49,248
If there are empty beer bottles on the floor,

263
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:51,848
then it's not unnatural for a bottle opener to be on the floor, too.

264
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:54,248
-I knew you did it. -What?

265
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:56,048
You said you were drinking

266
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,248
while playing with a cow magnet yesterday.

267
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:00,348
I told you, it wasn't me!

268
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:05,248
Otaro left us a message telling us who killed him.

269
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:06,248
What?

270
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,748
I knew it.

271
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:11,248
No, that's not Byun's symbol.

272
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,548
It's backwards.

273
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:14,548
Backwards?

274
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:18,348
Since the Masked Comet was so involved in this case,

275
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:20,448
it looked like his symbol to us.

276
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:22,048
But if you look at the position of his hand,

277
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,248
it's clear that it's reversed.

278
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:28,548
In other words, it's two lines sticking out of a circle?

279
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:31,048
What symbol is that?

280
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,748
In his signature,

281
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:36,648
Otaro expresses the "oh" sound as a circle.

282
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:38,548
In other words, the circle is "oh".

283
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:41,348
The two lines are the Katakana symbol for "ha".

284
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,348
They simply overlapped.

285
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:47,448
Then the name Otaro wrote was...

286
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,348
Ohara, you killed him.

287
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:53,848
This is ridiculous.

288
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:55,948
Why would I do that?

289
00:15:55,948 --> 00:16:00,748
Because you were the other culprit in the seven-year-old case.

290
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:06,248
Kyujiro overheard you discussing your secret

291
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:11,048
using the bug he installed in your room and threatened you.

292
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,148
That's it!

293
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:16,948
He had the Byun card to tell you he knew everything.

294
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:21,848
First, you killed Kyujiro to keep him quiet.

295
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:25,148
You must have prepared some tap water beforehand.

296
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:29,048
You most likely drowned him in the van,

297
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:33,548
and dumped the body in the lake on your way to pick us up.

298
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,548
Then you killed Otaro

299
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:38,448
in order to frame him for the murder.

300
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,648
You're lying! You're making it up!

301
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:44,948
Then why did you lie about Otaro taking beers

302
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:48,348
and a bottle opener to his room?

303
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:51,248
I wasn't lying. I really saw him.

304
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:55,148
It's not unusual to take a bottle opener to drink beer.

305
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,448
Otaro didn't need to

306
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:02,348
because he had his own bottle opener.

307
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:05,148
We didn't find one.

308
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,648
You've been fooled by its appearance,

309
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,848
just like that blue beer.

310
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:13,748
The key to the door to happiness that Otaro described

311
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:16,548
is a bottle opener.

312
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:17,948
That key?

313
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:21,148
I get it. For a beer-lover like Otaro,

314
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,648
opening a beer

315
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:25,648
would be the same as opening the door to happiness.

316
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:30,748
The upturned edges of caps on the floor are slightly pointed.

317
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:34,548
It's a product of the shape of the bottle opener.

318
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,648
In order to make this a locked room,

319
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,948
you needed a bottle opener.

320
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,948
You expected to find one, but didn't.

321
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:44,948
You hurried back to the kitchen to get one.

322
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:48,948
You lied to hide this fact.

323
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,348
Why was the dining room ransacked?

324
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:55,748
In the dining room was the cow magnet you played with

325
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,948
that had many bottle caps stuck to it.

326
00:17:57,948 --> 00:18:00,348
He had to remove them

327
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:02,448
in order to use the cow magnet in his trick.

328
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,048
However, it would be impossible to put them back.

329
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,248
So he scattered the caps on the floor

330
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:13,248
and ransacked the room to camouflage it.

331
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:16,448
What about proof? Do you have proof?

332
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:21,048
You know better than anyone that there's incriminating evidence

333
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,048
underneath your watch.

334
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:30,048
Normally you keep your watch in your pocket,

335
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:33,148
but since last night, you've been wearing it on your wrist.

336
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,548
So, what?

337
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:37,748
That watch is broken, isn't it?

338
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:39,748
When you checked the time earlier,

339
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:43,448
you looked at the wall clock after looking at your watch.

340
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,348
Well, I...

341
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:49,348
Last night, after murdering Otaro,

342
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,248
you intended to return the cow magnet

343
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,248
to the dining room before going home.

344
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:57,548
However, Fujiyoshi discovered the situation in the dining room first,

345
00:18:57,548 --> 00:18:59,448
causing a commotion.

346
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,448
Unable to return to the dining room,

347
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,548
you climbed down the tree

348
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:06,148
next to the second floor guest room and escaped.

349
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:09,648
The cow magnet was in your pocket during this time.

350
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,348
The pocket that also contained your watch.

351
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:15,248
So the magnetic force of the cow magnet broke his watch.

352
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,648
When he returned after receiving a call,

353
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:21,448
he waited for an opportunity to drop it on the dining room floor.

354
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:24,248
Could you take off your watch?

355
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:33,348
This mark was left by a bottle cap.

356
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:37,448
Otaro must have resisted when you tried to kill him.

357
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,548
He pushed you to the ground,

358
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:41,848
pressing one of the bottle caps on the floor against your arm.

359
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,548
That's when you got that mark.

360
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:47,048
If we examine the bottle caps in the room,

361
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:50,548
we'll find skin or blood stuck to one.

362
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,248
Go ahead and examine them!

363
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,748
You won't find anything.

364
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,448
I'm sure we won't.

365
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:59,248
You took the cap with you.

366
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:03,448
However, you didn't have time to dispose of it very far away.

367
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:07,548
Furthermore, even if skin or blood aren't found on it,

368
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:11,248
the various caps are bent differently.

369
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,848
If one matches this mark, it'll prove you did it.

370
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:21,648
Otaro's the one who said we had to get rid of Kyujiro!

371
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,448
Then why did you kill Otaro?

372
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:28,048
He insisted on killing Miona!

373
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:32,548
So I had to kill him to protect her!

374
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:35,448
Is that true?

375
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:38,548
This locked room trick is simple,

376
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:41,848
but you couldn't have thought of it on the spot.

377
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:45,848
Are you sure you hadn't been plotting

378
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:48,448
to kill Otaro?

379
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,048
No!

380
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:55,648
You had always planned to murder Otaro and frame him.

381
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:57,648
No...

382
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:01,748
Otaro wanted to kill her seven years ago,

383
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:03,348
but I stopped him!

384
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,448
I protected her!

385
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:07,448
It was really scary.

386
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,048
Miona.

387
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:14,948
The bloody mask came closer,

388
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,348
and...

389
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:21,648
I protected you.

390
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,848
Right? Isn't that right?

391
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:34,448
Forget everything you saw here.

392
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:35,648
Got it?

393
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:37,748
Otherwise, we'll kill you, too.

394
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,848
No!

395
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:45,948
Miona!

396
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:49,648
The man I saw seven years ago...

397
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:51,248
was this man!

398
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,648
It was an awful case,

399
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:31,048
but at least that girl will be able to truly smile again.

400
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:32,548
Yeah.

401
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,948
Huh? Where'd everyone go?

402
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:52,848
In your case, you're not just feeling groggy from the beer.

403
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:57,148
"Next Episode"

404
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:58,648
-Akagi! -Hide!

405
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:01,648
Have you recovered from your injury?

406
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,248
I hope this makes you feel better.

407
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:06,848
I'll be rooting for you!

408
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:07,848
Thanks.

409
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,448
Eventually, the Japanese will understand

410
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:14,648
what gambling is all about.

411
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:18,348
Why?

412
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:24,348
Next Conan, "The J League Bodyguard"

413
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,991
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,291
"A stadium tour"

415
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,491
There's no Conan next week.

416
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:32,391
We're taking the week off for J League.

417
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,191
I see you're not taking a week off from beer.
