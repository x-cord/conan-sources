1
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.670
And? You mean you really haven't seen him before?

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.770
Seen what?

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.970
Superintendent Kuroda.

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.570
Nope.

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.270
You were clinging onto me really tightly, though.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.670
Seeing his horrifying face up close like that,

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.470
what makes you think I can stay calm?

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.770
Really?

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.270
So she was just really afraid of his face.

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.170
That's right!

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.870
His face was really dreadful.

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.370
No joke. I was super scared!

13
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.870
I almost felt like crying.

14
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.670
I... I see.

15
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.470
Well, I think all is fine.

16
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.170
Because if that man Kuroda is Rum, who you suspect him to be...

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.070
And he saw my face at such close range...

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.670
He would've realized that I'm Sherry,

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.870
the one who betrayed the Organization,

20
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.070
would be at Doc's house by now.

21
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.270
But the mail I got from him was all about today's dinner.

22
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.270
Okay, that's great.

23
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.770
It's better to be safe than sorry.

24
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.270
Hey, what's the matter?

25
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.770
Hey, Ai?

26
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.670
A canvas stained black with crime.

27
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.070
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

28
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070
Why is Ai shocked out of her wits?

29
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.270
The information signals the start of a new case.

30
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.870
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.070
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:22.027 --> 00:03:27.827
"The Suspects are Passionate Lovers (Part 1)"

34
00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:32.727
Don't tell me that...

35
00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:34.427
Did something happen to Doc?

36
00:03:36.827 --> 00:03:39.127
"Yoko Okino And Ryusuke Higo, Their Passionate Love Exposed!"

37
00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:42.827
Oh, come on! It's just a gossip article.

38
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:44.127
You scared me out of my wits.

39
00:03:44.127 --> 00:03:46.527
What? Is this for real?

40
00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.327
-No joke? -They're a big couple!

41
00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:53.327
They would probably give birth to a handsome J-Leaguer!

42
00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:55.627
If it's a girl, she'd be an idol singer.

43
00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:56.627
Yeah!

44
00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:59.727
You think so too, don't you, Ai?

45
00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:01.527
Ai?

46
00:04:01.527 --> 00:04:04.027
You're white as a sheet.

47
00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:06.327
Rather, I don't think she's breathing.

48
00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:09.427
Wait a sec.

49
00:04:09.427 --> 00:04:13.227
If his partner is Yoko Okino, I'm sure he's...

50
00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:14.927
Hey, Dad!

51
00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:17.827
Get a hold of yourself, Dad!

52
00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.727
I thought so.

53
00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:25.527
Now, both their agencies

54
00:04:25.527 --> 00:04:28.527
haven't gotten a hold of either of them yet today,

55
00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:31.427
and say they have no comments to make.

56
00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:34.527
According to Higo's teammates,

57
00:04:34.527 --> 00:04:36.927
they seem to have graduated from the same high school

58
00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:38.427
and kicked it off well from there.

59
00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:46.327
Before you get so depressed,

60
00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.527
why don't you check on it and see if it's true?

61
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:51.927
I mean, you do a lot of work on illicit relationships etc., don't you?

62
00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:53.027
Idiot!

63
00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:55.127
Detectives don't do things like investigating

64
00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:57.127
just to satisfy their curiosity, you know!

65
00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:59.227
That's my policy!

66
00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:02.727
Then, will you investigate if I ask you to?

67
00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:07.727
Ai.

68
00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:08.727
Hey, hey.

69
00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:10.127
I'd like you to investigate

70
00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:13.827
on the backgrounds of Ryusuke Higo and Yoko Okino!

71
00:05:13.827 --> 00:05:15.027
What?

72
00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:16.827
Of course, for free!

73
00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:28.327
Okay! I'll do it!

74
00:05:29.627 --> 00:05:31.127
What is this?

75
00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:35.227
But, how're you going to find the two?

76
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:36.827
Unlike ordinary people,

77
00:05:36.827 --> 00:05:38.727
you don't know their addresses either, right?

78
00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:42.727
Even their agencies can't get a hold of them, you know.

79
00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:44.227
Idiot!

80
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:47.927
At times like this, safe comments are usually made public,

81
00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:49.827
but there are none,

82
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:51.727
so it's highly likely that they're seeing each other again today

83
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:54.627
without knowing that they're being rumored about!

84
00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:59.127
But wouldn't somebody normally e-mail or call them?

85
00:05:59.127 --> 00:06:03.727
Yoko's manager said that Yoko usually doesn't realize

86
00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:05.727
that her phone is switched off.

87
00:06:05.727 --> 00:06:08.727
It seems that Mr. Higo usually has his phone switched off

88
00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:10.727
during his days off.

89
00:06:10.727 --> 00:06:12.827
If so, we'll search using the keywords "Yoko Okino",

90
00:06:12.827 --> 00:06:18.227
"Ryusuke Higo", "date" and "today's date".

91
00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:20.827
See? Here it is!

92
00:06:20.827 --> 00:06:23.327
Someone posted on their blog

93
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:25.127
that the two were seen at a restaurant in Haidocho!

94
00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:29.127
But all they did was buy a man's wristwatch together, right?

95
00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:32.727
Maybe Yoko just asked Mr. Higo to help her pick out

96
00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:34.627
a present for her younger brother,

97
00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:38.027
and as a token of her appreciation, Yoko treated Mr. Higo to a meal.

98
00:06:38.927 --> 00:06:41.227
Yoko doesn't have a kid brother.

99
00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:45.027
Rather, why is she asking Mr. Higo to pick it out for her?

100
00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:46.427
I don't get it!

101
00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:48.027
I guess not.

102
00:06:48.027 --> 00:06:51.327
Then, maybe those two are going with each other after all.

103
00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:56.527
Sorry! Forget what I said. Forget it!

104
00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:59.527
Why don't you go over to that restaurant then?

105
00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:01.927
But the name of the restaurant's not written!

106
00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:04.927
Come to think of it, I heard one of Mr. Higo's soccer club seniors

107
00:07:04.927 --> 00:07:06.827
who retired from the J-League

108
00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:10.027
opened an Italian restaurant in Haidocho.

109
00:07:10.027 --> 00:07:11.827
Where's that shop?

110
00:07:11.827 --> 00:07:15.027
But I don't know if they're really at that shop.

111
00:07:16.427 --> 00:07:19.027
They're here. Both of them.

112
00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:20.727
And more so...

113
00:07:20.727 --> 00:07:22.727
From the way that these two are acting,

114
00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:25.227
it's no wonder Ran didn't want to come along.

115
00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:28.927
Hey, what're you taking notes of?

116
00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:32.127
The number of times that idol smiled at Mr. Higo!

117
00:07:34.127 --> 00:07:38.827
Hey. Didn't you like Yoko Okino's songs and listen to them repeatedly?

118
00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:41.227
I deleted all of them just a while ago.

119
00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:44.127
And?

120
00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:47.427
Is he the senior of that soccer guy?

121
00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:49.127
What?

122
00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:51.127
Nope.

123
00:07:51.127 --> 00:07:53.827
Mr. Higo's senior is Teiya Asuka,

124
00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:55.927
who used to be a wing back for the Tokyo Spirits,

125
00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:59.327
and was even chosen as a representative for Japan, too.

126
00:07:59.327 --> 00:08:03.427
I think he's the sommelier for this restaurant.

127
00:08:03.427 --> 00:08:07.627
I wonder what that guy intends to do after getting Yoko drunk?

128
00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:08.927
What?

129
00:08:11.127 --> 00:08:13.627
Where's Mr. Asuka?

130
00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:15.127
The owner's out buying some wine...

131
00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:19.127
"Akimichi Yamada (43), Sommelier" -and should be back soon.

132
00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:23.027
Should I tell him to come to your table when he gets back?

133
00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:24.927
Yes, please do that.

134
00:08:24.927 --> 00:08:27.727
Please enjoy.

135
00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:29.227
"Reiko Banba (27), waitress" -Excuse me.

136
00:08:29.227 --> 00:08:31.527
Here's your dessert.

137
00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:36.227
I'm so sorry!

138
00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:38.927
What an amateur, that waitress.

139
00:08:38.927 --> 00:08:41.827
Maybe she was distracted looking at Mr. Higo.

140
00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:48.627
I goofed.

141
00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:51.727
That guy Higo is the owner's friend, right?

142
00:08:51.727 --> 00:08:54.727
If he was here, you would've really gotten it from the owner.

143
00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:56.127
No problem.

144
00:08:56.127 --> 00:08:59.927
He never gets angry at me.

145
00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:03.527
Don't let it get to your head, just because you're going with him.

146
00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:04.727
Talk for yourself.

147
00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:08.227
Don't let it get to you just because you're my ex.

148
00:09:09.827 --> 00:09:13.127
"Yasuto Konoe (28), waiter"

149
00:09:13.927 --> 00:09:16.827
The owner sure is late, though.

150
00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.327
It's about time he should be back already.

151
00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:21.627
Shall we go look for him?

152
00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:23.327
I guess so.

153
00:09:23.327 --> 00:09:26.427
Mr. Konoe and I will go check the back room then.

154
00:09:26.427 --> 00:09:27.627
Yes, sir.

155
00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:32.827
Ms. Banba, please check the storeroom.

156
00:09:32.827 --> 00:09:34.227
Okay!

157
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:38.627
He's not here.

158
00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:42.127
He always takes short naps on this sofa, but...

159
00:09:42.127 --> 00:09:45.027
He didn't seem to be getting enough sleep lately.

160
00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:51.427
Come to think of it, weren't you arguing with the owner last night?

161
00:09:51.427 --> 00:09:54.227
He complained that the wine I buy is too expensive.

162
00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:57.527
Well, I guess it can't be helped because he owns this restaurant.

163
00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:59.927
He isn't in the storeroom either.

164
00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:02.527
Shall we wait for him a while longer then?

165
00:10:02.527 --> 00:10:04.227
-Yes. -Okay.

166
00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:08.627
They're asking for Mr. Asuka again.

167
00:10:08.627 --> 00:10:11.427
They want to know if he came back.

168
00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:13.127
What shall we do?

169
00:10:13.127 --> 00:10:15.027
Shall we go look for him again?

170
00:10:15.027 --> 00:10:16.927
Maybe we should check the bathroom just in case, too.

171
00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:20.227
-Yes. -I'll go check the bathroom then!

172
00:10:20.227 --> 00:10:21.927
Thanks.

173
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.727
He's not in the storeroom.

174
00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:32.427
He's not in the bathroom, either.

175
00:10:32.427 --> 00:10:34.027
I found the owner.

176
00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:36.227
It seems he's taking a nap on the sofa.

177
00:10:36.227 --> 00:10:37.227
No joke?

178
00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:40.627
Yes. He has a blanket over his head.

179
00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:43.527
He doesn't know that his friend is here?

180
00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:47.227
Let's let him sleep another 10 minutes then wake him up.

181
00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.927
It's almost 10 minutes.

182
00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:58.427
I'll go to the back room and wake the owner up then.

183
00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:00.027
Okay.

184
00:11:06.727 --> 00:11:09.427
It's e-mail from the owner.

185
00:11:09.427 --> 00:11:12.727
"Could you bring Higo and Yoko over to the storeroom

186
00:11:12.727 --> 00:11:14.327
without anyone noticing?"

187
00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:17.227
So he got up on his own?

188
00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:20.027
I'll take the two over to the back room then.

189
00:11:20.027 --> 00:11:21.127
Thanks.

190
00:11:25.227 --> 00:11:26.727
What's going on?

191
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.927
It seems they're going somewhere.

192
00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:37.427
Why does that girl idol have to stand so close to him?

193
00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:41.027
That soccer guy walks too slow!

194
00:11:41.027 --> 00:11:43.727
I guess I'll go take a puff in the restroom then.

195
00:11:43.727 --> 00:11:47.227
Hey, it's no smoking in the restroom too, normally, isn't it?

196
00:11:48.427 --> 00:11:50.127
But when I went to the restroom a while ago,

197
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:52.527
I smelled cigarettes.

198
00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:54.027
What? Really?

199
00:11:54.027 --> 00:11:55.127
Yeah.

200
00:11:57.527 --> 00:11:59.527
That was Yoko's scream!

201
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:02.427
Where did they go?

202
00:12:02.427 --> 00:12:04.827
To... to the basement storeroom.

203
00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:08.827
Don't tell me that the soccer guy did something terrible to Yoko.

204
00:12:09.727 --> 00:12:11.127
Yoko!

205
00:12:17.727 --> 00:12:19.227
Hey, Mr. Asuka?

206
00:12:19.227 --> 00:12:21.127
Get a hold of yourself! Hey!

207
00:12:21.127 --> 00:12:22.627
Mr. Asuka?

208
00:12:22.627 --> 00:12:24.027
Mr. Asuka!

209
00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:35.994
The victim is the owner of this restaurant,

210
00:12:35.994 --> 00:12:38.394
Mr. Teiya Asuka, age 31.

211
00:12:38.394 --> 00:12:39.994
The ETD is during the hour,

212
00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:43.594
between a little after 19:00 to a little before 20:00.

213
00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:46.694
The cause of death is blood loss due to a severed carotid artery.

214
00:12:46.694 --> 00:12:50.694
The murder weapon is a cutter knife that was found near the corpse.

215
00:12:50.694 --> 00:12:54.194
It seems that one of the cutter knives

216
00:12:54.194 --> 00:12:56.494
that was in the back room is missing,

217
00:12:56.494 --> 00:12:58.094
that most likely is it.

218
00:12:58.094 --> 00:12:59.294
I see.

219
00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:01.994
And? The first discoverers of the corpse,

220
00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:04.694
are you who were here at this restaurant,

221
00:13:04.694 --> 00:13:07.194
Mr. Ryusuke Higo, a J-Leaguer

222
00:13:07.194 --> 00:13:10.294
and idol Ms. Yoko Okino?

223
00:13:10.294 --> 00:13:11.294
-Yes. -Yes.

224
00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:14.894
But, why did you come to the storeroom when you came as customers?

225
00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:18.094
The waiter brought us here.

226
00:13:18.094 --> 00:13:21.394
He said that he received e-mail from Mr. Asuka

227
00:13:21.394 --> 00:13:22.694
telling him to bring us here.

228
00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:24.994
Did you know the victim?

229
00:13:24.994 --> 00:13:29.094
Yes. Mr. Asuka is an OB of the soccer club of our high school,

230
00:13:29.094 --> 00:13:32.194
and I came to see him to ask him a favor.

231
00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:35.894
I graduated from Konan High as well.

232
00:13:35.894 --> 00:13:40.694
So, the victim didn't send the mail directly to you?

233
00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:43.994
No. I don't know him that well.

234
00:13:43.994 --> 00:13:47.094
I lost my cell phone somewhere.

235
00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:50.094
I'm sure I brought it to this restaurant, though.

236
00:13:50.094 --> 00:13:54.694
And I'd like to ask you one more thing.

237
00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:56.894
Are you two going with each other?

238
00:13:56.894 --> 00:13:59.594
What?

239
00:13:59.594 --> 00:14:00.994
Just what kind of question is that?

240
00:14:00.994 --> 00:14:03.594
Don't you know? It's the talk of the town

241
00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:05.294
and causing a commotion on the gossip TV shows now.

242
00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:07.194
See?

243
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:09.394
That the passionate love between Ms. Yoko Okino and Mr. Ryusuke Higo

244
00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:11.394
has been disclosed!

245
00:14:13.294 --> 00:14:15.094
Hey. So, what's the story?

246
00:14:15.094 --> 00:14:16.894
-What's the story? -What?

247
00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:20.894
Why are Mr. Mouri and the others here?

248
00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:23.394
It seems they just happened to be here.

249
00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:28.694
Why don't you try asking the other restaurant staff questions, too?

250
00:14:28.694 --> 00:14:30.394
They seemed to be running around

251
00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:32.794
even before the body was found, you know?

252
00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:36.794
Running around?

253
00:14:36.794 --> 00:14:39.694
Oh, right. The owner wasn't back for some time,

254
00:14:39.694 --> 00:14:42.394
so we decided to split up and go look for him.

255
00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:44.294
He sometimes comes back without saying anything

256
00:14:44.294 --> 00:14:46.494
and takes short naps in the back room, you see.

257
00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:49.494
And there were customers who wanted to see him too, so...

258
00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:51.994
I think the first time was around 7:00 p.m.?

259
00:14:51.994 --> 00:14:54.894
So, I went with him to check the back room.

260
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.894
And I had her go and check the storeroom.

261
00:14:58.894 --> 00:15:01.194
The back room?

262
00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:04.294
It's where the staff takes a break. It's this room.

263
00:15:06.394 --> 00:15:08.294
And where was he taking a nap?

264
00:15:08.294 --> 00:15:09.894
On this sofa.

265
00:15:09.894 --> 00:15:11.794
But when we came here the first time,

266
00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:13.994
the only thing here was the blanket

267
00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:15.694
and there was no one here.

268
00:15:17.794 --> 00:15:20.494
When you searched the storeroom,

269
00:15:20.494 --> 00:15:22.694
you didn't see the owner there?

270
00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:23.694
No.

271
00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:28.094
But the next time, I was told to search the back room

272
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:31.894
so I went back about 10 minutes later.

273
00:15:31.894 --> 00:15:35.194
Then, I found the owner there.

274
00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:36.994
-You found the owner? -Yes.

275
00:15:36.994 --> 00:15:40.894
He was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket over his head.

276
00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:44.694
His shoes were placed near the sofa too, so I'm sure!

277
00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:48.294
But... But, why was the owner...

278
00:15:50.494 --> 00:15:52.494
And, what after that?

279
00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.394
After she told me this,

280
00:15:54.394 --> 00:15:57.294
I went to wake him up about 10 minutes later.

281
00:15:57.294 --> 00:15:59.794
Back then, he wasn't asleep on the sofa.

282
00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:03.394
Just about that time, I got an e-mail from the owner

283
00:16:03.394 --> 00:16:05.894
telling me if I could bring Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom

284
00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:08.294
without being noticed by anyone.

285
00:16:09.394 --> 00:16:11.394
About what time was it?

286
00:16:11.394 --> 00:16:13.994
About 7:30 p.m.

287
00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:18.094
That's why I brought those two to the storeroom, you see.

288
00:16:18.094 --> 00:16:20.294
I called him just before going into the storeroom,

289
00:16:20.294 --> 00:16:21.894
but there was no answer.

290
00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:23.394
Since he didn't come out,

291
00:16:23.394 --> 00:16:25.794
I thought he went back to the back room.

292
00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:29.194
I left the two at the storeroom and went to the back room,

293
00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:31.194
but only Mr. Yamada was there.

294
00:16:31.194 --> 00:16:34.894
When all three of us were wondering where the owner went...

295
00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:37.194
We heard Yoko scream.

296
00:16:37.194 --> 00:16:39.394
And just as we were about to head over to the storeroom,

297
00:16:39.394 --> 00:16:41.794
Detective Mouri came.

298
00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:44.394
Spit it out! I'll bet you persistently asked Yoko

299
00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:45.894
to come to this restaurant with you?

300
00:16:45.894 --> 00:16:46.894
No.

301
00:16:46.894 --> 00:16:49.494
I'll bet you're the one that asked him to come?

302
00:16:49.494 --> 00:16:50.794
What?

303
00:16:50.794 --> 00:16:53.694
Just what are they investigating anyway?

304
00:16:53.694 --> 00:16:56.594
Which means you found the corpse while you were waiting at the storeroom?

305
00:16:56.594 --> 00:16:59.694
Yes. Since they didn't come back for a while,

306
00:16:59.694 --> 00:17:02.094
we were looking around the storeroom and...

307
00:17:02.094 --> 00:17:04.994
I think it was around 7:50 p.m.

308
00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:08.694
7:50 p.m. is just barely within the estimated time of death.

309
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:11.494
Yeah, which makes these two suspects, too.

310
00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:13.394
What?

311
00:17:13.394 --> 00:17:14.894
Anyway, everyone...

312
00:17:14.894 --> 00:17:17.194
I'll have to talk to all of you individually.

313
00:17:18.194 --> 00:17:19.994
Like I said a while ago,

314
00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:22.194
I couldn't have committed the crime.

315
00:17:22.194 --> 00:17:24.194
When I first came to search for the owner,

316
00:17:24.194 --> 00:17:26.394
I was in this back room with Mr. Yamada,

317
00:17:26.394 --> 00:17:28.094
and next I was checking the men's room.

318
00:17:28.094 --> 00:17:31.094
Then, finally, I took those two to the storeroom,

319
00:17:31.094 --> 00:17:33.494
but I just called out from outside the storeroom

320
00:17:33.494 --> 00:17:35.394
and didn't go inside.

321
00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:40.194
That's why, while Ms. Banba was serving food and wine,

322
00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:41.494
you could've pretended to go to the restroom

323
00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:43.094
and snuck off to the storeroom.

324
00:17:43.094 --> 00:17:46.894
No way! The storeroom's always locked.

325
00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:50.094
And the key is always hung on the wall at the entrance of the corridor

326
00:17:50.094 --> 00:17:52.794
so that the staff can always keep an eye on it.

327
00:17:52.794 --> 00:17:55.494
Why is it put where the staff can keep an eye on it?

328
00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:57.794
In the past, there were staff who would come to the storeroom

329
00:17:57.794 --> 00:18:00.894
and this back room to smoke.

330
00:18:00.894 --> 00:18:03.094
The owner did it to prevent this from happening again.

331
00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:05.594
And besides, he hated cigarettes.

332
00:18:05.594 --> 00:18:08.194
Which means this room is always locked, too?

333
00:18:08.194 --> 00:18:10.394
Yes, and the back door, too.

334
00:18:10.394 --> 00:18:13.694
Only the owner had the spare key!

335
00:18:13.694 --> 00:18:16.594
Did the victim have the spare keys on him?

336
00:18:16.594 --> 00:18:19.294
Yes, inside the pocket of his slacks.

337
00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:22.794
But the cell phone of the victim wasn't found,

338
00:18:22.794 --> 00:18:26.294
so the forensics are looking for it now in the storeroom.

339
00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:28.194
I see.

340
00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:30.994
At any rate, I didn't do it.

341
00:18:30.994 --> 00:18:34.094
I've got nothing against the owner besides.

342
00:18:34.094 --> 00:18:37.394
I hear you're the one that's been smoking in this room.

343
00:18:37.394 --> 00:18:40.294
-What? -The waitress told me a while ago.

344
00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:42.794
That the owner was bawling you out.

345
00:18:42.794 --> 00:18:44.194
Was that your motive?

346
00:18:44.194 --> 00:18:46.694
No. That's...

347
00:18:46.694 --> 00:18:49.794
If you're the perp, will you please hurry up and confess?

348
00:18:49.794 --> 00:18:51.194
What?

349
00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:52.194
If you're talking about motive,

350
00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:55.094
I think the other two have more motive than I do.

351
00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:56.794
What?

352
00:18:56.794 --> 00:18:58.594
The sommelier Mr. Yamada

353
00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:01.594
had an argument with the owner over wine last night.

354
00:19:01.594 --> 00:19:05.494
And the waitress Reiko Banba is the owner's girlfriend, you know?

355
00:19:05.494 --> 00:19:06.794
Girlfriend?

356
00:19:08.094 --> 00:19:11.594
Maybe she killed him over a messy break up something?

357
00:19:12.894 --> 00:19:14.394
Yes, that's right.

358
00:19:14.394 --> 00:19:16.994
I was going with the owner,

359
00:19:16.994 --> 00:19:18.994
but there was no talk about a break up!

360
00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:21.594
But the waiter Mr. Konoe mentioned that

361
00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:25.294
the owner hadn't been going home with you lately.

362
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:27.994
That's because he was sleeping over here,

363
00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:31.794
so that he could think of ways to make business more profitable!

364
00:19:31.794 --> 00:19:33.394
He was sleeping over here.

365
00:19:33.394 --> 00:19:37.194
Right. That's why the owner's locker at the very left

366
00:19:37.194 --> 00:19:39.094
is full of a change of clothes, isn't it?

367
00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:44.194
True.

368
00:19:44.194 --> 00:19:46.494
There's even a change of shoes here.

369
00:19:46.494 --> 00:19:48.994
I'll bet Mr. Konoe is saying things like that

370
00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:52.994
because he used to be my ex-boyfriend and is jealous.

371
00:19:52.994 --> 00:19:55.394
Your ex-boyfriend?

372
00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:58.294
But if he had the blanket over his head

373
00:19:58.294 --> 00:20:00.294
when he was sleeping on the sofa,

374
00:20:00.294 --> 00:20:02.094
you didn't see his face, right?

375
00:20:02.094 --> 00:20:03.694
No, I guess not.

376
00:20:03.694 --> 00:20:07.694
Then maybe you could put something under the blanket

377
00:20:07.694 --> 00:20:10.294
to make it look as if he were sleeping there, couldn't you?

378
00:20:10.294 --> 00:20:14.494
What? What good is it for me to do something like that?

379
00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:16.994
When you first went to look for the owner in the storeroom,

380
00:20:16.994 --> 00:20:19.394
you could've actually killed him.

381
00:20:19.394 --> 00:20:21.594
Then after that, to make it look as if he were still alive,

382
00:20:21.594 --> 00:20:23.394
you faked the scene, didn't you?

383
00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:25.794
When I came to search this room,

384
00:20:25.794 --> 00:20:29.494
Mr. Yamada the sommelier was at the storeroom, you know?

385
00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:31.994
If Mr. Yamada found the owner's body,

386
00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:34.694
everything would be in vain, right?

387
00:20:34.694 --> 00:20:38.794
This room is really tidy.

388
00:20:38.794 --> 00:20:40.394
Of course.

389
00:20:40.394 --> 00:20:43.194
Because the owner would stay back after work

390
00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:44.994
and clean the room all by himself.

391
00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:47.494
The owner was a tidy person, wasn't he?

392
00:20:47.494 --> 00:20:50.694
Yes. Because even after I cleaned the place thoroughly,

393
00:20:50.694 --> 00:20:52.794
I could hear the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

394
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:56.494
I think he was vacuuming really small dust that couldn't be noticed.

395
00:20:57.994 --> 00:21:01.394
What? You mean when I went to look for him in the storeroom?

396
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:04.094
The owner wasn't there,

397
00:21:04.094 --> 00:21:05.994
but I did the same thing as Mr. Konoe

398
00:21:05.994 --> 00:21:08.894
and just called him from the entrance.

399
00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:11.194
Which means he may have already been killed

400
00:21:11.194 --> 00:21:14.294
inside the storeroom at that time?

401
00:21:14.294 --> 00:21:16.194
Yes, I guess so.

402
00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:20.494
By the way, it seems that you had an argument with the owner last night.

403
00:21:20.494 --> 00:21:24.294
Yes. The restaurant hasn't been doing well lately,

404
00:21:24.294 --> 00:21:25.894
so the owner said he wanted to stock inexpensive wine

405
00:21:25.894 --> 00:21:27.794
in place of the expensive ones.

406
00:21:27.794 --> 00:21:30.994
I only expressed my concern over that because this restaurant

407
00:21:30.994 --> 00:21:33.894
was supposed to be an authentic, very Italian restaurant.

408
00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:36.594
-That's why you killed him? -What?

409
00:21:36.594 --> 00:21:39.594
You mean you did it to so you could buy expensive wine of your taste.

410
00:21:39.594 --> 00:21:40.994
With the owner dead,

411
00:21:40.994 --> 00:21:43.594
I wouldn't be able to buy them if I wanted to!

412
00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:45.694
Inspector!

413
00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:50.594
A lot of cigarette butts were found in the trash box of the restroom.

414
00:21:50.594 --> 00:21:52.894
I thought the restroom was no smoking, too?

415
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:56.094
Yes, I think it's Mr. Konoe.

416
00:21:56.094 --> 00:21:58.494
He used to smoke in this room before,

417
00:21:58.494 --> 00:22:00.494
but after being scolded by the owner,

418
00:22:00.494 --> 00:22:03.494
I think he hid in the restroom and smoked.

419
00:22:03.494 --> 00:22:07.494
If in the restroom, he could say that a customer smoked.

420
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.194
That's why the restroom smelled of cigarettes.

421
00:22:10.194 --> 00:22:11.494
Come to think of it,

422
00:22:11.494 --> 00:22:15.494
he said from himself that he'd search the restroom,

423
00:22:15.494 --> 00:22:18.894
so maybe he didn't want anyone noticing the smell of cigarettes.

424
00:22:22.594 --> 00:22:24.494
Although there are 5 suspects,

425
00:22:24.494 --> 00:22:26.494
the suspicious ones are those three.

426
00:22:28.794 --> 00:22:33.394
How on earth did the perp commit the crime?

427
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.594
"Next Episode" -There's a tiny hole.

428
00:23:56.594 --> 00:23:59.594
Hey, is that blood?

429
00:23:59.594 --> 00:24:03.494
Only Mr. Higo or Yoko who were waiting in the storeroom

430
00:24:03.494 --> 00:24:06.294
could've committed the crime.

431
00:24:06.294 --> 00:24:10.594
-What? -Wait... wait a minute, Inspector!

432
00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:12.994
They wanted a third party

433
00:24:12.994 --> 00:24:16.294
to confirm that the owner wasn't in the room

434
00:24:16.294 --> 00:24:18.194
So, give yourself up!

435
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:20.494
Next Conan,

436
00:24:20.494 --> 00:24:24.294
"The Suspects are Passionate Lovers (Part 2)"

437
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:27.237
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:27.237 --> 00:24:29.537
"Vacuum bag"

439
00:24:29.537 --> 00:24:31.337
-Yoko! -Something is definitely strange, after all!

440
00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:32.937
I'll never let this couple be...

441
00:24:32.937 --> 00:24:34.337
Perfect sync.
