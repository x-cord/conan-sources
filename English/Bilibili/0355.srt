1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,240
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,340
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,140
The three kimono beauties are the suspects.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,940
Solve the mystery of the mole on the chest.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:52,968
"The Little Client (Part 2)"

9
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:58,168
No murder weapon?

10
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,168
Well...

11
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:01,668
"Tomoka Saegusa (28)" -I can't believe it.

12
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,768
You haven't even found the murder weapon.

13
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,868
We're going back to work then.

14
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:07,168
Wait!

15
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,868
I'd like to question you all later,

16
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,468
so please wait in another room till then.

17
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:14,368
If you insist that we wait, I guess we will.

18
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,568
"Toshika Bessho (29)" -But I won't answer

19
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,268
no matter what you ask me.

20
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:20,868
"Mitsu Kusano (34)" -There's nothing suspicious about us.

21
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,268
We were just taking an outdoor bath,

22
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,868
so we're not going to let you treat us like criminals.

23
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:25,968
An outdoor bath?

24
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:29,368
Yes, it seems that they all took a bath at about 11:55 pm,

25
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:30,868
which is around the time of the crime.

26
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:33,068
Then, about 20 minutes later,

27
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,968
Mr. Mouri went in as well.

28
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,268
What? He went in?

29
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:40,068
Don't tell me you peeked into the women's bath?

30
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,668
It's for both men and women.

31
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,968
I see. Just because it's for both women and men,

32
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:45,168
it doesn't mean that you can go ahead and look in, you know!

33
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:46,868
I'm telling you! So listen!

34
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,068
I just thought that if somebody was already inside,

35
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,168
-I'd be lucky... -Huh?

36
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,768
Isn't this movie the one that Kazuki acted in?

37
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:56,568
Why is something like that found over here?

38
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:59,068
It's the video that Mr. Kamoshita rented.

39
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:02,468
They rent out movie videos here at the inn.

40
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,468
Give it to me.

41
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:07,168
Let's take a look at it.

42
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,468
Mr. Mouri, we don't have time to watch that.

43
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:15,568
Some clues could be hidden in it, right?

44
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,468
It looks like a scary movie.

45
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:27,068
It's only kid's stuff.

46
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,168
Don't worry.

47
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:34,168
Your mother's not the killer.

48
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:37,468
I'm not worried about that lady at all.

49
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:44,968
Kazuki?

50
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,668
The sound reminds me of my mother.

51
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:47,968
Huh?

52
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:48,968
Wait!

53
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:57,968
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:01,368
A guest suddenly said he wants dinner.

55
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,668
Was it noisy?

56
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:04,868
No.

57
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:08,468
So you want to see your mother after all, don't you, Kazuki?

58
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:09,868
Not really.

59
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,968
I just thought that it'd be a hint to finding her.

60
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,368
Hey, stupid! Look behind you, behind!

61
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:18,968
Behind you, I said!

62
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,768
Wait. Something's coming from the ceiling!

63
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,168
Talk about getting carried away.

64
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:32,868
"The end"

65
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:41,268
It was quite amusing, wasn't it?

66
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:43,268
Yes.

67
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:45,768
But we really got nothing out of it, didn't we?

68
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,168
I guess not.

69
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:49,468
I see. I get it now.

70
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,068
That's why the killer soaked his body

71
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:57,368
into the bath tub after strangling the victim.

72
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:59,468
There are only two mysteries left to solve.

73
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,668
The reason why the killer took a bath

74
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,468
and that mole.

75
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:07,268
The killer could've gotten naked to set the victim off guard,

76
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:08,968
but what about the mole?

77
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,068
Officer Yokomizo, may I have a moment with you?

78
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,268
Yes, what is it?

79
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,068
We were concerned about the trace on the neck

80
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,668
that we didn't notice at first.

81
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,168
But there were marks of the victim

82
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:23,068
being hit several times on the back of his head.

83
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:25,668
Then, was he struck to death?

84
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:28,168
No. He seemed to have bled,

85
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,768
but it wasn't what killed him.

86
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,268
It's most likely that the killer hit him, and after he passed out,

87
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,468
she strangled him to death.

88
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,568
If so, this shower nozzle is very likely

89
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,968
the weapon that was used to hit him.

90
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:41,968
Please do a luminol reaction test right away.

91
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,068
I see. So that's the story.

92
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:46,668
That means the most suspicious person

93
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,868
would be the one who tried to hide it.

94
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:51,668
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep using the tranquilizer gun.

95
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,468
-Hey, Conan. -Huh?

96
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:54,768
What do you mean, "Huh"?

97
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:56,168
It's past three o'clock already,

98
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:57,968
so you'd better get to bed!

99
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,068
But...

100
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,668
We've got to go look for Kazuki's mother

101
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,568
who's a good cook tomorrow, you know.

102
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,968
Good cook?

103
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:05,968
Remember?

104
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,368
He mentioned that he used to go to sleep a lot

105
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,168
while looking at his mother's mole.

106
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,668
It seems that he used to hear

107
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:14,768
the rhythmical sound of the knife cutting things.

108
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:17,268
It means that she's a good cook, right?

109
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,068
I... I guess so.

110
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:21,668
I'll be right over, so please lay the mattress out for me, okay?

111
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,068
Promise, okay?

112
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:26,468
And if Kazuki gets up, please tell him something.

113
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:31,368
His mother is not the killer.

114
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:34,268
Inspector Yokomizo, luminol reaction was detected

115
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,168
from the shower nozzle.

116
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:38,568
The killer must've hit Mr. Kamoshita on the head

117
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,068
with this shower nozzle,

118
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,768
knocked him out and then strangled him to death.

119
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:47,668
And did you find that thin, long, black string

120
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:48,968
that was used to choke him?

121
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:51,368
Well, we looked all over

122
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:53,868
where the three suspects could've hidden the string,

123
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:54,868
but no luck so far.

124
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:59,168
This means that somebody out of those three

125
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,868
must still have it on her.

126
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,868
Okay, tell the policewoman

127
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:07,068
-to do a body check on them. -I think...

128
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,768
that would be useless.

129
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:10,868
-But... -You saw it, didn't you?

130
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:13,468
The picture that was taken on the cell phone

131
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,568
the moment Mr. Kamoshita was being strangled to death!

132
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,068
There was a mole on the left side

133
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:20,468
of the chest of the woman, wasn't there?

134
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:23,568
But Ms. Kusano's mole on her chest was on the right side.

135
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,768
Ms. Bessho's was on her left cheek.

136
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:28,168
And, Ms. Saegusa's was on the back of her neck.

137
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:30,468
They are obviously not the killers.

138
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:31,868
If you try to do a body check on them,

139
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,568
you're just going to get them angrier, don't you think?

140
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:37,868
But the only ones who don't have an alibi

141
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,968
among the employees of this inn are those three.

142
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:43,668
Well, let's call it a day for now.

143
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:46,368
And I'd advise you to do a re-check on everyone in this inn,

144
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,668
including the guests.

145
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,268
-Okay. -It did poke him for sure.

146
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:52,768
What is going on?

147
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:56,768
It seems that there's an off-season mosquito here too.

148
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,268
A mosquito?

149
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:01,068
See. I got a bite on my neck just a while ago...

150
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:03,868
What?

151
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,368
Jalapeno, harami...

152
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:13,268
Here he comes! The Sleeping Kogoro!

153
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:16,768
It turns out the needle just didn't poke him deep enough.

154
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,568
All right then, Officer Yokomizo.

155
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:20,868
Please gather the things that I ask for

156
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:24,368
and bring the three suspects here.

157
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,668
Mr. Mouri.

158
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:27,568
You've figured it out after all!

159
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:30,168
Yes. Let me explain the truth

160
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,168
of what went on in this room

161
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:35,168
regarding the strangulation of Mr. Kamoshita.

162
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:37,568
What you're saying doesn't fit in

163
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:39,968
with what you've been saying just a while ago.

164
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,568
All right, Mr. Mouri!

165
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:49,168
Everything's set.

166
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:52,268
Sleeping Kogoro's deduction show is about to begin!

167
00:08:58,356 --> 00:08:59,956
Hey, wait a second.

168
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,056
Why do we have to be called in again?

169
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,856
You saw for yourself already, didn't you?

170
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,956
We don't have the same mole that the killer had!

171
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:11,256
Besides, has the murder weapon been found?

172
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,356
You can't prove the murder without it, can you?

173
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,356
Of course we found it.

174
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,956
Right, Mr. Mouri?

175
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,156
No, we haven't found it.

176
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:22,156
What?

177
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:26,256
It has most likely been destroyed.

178
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,556
Destroyed? Mr. Mouri...

179
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,956
But we know what the killer used

180
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:34,056
to strangle Mr. Kamoshita

181
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:36,556
because we have this screwdriver.

182
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:40,656
Oh, it seems as if your hands have become a bit smaller.

183
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:44,156
Never mind the details.

184
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,256
Inspector! I've rented it.

185
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,656
Shall we compare the two, then?

186
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:57,056
The video of the same movie that Mr. Kamoshita rented from this inn

187
00:09:57,056 --> 00:10:00,856
and the video that we rented from the rental video shop.

188
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:05,056
First, we'll look at Mr. Kamoshita's video

189
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:06,856
that was here in this room.

190
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:15,856
Just as we've seen before,

191
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,256
it has a scary opening scene.

192
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:21,556
Next, let's look at the video from the rental video shop.

193
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,256
What? Is that all?

194
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,456
Yes.

195
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:42,656
The spot display of the video company...

196
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:45,156
and the spot display of the movie company.

197
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,156
What? Hey.

198
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:49,956
Besides that, this is...

199
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:53,056
-the prologue of the movie. -So, let me explain the story

200
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:54,356
of the cursed stairs...

201
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,556
Strange. The opening title

202
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,056
appeared immediately in the other video we just saw.

203
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:00,656
It's been cut off

204
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:03,456
and shortened by about one minute.

205
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:10,856
And the killer used it to murder her victim.

206
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,956
I see! It's the video tape!

207
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,056
The killer victim opened the video tape using a screwdriver

208
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,756
and removed the tape from inside,

209
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:19,456
then cut off enough tape to use as the murder weapon.

210
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:23,056
She then reconnected the tape together with scotch tape.

211
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:24,156
If she adjusted the tape

212
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:27,356
so that the opening title appears when the tape is played,

213
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,956
she wouldn't be suspected

214
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,856
even if the police were to check the tape later.

215
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,556
But the black string that was taken on the cell phone

216
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,756
looked much thinner.

217
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,756
That's easy.

218
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:41,756
Hey, disassemble the brand new tape

219
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:44,356
that Mr. Mouri told you to go buy.

220
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:45,356
Yes, sir.

221
00:11:57,956 --> 00:11:59,556
Now, please look!

222
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,856
If you don't do anything, it's nothing but a plain black strip.

223
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:04,656
But if you twist it like this...

224
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:07,256
Why...

225
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,756
It doesn't look like a thinner string.

226
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:12,056
It sure doesn't.

227
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:15,456
Instead of twisting it, you stretch it out.

228
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:18,156
Stretch it out?

229
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,556
How can you stretch it out even more...

230
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:25,856
Yes. When you pull the tape really hard,

231
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:28,456
it becomes thinner.

232
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,156
While I'm at it, the length of a tape being played at normal mode

233
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,056
is about 30 centimeters per 10 seconds.

234
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,156
That is 180 centimeters per minute.

235
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:39,456
So if you stretch it out, it can easily go over 2 meters.

236
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,656
It's long enough for the killer

237
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:44,856
to wind around both hands, then strangle the victim to death.

238
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:49,356
So that's why the tape was a minute short.

239
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:52,956
He looked at the recording time

240
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,756
that is posted on the box of the video!

241
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,556
Where did you come from, Conan?

242
00:12:57,556 --> 00:13:00,256
See, it says the duration is 94 minutes.

243
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,756
but the counter of the video tape that we just saw

244
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:05,656
was 1 hour and 33 minutes.

245
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,656
Right, Pops?

246
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:11,556
But where's the video tape that was used to kill the victim?

247
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:14,256
She probably burned it with a lighter or something

248
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:17,756
and shoved the ashes down the drain of the bath tub.

249
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,056
After all, video tapes are made from very easily burnable substance.

250
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:25,156
Well, there's no doubt that the murder weapon is the tape.

251
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,056
If you check the video tape,

252
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,656
the part of the tape that was connected will probably be found.

253
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,056
Therefore, the killer tried to deceive the police

254
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:35,556
by soaking the body in a tub of water.

255
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,156
Didn't the killer do that to complicate

256
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:39,956
the estimation of the time of death?

257
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:41,856
Then please take a look

258
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:45,156
at your left hand that is holding the video tape.

259
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:48,056
What is this black trace?

260
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:50,256
This is the black magnetic substance

261
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:53,656
that is on the surface of the video tape in order to record images.

262
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:57,556
The killer tried to wash the black traces

263
00:13:57,556 --> 00:14:01,456
off Mr. Kamoshita's neck, but his yukata got wet,

264
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:05,556
so she dunked his body into the water.

265
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:12,956
But the killer couldn't wash off what she had to the most.

266
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,756
The thing that would serve as conclusive evidence,

267
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,456
her red mole.

268
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,856
Red, you said?

269
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,256
Are you saying that the mole in the picture was...

270
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:23,056
Well, that wasn't a mole,

271
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:25,456
but something that flew on her when she hit

272
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,856
and knocked Mr. Kamoshita out with the shower nozzle.

273
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:30,256
It was his blood!

274
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:32,856
I see.

275
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:37,656
It looked like a black mole because the scene was static.

276
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:39,656
So, the killer took off all her clothes

277
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,156
to avoid getting blood on her yukata.

278
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:45,456
Yes. That's why the killer said

279
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,956
that she wanted to take a shower when she came to this room.

280
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,256
She probably said something like the shower broke

281
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:54,556
and lured Mr. Kamoshita into the shower room.

282
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:55,856
When he came in,

283
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:58,256
she hit him with the shower nozzle and knocked him out.

284
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:02,156
Without bothering to put on her clothes, she cut the video tape.

285
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:05,856
She then used it to strangle Mr. Kamoshita.

286
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:09,456
She was not aware at that time that her picture was being taken.

287
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:13,656
The killer wiped off the blood that splattered on her,

288
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,656
left the room, and put away the scissors

289
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,656
and screwdriver where they originally were.

290
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:19,356
She headed for the outdoor bath

291
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:22,056
to completely wash off the magnetic substance on her hand

292
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:24,356
and the blood that splattered on herself.

293
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,156
Am I wrong?

294
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,656
The one who tried to hide the red mole,

295
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,156
Ms. Toshiko Bessho?

296
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,756
She... she tried to hide it?

297
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:36,456
Don't be ridiculous! She was the first one

298
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:38,156
who showed you her body of her own initiative!

299
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:41,256
Yes. That was what bothered me.

300
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,756
Being as introverted as she is,

301
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,256
what she did was way out of line of her actual character.

302
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,056
That's when I realized

303
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:50,056
that it's a blind spot under the collar bone.

304
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,456
That the killer didn't know

305
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,456
that there was blood by her chest

306
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:57,356
until she saw that picture.

307
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,256
But there was no blood on her chest!

308
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:05,156
Of course it came off when she took a bath,

309
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:08,356
but the traces of it may be found if a body check is carried out.

310
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,356
That's why Ms. Bessho, afraid of this,

311
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:12,156
grabbed that part with her hand

312
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,656
so that it would be out of view,

313
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:18,156
and made the police confirm that she had no mole.

314
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:21,156
All of that was to avoid a body check.

315
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:26,856
She didn't want the police to find Mr. Kamoshita's blood

316
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,956
that had splattered on the underwear of her kimono!

317
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,656
No way.

318
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:34,256
So, you did it?

319
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,456
You blackmailed Kazuki's agency

320
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:39,656
despite being his mother?

321
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,056
What?

322
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:42,456
Why did you do that?

323
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:45,756
It was a joke.

324
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,056
A joke?

325
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,156
I probably did it out of envy.

326
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:52,056
I wanted a child really badly.

327
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,456
So, you're saying...

328
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:56,056
Yes, I'm not his mother.

329
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,956
The thing about his father being a killer is also a lie.

330
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,256
I thought that if I said so,

331
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:03,456
his agency would stop giving the postcards

332
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,356
that his mother had been sending to him.

333
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,756
But a while later,

334
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:09,156
money was really deposited into my account.

335
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:10,856
I was at a loss what to do,

336
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:14,056
and that was when that guy sniffed things out and came around.

337
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:17,656
I called this room and told him everything honestly.

338
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:19,556
That everything I said was a lie.

339
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:22,356
But that man had the nerve to laugh and...

340
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:26,456
Dear mother, I know how you feel about wanting to protect your child.

341
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:29,056
But you see, I'm doing business here.

342
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,856
Well, if it's really all baloney,

343
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:34,856
it's my turn to blackmail you this time.

344
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,256
I'll suck up to you for the rest of your life.

345
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,856
That's why I got scared.

346
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,256
I was scared, so I...

347
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:45,856
How did you find out the details

348
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,056
about Kazuki and his mother?

349
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:50,756
I'll tell you about it at the station.

350
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:55,656
But officer, I don't regret what I did.

351
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:59,856
Because I think I made her understand how it feels

352
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,956
for a woman to want a child really badly.

353
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,356
What?

354
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,656
So, Ms. Bessho was the killer?

355
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,956
Yes. Pops said he was going to Shizuoka Prefectural Police

356
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:19,756
for questioning together with the other officers.

357
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,256
He also said that he's leaving his wallet behind,

358
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:24,456
so you can take the kids home.

359
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,256
Where's Kazuki?

360
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:30,056
Oh, he got dressed and headed off to the front door

361
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,456
saying that he was leaving.

362
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:35,156
Wasn't he going to look for his mother?

363
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,856
He was.

364
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,956
But he's been acting strange

365
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:39,556
ever since last night before he went to bed.

366
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:42,356
He wouldn't answer no matter what I asked him.

367
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,756
I wonder if I should've carried him instead of piggy-backed him?

368
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,256
Come to think of it, Conan,

369
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:52,956
you were saying that Kazuki's mother wasn't the killer.

370
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:56,856
Does that mean you know who Kazuki's mother is?

371
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:01,556
"To Ms. Mitsu"

372
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:03,356
-Here you go. -Thank you so much.

373
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,056
I'll treasure it.

374
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,156
Me too.

375
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:07,356
So will I.

376
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,556
Can I have get an autograph for my grandson?

377
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:13,556
She did not carry him in front, but piggy-backed him?

378
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:18,056
Yes! When Kazuki fell asleep while looking at the mole,

379
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,056
he heard his mother chopping food with the knife, right?

380
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,156
She couldn't have done so if she carried him in front of her.

381
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,356
Oh, I see.

382
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:28,156
Kazuki was probably hugged when he was raised at church,

383
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:30,956
so he probably mistakenly thought the mole was on his mother's chest.

384
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,356
So, you're saying that his mother

385
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:34,156
is the one with a mole on the back of her neck,

386
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,456
Ms. Saegusa?

387
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:43,156
But she seemed so stuck up and cold towards him, didn't she?

388
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,456
She was acting that way deliberately

389
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:47,156
so he wouldn't recognize her as his mother.

390
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:51,256
She figured it would cause Kazuki problems if he found out.

391
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,856
I'm sure that Ms. Saegusa

392
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:55,856
had told the killer, Ms. Bessho about him.

393
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:58,756
About having no other choice but to leave him at church,

394
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:01,456
and how much she loved him.

395
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:03,256
Ms. Bessho probably figured out from the story

396
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:06,456
and the postcards that she sent out every month,

397
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,956
that Ms. Saegusa was his mother.

398
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:11,556
The postcards stopped coming since winter of last year

399
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:13,456
probably because Ms. Bessho blackmailed Kazuki's agency

400
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:14,656
just around that time,

401
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:17,856
so they stopped giving the postcards to Kazuki.

402
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:20,256
Pops was the one who said that!

403
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:22,856
But how does he know

404
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,656
that she left him at church because she had no choice?

405
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,456
Because if the son whom she wrote to every month

406
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:28,456
appears before her,

407
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:30,756
the first thing you'd expect her to do is to hug him!

408
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:33,556
After all, he's famous and rich.

409
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,556
Despite that, she held back her feelings and acted indifferently.

410
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:40,356
That goes to show how much she must really care for him, right?

411
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:41,656
I guess you're right.

412
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,656
Ran?

413
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:48,156
I'm going to tell Kazuki about this.

414
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:49,756
I feel sorry for him having to hold a grudge

415
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:51,156
against his mother all his life.

416
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:56,056
On the contrary, I think he's dying to see her.

417
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,256
The fact that the postcards from his mother

418
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,356
are all wrinkled up and stained

419
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:02,256
only proves that he read them in tears over and over.

420
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:03,856
Besides, I'm sure Kazuki already knows

421
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:06,156
who his mother is.

422
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,756
Go on. Why don't you get his autograph too?

423
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:10,356
No, I don't think so.

424
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,156
How come you're so hesitant?

425
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:16,256
You watched his videos and movies over and over too.

426
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:18,756
Come on.

427
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:22,756
I'm not giving you my autograph.

428
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,956
But I'll give you...

429
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,656
this instead.

430
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:35,656
I'll come again if you don't send these out.

431
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,756
Wait, Kazuki.

432
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:49,256
"Postcards"

433
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,456
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,056
I'm so sorry, honey.

435
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,356
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,356
Three days later,

437
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:30,056
he received payment for the job he was asked to do.

438
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:31,556
What...

439
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:34,656
What exactly is this?

440
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:38,456
It looks like a piggy bank no matter what angle you look at it from.

441
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,356
No... no way.

442
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:43,056
Is this all he's paying us?

443
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:46,256
-Maybe kid actors don't make much? -135 yen, 185 yen...

444
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,056
Let's see...

445
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:51,656
I mean, this doesn't even cover the travel expenses!

446
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:55,856
"Next Episode"

447
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:04,056
He's walking?

448
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:08,056
Wow, he's walking.

449
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:11,356
It can't be!

450
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:13,256
Then how the hell is he up there?

451
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,756
Next Conan special,

452
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,456
"Thief Kid's Wondrous Sky Walk"

453
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:26,083
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,883
"Wind"

455
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,883
The next episode is already time for the new semester!

456
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:30,583
Movies and TV programs start together with Conan.

457
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,183
The target is the Kid!
