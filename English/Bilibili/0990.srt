Do you have business with

Do you have business with
the Mori Detective Agency?

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.170
It seemed like you were saying something
while looking at that window.

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.600
I guess you could say Detective
Mori looks after me.

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.880
I'm sort of like his apprentice.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.420
He's really a great detective

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.790
who can solve any case, right?

10

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.190
Yes, even the most difficult cases are a
piece of cake once I'm working on them.

I want you to find the culprit
responsible for this case.

Office worker slain in home and robbed
I want you to find the culprit
responsible for this case.

15
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.120
A robbery and murder that happened last week?

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.040
If I recall correctly—

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.610
It happened last Wednesday.

18
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.330
Office worker Oide Raita-san, 58 years
old, was at his home in Tebai City.

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.370
He died when someone struck him on the head,

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.590
and about 300 thousand
yen in cash was stolen.

21
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.610
And ten days later, they still
haven't found the culprit.

22
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.950
Go play somewhere, kid.

23
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.650
What's wrong with me staying?

24
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.480
After all, I showed our client in.

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.780
Right, Oide-san?

26
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.360
Y-Yeah.

27
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.480
Oide? Which means...

28
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.760
Yes.

29
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.050
I'm Oide Fusaya, the son of
the murder victim Oide Raita.

30
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.160
My dad...

31
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.310
I made him die.

32
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.600
You made him die?

33
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.330
What does that mean?

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.840

Who was it that turned the gears of tragedy?

Always determining the one truth

39
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.820
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

40
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.160
his name is Detective Conan!

The Automatic Tragedy
(Part One)

44
00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:12.477
My father was a very serious person,

45
00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:15.967
but there was a time when I went astray.

46
00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:19.427
Because of that, I had a
hard time finding a job.

47
00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:23.987
And the other day, my
older sister got engaged.

48
00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.997
Her partner is the son of a
locally famous wealthy family.

49
00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:34.417
My old friends caught wind of it
and tried to extort her partner.

50
00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:39.127
I didn't want to trouble my sister,

51
00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:42.387
so I planned to run away from home.

52
00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:47.977
The morning of the incident, my mom and
sister were planning to go out together,

53
00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:49.977
so I decided I'd leave then.

54
00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:52.977
Fusaya!

55
00:04:53.717 --> 00:04:54.727

He's probably sleeping again.

61
00:05:00.607 --> 00:05:01.607
Seems like it.

62
00:05:03.347 --> 00:05:07.867
My dad works in an office, so
when they go out, I'm home alone.

63
00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:10.497
I thought it was the perfect opportunity.

64
00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:13.507
But then...

65
00:05:15.997 --> 00:05:19.147
Dad, why are you home so early?

66
00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:20.507
Ah, Fusaya.

68
00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:24.067

70
00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:29.677
I thought the two of us could
talk about your future.

71
00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:31.977
You did that for me?

72
00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:36.477
I was so grateful, I could've cried,
but I'd already made my decision.

73
00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:41.027
Were you on your way out, too?

74
00:05:42.097 --> 00:05:44.677
I'm leaving this house.

75
00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.487
What?

76
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.867
I'm moving out of this house!

77
00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:52.287
Looking at your face is suffocating!

78
00:05:52.287 --> 00:05:54.547
Wh-What?

79
00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:57.027
You're unbelievable.

80
00:05:57.027 --> 00:05:58.837
Say that again.

81
00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:02.337
Do you have any idea how
important this time is?

82
00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:05.347
Why don't you show a little more
consideration for your family?

83
00:06:05.827 --> 00:06:08.267
Are you trying to ruin An's wedding?

84
00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.937
When are you going to grow up?!

85
00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.347
Mind your own business!

86
00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:18.327
We got into a bit of an argument, but
I brushed him off and fled the house.

87
00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:19.647
Hey, Fusaya!
We got into a bit of an argument, but
I brushed him off and fled the house.

88
00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:19.857
We got into a bit of an argument, but
I brushed him off and fled the house.

89
00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:21.747
Fusaya, where are you going?

90
00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:22.847
Fusaya!

91
00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:26.777
I heard what happened next
from my sister and mom.

92
00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:27.157
They returned home that afternoon.

93
00:06:27.157 --> 00:06:28.547
What happened to Fusaya?
They returned home that afternoon.

94
00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:29.867
We need to find him and bring him back.
They returned home that afternoon.

95
00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:30.127
We need to find him and bring him back.

96
00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:31.247
We'll split up and look for him.

97
00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:34.257
Later, around 3:30...

98
00:06:35.287 --> 00:06:36.287
It's me.

99
00:06:36.737 --> 00:06:39.217
I'm back at the house.

100
00:06:39.217 --> 00:06:41.777
Well? Has anyone seen him?

101
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.727
Apparently he called my
sister from the house.

102
00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:48.047
That was the last time we heard him speak.

103
00:06:48.787 --> 00:06:50.307
Then, at 4:30...

104
00:07:06.377 --> 00:07:07.867
My sister and mom discovered the body

105
00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:11.227
when they returned home after
giving up the search for me.

106
00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:19.087
Normally my dad wouldn't be
at home during the evening.

107
00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:21.957
He took the day off for me.

108
00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:26.027
If I hadn't run away, the thief
wouldn't have entered the house.

109
00:07:27.117 --> 00:07:29.887
I made my dad die.

110
00:07:30.437 --> 00:07:33.337
On top of that, I've caused
trouble for my sister.

111
00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:38.137
Her partner's family says they can't get
married while the culprit is still unknown.

112
00:07:38.137 --> 00:07:41.337
All the scheduling and arrangements
for her wedding have been postponed.

113
00:07:42.317 --> 00:07:43.887
I'm a curse.

114
00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:47.357
I turned the gears of misfortune.

115
00:07:47.647 --> 00:07:49.717
You shouldn't say that.

116
00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:51.337
He's right.

117
00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:52.737
Over there.

118
00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:56.497
That's my sister and mom
handing out fliers over there.

119
00:07:57.177 --> 00:08:01.037
They're looking for someone who might've
seen anyone suspicious that evening.

120
00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:04.627
So they're asking for information.

121
00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:08.047
Mom, Sis!

122
00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:11.547
Fusaya.

123
00:08:11.797 --> 00:08:13.097
Are you okay?

124
00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:14.427
Don't push yourself.

125
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:17.407
Looks like they're taking it pretty hard.

126
00:08:17.407 --> 00:08:20.037
She probably hasn't been sleeping well.

127
00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.317
Huh?

128
00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:33.727
What's her deal?

129
00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:36.447
She was grinning while looking this way.

130
00:08:36.447 --> 00:08:39.367
Maybe she knows someone in the Oide family.

131
00:08:40.047 --> 00:08:42.877
I'll go with her.

132
00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.737
Mori-san, I'm worried. I'm going, too.

133
00:08:45.737 --> 00:08:48.137
Then we'll meet at your home later.

134
00:08:48.137 --> 00:08:49.627
Thank you.

135
00:08:53.487 --> 00:08:56.387
I can't believe his mother collapsed, too.

136
00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:59.467
We'd better find the culprit soon.

137
00:09:00.057 --> 00:09:00.857
Tebai Police Station

138
00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:02.897
You think the thief turned violent?
Tebai Police Station

139
00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:03.437
Yes. Just before 4:30PM that day,

140
00:09:03.437 --> 00:09:06.477
Lieutenant Tagiri Yoshia (45)
Tebai Station Officer
Yes. Just before 4:30PM that day,

141
00:09:06.477 --> 00:09:06.897
a silent call was made to the Oide
residence from a nearby public telephone.
Lieutenant Tagiri Yoshia (45)
Tebai Station Officer

142
00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:11.017
a silent call was made to the Oide
residence from a nearby public telephone.

143
00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:12.907
We believe it was the culprit.

144
00:09:13.207 --> 00:09:15.997
They were determining if anyone was home.

145
00:09:15.997 --> 00:09:19.527
Yes. Oide Raita didn't answer the call.

146
00:09:19.527 --> 00:09:21.447
The answering machine answered instead.

147
00:09:21.447 --> 00:09:24.347
So the culprit thought the house was empty.

148
00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:27.297
Yes. Apparently they picked the lock.

149
00:09:27.727 --> 00:09:28.957
They picked the lock?

150
00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:31.677
See? This is it.

151
00:09:32.057 --> 00:09:35.267
After sneaking into the house,

152
00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:37.457
they ran into Oide and turned violent.

153
00:09:37.457 --> 00:09:38.947
But, Mister...

154
00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:40.607
Kapow.

155
00:09:41.087 --> 00:09:45.057
The weapon used to strike Oide's head

156
00:09:45.057 --> 00:09:47.187
was an angular blunt object,

157
00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:49.267
but we haven't found it yet.

158
00:09:49.267 --> 00:09:51.697
We believe the culprit took it with them.

159
00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:54.087
An angular blunt object?

160
00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:56.447
I have questions about the weapon, too.

161
00:09:56.727 --> 00:09:59.357
Do you have any idea who the culprit is?

162
00:09:59.357 --> 00:10:03.517
We're looking into everyone with break-ins
via lockpicking on their record, but...

163
00:10:05.427 --> 00:10:06.867
Hey, Mister.

164
00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:10.167
Would someone who picks locks
to secretly enter empty homes

165
00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:13.317
turn violent and kill someone?

166
00:10:13.317 --> 00:10:16.627
They probably did it spur of the moment
when they ran into the homeowner.

167
00:10:16.627 --> 00:10:21.177
Yeah, but it's also odd that someone
trying to rob an empty house

168
00:10:21.177 --> 00:10:22.847
brought a weapon and ran away with it.

169
00:10:23.177 --> 00:10:24.437
Shut up.

170
00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:26.737
Thinking about that won't—

171
00:10:28.107 --> 00:10:30.757
Mori-san, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

172
00:10:31.307 --> 00:10:34.607
My mom's going to be staying at the
hospital for two or three days.

173
00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:37.647
The Oide family is falling apart.

174
00:10:37.647 --> 00:10:39.027
Fusaya-kun.

175
00:10:39.027 --> 00:10:39.617
Yes?

176
00:10:40.177 --> 00:10:43.867
You mentioned something
about the gears of tragedy.

177
00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:47.627
It wasn't you who turned them, but the culprit.

178
00:10:52.407 --> 00:10:55.547
Ten days may have passed, but it's
always worth examining the crime scene.

179
00:10:55.727 --> 00:11:00.137
It's likely some kind of clue was left behind.

180
00:11:00.647 --> 00:11:03.267
This is the living room where it happened.

181
00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:06.437
All right. Let's find those clues.

182
00:11:08.987 --> 00:11:11.437
Come on out, clues.

183
00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:16.067
Come on, clues.

184
00:11:18.067 --> 00:11:20.287
Fusaya
An

185
00:11:20.287 --> 00:11:21.947
I'm taking a break.
Fusaya
An

186
00:11:22.437 --> 00:11:24.047
Hey, Fusaya-san.

187
00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:25.837
What is it?

188
00:11:26.287 --> 00:11:30.747
This door looks strangely
new compared to the wall.

189
00:11:30.747 --> 00:11:35.127
We replaced it about a month ago.

190
00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:36.087
What is it?

191
00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:43.007
Lockpicking requires skill, but it's easy
to break in when you have a spare key.

192
00:11:43.007 --> 00:11:43.637
Huh?

193
00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:45.867
Fusaya-kun.

194
00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:47.207
Y-Yes?

195
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.647
Who replaced this door?

196
00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:53.397
A nearby contractor called Tebai Engineering.

197
00:11:53.437 --> 00:11:54.437
Tebai Engineering

198
00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:55.617
I see.
Tebai Engineering

199
00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:57.907
So it was Taira Yasushi-san who was
responsible for replacing the door.
Tebai Engineering

200
00:11:57.907 --> 00:11:58.067
So it was Taira Yasushi-san who was
responsible for replacing the door.

201
00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:01.487
Taira Yasushi (33)
Engineering Firm Employee
So it was Taira Yasushi-san who was
responsible for replacing the door.

202
00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:01.527
So it was Taira Yasushi-san who was
responsible for replacing the door.

203
00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:07.877
And he was out on a job ten days
ago last Wednesday evening?

204
00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:09.577
One moment, please.

205
00:12:10.737 --> 00:12:12.587
On that day...

206
00:12:13.597 --> 00:12:15.827
Taira took the day off.

207
00:12:16.757 --> 00:12:19.137
I see. Thank you.

208
00:12:19.977 --> 00:12:23.437
What? He paid off his rent all at once?

209
00:12:23.437 --> 00:12:27.017
Yes, the full amount he
owed. 280 thousand yen.

210
00:12:27.237 --> 00:12:30.377
Was that ten days ago?

211
00:12:30.377 --> 00:12:32.937
Yes, it was around then.

212
00:12:33.497 --> 00:12:34.437
This is...

213
00:12:34.857 --> 00:12:36.407
That must be it.

214
00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:39.697
Tebai Engineering

215
00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:43.177
You're Taira Yasushi-san, aren't you?

216
00:12:43.177 --> 00:12:44.207
Huh?

217
00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:46.627
My name is Mori.

218
00:12:46.627 --> 00:12:48.147
I'm a private detective.

219
00:12:48.147 --> 00:12:51.077
What? The famous detective?

220
00:12:51.077 --> 00:12:54.297
I have a few questions
for you about the robbery

221
00:12:54.297 --> 00:12:57.587
and murder that happened ten days ago.

222
00:12:58.827 --> 00:13:03.477
I'm actually really busy right now.

223
00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:04.257
Huh?

224
00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:06.587
That is to say, you know...

225
00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:08.017
What?

226
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:09.887
Hey!

227
00:13:10.347 --> 00:13:10.977
You jerk!

228
00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:14.067
Stop, damn it!

229
00:13:15.207 --> 00:13:17.987
Where did that punk go?

230
00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:22.047
Hey.

231
00:13:22.047 --> 00:13:22.527
Huh?

232
00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:26.827
I think you should tell us everything
you know instead of running.

233
00:13:28.017 --> 00:13:30.367
The kid's right.

234
00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:32.847
This game of tag is over.

235
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:36.587
Now why don't you answer my questions?

236
00:13:45.994 --> 00:13:48.834
You used the 300 thousand yen you stole

237
00:13:49.174 --> 00:13:52.014
to pay off four month's
worth of rent, didn't you?

238
00:13:52.014 --> 00:13:55.964
I, uh—I won the lottery.

239
00:13:56.234 --> 00:14:00.334
You secretly made a spare key
when you replaced the door,

240
00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:03.254
and used that to sneak
into the Oide residence.

241
00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:04.914
Isn't that right?

242
00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:07.644
Well, I—

243
00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:12.404
The scratches on the front door keyhole
were a camouflage, weren't they?

244
00:14:13.014 --> 00:14:17.154
You did it to make it look like
the front door had been picked

245
00:14:17.484 --> 00:14:20.654
and draw attention away from the back door.

246
00:14:22.084 --> 00:14:24.704
It's an old trick.

247
00:14:24.704 --> 00:14:26.454
So, where's the weapon?

248
00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:27.954
I-I don't know.

249
00:14:28.364 --> 00:14:30.044
No, wait. You've got it all wrong.

250
00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.264
What's wrong?

251
00:14:32.264 --> 00:14:33.544
I'll confess.

252
00:14:33.544 --> 00:14:37.844
I'll tell you everything I know
if you'll prove my innocence.

253
00:14:38.194 --> 00:14:38.964
What?

254
00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:43.974
It's exactly like you said, Mori-san.

255
00:14:45.024 --> 00:14:49.314
I needed the money, so I broke
into that house that day.

256
00:14:49.774 --> 00:14:52.654
We can't come to the phone at this time.

257
00:14:52.654 --> 00:14:53.984
Please leave your message after—

258
00:14:55.314 --> 00:14:56.984
I confirmed no one was home,

259
00:14:57.224 --> 00:15:01.094
and snuck in through the back
door using the spare key I made.

260
00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:02.654
Then...

261
00:15:04.814 --> 00:15:07.254
He was snoring in his sleep.

262
00:15:09.434 --> 00:15:10.834
Right on the floor here.

263
00:15:11.824 --> 00:15:12.924
I see.

264
00:15:13.214 --> 00:15:18.574
So Raita didn't answer the phone
because he was fast asleep.

265
00:15:18.574 --> 00:15:24.494
Yeah, but I thought it'd be fine
as long as I didn't wake him up.

266
00:15:29.694 --> 00:15:33.944
I quietly stole the cash, scratched
up the front door keyhole,

267
00:15:36.064 --> 00:15:38.014
and then left.

268
00:15:39.354 --> 00:15:41.674
What time was that?

269
00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.074
Huh? Uh...

270
00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.584
The time is 4:30.

271
00:15:47.584 --> 00:15:51.504
Please be careful as you
return to your homes.

272
00:15:51.504 --> 00:15:53.174
It was after 4:30.

273
00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:55.084
There was a notice playing.

274
00:15:56.724 --> 00:16:01.344
Oide Raita-san's estimated time
of death is also after 4:30.

275
00:16:01.344 --> 00:16:04.474
Did you lock the front door when you left?

276
00:16:04.744 --> 00:16:09.094
No. I didn't have a key to the front door.

277
00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:12.224
Someone must've broken in after me.

278
00:16:12.454 --> 00:16:15.434
In other words, this case
isn't a robbery and murder.

279
00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:19.064
It's two separate cases:
a burglary and a murder.

280
00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.744
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:28.594
Yeah, but do you really think a murderer
entered his home right after a burglar?

282
00:16:28.594 --> 00:16:30.524
What kind of coincidence is that?

283
00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:35.404
But I didn't bring or leave with a weapon.

284
00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:36.704
Can you prove that?

285
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:41.424
Isn't it a detective's
job to figure that out?

286
00:16:41.424 --> 00:16:43.314
A weapon, huh?

287
00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:49.854
We'll hold him at our
station as a key witness.

288
00:16:51.394 --> 00:16:52.534
Mori-san.

289
00:16:52.534 --> 00:16:57.414
If we let the police handle it,
he just might confess to it.

290
00:16:57.414 --> 00:17:00.984
Mori-san, do you really
believe he's a murderer?

291
00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:01.984
What?

292
00:17:02.394 --> 00:17:08.664
If the culprit is someone else,
the police won't find him.

293
00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:11.994
Only you can do it, Mori-san. So...

294
00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:13.494
I see.

295
00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:19.834
If there's a true culprit who cleverly
beat the police investigation,

296
00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:23.634
then finding them would
be a job for Mori Kogoro.

297
00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:25.314
Thank you.

298
00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:26.884
Seriously?

299
00:17:27.454 --> 00:17:31.014
Yeah, but we don't have any suspects.

300
00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:36.324
Generally speaking, the motive
is likely to be a grudge.

301
00:17:36.784 --> 00:17:40.474
May I speak with your sister and mother?

302
00:17:41.024 --> 00:17:41.564
Yes.

303
00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:43.454
I'll take you to the hospital.

304
00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:47.264
Well, whatever.

305
00:17:47.264 --> 00:17:51.574
Honestly, I doubt Taira
is the culprit either.

306
00:17:51.824 --> 00:17:55.064
This case seems like there's
more to it than meets the eye.

307
00:17:56.504 --> 00:18:02.844
Can you think of anyone who
may have resented Raita?

308
00:18:03.864 --> 00:18:08.094
He was careful in his relationships
with people. Right?

309
00:18:08.094 --> 00:18:10.634
Yeah. Almost too careful.

310
00:18:11.054 --> 00:18:13.764
Did being too careful cause any problems?

311
00:18:14.984 --> 00:18:18.634
Yeah. He was reluctant to get
on board with my engagement.

312
00:18:19.124 --> 00:18:21.434
He was convinced marrying
into a wealthy family

313
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.654
would make maintaining
relationships difficult.

314
00:18:25.124 --> 00:18:27.164
He let his imagination run wild.

315
00:18:28.144 --> 00:18:31.394
But that had already been resolved.

316
00:18:31.854 --> 00:18:36.544
He smiled and said he had
been worried about nothing.

317
00:18:37.294 --> 00:18:38.754
I have another question.

318
00:18:39.194 --> 00:18:43.674
Who knew Raita was at home that day?

319
00:18:44.304 --> 00:18:46.694
I think it was just the three of us.

320
00:18:46.694 --> 00:18:49.554
But he may have told someone.

321
00:18:49.864 --> 00:18:54.184
The two of you were looking
for Fusaya-san together

322
00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:57.224
around 4:30 that day, right?

323
00:18:58.514 --> 00:19:01.824
Not together. We split up.

324
00:19:01.824 --> 00:19:03.604
I see.

325
00:19:04.034 --> 00:19:06.714
But you returned together, right?

326
00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:09.454
Yeah. We met up at night.

327
00:19:09.454 --> 00:19:11.394
We'd given up the search.

328
00:19:11.394 --> 00:19:12.994
That's right.

329
00:19:13.454 --> 00:19:17.044
What are you asking questions for?

330
00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:20.264
In any case, let me handle this.

331
00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:23.504
I promise I'll expose the heinous culprit.

332
00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:27.494
Take care. Excuse me.

333
00:19:30.664 --> 00:19:33.884
He'll solve this case in no time, Sis.

334
00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:35.914
It seems like it.

335
00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:39.214
I haven't seen you smile in forever.

336
00:19:39.694 --> 00:19:41.904
I could say the same thing about you.

337
00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:44.084
What is it?

338
00:19:44.564 --> 00:19:45.304
It's just...

339
00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:52.514
This will finally stop the gears of tragedy
that have been turning for our family.

340
00:19:53.634 --> 00:19:54.664
You're right.

341
00:19:55.144 --> 00:19:58.544
If Dad accepted my engagement,

342
00:19:58.544 --> 00:20:01.664
then I should move ahead with
the wedding planning soon.

343
00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:04.654
More than anything, for Dad's sake, too.

344
00:20:05.864 --> 00:20:09.874
That just leaves Fusaya's future.

345
00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:18.944
Sorry about that.

346
00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:21.704
I'll do something about it soon.

347
00:20:21.704 --> 00:20:28.314
Anyway, you weren't lying when you said
the famous Mori-san accepted the case.

348
00:20:28.504 --> 00:20:31.324
You didn't believe him?

349
00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.504
We learned a lot, Mister.

350
00:20:34.974 --> 00:20:40.334
Only those three knew Oide
Raita-san was at home.

351
00:20:40.754 --> 00:20:45.054
And while he expressed his disapproval
of his daughter's engagement,

352
00:20:45.054 --> 00:20:49.084
only his wife knew that issue
had already been resolved.

353
00:20:49.634 --> 00:20:55.844
Also, the sister and mom were acting
separately when Raita-san was killed.

354
00:20:56.104 --> 00:20:59.994
Hold on. I hate to consider it, but...

355
00:21:00.924 --> 00:21:05.544
The mother secretly returned home
to help her daughter get engaged,

356
00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:08.314
but Raita continued to
disapprove of the idea, and...

357
00:21:08.314 --> 00:21:12.114
If that feebleness is just an act, then...

358
00:21:14.124 --> 00:21:15.574
I see.

359
00:21:15.854 --> 00:21:19.224
So she's definitely in a
weakened state due to anxiety.

360
00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:23.874
Is it possible she's living
an unhealthy life on purpose?

361
00:21:23.874 --> 00:21:30.394
Mori-san, despite your stature, I can't tell
you the details of a patient's condition.

362
00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.844
I guess it was all in my head.

363
00:21:36.114 --> 00:21:41.094
It's possible her fear of being
suspected caused her anxiety.

364
00:21:41.254 --> 00:21:44.434
Damn it. I can't come up with anything.

365
00:21:44.434 --> 00:21:47.084
I guess we'll get dinner
and go home for today.

366
00:21:47.084 --> 00:21:48.854
I want sushi.

367
00:21:49.064 --> 00:21:51.014
Nothing expensive.

368
00:21:51.504 --> 00:21:52.864
Cheapskate.

369
00:21:52.864 --> 00:21:55.214
You're a kid. You should
be eating kid's meals.

370
00:21:55.214 --> 00:21:57.054
I know. Let's go to a family restaurant.

371
00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:58.864
Again?

372
00:22:01.384 --> 00:22:02.504
What is it?

373
00:22:02.504 --> 00:22:04.664
I felt like someone was watching us.

374
00:22:06.064 --> 00:22:07.664
Looks like it was my imagination.

375
00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:10.544
Jeez. Let's get out of here.

376
00:22:10.544 --> 00:22:11.764
Okay.

377
00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:15.924
The gears of tragedy that began
turning for the Oide family.

378
00:22:16.674 --> 00:22:19.794
What exactly put them into motion?

379
00:22:20.594 --> 00:22:26.044
Why was Oide Raita, who was home
that day by chance, murdered?

380
00:22:29.544 --> 00:22:32.164
I'll definitely solve this mystery.

The sudden sleepiness Raita mentioned

was due to the sleeping pills
