1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,370
I see. This was a blind spot.

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,870
We were watching the back door

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,070
since we expected passers-by out front.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,170
But why did Ihaya go outside?

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,070
We told you guys to stay in your room.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,370
We were going to the bathroom.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,470
Ihaya, Agata, and I headed to the bathroom together.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,470
Ihaya said he was worried about leaving Keiko alone in the room,

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,870
so he alone headed back.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,870
I thought I saw him check his messages before he headed back.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,270
I see.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,370
Did Ihaya return immediately to the room?

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,870
No.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,570
I was afraid to stay alone in the room,

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,970
so I left for the bathroom shortly afterwards.

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,470
It's possible he returned after I left the room.

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,470
How long were the two of you in the bathroom?

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,170
I left the bathroom right away,

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,970
but I got lost on the way back.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,470
My stomach wasn't feeling great,

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,170
so I stayed in the bathroom for a while.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,170
In other words, all three of you could've messaged Ihaya

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,270
and murdered him.

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,370
What?

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,570
But...

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,770
We'd never do that!

27
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,470
Now, now. You're not wrong,

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,970
but the blood spray and footprints on the inuyarai...

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,270
It looks like they were painted on quite a while ago.

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,770
When you were here before the body was discovered,

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,570
were these really not here?

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,170
Yes.

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,970
Maybe we're all being tricked by a fox.

34
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,070
What's this mark?

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,670
Huh?

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,770
What?

37
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,870
There are weird marks around the inuyarai.

38
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,370
Oh, man. I did what I always do.

39
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,470
You're right. It goes all the way around it.

40
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,870
I wonder what it is.

41
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,870
Did he just say "Huh"?

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,170
He's doing an impression of that brat now?

43
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,970
How imprudent.

44
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,070
Anyway, was there a code?

45
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,670
Was it in his breast pocket again?

46
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,870
Yes.

47
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,070
Like Nishiki's murder,

48
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,570
it was there along with this paper plant leaf.

49
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,970
The third cipher.

50
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,970
They left another nonsensical cipher?

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,270
And why are these four squares at the beginning Dekuri's mark?

52
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,670
Maybe it's because the character for "de" in Dekuri is formed

53
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,870
if you draw a big square around them.

54
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,570
Draw a big square around them, huh?

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,870
You're right.

56
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,170
Hattori, your phone's ringing.

57
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,270
"Incoming Call, Kazuha" -It's Kazuha.

58
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,970
What is it, Kazuha? I'm...

59
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,670
Heiji, what are you doing?

60
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,570
Didn't I tell you?

61
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,170
I'm really sick with a cold, so I can't go to school.

62
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,670
Don't be ridiculous!

63
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,370
I see you on TV!

64
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,770
What?

65
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,770
Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,770
I wandered over to Kyoto

67
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,270
to find a good luck charm that cures colds.

68
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,170
What?

69
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,270
That's not a believable excuse.

70
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,470
In any case,

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,570
I need to solve a serial murder case and crack a code.

72
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,470
Don't tell my parents about this.

73
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,670
Hey, Heiji.

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,970
Those characters in the code

75
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,670
remind me of location names in Kyoto.

76
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,070
What?

77
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,770
This character is the "hisashi"

78
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,570
in the Kamigyo Ward's Hisashi-cho.

79
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,870
To its left is the "to" in the Shimogyo Ward's Tokusayama-cho.

80
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,770
To the left of that is the "adashi" in the Ukyo Ward's Adashino.

81
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,870
This is read "adashi"?

82
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,070
That's right.

83
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,870
Hold on.

84
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,470
If there are wards with top, bottom,

85
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,570
and right in their names, then...

86
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,670
Yes. Kyoto contains the Kamigyo Ward,

87
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,870
the Nakagyo Ward, the Shimogyo Ward,

88
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,770
the Sakyo Ward, and the Ukyo Ward.

89
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,870
Top, middle, bottom, and left and right are all represented.

90
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,070
What?

91
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,470
Then maybe this...

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,970
Could it be...

93
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,470
That must be it.

94
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,670
-Hey, Heiji! -What?

95
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,970
I thought I heard Momiji's voice.

96
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,370
Why, little leaf. How have you been?

97
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,870
-Mo! -Let me handle Heiji.

98
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,970
You should focus on your studies.

99
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,970
-I... -Goodbye, now.

100
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,970
I can't let you handle him, you idiot!

101
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,870
Can't let us handle it?

102
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,970
Are you going to clean the classroom yourself, Kazuha?

103
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,870
That's not what I meant.

104
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,370
Gosh.

105
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,970
I believe we were in the middle of our conversation.

106
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,370
Why don't you tell us this time

107
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,770
about the man named Dekuri who came up with these three ciphers.

108
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,770
In my eyes are maximum creation!

109
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,570
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction!

110
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,370
A serial murder stirs up trouble in Kyoto!

111
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,370
The tengu and the movie share a surprising connection!

112
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

113
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

114
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,070
His name is Detective Conan!

115
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,870
"The Scarlet School Trip: Bright Red and Red Love Arcs"

116
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:20,928
"The Scarlet School Trip (Red Love Arc)"

117
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,528
"Ponto City"

118
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:29,428
Dekuri Michio?

119
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:35,028
Was he also your classmate at Gion Art School?

120
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,128
Yes.

121
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:41,128
He was in fine arts, but I was a music student.

122
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,328
I studied film.

123
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:46,828
Ihaya and I were in the acting school.

124
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:49,528
And Nishiki was a literary arts student.

125
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,128
How did you get to know each other

126
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,628
when you studied different majors?

127
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:58,128
We all joined the special effects film club.

128
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:01,628
Dekuri was also in the comics club, though.

129
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:06,428
Every year, we'd show the movie we filmed at the school festival.

130
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:09,628
I was always good at special effects.

131
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:13,628
Ihaya and I were masters of special effects makeup.

132
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:18,028
And I'd compose eerie music for the completed film.

133
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,528
Nishiki would write the script,

134
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:23,728
and Dekuri would design the costumes and monsters, right?

135
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,928
When Dekuri was busy with his comics,

136
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,828
we all pitched in.

137
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:33,928
Agata was the only one who was really useful, though.

138
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:34,928
Yeah.

139
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:38,928
But the name Dekuri doesn't appear in the credits

140
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:43,628
of the graduation project "The Fighting Red Tengu" is based on.

141
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:48,128
Why is that?

142
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,128
What? Why aren't you saying anything?

143
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,228
Nishiki was having trouble

144
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:56,128
writing the script for our graduation project.

145
00:08:56,128 --> 00:09:01,028
That's when he found a self-published comic Dekuri had produced.

146
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:03,728
It was a marvelous fantasy story.

147
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:07,028
It was "The Fighting Red Tengu", wasn't it?

148
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:08,528
Yes.

149
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:12,828
Dekuri said he planned to officially publish it

150
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:16,328
once he became a professional comic book artist,

151
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,028
so he asked us not to use it.

152
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,328
We thought Dekuri would accept it

153
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:23,128
once he saw the finished product,

154
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,328
so we decided to film his story.

155
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:28,628
And if we put his name in the credits,

156
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:31,528
it would be his graduation project, too.

157
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,828
But when he previewed the film in our club room...

158
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:37,728
This isn't my work!

159
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,328
You betrayed me!

160
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,028
Wait, Dekuri.

161
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:44,028
Don't put my name on it!

162
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,728
Dekuri!

163
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:51,028
Later, our graduation project received high praise.

164
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:55,328
The five of us were thrown into the limelight.

165
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,628
He totally hates you.

166
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:02,228
But the night we announced the movie,

167
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,628
I got a call from Dekuri.

168
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,928
He said he'd given up on drawing comics

169
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:11,228
and was working at a small design firm.

170
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:15,028
He asked us to put his name in the credits

171
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,028
if we were going to remake that movie.

172
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:21,028
Dekuri said it was his dream

173
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,028
for his comics to be adapted for the big screen.

174
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:26,328
Did you put his name in the credits?

175
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:31,028
We were going to, but there was a little mistake.

176
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:35,828
When he saw his name wasn't in the credits at the first screening,

177
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,928
he killed himself over the disappointment.

178
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:44,028
We even thought about canceling the movie's release,

179
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:47,328
but our sponsors wouldn't let us.

180
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:48,928
I see.

181
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,628
Why?

182
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:57,428
Why are Heiji and the others allowed inside when we're not?

183
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:01,428
The little leaf left me to look after Heiji for once.

184
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,428
He seems to have the trust of Inspector Ayanokoji.

185
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:07,528
Seriously, who is he?

186
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,728
It's your job to do something about that.

187
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,428
Excuse me, Momiji.

188
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,928
What is it?

189
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:15,628
Where can I go to meet Okita?

190
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:21,728
Well, that kendo brat

191
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:25,528
is probably practicing in the dojo around now.

192
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:27,828
If you have a message for him, I'll deliver it for you.

193
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:32,428
Actually, there's something I wanted to discuss with him in person.

194
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:35,028
Huh?

195
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,328
-It's you, Ran. -What?

196
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,728
Okita!

197
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:41,228
What are you doing here?

198
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:43,728
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:46,128
You brought all your henchmen with you.

200
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:49,628
I heard some tengu were running wild on Kiyamachi Way,

201
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,128
so I brought the club to wipe them out.

202
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,628
Why, thank you.

203
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:57,428
He looks exactly like Shinichi.

204
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,828
Does that mean...

205
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:03,228
This girl says she wanted to see you.

206
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,428
Really?

207
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:09,328
So you did come to Kyoto because you wanted to see me.

208
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,528
No...

209
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,928
-Come with me. -What?

210
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,273
Keiko Kurachi?

211
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,173
Kyoko.

212
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,873
We appeared in a lot of dramas together.

213
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,973
Of course, I always played the lead role.

214
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,873
Kyoko? Not Keiko?

215
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,173
Her real name is Kyoko.

216
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:06,473
After all she went through over her college graduation project,

217
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:09,073
she added the character for sun to the top of "kyo" for "Kyoto",

218
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:11,573
and made her stage name Keiko.

219
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,473
Really?

220
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:14,873
Speaking of names,

221
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:19,273
she said Nishiki and Mayama changed their names

222
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:22,273
just for that graduation project, too.

223
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:24,073
They changed their names?

224
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:25,573
Yeah.

225
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,373
Mayama changed the mountain radical

226
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:31,273
of "mine" in "Mineto" from left to top,

227
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:34,973
and Nishiki changed his name from "Taro" to "Tarobo".

228
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:37,573
Come to think of it, Japan's most legendary tengu

229
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:40,073
is named Tarobo, too.

230
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:42,273
Oh, yeah. Speaking of Kyoko,

231
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:44,873
she fell in love during college and hasn't gotten married

232
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:49,273
because she's still in love with him.

233
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:50,673
I see.

234
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:54,073
Is that man's name Michio Dekuri?

235
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,173
No way. How did you know?

236
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,473
Hey, mom. That Dekuri guy...

237
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,073
How did you know?

238
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,773
She hung up.

239
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:06,473
A message from Sonoko?

240
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,473
What?

241
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:08,973
"Subject: Your wife is cheating on you"

242
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,273
Okita?

243
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:14,073
Why is Ran seeing Okita?

244
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:17,273
And what do their expressions mean?

245
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:20,173
Hey, Kudo.

246
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:22,073
What are you looking at?

247
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:23,173
Nothing.

248
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,973
-Let's go. -Go where?

249
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,673
To the Gion Hotel.

250
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:31,973
When Nishiki tried to reserve a smoking room,

251
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:34,973
at first, they told him they were fully booked,

252
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,073
but a reservation was canceled while he was on the phone,

253
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:39,073
so he got a room after all.

254
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,173
Curious, right?

255
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,073
Yeah.

256
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,773
You're right.

257
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,073
I'm curious about this, too.

258
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,673
Yes, that's correct.

259
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,973
A reservation was canceled

260
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,373
while we were on the phone with Mr. Nishiki.

261
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,573
He reserved the room for two days starting yesterday.

262
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:01,173
I see.

263
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,673
Come to think of it, you smoke, too, Agata.

264
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:07,173
Were you able to get a room right away?

265
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,273
Yeah.

266
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,873
Someone else canceled right after Nishiki called.

267
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:15,273
We were gathered in Nishiki's apartment

268
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,273
and made our reservations together.

269
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,673
-Right? -Yes.

270
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,773
Is this true?

271
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:22,873
Yes.

272
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:25,173
After Mr. Nishiki made a reservation,

273
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:29,573
someone else canceled, and Mr. Agata reserved the room.

274
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:33,273
It was a group of guests who canceled.

275
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:36,473
Speaking of Agata's room,

276
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:39,073
a giant tengu apparently appeared inside it.

277
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:42,573
Is it true that nothing strange was found in the room after that?

278
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:47,473
Yes. There was a glue-like substance on the burned ceiling,

279
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:52,273
but it wasn't nearly enough to support a large object.

280
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,073
There were also marks left by the chair

281
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:57,173
when Agata fell out of it

282
00:15:57,173 --> 00:16:00,273
and a roughly three centimeter burn in the carpet

283
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:03,273
when a cigarette fell from the ashtray thrown at the tengu.

284
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,973
And for some reason, there was another pillow

285
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,573
in the middle of the bed.

286
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:10,373
That's a habit of mine.

287
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:15,073
What is it? Something in that didn't sound right.

288
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:17,773
The glue on the ceiling...

289
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,873
The marks left by the chair...

290
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,573
I'm Soshi Okita.

291
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,273
The cigarette burn...

292
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:27,073
I wonder if we'll get to see Okita.

293
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,673
The pillow in the center of the bed...

294
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,573
Your wife is cheating on you.

295
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,573
Gosh.

296
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:37,573
I can't focus on the case

297
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,073
because I keep thinking of that picture of them.

298
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:43,073
I don't have time to think about that right now.

299
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:44,973
What? Time?

300
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,373
Gosh. There it is.

301
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,973
It's sooner than yesterday.

302
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:54,473
Hey, Kudo. You okay?

303
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,773
Yeah.

304
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,173
More importantly, I know who did it.

305
00:16:58,173 --> 00:16:59,173
-What? -What?

306
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:00,173
Seriously?

307
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:05,373
But there's not enough evidence to arrest them.

308
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:08,473
Then what are we going to do, Kudo?

309
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,773
Inspector Ayanokoji.

310
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:10,873
What is it?

311
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:14,973
Could I get some assistance from the Kyoto police?

312
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,373
Yes, if we're able.

313
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:24,873
It may be a little... embarrassing, though.

314
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:37,755
"The next day" -In any case, since a new cipher

315
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,155
was found on the body of Ihaya yesterday,

316
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:46,455
the culprit may be planning to kill another one of you.

317
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:49,355
Please remain in your rooms

318
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:52,455
until it's time to check out.

319
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,355
To be safe,

320
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:58,455
we'll be posting an officer outside each of your rooms.

321
00:17:58,455 --> 00:18:00,155
Thank you.

322
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:01,555
Goodbye.

323
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:06,755
Hey, Kudo. Are you okay?

324
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,455
Yeah, just barely.

325
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,555
I took my medicine late this morning.

326
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,255
-Your medicine? -What?

327
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,155
What medicine?

328
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:16,155
Cold medicine.

329
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,355
Really?

330
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,755
This has turned into quite the visit.

331
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:25,955
Yeah. We never even made it to Dekuri's grave.

332
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:28,155
We'll have to go another time.

333
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,355
You're right.

334
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,655
-See you later. -Yeah.

335
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:40,255
Your dream?

336
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,655
That's your dream, Dekuri?

337
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:45,755
Yeah.

338
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:50,155
Seeing the words "based on a comic by Michio Dekuri"

339
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:52,055
on the big screen is my dream.

340
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,155
Really?

341
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:16,155
You'll really put my name in the credits?

342
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:21,855
Of course. You're the one who wrote the story.

343
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,955
-I'm glad. -What?

344
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,755
I've actually always regretted it.

345
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:30,055
Your graduation project was so well made,

346
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:33,355
I said that out of frustration.

347
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:36,855
I'm sorry. And thank you.

348
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,855
What's wrong, Dekuri?

349
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:55,055
We need to leave. They're closing the theater.

350
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:56,855
That's odd.

351
00:19:56,855 --> 00:20:00,555
No matter how long I wait, my name never appears.

352
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,155
Isn't that strange?

353
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:34,255
Where are you going?

354
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:35,455
To the bathroom.

355
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,255
The bathroom in my room isn't working.

356
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:40,155
I'm going to the bathroom in the lobby.

357
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,755
I'll be right back.

358
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,255
Be careful.

359
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:49,755
Hello?

360
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:00,055
To Kiyomizu Temple.

361
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,355
Very well.
