1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,200
I found it!

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,700
Remi Sekizawa's photo book, "DoRemi"!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,800
You have the last copy in stock!

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm so lucky!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Your big sister is so popular.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,400
Thank you.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
( Yumi Sekizawa(17) )
To me, she's still my sloppy and careless big sister.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,900
To me, she's still my sloppy and careless big sister.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,400
But she was so cute as a detective's assistant

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,100
in the drama that was aired the other day.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,200
She was a hopeless assistant

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,300
who didn't have any skills of deduction, though.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Well, that's what the script wanted her to be.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,600
She is a model first and foremost, after all.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,100
So, is it really okay for our friends
to come over tonight?

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,600
To Remi Sekizawa's birthday party.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Even though we're not famous or anything.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Yes.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,800
It is a small party at the place
where one of her classmates works.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,700
And we're also celebrating my birthday
at the same time.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,900
I see. Your birthday
is two days after Valentine's Day, right?

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,400
That's right, on 16 February.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,800
My sister's birthday
is on the day after Valentine's Day,

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,200
so we've celebrated our birthdays together
since we were kids.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,900
Besides, there's another reason
I want you all to come to the party.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,500
Is something the matter?

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
No, it's not such a big deal.

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
So, Yumi. About what I said earlier...

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,400
He's a first-year in elementary school, right?

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,900
It's fine! I think it's okay
to have just one more kid at the party.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,400
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,700
At a well-known model's birthday party,

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,900
the screams carried
by the cake echo throughout!

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,500
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,300
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,700
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,900
(A Birthday Party
with Divine Punishment (Part 1) )

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,100
The cafe isn't that big.

40
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,600
But there are so many models, actors,
and entertainers here!

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
No wonder everyone looks so stylish.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,000
Aren't you glad you came along, Conan?

43
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300
What's up? You don't look happy at all.

44
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Conan has a mouth ulcer,
so it's difficult for him to speak.

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,500
Did you bring your medicine?

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,200
Yeah, I brought it.

47
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,300
You should have left the kid at home
if he has a mouth ulcer.

48
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,800
But dad has to attend

49
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,700
the neighbourhood association meeting tonight,

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,700
so Conan would have been alone at home.

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,600
How about you take your medicine
before the party gets started?

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,100
You're right.

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,300
Let's see. If I recall correctly,
it's one tablet per dose.

54
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,400
I put the mouth ulcer tablets

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,100
in the same pill case as that capsule.

56
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
Hey.

57
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,700
What's the blue-and-white capsule for?

58
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,100
It... it's nothing!

59
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,700
Of course, I couldn't tell her.

60
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,700
It's the antidote to APTX 4869

61
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,800
that Haibara gave me during the field trip.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,200
I can't believe I've kept it on me
the entire time without using it.

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,000
What's this?
Is the kid afraid of swallowing tablets?

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,800
I don't think that's the case.

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Mum?

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Just as you predicted,
Conan has the capsule with him.

67
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,700
I see.

68
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,800
But a blue-and-white pill is different
from the poison I was given.

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Judging by his flustered response,

70
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,900
it's likely an antidote to
revert my body to its original age.

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,800
If possible, take it from him.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Okay, mum.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right. I was given a red-and-white pill.

74
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,000
At London's Vauxhall Bridge.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
They defeated me and...

76
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,100
You must be my sister Yumi's classmates.

77
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
These are Ran, Sonoko, and Sera.

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
Nice to meet you.

79
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,500
( Remi Sekizawa(21) )

80
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,900
( Remi Sekizawa(21) )
I hope you enjoy the party to the fullest.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
While we're here, I...

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,800
I bought your photo book earlier today,

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,100
I'd appreciate it
if you could sign it at a later time.

84
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,400
In that case, I can sign it for you now.

85
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,700
Mr. Kushiyama,

86
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,300
(Mitomu Kushiyama)
could you get the permanent marker from my bag?

87
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,700
Yes.

88
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,500
Here you go.

89
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,800
Thanks.

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Should I write "To Ran"?

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes! Thank you very much!

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,300
No problem.

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,500
That's weird.

94
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,000
I can't write a thing with this marker.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,800
There was an acrid smell
when I opened your bag earlier,

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,000
so maybe the marker was uncapped.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,100
- No way.
- For goodness' sake.

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,500
You always forget
to cap your markers, Remi.

99
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
Here's a spare permanent marker I have ready.

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,150
Nice one, Yumi!

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,400
Sorry to make you wait.
Was your name Sonoko?

102
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,300
- Hey, Yumi!
- It's Ran.

103
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,700
Who do we ask for water?

104
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,400
The kid wants to take his medicine.

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Well...

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
In that case, I can bring it to you.

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,700
- Yes, please.
- While we're at it,

108
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,400
I can help inform the staff
if you have food allergies.

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,900
We don't really have any.

110
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,600
Understood.

111
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,100
I'll treasure it always!

112
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,400
I'd appreciate it if you do.

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,100
Come on, Remi, you're not supposed
to put the marker in there!

114
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,000
You'll leave stains on it.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,900
But what if I get asked
for an autograph again?

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,800
I'll carry it for you until the time comes!

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
You almost can't tell who's older.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're right.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,700
They've been like that since they were kids.

120
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,400
Yumi is more reliable
even though she's four years younger.

121
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
I really thought that

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Yumi would be the one
who'd apply to become a model.

123
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,690
( Tsuguo Hatsune(21) )
I'm a classmate of Remi's

124
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,000
( Tsuguo Hatsune(21) )
in middle school and high school.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,700
My name's Tsuguo Hatsune.

126
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,500
I work as a pastry chef,  and someday
I would like to open my own shop.

127
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,800
I asked the head chef
if I could make the birthday cake,

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,100
so please look forward to it.

129
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,400
Yes.

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,100
You've just started out as a pastry chef,

131
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
but you're dreaming
of getting your own shop?

132
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Well, yes.

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,800
Good luck, then.

134
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,000
( Mizutoshi Hanasaki(32) )
If you wrote

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,150
( Mizutoshi Hanasaki(32) )
"made by Remi Sekizawa's classmate" in the name,

136
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,900
"made by Remi Sekizawa's classmate" in the name,

137
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,700
your cakes might just sell well!

138
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Thank you for that.

139
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Remi! Happy birthday!

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,700
Mr. Hanasaki!

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Here you go. A birthday bouquet.

142
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,700
- Thank you, Mr. Hanasaki.
- Who is that creepy dude?

143
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
That's Mizutoshi Hanasaki.

144
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,200
He's a hair and make-up artist
who's married with children

145
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,700
but he has asked her out countless times.

146
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,500
She has always rejected, though.

147
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,600
What a despicable man.

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
What's with the glasses?

149
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
You'll have to wait and see.

150
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,100
Not only that,
but he has tried to ask me out before.

151
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,800
You should have just ignored him!

152
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,500
But his skills in hair and make-up
are genuine,

153
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,600
so we can't just let go of him.

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,000
I see. So that's why you invited us.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,900
So that he wouldn't try to flirt with you.

156
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,600
Yes. It's easier to avoid him
if I'm with you guys.

157
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,100
It's all right! We'll protect you!

158
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,400
Don't worry!

159
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Thanks.

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,100
Well, anyone would feel safe
around a Jeet Kune Do expert, a karate expert,

161
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,050
and a daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group.

162
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,500
(Suzuki Financial Group)
and a daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group.

163
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
That was delicious.

164
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,100
There's only dessert left.

165
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,800
They'll bring out the birthday cake.

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,500
I can't wait!

167
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,400
Happy birthday to you.

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,500
Happy birthday dear Remi and Yumi.

169
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,200
Happy birthday to you.

170
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,500
Happy birthday...

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Your glasses are glowing!

172
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
How do I look? I look good, right?

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
While the cake is being sliced and distributed,

174
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,400
please enjoy these precious pictures
of sisters Remi and Yumi.

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,500
Yumi was so tiny!

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Please, have a bite.

177
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,500
- Please enjoy the cake.
- Thank you.

178
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,900
Excuse me.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Remi!

180
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
The three-second rule applies here.

181
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,200
Come on.

182
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,700
Did somebody fall?

183
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,400
Was it the hair and make-up artist?

184
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm sorry,

185
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,900
but a wine bottle just broke,
so please don't come this way!

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,000
There's no way of telling
even if he said "this way"...

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,450
Where is it?

188
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Anyway, we have to turn on the lights.

189
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Gosh, I can't see anything in this darkness.

190
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Mr. Hanasaki has fallen,

191
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,800
but his glowing glasses
are partially hidden.

192
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Is there someone next to his head?

193
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,600
What on earth is going on?

194
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
(Divine Punishment)

195
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,200
Death by poison?

196
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,300
So, the victim, Mizutoshi Hanasaki,

197
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,700
ate something that was poisoned and died.
Is that right?

198
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,300
Yes. According to forensics,

199
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
it is likely that there was poison in the cake

200
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,100
the victim ate before falling over.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,400
A vial of cyanide-based poison

202
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,600
was found under the table
where he was sitting.

203
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
But how did the culprit do it
in the middle of a party?

204
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,600
He fell when the projector
was showing the pictures.

205
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,500
The inside of the cafe was dim at the time.

206
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,800
But still, even if there was barely any light...

207
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,900
(Divine Punishment)
If someone was writing on the victim's forehead

208
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,600
(Divine Punishment)
with a permanent marker,

209
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,100
someone else must have seen him or her do it!

210
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,200
About that...

211
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,100
Just after the victim fell,
the projector was suddenly turned off,

212
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,700
and the entire hall became pitch black.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,300
But if it was pitch black,
how did anyone manage to write

214
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,400
(Divine Punishment)
these words on the victim's forehead?

215
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,500
(Divine Punishment)
Actually, the glasses

216
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,900
were a type of party item that glowed in the dark.

217
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,200
I see.

218
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,100
Anyone could write if they were able to
find where his head was.

219
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,700
(Divine Punishment)
The writing is quite distorted,

220
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
(Divine Punishment)
the culprit must have used their opposite hand

221
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
so that they wouldn't be identified
by the handwriting.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,900
But there are close to 40 people here,
including guests and staff.

223
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,100
It would be difficult
to find the culprit amongst them.

224
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,400
There are four suspects.

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
Suspects?

226
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,850
I think he's saying that
there are four suspects.

227
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,700
You're here too?

228
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,900
Our classmate
is the sister of Remi Sekizawa,

229
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,200
so she invited us to the birthday party.

230
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,000
So? What do you mean
by "there are four suspects"?

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,700
Can't you tell just by looking at the scene?

232
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,400
There's the projector and our table
to the left of the victim,

233
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
so no one can get through.

234
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,100
And to the right of the victim...

235
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,900
Look. A staff member dropped
and broke a wine bottle in the dark,

236
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,800
but there aren't any footprints

237
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
even though there's wine on the floor.

238
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
That's not all.

239
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,600
The door across from the victim
leads to the kitchen,

240
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,400
but the kitchen staff testified that

241
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,200
none of them left it
after the projector was turned off

242
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,400
but before the lights turned on again.

243
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
In other words, the murder scene

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,200
is a closed space where no one could leave

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
after the victim ate the poisoned cake
and fell to the floor.

246
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
If you exclude us,
who weren't acquainted with the victim,

247
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,500
there were only four people at the scene.

248
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,150
I see. So, who are the four?

249
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,600
I've told them to stand by in a corner

250
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,100
so that nothing gets carried out.

251
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,000
These are the suspects
who could have slipped the poison

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
- to the victim.
- Hold up.

253
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Yumi is one of the suspects, too?

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,100
Remove her from suspicion!

255
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,700
I'm including her just in case.

256
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,300
She does seem to
know the victim, after all.

257
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Isn't that right, Conan?

258
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,500
You're right.

259
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
What is this?

260
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Has your mouth ulcer not healed yet?

261
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,300
Wouldn't it be better
if you took more medicine?

262
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm going to be fine.

263
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,600
In any case,
we'll have all the other guests go home

264
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,100
and question you all individually.

265
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
We'll ask you
how you were connected to the victim

266
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,550
and what you did
before and after he fell down.

267
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,900
The deceased, Mr. Hanasaki,
was a hair and make-up artist,

268
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,000
and he handled my hair and make-up
for almost every event.

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,600
He was good at his job and quite popular,

270
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,200
so I appreciated what he did.

271
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,600
You were only involved with him
for your work, right?

272
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,900
That's right.

273
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,100
But he tried to ask me out numerous times.

274
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,200
Ask you out?

275
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
But if I recall, Mr. Hanasaki
was already married, wasn't he?

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
Perhaps he wanted an affair?

277
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,200
That was why I said no every time.

278
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,700
I thought he was half-kidding when he said it.

279
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,300
- I see.
- What were you doing during the incident?

280
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,500
Mr. Hanasaki was wearing
glow-in-the-dark glasses,

281
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,200
and after I commented on it,

282
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,800
he ate the cake that was brought in.

283
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,400
After that, he stood up all of a sudden
and fell to the floor.

284
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,400
I didn't get up from my seat
until the lights were on again.

285
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,200
You didn't do anything
aside from eating the cake, correct?

286
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,900
The hall was dim

287
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,000
because the projector
was turned on to show pictures.

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,200
And the strawberry on top of my cake
dropped onto the table.

289
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
I saw that, too.

290
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,500
Remi said the three-second rule applied,

291
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,000
so she ate the strawberry in one bite.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,300
Three... three-second rule?

293
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't add unnecessary details!

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,400
Sorry.

295
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,800
So, Yumi, were you next to
your sister the entire time

296
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,100
during the incident?

297
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,200
Yes. I love cakes,
so I finished mine quickly.

298
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,300
Then, I thought about going to the toilet.

299
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,500
But I heard Mr. Hanasaki groaning
and the sound of him falling.

300
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,000
And there was no one rushing to his side?

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,600
No one. It was pitch black, after all.

302
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,100
There was also a commotion
over the wine bottle that broke nearby.

303
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,300
You weren't really close to the victim, I presume?

304
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,600
No. He tried to ask me out a few times as well,

305
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
- but I also turned him down.
- You, too?

306
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
Yes.

307
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,850
I often met Mr. Hanasaki while on the job.

308
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,900
After all, he was the hair and make-up artist
for the model I represent.

309
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,000
Have you encountered any trouble
with the victim, then?

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,400
She mentioned the problem with him earlier,

311
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,600
but he was accomplished
and well-known otherwise.

312
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Instead of prioritising Miss Sekizawa,

313
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,700
he had a lot of demands.

314
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,400
What were the demands?

315
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,200
He wanted to know her favourite flowers
or her favourite foods.

316
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,300
This time, he wanted to sit next to her,
so we arranged it.

317
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,100
So, what did you do during the incident?

318
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,200
My phone was ringing,

319
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,700
so I stood up from my seat
before eating the cake.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,500
And to prove it,
my cake is still untouched at the table.

321
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,600
So I see.

322
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,900
And during my call, Mr. Hanasaki fell,

323
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,100
the lights went on,
and you policemen came here.

324
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,300
I haven't had the chance to return to my seat

325
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,700
since I left it to take my call.

326
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Yes, I was the one who baked the cake.

327
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,400
It was for Remi's birthday.

328
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,500
We were classmates
in middle and high school.

329
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,100
So I asked the chef
if I could bake the cake, and I did.

330
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,800
You also cut the cake
and gave the slices to guests, is that correct?

331
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,400
Yes. I placed a strawberry on top of each slice.

332
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
Remi loves strawberries, so I had to.

333
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,300
Are you acquainted with the victim?

334
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,400
No, today is the day I first met him.

335
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,000
I heard from Yumi
that Remi was bothered by him

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,600
asking her out so often.

337
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,300
What were you doing
at the time of the incident?

338
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,600
It suddenly got dark
while I was cutting the cake,

339
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,200
so I held on to the cake cart
until the lights were on again.

340
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,850
So that the cart wouldn't fall
if anyone were to collide with it.

341
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,100
That aside,

342
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,700
wouldn't it be more efficient
if you checked our belongings?

343
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,200
What do you mean by that?

344
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
I'm talking about the marker.

345
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,400
The culprit wrote those words
on Mr. Hanasaki's forehead,

346
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
so they must have the marker on them right now.

347
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,300
Of course, I do not have one myself.

348
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,300
Then, please allow me to check you.

349
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,400
He certainly doesn't have one.

350
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,600
Well, then. How about you, Mr. Manager?

351
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
Yes.

352
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Miss Sekizawa usually
has a permanent marker in her bag

353
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,700
in case she needs to sign autographs.

354
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,600
That one can't be used anymore, though.

355
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,650
You're right.

356
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
The bag has an acrid smell inside.

357
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,900
Did you deliberately uncap the marker

358
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,400
so that it wouldn't work anymore
after the incident?

359
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,100
No, Miss Sekizawa tried to
sign that girl's book

360
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,300
before the party started,

361
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,800
but the marker didn't work.

362
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,300
Was that true?

363
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Yes, sir.

364
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,900
Did you not get your book signed, then?

365
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,200
No. Yumi had a spare permanent marker,

366
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,100
so Remi used that to sign my book.

367
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,300
So, Remi, do you have the marker
that was used to sign the book?

368
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,000
- No! This has to be a mistake!
- Well... no...

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
There's no way
Miss Sekizawa would murder anyone!

370
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,800
I returned the marker to my little sister.

371
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,500
Yes. It is in my bag.

372
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,400
But it wasn't me!

373
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,100
I haven't killed anyone! Please believe me!

374
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,600
Sera, you have to do something!

375
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,300
Even if you say so...

376
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,300
It's from mum!

377
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,800
Sorry, but I have to take this call.

378
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,200
Goodness.

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Hello?

380
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
How is it? Do you think
you can get the antidote?

381
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,100
No, someone was poisoned to death at the party,

382
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
so this really isn't the time.

383
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,300
I'll call you back later!

384
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,700
Poison. Someone was poisoned to death...

385
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Aren't you late?

386
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,100
Tsutomu.

387
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Sorry, Mary.

388
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,600
It has been such a long time

389
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,200
that I couldn't recall
where our usual meeting place was.

390
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
I'd completely forgotten that

391
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,900
it was on the railings of Vauxhall Bridge,

392
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,100
right in front of the MI6 headquarters.

393
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,300
So?

394
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,700
Did you figure out who murdered Koji Haneda?

395
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,850
No.

396
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,300
The only thing I found was that
the organisation was enormous.

397
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,400
They had their eyes on me,
so I was desperate to get away from them.

398
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,000
So, why didn't you contact me
for more than a decade?

399
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,500
Didn't I tell you when we happened to
see each other in town before?

400
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,100
I suffered a serious injury to the head

401
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
when I was running away from them.

402
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,500
I had amnesia for a long time
and wandered the town.

403
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,400
My memories finally returned
when I saw you again,

404
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,000
and I was able to return to
work for MI6 within a year.

405
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Enough about that.

406
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Did you come here with our sons?

407
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,500
No.

408
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm here with our daughter.

409
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,100
Daughter?

410
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,400
So, you still don't remember that

411
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
you held our daughter in your arms.

412
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,000
Oh, her.

413
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,700
How old is she now?

414
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,900
What's wrong, Mary?

415
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,800
Why are you crying?

416
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,300
When I parted ways with Tsutomu,

417
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,400
I was still pregnant with my daughter!

418
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,100
Who are you?

419
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,100
That's right.

420
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm not Tsutomu Akai.

421
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,900
I'm the woman who's about to
poison you to death with this capsule.

422
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,100
Yumi was the only person
who had a working marker.

423
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,900
It's no wonder
she would be suspected the most.

424
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,800
But whoever poisoned the victim
left his or her seat.

425
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,700
Does anyone have an idea
who would have a grudge

426
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
against the victim?

427
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,500
- No.
- There are too many.

428
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,400
He often complained.

429
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,900
I see.

430
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,800
Next Conan,

431
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,900
"A Birthday Party
with Divine Punishment (Part 2)"

432
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,700
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,000
"A permanent marker"

434
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,100
What did you say?

435
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,700
It was "a permanent marker", wasn't it?

436
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,600
Ran was right.
