1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:01,882
Connected!

2
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:05,182
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:06,882
Eisuke Hondo is somewhat a suspicious character.

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,082
The mysterious case that occurred at the Teimusu River!

5
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:09,582
Something has begun to move!

6
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:10,982
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:12,382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,082
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:59,859
"Haido Central Hospital"

10
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,759
Rena Mizunashi hasn't regained consciousness yet?

11
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,659
No.

12
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,559
Memory loss due to exterior injuries

13
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:15,659
usually improve in about a month.

14
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,159
But I was told by the doctor in charge,

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,559
that if this continues on for more than two months,

16
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,859
it may take even longer.

17
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:24,959
That's bad.

18
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,659
The longer this keeps on,

19
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:31,059
the higher the chance of them finding this place.

20
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,459
I think we should move her to a different hospital after all.

21
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,659
Maybe even to a hospital in the States if we have to.

22
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,459
No.

23
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,159
Doing so will only make things more conspicuous,

24
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,159
and we'd be doing exactly what they want us to do.

25
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,159
But...

26
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,159
Well, if that happens, we can take things from there.

27
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,759
And I don't think that there'd be a better bait to fish them with.

28
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,559
Bait?

29
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,259
By the way,

30
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,359
did you get anything on the personal history of Rena Mizunashi?

31
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:06,959
Actually, everything she said on and to Nichiuri TV was fabricated.

32
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,459
And there is no way of knowing where she was born or raised.

33
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:18,159
Which means we can't even tell if she has a family or not.

34
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,559
I'm pretty sure

35
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:24,459
that her crazy name, Rena Mizunashi, is also an alias anyway.

36
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,459
Crazy name?

37
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,459
Mizunashi is zero.

38
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,159
Rena equals zero and seven.

39
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,859
It's 007.

40
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,259
Get it?

41
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,259
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: The Little Witness"

42
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,559
But...

43
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,059
It may seem that way to you,

44
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:59,759
but it was only because your husband asked me to do it.

45
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,359
I'm home!

46
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:05,959
You should talk to your husband about it.

47
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,459
Is that right?

48
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,159
You ruthless rat!

49
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,059
Who was that on the phone?

50
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,859
A man asked me to investigate on his wife's affair, so I did.

51
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,259
And that was his wife on the line just now.

52
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,959
She said, "Thanks to you, I ended up getting a divorce.

53
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,659
Just what are you going to do about it?"

54
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:31,359
And she's the one that's having the affair.

55
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,759
Gosh.

56
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,259
I really wish I were James Bond or something.

57
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,459
Huh? Why?

58
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,259
What do you mean?

59
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,459
Because he gets to wear expensive brand name clothes.

60
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,959
He gets to ride super luxurious cars equipped with high tech devices

61
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,959
and conduct investigations in glamour.

62
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,359
On the other hand,

63
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,859
I work wearing the only suit I have and rent this car.

64
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:16,159
I was sneakily taking pictures of her having affairs, you know.

65
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:31,159
Moreover, no matter where he goes,

66
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:34,259
women are head over heels over him.

67
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,459
On the contrary, I get yelled at by a middle-aged woman.

68
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,259
I mean, how different can things get?

69
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,859
This coffee tastes good!

70
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,959
Is this some brand name coffee or something?

71
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,759
Nope.

72
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,559
It's drip type coffee that just came out the other day.

73
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,859
I just got it at the supermarket.

74
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:55,459
It said that if I collect enough points,

75
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,659
I would be able to get a cute coffee pot so I went out and bought it.

76
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,359
So, drip type coffee is what suits me best?

77
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,059
Oh, come on.

78
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,559
-If you want to complain, you don't have to drink it! -Hot!

79
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,259
That's hot...

80
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,959
You're...

81
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,059
Eisuke Hondo.

82
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:23,059
Hello.

83
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,759
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

84
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,159
Did you get burnt?

85
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,859
No, I'm fine!

86
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:31,859
I'm the one to blame for just standing there doing nothing.

87
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,059
And what brings you here?

88
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,059
I happened to run into him at the supermarket and brought him here.

89
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:42,759
Detective Mouri, you said I could come over whenever I wanted.

90
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,759
I guess I did.

91
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,359
Let me help you!

92
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,859
I'll take your calls or do whatever!

93
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,259
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

94
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,959
Hello? Hello?

95
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,359
Hey.

96
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,959
Huh? That's strange.

97
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,959
They hung up.

98
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,259
I mean, you went ahead and hung it up yourself!

99
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,259
Listen, don't touch anything!

100
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,559
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,159
I didn't even notice

102
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,959
-that he was in this room. -I'll go bring a towel.

103
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,559
Don't tell me that he deliberately erased his presence?

104
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,559
Or...

105
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,259
All right.

106
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,859
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there.

107
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,759
It's okay.

108
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,459
Or maybe he just have a very flimsy sense of presence.

109
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:53,359
Detectives sure don't have much to do, do they?

110
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,459
Yeah.

111
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,659
Might be different if somebody hadn't hung up on a client.

112
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,459
Huh? This comic is not going to be issued next week.

113
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,659
Too bad. I wanted to know how this story was going to continue.

114
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,659
It says that they're taking a rest because of an interview,

115
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,959
so I guess it can't be helped.

116
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,459
But this could require investigation as well, right?

117
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,059
Huh? Why?

118
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,159
Because although it's written that there will be an interview,

119
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,359
you never know, right?

120
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,959
It could be that the writer fled because he got sick of the job.

121
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,859
Or he could've come down with a cold that he's unable to write.

122
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:29,959
Or it could be

123
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,459
that the writer's been kidnapped and is being confined somewhere?

124
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:36,159
No, that couldn't be.

125
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,159
Remember the actor six months ago?

126
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,559
He said he was recharging himself and stayed away for some time.

127
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,559
He turned out to be actually sick.

128
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,359
There was someone recently, too.

129
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,759
Let's see...

130
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,459
You know, they were on TV a lot,

131
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,059
but is taking a rest and now they don't appear anymore.

132
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,559
I get it! Roku Itagaki!

133
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,059
Huh?

134
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,159
You know,

135
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,559
the musician that made a major debut last year and hit the scenes.

136
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,559
Isn't he the one you're talking about?

137
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,759
Yes, well...

138
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,959
Just as I thought.

139
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,559
Sonoko also mentioned about it.

140
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,159
It's been less than a year since he's debuted

141
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,859
and he's already taking time off to recharge himself,

142
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,459
so something is bound to have happened.

143
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:23,559
Like so.

144
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,259
Was Sonoko his fan or something?

145
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,159
Yeah. From the time he was in an indies band.

146
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,659
He probably got rich,

147
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,559
so he is fooling around with some ladies somewhere.

148
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,659
Just like 007.

149
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,559
That man was killed.

150
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,359
I saw him being thrown off a bridge!

151
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,959
I see.

152
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,559
So Takumi got excited

153
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,759
after hearing the CD of Roku Itagaki playing on a TV commercial?

154
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,659
Takumi has been telling you that, right?

155
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,159
Yes.

156
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,759
He said, "Daddy, this man with the saw died."

157
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,159
Saw?

158
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,659
His head looks like a saw.

159
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:13,659
I guess it's because of his silver haircut, so it does looked like it.

160
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:18,359
But there was no such news on TV or in the papers.

161
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,859
I didn't believe him at first,

162
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:24,659
but I heard that Mr. Itagaki suddenly took time off from work.

163
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,059
I got kind of worried

164
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,359
and decided to come talk it over with you, Detective Mouri.

165
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,359
I actually tried calling you before coming,

166
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:35,759
but for some reason, the phone was cut.

167
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,759
Oh, no.

168
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,759
Hey.

169
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,759
Takumi, do you know at which bridge you saw it?

170
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,359
I saw it the other day.

171
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,659
I don't know where, though.

172
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,259
I heard the sound of fireworks.

173
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,459
If it was the other day,

174
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,159
isn't it the fireworks that were shot up at the beginning of the New Year?

175
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,759
Mr. Hashiratani, do you remember where Takumi was back then?

176
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,659
Yes. I think it was in my car on the way to visit a shrine.

177
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,259
We were in a traffic jam at the time.

178
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,759
I actually got pretty tired and was dozing off here and there.

179
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,459
So I don't remember which bridge we were crossing

180
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,959
when we heard the fireworks.

181
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,659
Can you tell us more in detail about what happened back then?

182
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:23,659
Let's see...

183
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:29,159
He had a big bag beside him and kept looking at the river.

184
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,359
But he suddenly got up, picked the bag up

185
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,959
and threw the bag down over the bridge.

186
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,959
Then, Mr. Itagaki was in that bag.

187
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,259
But how did you know Mr. Itagaki was in the bag?

188
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,159
I saw him before the bag was dropped.

189
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,159
It was sticking out of the bag.

190
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,959
There was a lot of blood.

191
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,959
The saw headed man's face.

192
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,968
I saw it!

193
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:09,868
That can't be.

194
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,768
If something like that were carried around,

195
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:14,168
somebody is bound to notice it.

196
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,568
But it was dark, so I had to take a good look.

197
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,868
It was hard to tell.

198
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,568
Then are you saying

199
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:23,368
that something you had to take a good look at to make out,

200
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,468
could only be seen by you?

201
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,668
But it happened so fast!

202
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:32,568
His head just popped out of the bag.

203
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:36,168
What did the man do after he threw the bag down?

204
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:39,868
He took out stuff from his clothes and dropped them.

205
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:42,468
I couldn't really see because his body was in the way.

206
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:45,568
Then he started looking for something,

207
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:47,668
touching his clothes here and there.

208
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:50,268
Touching his clothes here and there?

209
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,468
Before he started looking for something,

210
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:52,868
did he put something in his mouth?

211
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:56,168
Yes, he did.

212
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:57,868
I see. It was a cigarette.

213
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,568
He had a cigarette in his mouth.

214
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,068
Then he must've been looking for a lighter.

215
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:06,468
And did he found the lighter?

216
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,968
Yes. After he lit the cigarette, he threw that away, too.

217
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,468
Did he stay there for a while then?

218
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:13,668
Nope.

219
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,168
He got in a car that was nearby and left right away.

220
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:20,368
Do you remember what he looked like, or what kind of car it was?

221
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:23,168
The car was a dark colour.

222
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,268
But as for his face, since he was wearing a cap...

223
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,068
But he had a drawing on his arm.

224
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,768
What? You saw a drawing?

225
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,368
A drawing of a strange nail.

226
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,268
A drawing of a strange nail?

227
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:42,668
That's right!

228
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:45,768
Near the car that I was riding back then,

229
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:49,968
I saw a shiny hammer that was this big!

230
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,768
A shiny hammer?

231
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,268
Yes.

232
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,368
A saw,

233
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,768
a nail and a hammer?

234
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,168
Is this brat playing games with us?

235
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,268
Mr. Mouri?

236
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:07,968
Well...

237
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:11,368
A boy like you shouldn't tease adults, okay?

238
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:24,968
Takumi. Was that your name?

239
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:25,968
Yes.

240
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:32,268
You're lying, aren't you?

241
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,668
No, I'm not.

242
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:35,068
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:14:58,768 --> 00:14:59,768
My chance.

244
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,368
Excuse...

245
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,468
If I remove the transmitter and listening device now...

246
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,468
All right, I've got it!

247
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,068
Sonny.

248
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:56,968
Don't tell me you followed me here?

249
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:01,968
Of course not.

250
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,168
It's just a coincidence.

251
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,368
I see.

252
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:16,268
Thank you.

253
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,968
Thanks for picking up my shoe.

254
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,968
Really, thank you so much.

255
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,268
Takumi.

256
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:56,968
I guess he's not lying.

257
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,568
Huh?

258
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,468
He's got to be.

259
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:03,468
Four days have already gone by since he saw it happen, you know.

260
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:07,168
If it's true, the body should've been found by now,

261
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,768
and there would be news about it.

262
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:13,168
We interrupt this program to report special news that just came in.

263
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:17,368
Today at dawn, the body of a man that was found in Teimusu River

264
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,968
was confirmed by the bereaved family to be

265
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:22,168
"Roku Itagaki (22)" -Mr. Roku Itagaki himself.

266
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:29,768
The body was found shoved into a bag

267
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:30,868
and on his head,

268
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:34,668
there were several traces of assault including those that were fatal.

269
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:37,468
Therefore, the police are investigating the case

270
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:39,168
as murder through a grudge.

271
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,468
It was for real.

272
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:44,668
This means that

273
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,668
my son saying that he saw someone throw the bag

274
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:51,668
with Mr. Itagaki's body inside it over the bridge...

275
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:53,768
It really happened, didn't it?

276
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,768
Of course! I'm not lying!

277
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,868
Then shouldn't we report this to the police right away?

278
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,468
That's right.

279
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:04,468
This boy is an important witness.

280
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:09,668
But he says that Roku Itagaki's got a saw head

281
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:13,268
and that the killer had a drawing of a nail on his arm.

282
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:16,968
He goes on to say,

283
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:18,968
when he saw all that near the car he was riding,

284
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:23,268
he saw a big shiny hammer.

285
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,568
I don't think the police will believe what this boy is saying at all.

286
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:32,668
Moreover, he doesn't even know where the bridge the body was dropped from.

287
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:35,668
Then why don't we take Takumi in the car

288
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:37,568
and replay that entire day?

289
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:39,468
We may just come up with something.

290
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,268
Besides, we already know that it's the Teimusu River.

291
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,768
That's right.

292
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:48,268
He witnessed it on a bridge on the way to the shrine on New Year's day.

293
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:52,768
Mr. Hashiratani, do you at least remember what road you took that day?

294
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,668
Yes, sort of.

295
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,468
But you're fantastic, Eisuke!

296
00:18:57,468 --> 00:19:00,368
I mean, you could tell whether he was telling the truth or not

297
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,468
just by looking at his face.

298
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:05,568
Well, it's really no big deal.

299
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:10,068
I just copied what my dad used to do when I was a child.

300
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:12,268
It's similar to a magic trick.

301
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,868
And?

302
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,268
Which way did you turn at this intersection?

303
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:25,568
If we make a right, it's Haido Big Bridge.

304
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:28,668
If we go straight, we come out to Haido Central Bridge.

305
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,868
If we make a left, we come out to New Haido Bridge.

306
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,068
Yes.

307
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:37,368
I'm sure it was the nearest street in the middle.

308
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:40,768
Then it's Haido Central Bridge?

309
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:41,768
But...

310
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:50,068
I took a right there to avoid traffic.

311
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:52,168
They usually have checkpoints for drunk driving at the end of the year.

312
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,068
Then, it's Haido Big Bridge?

313
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,568
Oh, no.

314
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:59,668
There are a lot of traffic lights to the right, so I went left.

315
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:02,768
But it's the farthest road to take.

316
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,568
Come on, let's be a bit more specific.

317
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:08,768
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:12,368
I always take this road to work.

319
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:16,268
I took whichever road I felt like taking at the time.

320
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:19,968
So I don't really remember which road I took that day.

321
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,668
I mean...

322
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,568
Hey,

323
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:26,368
you said you remembered the way!

324
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,468
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,168
Dad!

326
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,868
It's all right.

327
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:36,068
Why don't we stop over at all three bridges in order?

328
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,168
That's right.

329
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,368
In order to cross the Teimusu River from here,

330
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:43,268
we're going to have to cross one of the three bridges anyway.

331
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:44,468
That's it.

332
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:45,668
Right, Conan?

333
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:49,968
Conan?

334
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,568
Yeah.

335
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:56,068
What's the matter? You're not your usual peppy self.

336
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,868
I'm just fine.

337
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:00,468
I'm fine.

338
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:04,568
Really? Okay then.

339
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:17,168
I just copied what my dad used to do when I was a child.

340
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:19,168
It's similar to a magic trick.

341
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,868
No.

342
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:24,568
It's no magic trick.

343
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:28,768
What he did a while ago,

344
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:32,168
is what that person did back then.

345
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:35,668
It is a way to detect lies by checking for irregularities in the pulse

346
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:39,968
and breathing as well as for dilation of the pupils.

347
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,568
Moreover, his actions are just like that person.

348
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,468
They're almost identical.

349
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,768
Just as I thought.

350
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,868
This guy...

351
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:53,868
He's connected to...

352
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:06,368
Eisuke Hondo.

353
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:10,068
You're...

354
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,968
And that person...

355
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,568
You're connected with that person.

356
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,068
Rena Mizunashi.

357
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:28,768
The woman called Kir

358
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:31,068
of the Black Organization!

359
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:04,768
"Next Episode" -Look!

360
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:07,568
