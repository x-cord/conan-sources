1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,340
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,540
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,440
Those two have our complete attention.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,640
A wager between two adults causes the case to expand.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,853
Hey, Miwako!

9
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,053
An officer of the renowned Metropolitan Police Department

10
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:09,153
First Investigation Division is lying around during the day

11
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:12,653
with her mouth full of tangerines while watching TV.

12
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:13,853
Give me a break.

13
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,753
It's my day off. It won't hurt to take it easy, will it?

14
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,653
Here, then.

15
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,353
Not again! Pictures of my marriage mate candidates.

16
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:29,153
If you've got time to be loafing around, you should look through them.

17
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:31,453
No way! I'm sick and tired of looking at pictures

18
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,153
because I've got to look at bloody pictures of autopsies

19
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,953
all the time.

20
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:41,453
How did you ever end up turning into such a tomboy?

21
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:44,953
It's all my fault.

22
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,153
I raised you by giving you too much freedom.

23
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:51,453
I couldn't possibly face up to your father who died on duty

24
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:53,853
and is watching over us from the heavens.

25
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,453
Okay, then.

26
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:57,853
But I'm just merely going to meet them. That's all.

27
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:00,853
Oh, my! Just as would be expected of my daughter.

28
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,153
You have the same taste as I when it comes to men.

29
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:13,753
"Love Story At Police Headquarters 4 (Part 1)"

30
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,653
What? Officer Sato is going to meet

31
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:17,853
a marriage mate candidate?

32
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,053
Right!

33
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:21,353
I'm sure that Miwako is all dressed up by now

34
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:24,453
and are meeting up with that man.

35
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,553
Just who is that man?

36
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:31,453
Miwako doesn't know either.

37
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,953
Because she told me she chose the picture of her would-be-mate

38
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,953
without even looking inside the envelope.

39
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,053
No way!

40
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,753
You mean she's meeting a man

41
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,253
she doesn't even know the looks of?

42
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,353
No problem, though!

43
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:44,053
He's a man that decided to meet a woman officer

44
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:46,353
who is in active duty, right?

45
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:47,753
I'm sure he's a very independent and reliable,

46
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:50,153
square middle aged man.

00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,953
"Japanese Restaurant Minatorou"

48
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,253
Hey, hey!

49
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:56,853
10 minutes have already gone by

50
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,153
since the promised time of meeting!

51
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:00,953
A man who has the nerve to keep a lady waiting

52
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:03,753
couldn't be worth much anyway!

53
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,753
I'm leaving.

54
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,953
It's not big deal, he's only 10 minutes late.

55
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,853
Ms. Sato?

56
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:13,353
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

57
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,953
I am Isokichi Kamoi,

58
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:19,153
please remember me from here on after.

59
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:21,653
What's this?

60
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,953
Is this old man supposed to be my marriage candidate?

61
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:27,753
No! He's the butler!

62
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,953
Well, since this meeting popped up so suddenly...

63
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:33,553
My master and his wife are on a trip abroad,

64
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:37,953
so sire asked to come along in their place.

65
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,653
Sire?

66
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,053
Hi, I'm so sorry.

67
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:46,053
I took a while to choose flowers that would suit you, Ms. Sato.

68
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,253
Oh, no.

69
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,453
I shouldn't call you Ms. Sato today, but rather...

70
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:55,353
would it be all right for me to call you Miwako?

71
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:57,953
Shiratori?

72
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:00,453
Long time no see, Mother.

73
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,453
Hello.

74
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:05,253
What? Why?

75
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,053
Just what are you talking about?

76
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,153
You chose him yourself, didn't you?

77
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,353
-Huh? -Being attracted to a police officer,

78
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,153
no doubt you're my daughter after all.

79
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,853
You mean no one in the First Investigation Division

80
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:17,653
knows about her meeting today?

81
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:19,453
Does that mean even Officer Takagi doesn't know about it, too?

82
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,453
No.

83
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,453
She said that she would never agree to going out with the man anyway,

84
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:26,053
and is embarrassed, so she was keeping it a secret.

85
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:29,353
Besides, Miwako is quite popular with the guys

86
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:31,253
that if the word goes out, it may cause a commotion.

87
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,753
But...

88
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,453
what if the man she is seeing wants to marry her?

89
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,853
No problem! Because it's all worked out

90
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:42,553
that she'll get out of there when the time is right.

91
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:45,153
Nobody would ever want to marry a woman

92
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:46,953
who splits the scene saying

93
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:49,353
that she has to go cover a case, right?

94
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:52,453
But who's going to do that?

95
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:55,753
You silly thing. Who else but Officer Takagi?

96
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,353
I'm going to mail him on his phone with the message,

97
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:58,953
"Miwako is in trouble!"

98
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:01,953
And say that a criminal case has come up

99
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,453
and take her away from where she is.

100
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:06,753
I'm sure that he'll going bursting in with a face

101
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:08,153
that you've never seen before.

102
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:09,353
You witch.

103
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:10,653
He may just confess how he feels for her

104
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:11,853
if situation pushes him to do so.

105
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,153
Hey, why don't we go there too?

106
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:16,153
But it's pretty far from here.

107
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,053
Why don't you give us a lift there, Officer Yumi?

108
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:20,653
I can't because I'm still on duty.

109
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,553
What are you all doing here?

110
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,453
Dr. Araide!

111
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,853
Lucky!

112
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,253
Huh?

113
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:35,753
What an honor.

114
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,553
To think that you chose me

115
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,553
from among the number of candidates that you have.

116
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:43,553
So, like I've been saying it was sheer coincidence!

117
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:44,953
The picture that I chose without even looking at

118
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:47,053
happened to be you.

119
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,253
Oh, Miwako.

120
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,853
You're saying something like that just to hide your embarrassment.

121
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:54,353
I rather prefer that it was a coincidence.

122
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:55,353
Because it would mean

123
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,653
that your beautiful fingers were guided

124
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,653
to my picture by some work of God.

125
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,553
I feel that it was a work of fate.

126
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,953
That's right.

127
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:09,353
Splendid, Sire!

128
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,853
I can't possibly tell him

129
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:13,553
that I picked his picture up with my toes.

130
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:17,453
I wonder if Yumi's really going to carry out the planned.

131
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:21,253
I'll send my kid brother over, so hang in there.

132
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,453
She promised me by saying so.

133
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,353
I wonder who she means by kid brother?

134
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:31,553
Are you all right, Officer Takagi?

135
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:33,553
You've been sneezing quite a bit.

136
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,753
Hold on.

137
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:39,853
Yes, Takagi here.

138
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:41,453
Oh, Officer Takagi?

139
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:42,853
Did you read the mail I sent you?

140
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,753
Mail?

141
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,053
Robber!

142
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,753
Someone, please catch him!

143
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,553
Let's go after him, Officer Chiba!

144
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,353
Yes, sir!

145
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,353
Hello, Officer Takagi?

146
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:58,053
Hey, are you listening?

147
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,153
Hey, Officer Takagi!

148
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:02,753
Excuse me, we're the police.

149
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,253
Please let us through!

150
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,153
Oh, there he is! That's him!

151
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,153
He went into the alley!

152
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,353
Don't let him get away!

153
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:22,553
Are you all right, Mister?

154
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,853
Did you see someone wearing a helmet?

155
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,853
The guy rammed into me

156
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,353
and ran towards the restroom of the park.

157
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,153
Officer Takagi!

158
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:46,853
There's a helmet, a coat, a bag and gloves.

159
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,153
There's no doubt about it,

160
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,253
the man who robbed the convenience store is inside the restroom.

161
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:55,153
Police! There's no use trying to flee any further!

162
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,053
Come out quietly!

163
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,353
"Hiroshi Zama (21)" -Hey, what's with all the fuss?

164
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:09,753
"Eiko Koshimizu (28)" -What do you want?

165
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:14,253
"Yasuo Kamieda (32)" -What would the police want to with me?

166
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,953
There's three people?

167
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:22,253
These are the three people who were using the restroom

168
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,453
Well?

169
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:26,853
Can you make out who bumped into you?

170
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,253
Not really.

171
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:31,853
Because my glasses fell off when the person bumped into me,

172
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:35,253
so I couldn't see very well since my vision was blurred.

173
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,953
Any little thing will do!

174
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,953
Please tell me what you remember!

175
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,353
Well, the person was taller than me.

176
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:47,353
She was a girl wearing blue clothes under her coat!

177
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,453
A girl?

178
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:51,553
Ms. Koshimizu is the only woman,

179
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:53,753
but the clothes she's wearing is black.

180
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:57,553
What am I supposed to do? That's all I remember!

181
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:02,753
Hey! I don't have any idea what's going on, but...

182
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:04,253
If we have nothing to do with what's going on,

183
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,053
can we head on home?

184
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,153
I've got other commitments after this.

185
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,553
Please wait!

186
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:12,853
You may leave

187
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:15,753
only after we finish questioning the other witnesses!

188
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,453
What?

189
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:22,053
Shiratori? Don't tell me that he's the one from the police department?

190
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:25,253
Yes, he's in the Tsuru Room together with Ms. Sato.

191
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:29,053
Which means that the man Officer Sato is meeting is...

192
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,853
Inspector Shiratori?

193
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:33,153
Would you like me to take them a message?

194
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:35,453
Oh, well...

195
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,553
We were asked by the two families

196
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,953
to bring them an interesting gift.

197
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:44,953
It's going to take some time to prepare,

198
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:47,853
so will you please let us use the room next to the Tsuru Room?

199
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:51,953
Yes, sure. It just so happens to be vacant.

200
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:54,153
Thank you, Miss!

201
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,453
Please wait a while, then.

202
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,353
I'm very sorry to trouble you.

203
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,853
That kid is pretty sharp.

204
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:06,753
Oh, my! How delicious!

205
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,853
We had our chef come over to cook for us here

206
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,153
so that you could taste the kind of meal

207
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,653
that we eat at the Shiratori residence,

208
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,053
and had him make these exquisite Japanese dishes!

209
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:20,053
Sire had informed us that Ms. Miwako doesn't like French cuisine.

210
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,853
Huh? Did you have food that you didn't like?

211
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:25,053
Hey, Miwako?

212
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,553
Oh, yes.

213
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,353
Excuse me!

214
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,753
Is there anyone who witnessed the robber

215
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:39,753
in this convenience store a while ago?

216
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:41,053
Hey, Officer!

217
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:43,353
Wouldn't it be faster for you to ask the employee

218
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,053
of the convenience store?

219
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,853
We already did!

220
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,853
She said the robber stuck out a knife and showed a paper

221
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:50,453
that said "Give me the cash",

222
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:53,653
so the only thing she remembers is the helmet and coat.

223
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,753
What a hopeless case.

224
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,153
Darn it. Give me a break.

225
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,753
Excuse me, Officer.

226
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,753
Yes?

227
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:05,753
I can tell you how tall the robber was.

228
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:09,753
The person who was wearing a helmet and a coat, right?

229
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,853
I was watching through the window of the shop,

230
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:15,653
but I saw the person's head sticking out of the throng of people,

231
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,453
so I think the person's height was about 180 centimeters.

232
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:23,153
180 centimeters would be the tallest of the three,

233
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:24,553
Mr. Zama.

234
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:28,053
Come to think of it, he was wearing a blue sweater.

235
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:30,253
Oh, when the person's coat flipped over a bit,

236
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,353
I saw the color green!

237
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:33,953
Not blue?

238
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,253
No, I'm positive that it was green!

239
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,653
Were able to tell if it was a man or a woman?

240
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:43,453
With a height of 180 centimeters, wouldn't it be a man?

241
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:44,453
I see.

242
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,353
-Hey, Officer! -Yes?

243
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,153
That coffee shop owner

244
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:51,253
was bragging that he looked at the robber close.

245
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,153
Really?

246
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,853
Yes, I sure saw him!

247
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:58,653
The weirdo wearing a helmet who went running off!

248
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:04,453
It was when I was getting the samples of the lunch time menu out.

249
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:07,653
Can you give me the characteristics of that person?

250
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,053
I'm not sure if the person was a man or woman,

251
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,253
but the height was about 170 centimeters.

252
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:15,453
The person had a coat over black clothes.

253
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:19,953
Did you say black?

254
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:23,453
About 170 centimeters would be Mr. Kamieda.

255
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,353
But he is wearing green colored sweater.

256
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:29,353
Hey, what's going on?

257
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:41,461
Well, I guess we'll excuse ourselves for a while.

258
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,261
You two take your time and talk things out together.

259
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:48,961
Hey, Yumi.

260
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,561
When is she coming to pick me up?

261
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,361
I see.

262
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,161
So someone is supposed to come rescue

263
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:01,061
the beautiful princess from the hands of the evil prince?

264
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:02,861
Don't be ridiculous!

265
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,461
Just what are you talking about?

266
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,361
Okay, let's do this.

267
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,161
If Officer Takagi comes to get you,

268
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,961
I shall gracefully back down.

269
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:14,261
But if he chickens out and doesn't show up,

270
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,561
you will be my wife.

271
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,361
Huh? Why is it Officer Takagi?

272
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,061
Why not?

273
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,461
It's just a joke!

274
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:33,561
I just wanted to see you look troubled.

275
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:34,661
All right, then.

276
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,961
Huh?

277
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,361
It's a deal!

278
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:40,661
What?

279
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:44,361
Officer Takagi, just what is going on?

280
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:45,661
What do you mean by the testimonies

281
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:47,061
of the witnesses don't match?

282
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:50,561
There were three witnesses in all, weren't there?

283
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,861
Yes, all three of them

284
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:57,061
remembered the characteristics of the robber very well.

285
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:59,361
The old man who bumped into the robber said

286
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:02,361
that it was a woman wearing blue clothes.

287
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,861
The girl who was watching through the window of a shop said

288
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,861
that the robber was more than 180 centimeters tall,

289
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:10,361
wearing green clothes, and most probably a male.

290
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:12,361
And the owner of the coffee shop insisted that

291
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:16,361
the robber was about 170 centimeters and was wearing black clothes.

292
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,061
All three witnesses had something absolutely different to say.

293
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,261
Right.

294
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:27,261
I don't believe they told a lie.

295
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,961
I guess so.

296
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:35,961
Shall we begin interrogating the three suspects, then?

297
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,161
Yes.

298
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:43,261
What do you mean by it's a deal?

299
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:47,161
Are you sure you know what you're talking about?

300
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:49,461
Yes, I do.

301
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,861
If Officer Takagi comes here to get me,

302
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,461
then this meeting for possible marriage

303
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,561
is called off immediately, right?

304
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:59,061
If he doesn't show up, I marry you and become your wife.

305
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,861
Instead of waiting without a time limit,

306
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:04,861
how about we set the limit at sundown?

307
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:08,661
Hey, you've got to be joking, Officer Sato.

308
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,961
Things are starting to sound really interesting, right?

309
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:14,561
But what if Officer Takagi doesn't show up?

310
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,161
It could be that Officer Sato

311
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,261
is following the "Cinderella" story, you know.

312
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,861
Inspector Shiratori is after all the son of a tycoon

313
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,161
that attends most of the parties held at my house.

314
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,961
I thought that Officer Sato and Officer Takagi

315
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:29,061
was really getting along well though.

316
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:33,461
Well, she went as far as to say what she did.

317
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:36,461
So, I think she thinks that the odds are in her favor.

318
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,761
Okay. So, it's all right with you then?

319
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:42,761
Yes! I will not go back on my word!

320
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:49,761
That's right, it's Officer Takagi.

321
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,861
I'm sure that he's the one that's going to pick me up

322
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,961
that Yumi was talking about!

323
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:58,061
Yes, I'm sure that he'll come.

324
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:01,061
I'm sure?

325
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,861
Why?

326
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:13,461
My name is Yasuo Kamieda. I teach at a prep school.

327
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,761
I stopped over at that restroom

328
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:18,761
on my way to a book store nearby where I was planning to buy a book.

329
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,661
I'm Hiroshi Zama, a part-time worker.

330
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,961
I just happened to use that restroom

331
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,561
on my way back from band practice.

332
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:29,661
I'm Eiko Koshimizu. I work at an office.

333
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:32,961
I was taking a walk when I suddenly came down with a stomachache.

334
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,061
So I went to that restroom.

335
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:38,561
Now that I've said all I have to say, let me go!

336
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:40,661
It's already after 2:00!

337
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:45,461
Huh? You're wearing two wristwatches?

338
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:47,361
My boyfriend's abroad,

339
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,661
so I'm wearing a wristwatch showing the time of the country he's in.

340
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:53,261
It's not nice calling him at a ridiculous time, is it?

341
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,561
Back in middle school,

342
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:59,761
a teacher told me to wear two wristwatches, too.

343
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,061
Because I was always late for class.

344
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,561
Hey, mister! What's so funny?

345
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:09,061
Well, I always tell my students at prep school

346
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,961
to take off their watches during class,

347
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,861
so I just thought what a difference.

348
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,761
You mean the wristwatches of the students?

349
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:19,161
Yes, because I want them to concentrate on the lessons

350
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,461
without thinking of time.

351
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:24,061
I also removed clocks of the classroom

352
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,961
as thinking out other things to help them.

353
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:29,661
By the way, what about the band you just mentioned, Mr. Zama?

354
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:33,061
Oh, I'm playing in the band with my high school friends.

355
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,661
It's a visual type band!

356
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:37,761
When I play in the band, I dress like a woman.

357
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:40,261
I may not look it, but I get a lot of calls from my fans

358
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,661
and I'm pretty popular, too.

359
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,661
Oh, I see.

360
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,861
Oh, talking about phone calls,

361
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,961
there was a call for you from Officer Yumi a while ago.

362
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,461
She said for you to read the mail she sent you.

363
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:53,461
I'll bet she wants to go singing karaoke or something again.

364
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:55,961
Little does she know of the predicament I'm in.

365
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,761
A convenience store robbery?

366
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,061
Oh, no.

367
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:04,461
I just had something I wanted to ask Officer Takagi.

368
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:09,161
Please tell him to give it his best shot, Inspector Megure.

369
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:14,061
Hey, what's this about a convenience store robbery?

370
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:17,361
Wasn't Officer Takagi supposed to be checking on a case today?

371
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:20,361
After he finished checking on the case,

372
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:23,761
he seems to have run into the convenience store robbery case.

373
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:27,561
It seems he's already narrowed the suspects downto three people, though.

374
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:30,861
It seems the testimony of the witnesses are a bit various.

375
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:32,761
What do you mean various?

376
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:34,761
There's only one suspect, isn't there?

377
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:37,161
Well, I don't have the slightest idea.

378
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:40,161
Okay, I'll contact Officer Takagi myself, then.

379
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:45,961
It's against the rule for you to call him from your side.

380
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,661
It's much too disadvantageous for me.

381
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:51,161
Well, I'm sure everything will turn out all right.

382
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:54,561
He'll rush over here as soon as he arrests

383
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,561
the convenience store robber.

384
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,361
Or maybe you don't believe he will?

385
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:01,961
It's not like that.

386
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:04,861
Then again, if a police officer abandons the case

387
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,261
in the midst of an investigation,

388
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,861
and shows up in a place like this,

389
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,261
he'll have to go through disciplinary action

390
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,461
taken against him for violating duty regulations.

391
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,861
If I remember correctly,

392
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:16,561
he went through a pay cut once before, didn't he?

393
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:20,161
If he has the guts to show up here knowing

394
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:23,161
that he may have to undergo disciplinary action for the second time,

395
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:26,961
I'll admit that he's been a man about the whole thing.

396
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:33,461
The situation doesn't look too good, does it?

397
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:36,861
Oh, come on. We can't just do nothing!

398
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:39,061
Quiet.

399
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,361
I've got to go to the restroom.

400
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,261
Officer!

401
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,961
Just how long to you intend to keep us locked up in this car?

402
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,161
The sun's going to set!

403
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,261
Just a little while longer.

404
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:59,161
Hello, Officer Yumi? My hands are tied just yet and...

405
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:02,261
Hi, this is Shinichi Kudo.

406
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,361
What?

407
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:06,261
Conan asked me to give you a call.

408
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:08,761
What did Conan ask you to do?

409
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:12,361
Please check your cell phone mail

410
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:15,161
and take note of the situation that you're in now.

411
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:19,461
But the only mail I got today was from Officer Yumi.

412
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,361
"Miwako is in trouble!

413
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,061
Resue her from Minatoro where she is holding a marrige meeting."

414
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:29,261
Officer Sato is meeting her husband to be?

415
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,961
So, you haven't read the mail, have you?

416
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,461
But don't worry, and please calm down.

417
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,561
There's still a lot of time to go until sundown,

418
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:42,861
and the place she's meeting him is in the neighboring town, Haido-cho.

419
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:45,361
Sundown?

420
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:50,361
Officer Sato agreed to the terms that her proposed husband suggested.

421
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:56,161
If you don't solve the case by sundown and go to get her,

422
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:59,061
she's going to have to accept her partner's marriage proposal.

423
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:04,161
Please give me the details of the case.

424
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,661
Officer Takagi?

425
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:08,761
Officer Takagi, can you hear me?

426
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,161
Hey...

427
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:15,661
I see.

428
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:17,861
All three suspects that was testified

429
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:22,561
has totally different characteristics of the robber.

430
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:24,261
How interesting!

431
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,161
What do you mean by interesting, Kudo?

432
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:28,461
First of all,

433
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:33,461
go to that coffee shop and talk to Mr. Mamehara, the owner.

434
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,761
"Next Episode" -40 minutes left to sundown.

435
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,361
I've got to hurry. Otherwise, Officer Sato will...

436
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:16,361
If Officer Takagi doesn't make it in time and I win the bet,

437
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:19,461
as proof, please give me a kiss of pledge.

438
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,161
I see! So that's what it was!

439
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,561
Shall we get started...

440
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,961
with that pledge or whatever it is?

441
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,261
Next Conan,

442
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,182
"Love Story At Police Headquarters 4 (Part 2)"

443
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,979
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,279
"Wristwatch"

445
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,479
Officer Sato, just between us, tell me how you really feel.

446
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,479
Inspector Shiratori gets one point.
