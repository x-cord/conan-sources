1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:04,863
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,073
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:10,353
Today's stage is a clock manor!
The case's alarms all ring together!

4
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:12,313
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,193
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,773
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:59,656
"The Case of the Mysterious
Bandit Mansion (Part 1)."

8
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:11,056
"Dear Mori Kogoro.
I'm sorry for the sudden letter.

9
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:15,386
Getting directly to the point,
I would like you, the great detective,

10
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:20,406
to solve the mysteries concerning
strange events in my home.

11
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:25,716
It's actually an old mansion
given to me by my grandfather,

12
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:28,366
who passed away very recently.

13
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:33,006
Since moving in, strange events
have been occurring daily,

14
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:37,926
and I've even had the feeling
that I'm being watched lately.

15
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:42,676
I tried to figure it out on my own,
as I'm a simple mystery writer,

16
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:46,886
but seeing as I haven't been here
long and don't know the house well,

17
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:50,096
I figured I wouldn't discover
anything on my own,

18
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:53,236
which is why I've sent you this letter."

19
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:03,676
"On his deathbed, my grandfather
said the mansion was special,

20
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:06,676
which I find very strange now.

21
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:11,386
If you're interested,
please come before 10:30 a.m.

22
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:15,176
I look forward to hearing
from you. Nakamura Misao."

23
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,046
I'm coming, Misao-chan!

24
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:24,636
I've deduced that she's a lonely,
talented woman in her late 20s!

25
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:30,506
Are you sure? It sounded like some
glum guy in his early 30s to me.

26
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:36,686
How dumb! Why would I rent a car
and go there on a Sunday then?!

27
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:41,776
Couldn't you have told if it was
a man or a woman on the phone?

28
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:49,926
I didn't call. I'm gonna show
up and make an exciting entrance!

29
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:53,456
What do you want
to excite this person for?!

30
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:57,086
He's such a lost cause...

31
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:01,546
What do you think, Conan-kun?
Is it a man or a woman?

32
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:04,996
I don't know. The handwriting is nice...

33
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:09,126
Maybe it is a woman?

34
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:18,276
Dad! That's dangerous!

35
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:26,276
S-Sorry! I messed up!
I haven't done this in a while!

36
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,346
Forgive me, Misao-chan!

37
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,216
No one can forgive this!

38
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,886
I think I'll take the train back.

39
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:46,176
What're you talking about?
That was a pleasant family drive!

40
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,386
You call that pleasant?

41
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:53,726
Just look at this refreshing
sunlight coming through the leaves!

42
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:57,096
Doesn't it just relieve your mind?!

43
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,526
Yeah. I'm relieved we
actually made it to our destination.

44
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:12,676
Whadya think? This large mansion
is surrounded by trees and nature!

45
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:17,496
But... "It's so lonely for a single woman!"

46
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:24,216
"Misao-san! At long last,
your Mori Kogoro has arrived!"

47
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:29,386
I've recently started to
understand why Mom left you...

48
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,176
Yeah...

49
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:42,146
Yes?

50
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:49,026
Oh, Mori-san! You came!

51
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:51,986
Here, we can say hello inside!

52
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:54,716
Y-Yeah...

53
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,956
See! I told you!

54
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,536
Say, did you send this letter?

55
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:05,876
No, the person who wrote that
letter is my three-years-younger--

56
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:08,336
Your younger sister?!

57
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,046
My younger brother, Misao.

58
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,306
Hi, there!

59
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:15,516
Oh...

60
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:18,506
I'm the one who
inherited this mansion,

61
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,976
but it's so big that
I moved in with my brother.

62
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,936
What happened to your arm?

63
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:28,006
I hurt it while moving some shelves.

64
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:31,236
That's bad. Especially for a writer.

65
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:37,046
It's only a sprain. The doctor just
went overboard and wrapped it up.

66
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,436
Anyways, come inside!

67
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:45,596
What is it, Conan-kun?

68
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,176
Doesn't this seem strange?

69
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:53,636
There's a tiger on that pillar,
but not on this one.

70
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:57,096
It has weird holes instead...

71
00:06:57,386 --> 00:07:00,506
Maybe they planned to put
something there, but decided not to?

72
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,016
Hey.

73
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:04,236
Come in already.

74
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:05,546
Okay.

75
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:06,926
Let's go, Conan-kun.

76
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,616
Okay!

77
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,866
Wow! How cute!

78
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:21,326
What an amazing collection!

79
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:24,846
There are animals on almost
all the furniture and dishes!

80
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:28,636
Oh! Is this a seal?!

81
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:33,136
Ran-neechan. That's a walrus.

82
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:34,636
Really?

83
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,346
All this junk everywhere
makes the place stuffy...

84
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:45,016
Surprised? Our late grandfather
absolutely loved animals!

85
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:49,606
He always used to say
that animals that hunted to live

86
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:56,736
were much better than humans
who fool others out of sheer greed.

87
00:07:57,256 --> 00:08:02,706
Animals aside, there
sure are a lot of clocks here...

88
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:07,166
But of course.
Our grandfather was a clockmaker!

89
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:09,376
A clockmaker?

90
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,676
Yes. His name was Izubuchi Monjiro.

91
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:15,426
He made quite a name for himself;

92
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:20,546
"Monjiro's clocks last a lifetime,"
people came to say!

93
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,556
Then this digital
bunny clock was his, too?

94
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:28,266
No, our grandfather only
made screw-operated clocks.

95
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,606
He probably just
collected those ones for fun.

96
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:36,256
I see. There's a crack
on this digital clock.

97
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:40,536
He must've handled things
he didn't make without much care.

98
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,546
See? This one, too. And this one.

99
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:47,876
That's strange. He always
took great care of his things...

100
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:51,126
Doesn't this clock seem strange too?

101
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:54,586
It looks like something
used to be attached to it...

102
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:57,796
It probably came off when
he dropped it or something.

103
00:08:59,046 --> 00:08:59,756
Huh?

104
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,436
Is this a photo of Monjiro-san?

105
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:08,476
Yes! It's from quite a long time ago, though.

106
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:11,186
Who's the girl with him?

107
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:15,406
Oh, that's his friend's granddaughter.

108
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:20,366
He always used to take me
and my brother to the golf course.

109
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:24,076
Then this golf bag
was Monjiro-san's?

110
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:26,786
"Demon"?

111
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:35,756
You know, it's what they call
people who score over 100 in golf.

112
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,096
Our grandfather could
never improve his score,

113
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:40,216
so we gave him that as a joke present.

114
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:45,136
Say, wasn't "Demons"
the name of an old bandit gang?

115
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:51,396
You know, the gang that only
stole from bad companies and people!

116
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:57,356
Don't be dumb.
Those were the Goblins, not the Demons.

117
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,656
I'm sorry! I should've been helping!

118
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,326
Here it is again!

119
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:13,796
All the other cups have animals
on their handles, but not this one.

120
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:17,876
And it's been carefully
filed down afterward.

121
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:22,926
If the animal had fallen off,
it could've been easily glued back on.

122
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,466
So why?

123
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:25,726
Conan-kun.

124
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,256
Thanks.

125
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:30,466
I'll clean this up!

126
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,896
Oh, thanks...

127
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:37,856
So, could you tell me about these
strange happenings you spoke of?

128
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:40,696
Oh, you mean the clock.

129
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:42,406
Clock?

130
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,006
10:48... Perfect timing...

131
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:50,076
Come to the study.
I'll let you see for yourself.

132
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,926
Damn. It's stuck again.

133
00:10:57,926 --> 00:11:01,426
Hey, have you forgotten?
You gotta kick the bottom right part.

134
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,036
See?

135
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:07,386
Oh, right.

136
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:13,356
You leave the curtains shut,
even though it's so stifling in here?

137
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,316
It's like I mentioned in the letter.
It feels like someone's watching us.

138
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,526
So that's why.

139
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:29,596
There's a hole over here.

140
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:34,346
Oh, really? Well, this house
is old and falling apart.

141
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:39,676
Only a tool could've
made such a clean hole!

142
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:42,176
What in the world is it for?!

143
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,716
So, about this clock...

144
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:49,306
Oh, right. Let's see...
It's a cuckoo-clock...

145
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:50,876
Huh?

146
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,886
Isn't this it?

147
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,266
Oh, yes! That's it!

148
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,066
Geez...

149
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:03,526
Looks like an ordinary
cuckoo clock to me.

150
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,756
Is there something to it?

151
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:07,616
It rings at a certain time.

152
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:11,926
Of course it does.
It's a cuckoo clock.

153
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:14,706
No, it happens at a weird time.

154
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,466
Every 10:50 or so.

155
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:22,926
And something strange comes
out of it instead of a cuckoo.

156
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:25,216
Something strange?

157
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:26,386
Just watch!

158
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:28,596
Should be any time now!

159
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,046
Nothing's happening.

160
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:43,446
T-That's odd! It came out last time!

161
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:47,136
Are you sure it isn't just broken?

162
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:48,366
Of course it isn't!

163
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,826
Our grandfather's clocks
are known for never breaking!

164
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:55,786
This is ridiculous. I'm going home.

165
00:12:55,786 --> 00:13:00,136
W-Wait, Mori-san! There's another
strange thing that needs solving!

166
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:01,756
Please!

167
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,426
The VCR's timer has been set, too...

168
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:10,256
Let go! I told you, I'm leaving!

169
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,566
W-What is this?

170
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,696
It's crazy, Dad! All the clocks
in the house are ringing!

171
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,716
T-The entire house?!

172
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,996
Even the VCR is running!

173
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:43,206
What in the world is going on here?!

174
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,003
All the clocks in the house are ringing?!

175
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:02,503
What in the world is going on here?!

176
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,053
I-It stopped!

177
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,093
The video ran for only a minute, too.

178
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:14,863
But why?

179
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,223
What was that?!

180
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,743
A cat.

181
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:42,083
A big cat's taken up lodging in
the attic and we can't get rid of it.

182
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,083
Anyway, think you can solve
the mystery of the clocks

183
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,973
that all ring at the same time
every day at 11:00 a.m.?

184
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:54,683
I dunno. Maybe it's just one
of your grandfather's pranks?

185
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:56,953
But isn't it strange?

186
00:14:56,953 --> 00:15:01,153
I'd use all the clocks in the
house if I were going to pull a prank,

187
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:04,193
but it looks like only
the digital clocks rang.

188
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,113
Only the digital clocks?

189
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:06,913
Yeah.

190
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:13,283
I checked. That cuckoo clock and
this alarm clock were set to "off."

191
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,753
He's right! All the analog
clocks are set to "off"!

192
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:21,453
Sure you guys didn't turn them off?

193
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:26,713
No! We decided not to touch
anything until this mystery is solved!

194
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:30,553
It wasn't just the clocks.
This VCR was running, too.

195
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,293
VCR?

196
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:33,513
Yeah.

197
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:35,413
Now I see!

198
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:41,043
Monjiro-san must've had a TV show
he watched every day at 11:00!

199
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:43,103
That's why he set the alarms!

200
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,163
But don't you think
he set too many alarms?

201
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:49,033
The old guy didn't wake easily.

202
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:53,413
Anyways, one look at
the video and it'll all be clear!

203
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:55,323
Play

204
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:02,203
This TV isn't
connected to an antenna!

205
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:03,503
It would seem not.

206
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:08,463
Why would you need to wake up
if you had the recorder on a timer?!

207
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,873
So why is this video on a timer?

208
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:13,803
Huh?

209
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:16,893
Look here, at the numbers!

210
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,853
There's a weird crack after the zero!

211
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:24,563
This digital clock has a crack, too!

212
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:27,023
See! In the same spot!

213
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:30,083
Oh, so does this one...

214
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:30,993
A-And this one...

215
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:33,203
Come to think of it,

216
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:38,913
that digital clock in the living
room had a similar crack.

217
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:41,953
What is it, then?

218
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:49,633
Don't tell me this "110" was
left behind by Monjiro-san as...

219
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:51,343
...a code.

220
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,303
What?!

221
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,333
Maybe!

222
00:16:55,333 --> 00:17:01,583
If 110 is a code, it'd make sense
that only the digital clocks rang.

223
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,733
On an analog clock,
11:00 would just be 11 o'clock.

224
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,903
But what could 110 be?

225
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,313
110 is the emergency police number...

226
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,363
And when you think of the police...

227
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,583
Yes?

228
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,043
That's it!

229
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,713
Dogs!

230
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,673
The police have police dogs!

231
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:36,013
This "110" means we have
to find all the dogs in this house!

232
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:42,353
Alright! Let's split up and
gather every dog in the living room!

233
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:47,123
One of the dogs has
to be hiding something!

234
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:54,783
Collie, German Shepherd,
Siberian Husky, Tosa, Doberman...

235
00:17:55,703 --> 00:18:00,453
Dobermans are police dogs,
but there's nothing here.

236
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,083
Maybe it's the Dalmatian?!

237
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,793
Remember the movie about those dogs?!

238
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,503
That was "101."

239
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:12,123
There might still be some
other dogs. Keep looking.

240
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,463
Okay!

241
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:20,933
Dog, dog, dog...

242
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:25,533
The attic...

243
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:35,953
It's locked!

244
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:53,543
Now, now!
There's nothing in that room!

245
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:58,173
And these stairs are
dangerous! There's no handrail!

246
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,183
Now come downstairs with me!

247
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,553
B-B-But there was someone in there!

248
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,263
It's the cat!

249
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:10,483
I'm sure the kitty would
be sad if you hurt yourself.

250
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,833
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:17,263
Conan-kun. What do you say
we check the study again?

252
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:17,863
'Kay...

253
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:27,333
No, those were human eyes!
Why is he trying to hide it?!

254
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,603
Conan-kun!

255
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:40,163
Conan-kun. Anything
with a dog design. Got it?

256
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,223
Yeah.

257
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,183
It's strange. It's too strange!

258
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:48,393
There's gotta be
something to this mansion!

259
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:50,993
File 'Goblin'

260
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,753
"File 'Goblin'"...
File 'Goblin'

261
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:53,563
File 'Goblin'

262
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,153
You mean them?

263
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,333
Bandits of the Wind!!

264
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:02,543
It is! These are articles about
the Goblins, the Bandits of the Wind!
Bandits of the Wind!!

265
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:05,173
But why are these articles filed here?
Bandits of the Wind!!

266
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:06,163
Bandits of the Wind!!

267
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:12,083
The Goblins targeted corrupt
businessmen's safes and illicit deals!

268
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:17,043
Because they were so swift,
they were called the Bandits of the Wind

269
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:22,013
and they always left creepy
goblin figures wherever they struck.

270
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:27,373
The name "Goblin" refers to
the malicious European spirits

271
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,953
and familiars that would
take up residence in homes.

272
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,573
They possess a bizarre form.

273
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:38,833
They've Stopped!? Mystery of the Goblins

274
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,823
It's been ten years since the
Goblins ceased their activities.
They've Stopped!? Mystery of the Goblins

275
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,243
Oh, so no one's been caught yet?

276
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:53,463
"Estimated to Have Eight
Members!! Leader Named 'Demon'"...

277
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:55,413
Demon?

278
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:59,173
That was the name on the golf bag...

279
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:01,713
Could it be?

280
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:03,663
A mirror?

281
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:10,143
Huh? It's attached
to the desk! Why?

282
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,603
Say, there was a hole
in the wall behind me...

283
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:20,073
And right above it
is the cuckoo clock.

284
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:21,483
The hole in the wall.

285
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:24,443
The immobile mirror
facing the hole.

286
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:27,823
And the cuckoo clock opposite
it and above the hole...

287
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:39,333
Ran!

288
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:43,453
Ran! I'm coming!

289
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,913
What is it, Ran?!

290
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:49,263
T-There!

291
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:04,043
Demon figures...

292
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:08,953
Demons aren't animals! What are
such creepy things doing there?

293
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:14,663
Those aren't just demons.
They're goblins!

294
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:20,333
They're definitely what the Bandits
of the Wind used to leave behind!

295
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:24,493
But why three of them?!

296
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:30,003
Just what kind of mystery are
these three goblins hiding?!

297
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:11,683
Hey! Don't tell me those figures are...

298
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,483
What did you say?

299
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:15,563
Oh, nothing!

300
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:18,733
Ah.

301
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:23,523
Now I see what's going on here!

302
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:30,273
So that's it!

303
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:33,813
On the next Conan--

304
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:37,253
"The Case of the Mysterious
Bandit Mansion (Part 2)."
