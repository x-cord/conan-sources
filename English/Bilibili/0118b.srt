1
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:07,416
The victim is Okazaki Sumie-san, age 39.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,253
She was strangled to
death with a rope of some sort.

3
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:15,791
She appears to have been
stabbed after being strangled.

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,359
What time did you find the body?

5
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:20,863
Three or four minutes
before you arrived.

6
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:23,932
This bathroom
cleaner guy found her.

7
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:29,171
But why does the killer
stab their wallets every time?

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:34,643
You told this lady not to go outside,
but it looks like she died here.

9
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:41,850
Come to the Shinsai Bridge now
if you want to see some old friends.

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,653
1:08 pm.

11
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:50,559
See that? You're the
next to wind up like that.

12
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,530
1:10 pm.

13
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:58,434
There's no question that's the killer!

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,704
In other words,
the lady heard the first message

15
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,306
and went to the Shinsai Bridge.

16
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:07,976
Then, when she came back,
she heard the second message

17
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:10,546
and trembled in fear inside.

18
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:15,884
But what does "old friends" mean?

19
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,388
Could it refer to the
people who've been killed so far?

20
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,491
Detective Sakata.
There's a call from headquarters.

21
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,792
Oh, thanks.

22
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,763
Hey, Hattori. These answering
machine messages are strange.

23
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:29,665
How so?

24
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:31,967
The times and the
contents of the messages.

25
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:37,139
There were only two minutes
between the "come" message

26
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,608
and the "see that" message.

27
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,812
Does that mean the
killer was watching her?

28
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:47,783
Something's odd
about these four murders.

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,254
I get a bad feeling that
the killer is playing with us...

30
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:54,389
Bad feeling?

31
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,096
Kudo!

32
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,099
What?!

33
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,401
N-Nothing! Don't sweat it!

34
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:10,806
Yikes! I just remembered that
ominous dream from the other day!

35
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,514
So, Heiji-kun. Where to next?

36
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,484
Shall we visit Goshi-san's office?

37
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:25,687
Heiji-kun?

38
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,423
Oh, right.

39
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,727
These sure are strange cases.

40
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:35,464
There are no witnesses and it's
not clear how they're all connected,

41
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,633
yet we can ID
the victims easily enough.

42
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,668
Yeah, now that you mention it.

43
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:44,973
The victims' names were on the
news right after the first two killings.

44
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,509
That's only natural.

45
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:51,880
All four had their driver's
licenses in their stabbed wallets.

46
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,683
Driver's licenses? That's it!

47
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,653
Kadoma Driver's License Testing Ground

48
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:00,455
So all four have
clean driving records...

49
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:01,123
Yes.

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,061
I thought there might be a car connection.
Guess I was wrong again.

51
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:11,033
They also all got their licenses
different years at different places.

52
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:17,673
Hey... it says Okazaki learned
to drive in Hyogo and not Osaka.

53
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:18,473
So it does.

54
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,676
Why that far away?

55
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:25,681
Oh, that place is famous
for its cheap license school.

56
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,684
License school?! Does that mean--?!

57
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,520
...If you want to see some old friends.

58
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:34,356
There's her friends!

59
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:37,492
Do you have the number
for that place, Mister?

60
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:39,027
Yes.

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,534
Okazaki Sumie and Nishiguchi
Tayo shared a room at the school?!

62
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,269
Seriously?!

63
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,340
Alright! We're starting
to connect the four victims now!

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,476
But... isn't it strange?

65
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:58,046
Okazaki-san got
her license that same year,

66
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:01,917
but Nishiguchi-san
got his three years later.

67
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,221
Maybe he sucked at driving
and didn't graduate that year?

68
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,691
That's crazy!

69
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:11,927
You're really sure about that?!

70
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:13,895
Huh?! What is it?!

71
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:19,801
The others were at that
school twenty years ago, too!

72
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,672
The first victim,
Nagao Hidetoshi-san,

73
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:27,242
the third victim, Noyasu Kazuto-san,

74
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:30,912
and Assemblyman Goshi-san!

75
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:35,050
They were all at the same place!

76
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,185
What?!

77
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,621
And that's not all.

78
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:44,593
There was also a man
whose name is all too familiar now.

79
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,562
Familiar?! Who?!

80
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:52,501
Numabuchi. Numabuchi Kiichiro.

81
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,337
Numabuchi Kiichiro? You don't mean--!

82
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,473
The robber and murderer...

83
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:01,410
...who's on the run?!

84
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,312
Here it comes! The school photo!

85
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,886
No question about it!
It's Numabuchi!

86
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,356
The faces and names
of the other five match, too!

87
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,891
But this is strange!

88
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:20,328
August 23, 1978 graduates
- See? It says they all graduated then...

89
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:24,066
...but only Okazaki-san
went on to get her license.

90
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:29,805
Something happened at this
school twenty years ago. Something...

91
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:33,141
I see. Thanks.

92
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:37,245
None of the current staff know anything
that happened twenty years ago.

93
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:39,981
I figured as much.

94
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,952
Prefectural Nakanoshima Library
- But there had to have been some sort of incident

95
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:49,491
involving that training
ground twenty years ago.

96
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:54,196
Bingo! This is it!

97
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:57,432
Driving Instructor Dies in Accident Drunk Driving Suspected
- On that day twenty years ago when those six graduated,

98
00:05:57,432 --> 00:06:01,103
Driving Instructor Dies in Accident Drunk Driving Suspected
- one of the instructors died in a drunk driving accident!

99
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:05,640
His name was Inaba Tetsuji.
The strictest instructor at the school...

100
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:08,343
Hey, how does this sound to you?

101
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:13,515
Numabuchi, broke and in trouble,
decided to use the old incident

102
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:17,919
to blackmail the assemblyman
out of money but was refused.

103
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,423
So he killed off everyone
involved in the incident

104
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,091
and then repeated his threat.

105
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,661
That, or Goshi used
Numabuchi to kill off everyone

106
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:32,067
to keep the scandal from interfering
with his Diet member campaign.

107
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:35,170
Both sound plausible enough.

108
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,608
When Nagao-san and
Noyasu-san quit working for him,

109
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,244
they received a lot of severance pay.

110
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:48,884
Mention the instructor's death
and his companions back then,

111
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:52,087
and I bet that cop-hater
will start talking!

112
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,688
Okay! Let's go!

113
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:03,965
Conan-kun! What are you doing here?!
You suddenly disappeared!

114
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:06,334
Oh no! I forgot to call!

115
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:09,271
Hey, Hei-chan! Long time, no see!

116
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:13,275
Otaki-han from headquarters?!
Why are you here?!

117
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:16,678
Kazuha-chan asked me to be a driver.
Inspector Otaki Osaka Prefectural Police

118
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:20,816
Sakata-han called us about the glasses boy.

119
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,351
Now why'd you do that?

120
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:26,688
Must be convenient, always having
the cops at your beck and call!

121
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:30,692
Who're you to talk?! You were
touring Osaka in a police car!

122
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,593
Now, now!

123
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,497
I can drive the boy to
the chief's house if you'd like.

124
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,232
Shall we go?

125
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:40,335
No! I wanna stay with
Heiji-niichan!

126
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,836
Just a minute, Otaki-han.

127
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:50,612
This is Osaka. Just leave this
to us and go on your way, Kudo!

128
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:56,151
But knowing you,
you'll just find a way to butt in again.

129
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:01,690
Fine, then. I'll let you hold onto this.

130
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,791
Your good luck charm?

131
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,361
In exchange, hold yourself
back as much as you can today.

132
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,065
When I come home,
I'll tell you all about what happened!

133
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:10,799
'Kay?

134
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,403
Conan-kun! Hurry up!

135
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:22,377
Don't worry. I won't let
them mess with Osaka anymore!

136
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,745
I bet my life on it!

137
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:26,348
See you later!

138
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,751
Who's he talking to?

139
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:35,724
I'm starving...

140
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:40,228
We'll be at the chief's house
in Neyagawa in half an hour...

141
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,733
Heiji's mom is making
blowfish stew tonight!

142
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,700
Oh?!

143
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,403
I can't wait!

144
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:52,274
Otaki.

145
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:53,241
What?!

146
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,710
You found the car of
Numabuchi, the fugitive,

147
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,212
in the Mino mountains?!

148
00:08:57,212 --> 00:08:59,247
I'll be right there!

149
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:05,220
Sorry, Mori-han, but you'll have to
wait longer for the blowfish stew.

150
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,355
I'm taking a side trip!

151
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:17,032
Mino Waterfall

152
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,741
Sorry! I'll have a youngster
come get you in a minute.

153
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:27,642
Okay...

154
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:31,846
Isn't Numabuchi that
murderer who escaped with a gun?

155
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:35,617
Things have gotten really bad.
Right, Conan--?

156
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:37,752
Conan-kun!

157
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,323
How's it look?

158
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,424
Oh, Inspector Otaki!

159
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:46,928
We found the car covered
in plants, but Numabuchi is still...

160
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:49,998
And that shack?

161
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,434
It was empty
when I peeked inside.

162
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:56,905
Maybe he ditched the car
and ran off somewhere else?

163
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:58,807
He's in there.

164
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,543
L-Little boy!
When did you get here?!

165
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:03,979
Have a look here!

166
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:09,517
I found these burned
at the bottom of this can.

167
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,589
See? Convenience store receipts
from five and three days ago,

168
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,293
and stickers from lots of convenience
store lunches that expire today.

169
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:21,463
Not many people would
eat convenience store lunches

170
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:23,264
at a place like this every day, right?

171
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:28,203
But, boy, if a wanted man
showed up at a convenience store...

172
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,672
Someone else probably bought it.

173
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,508
Someone's sheltering him.

174
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,643
For some reason...

175
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:49,591
Hey! You find Numabuchi?!

176
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:50,925
Well?!

177
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:55,296
No! There are signs that someone
lived here awhile ago, but...

178
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:02,404
There's mud on the windowsill!

179
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:06,141
That pillar and those
beams are free of cobwebs...

180
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,845
I see! He stood
on the windowsill and...

181
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:17,986
S-Stop, little boy!

182
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,596
Oh?! It looks like
this leads to the attic!

183
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:32,066
Wait, boy! Leave the rest to us!

184
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,275
Numabuchi!

185
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,245
Numabuchi Kiichiro! You're under
arrest for robbery and murder!

186
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,680
F-Food!

187
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,284
Hurry, give me food!

188
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:54,622
Goshi Sotaro's residence
- What?! Old man Goshi won't come out?!

189
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:59,027
No, he's kept us waiting
in here since this evening.

190
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:01,362
I'll go see him myself!

191
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:06,468
Now, now! Please simmer down
and let my senior save face!

192
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:10,939
Goshi Sotaro Prefectural Assemblyman
- Sir! We can't keep the police detectives waiting any longer!

193
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,642
Forget 'em. They'll give
up and leave eventually.

194
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:20,482
Shall I at least tell them about
the phone call with the strange voice?

195
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:24,752
N-No! I absolutely can't...

196
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:30,091
Let's make a deal in one hour
about the incident twenty years ago.

197
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:33,795
Go out the back gate
and wait in the far storehouse.

198
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,899
We absolutely can't tell them!

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,371
Sheesh! I told you to stop
scampering around, Conan-kun!

200
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,607
All you do is worry me...

201
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,241
Sorry.

202
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,543
Come on! Get walking!

203
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:54,549
Hey!

204
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,788
Hey, you alright?

205
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:01,956
Hey, you!

206
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,392
Outta the way!

207
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,503
It's no use!

208
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:22,677
Conan-kun!

209
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:27,348
Conan-kun! Hang in there!
Conan-kun!

210
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:35,790
It can't be--!

211
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:38,993
What is it, Heiji-kun?

212
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,361
Oh, nothing!

213
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,932
Huh? Where's Sakata-han?

214
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,901
He just left to use the bathroom.

215
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,437
I should probably go, too.

216
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,309
Conan-kun! Conan-kun!

217
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:57,712
Someone rush him to the hospital!

218
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,379
Yes, sir!

219
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:02,317
I'm okay... It only pricked me!

220
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,220
That can't be! The knife went--!

221
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,560
A good luck charm?

222
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,031
It must be thanks to the good
luck charm Heiji-niichan lent me!

223
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,733
Heiji's?

224
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:26,541
See? The knife got caught in
the chain link, so it couldn't stab me!

225
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,577
Never do that again!

226
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,212
Up, you!

227
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,247
No funny business!

228
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,719
Why does he have two
handcuffs on his left hand?

229
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,925
Oh, this? I'm not sure why,
but he was handcuffed to a pillar.

230
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,830
We had to get him free, so we cut
the chain and put our cuffs on him.

231
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,299
He was handcuffed?!

232
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:57,872
Looks like you were right
about someone bringing him food, kid.

233
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,608
Wait a minute!

234
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,477
It couldn't be! It couldn't be!

235
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:04,812
It couldn't be!

236
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,250
Oh no!

237
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:29,303
Wait all you want,
old man Goshi won't come.

238
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:34,976
Sakata-han. You're the
serial murderer, aren't you?!

239
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:39,247
P-Please don't joke like that!

240
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:44,185
I was just admiring how
unusual this storehouse is!

241
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,156
First, when the
body fell onto the cop car...

242
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:52,360
You craftily took us there.

243
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,699
Mere moments before we exited
the restaurant, you made a call

244
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:03,071
and put the special set-up in action.

245
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:10,311
Then, while I was on the roof,
you called Okazaki-san to the scene,

246
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:15,183
left a threatening call on her
machine when you knew she was gone,

247
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:19,487
and led her to
hole up in her apartment.

248
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:25,059
After you had me witness her
and made an impression on her,

249
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:31,666
you brought up the topic and
called her after passing her apartment.

250
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,871
Then, after I heard her
frightened voice and leapt from the car,

251
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:43,678
you parked the car in an alley
and called her again while chasing me.

252
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,182
I'm the detective who just called!
You're in danger there!

253
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,619
Please wait in the nearby
public restroom! Got it?!

254
00:16:52,553 --> 00:17:02,697
And then, while we were in her room,
you killed her in the restroom!

255
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:12,006
You were able to arrive by
car immediately after she was found

256
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:16,077
because you had rented
two cars of the exact same model!

257
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:22,049
After you killed her, you got in
the other rental car that was nearby

258
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:28,956
to make it look like you'd
just gotten there after some time.

259
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,896
You drove for us and got us
closer to the heart of the case

260
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,499
to get everyone here so you
could kill old man Goshi!

261
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,970
He's a prefectural assemblyman.
He'd stand out if he left his home.

262
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,439
And he could even
take bodyguards with him.

263
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,145
But if you came here with us,
you could wander around freely.

264
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,417
When did you realize it, Heiji-kun?

265
00:17:56,918 --> 00:18:00,054
The rental cars' side-view
mirrors were the first thing.

266
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:03,591
It was at a different
angle the second time.

267
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:10,531
And then I noticed the instructor
in the picture from twenty years ago

268
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:13,000
looked a lot like you.

269
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,971
It was your habit in the
car that finally convinced me.

270
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,973
You fiddled with the rear-view mirror

271
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,342
the same way Noyasu-san
and Okazaki-san did!

272
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,981
That's proof you'd all been
involved with the same person.

273
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:30,384
I don't know what
happened twenty years ago,

274
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,954
but shouldn't you turn
yourself in, Sakata-han?

275
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,458
I'm sorry, Heiji-kun.

276
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,530
It's all over at this point...

277
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,631
You idiot!

278
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,535
Sakata is the killer?!

279
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:50,872
That's right! Numabuchi
told us everything!

280
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,976
After he committed the murders,
he planned to frame Numabuchi

281
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,447
and then kill him in a fake suicide!

282
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:00,915
Where's Sakata?!

283
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:03,584
H-He's been gone awhile--

284
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,362
There, it's empty!
Now you can't do anything stupid!

285
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,235
A bullet hit your leg?!

286
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,206
N-Never mind me,
Heiji-kun... Hurry and escape!

287
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:30,344
No can do... Looks like I got hit, too...

288
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:38,953
He was my father... The instructor
who died twenty years ago.

289
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,621
He was a strict driver

290
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:45,259
and was always telling my
mother to check the rear-view mirror.

291
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,230
That's probably where I got it from.

292
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:53,034
Do you think someone
like that would drive drunk?!

293
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:57,338
And then I became a police detective...

294
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:00,241
...to expose the
truth of my father's death!

295
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:06,914
I solved the mystery when I found
Numabuchi in a mountain shack.

296
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:11,919
I look like my father, so the instant
he saw me, he grew frightened

297
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,422
and blurted everything out.

298
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,593
F-Forgive me, Instructor Inaba!
It was just a prank!

299
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,629
We just wanted to see your scared face

300
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:25,800
when we forced you to drink
and drive a car without brake fluid!

301
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:32,873
And then you went after all
six people who took part in it?

302
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:35,810
The statute of limitations
for murder is fifteen years.

303
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:41,749
So I decided that if the
law can't punish them, I would!

304
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:50,791
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Heiji-kun.

305
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,161
D-Don't talk like that!

306
00:20:55,496 --> 00:21:02,003
You're a cop! You're the only
ones in Japan allowed to carry guns!

307
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,672
Why don't you feel any pride for that?!

308
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,209
Get up, Sakata!

309
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:12,313
You put the cherry blossom
emblem on your notebook to shame!

310
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,664
O-Otaki-san...

311
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,365
How's Heiji-kun?!

312
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:34,869
They took him away in
another ambulance just now.

313
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:40,608
He's really something. He carried
you out of that fire, on his back.

314
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,610
Yes...

315
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,347
Is this the homicidal
maniac who tried to kill me?!

316
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,982
Why, you--!

317
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:54,288
He is still my subordinate. Hands off.

318
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:56,991
O-Old man Toyama!

319
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,730
I'll pay a visit later, Goshi-san.

320
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:07,334
When I do, we can talk about
what happened twenty years ago.

321
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:42,403
I want to do something
else dangerous, like stand on ice

322
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:49,210
I also want to realize
the dreams I came up with

323
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,847
Forever my destiny

324
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:59,420
If a spaceship landed
right before my very eyes

325
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:07,194
I'm sure I would leave my
friends behind and leave Earth

326
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:16,570
I said having uneventful
day after day is the best

327
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,541
but I'm really just running away,

328
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:26,680
unable to keep up with days without you

329
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:35,055
Like standing on ice, it's a secret

330
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:41,962
Even if I loved you, my heart
would fly off even faster than light

331
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,666
Forever my destiny

332
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,742
Heiji, hang in there!

333
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,510
Heiji!

334
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,513
How does Hattori's wound condition?

335
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:01,282
We still have no idea.

336
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,551
Anyway, we need to remove the bullet first.

337
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,519
What bullet?

338
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,254
Did Mr. Sakata shoot you?

339
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:09,223
He didn't shoot me.

340
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,659
While I was trying to stop him from suicide,

341
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,661
I accidentally got shoot.

342
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,797
Why? Why you have to do something so reckless?

343
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:20,234
Because a fool once told me...

344
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,736
To never corner the culprit with my deduction

345
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:25,206
So they won't take their own life.

346
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:27,041
Hattori...

347
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:31,579
It's bad...

348
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,181
Somehow I feel really sleepy,

349
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,517
Let me sleep for a while.

350
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:38,519
No!

351
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,221
You can't sleep, Heiji!

352
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,423
Heiji?

353
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,634
No way!

354
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,904
Heiji!!!

355
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:01,742
Shut up!

356
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:04,411
Don't you hear that I want to sleep, you idiot?

357
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,483
If he has this much energy, I think he will be okay.

358
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,557
I didn't get much sleep last night because I was planning the best Osaka trip.

359
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,361
So stop disturbing me with your loud voice, you stupid.

360
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,601
I'm sorry if I have loud voice!

361
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:33,173
What are you doing, you fool?

362
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:34,408
You're the stupid one!

363
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,477
You're confusing us with your sleep.

364
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,712
Wait, calm down you two.

365
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,048
Look, I am an injured person!

366
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,383
Isn't that great?

367
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:45,953
Looks like this guy won't die easily.
