1
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:07,356
The victim is Okazaki Sumie-san, age 39.

2
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:11,186
She was strangled to
death with a rope of some sort.

3
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:15,736
She appears to have been
stabbed after being strangled.

4
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,286
What time did you find the body?

5
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:20,776
Three or four minutes
before you arrived.

6
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:23,856
This bathroom
cleaner guy found her.

7
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:29,086
But why does the killer
stab their wallets every time?

8
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:34,556
You told this lady not to go outside,
but it looks like she died here.

9
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:41,776
Come to the Shinsai Bridge now
if you want to see some old friends.

10
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,566
1:08 pm.

11
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:50,486
See that? You're the
next to wind up like that.

12
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,446
1:10 pm.

13
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:58,366
There's no question that's the killer!

14
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:02,646
In other words,
the lady heard the first message

15
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,246
and went to the Shinsai Bridge.

16
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:07,896
Then, when she came back,
she heard the second message

17
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:10,486
and trembled in fear inside.

18
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:15,806
But what does "old friends" mean?

19
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:19,306
Could it refer to the
people who've been killed so far?

20
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:22,436
Detective Sakata.
There's a call from headquarters.

21
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:23,726
Oh, thanks.

22
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:27,696
Hey, Hattori. These answering
machine messages are strange.

23
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:29,606
How so?

24
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:31,906
The times and the
contents of the messages.

25
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:37,066
There were only two minutes
between the "come" message

26
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,536
and the "see that" message.

27
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:43,746
Does that mean the
killer was watching her?

28
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,716
Something's odd
about these four murders.

29
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:52,176
I get a bad feeling that
the killer is playing with us...

30
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,326
Bad feeling?

31
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,016
Kudo!

32
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,026
What?!

33
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:06,316
N-Nothing! Don't sweat it!

34
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,736
Yikes! I just remembered that
ominous dream from the other day!

35
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:19,456
So, Heiji-kun. Where to next?

36
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:22,416
Shall we visit Goshi-san's office?

37
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,626
Heiji-kun?

38
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:28,336
Oh, right.

39
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:31,646
These sure are strange cases.

40
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:35,396
There are no witnesses and it's
not clear how they're all connected,

41
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,556
yet we can ID
the victims easily enough.

42
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,606
Yeah, now that you mention it.

43
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:44,896
The victims' names were on the
news right after the first two killings.

44
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,436
That's only natural.

45
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:51,816
All four had their driver's
licenses in their stabbed wallets.

46
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,616
Driver's licenses? That's it!

47
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,576
Kadoma Driver's License Testing Ground

48
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,396
So all four have
clean driving records...

49
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,036
Yes.

50
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:05,996
I thought there might be a car connection.
Guess I was wrong again.

51
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,956
They also all got their licenses
different years at different places.

52
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:17,606
Hey... it says Okazaki learned
to drive in Hyogo and not Osaka.

53
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:18,386
So it does.

54
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:20,606
Why that far away?

55
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:25,596
Oh, that place is famous
for its cheap license school.

56
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,606
License school?! Does that mean--?!

57
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,436
...If you want to see some old friends.

58
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:34,276
There's her friends!

59
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,406
Do you have the number
for that place, Mister?

60
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,946
Yes.

61
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:45,456
Okazaki Sumie and Nishiguchi
Tayo shared a room at the school?!

62
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,186
Seriously?!

63
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,276
Alright! We're starting
to connect the four victims now!

64
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:54,396
But... isn't it strange?

65
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:57,986
Okazaki-san got
her license that same year,

66
00:03:57,986 --> 00:04:01,846
but Nishiguchi-san
got his three years later.

67
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:06,136
Maybe he sucked at driving
and didn't graduate that year?

68
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,606
That's crazy!

69
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,856
You're really sure about that?!

70
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,816
Huh?! What is it?!

71
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:19,736
The others were at that
school twenty years ago, too!

72
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:23,606
The first victim,
Nagao Hidetoshi-san,

73
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:27,186
the third victim, Noyasu Kazuto-san,

74
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:30,856
and Assemblyman Goshi-san!

75
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,966
They were all at the same place!

76
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,126
What?!

77
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,546
And that's not all.

78
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:44,516
There was also a man
whose name is all too familiar now.

79
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,476
Familiar?! Who?!

80
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:52,436
Numabuchi. Numabuchi Kiichiro.

81
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:55,276
Numabuchi Kiichiro? You don't mean--!

82
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:58,406
The robber and murderer...

83
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:01,326
...who's on the run?!

84
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,256
Here it comes! The school photo!

85
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:10,826
No question about it!
It's Numabuchi!

86
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,276
The faces and names
of the other five match, too!

87
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:15,836
But this is strange!

88
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:16,396
August 23, 1978 graduates

89
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:20,256
See? It says they all graduated then...
August 23, 1978 graduates

90
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:23,986
...but only Okazaki-san
went on to get her license.

91
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:29,726
Something happened at this
school twenty years ago. Something...

92
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:33,066
I see. Thanks.

93
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,186
None of the current staff know anything
that happened twenty years ago.

94
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,906
I figured as much.

95
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,996
Prefectural Nakanoshima Library
But there had to have been some sort of incident

96
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:43,866
Prefectural Nakanoshima Library

97
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:49,406
involving that training
ground twenty years ago.

98
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:54,126
Bingo! This is it!

99
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:54,936
Driving Instructor Dies in Accident
Drunk Driving Suspected

100
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,356
On that day twenty years ago when those six graduated,
Driving Instructor Dies in Accident
Drunk Driving Suspected

101
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,046
one of the instructors died in a drunk driving accident!
Driving Instructor Dies in Accident
Drunk Driving Suspected

102
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:05,556
His name was Inaba Tetsuji.
The strictest instructor at the school...

103
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,276
Hey, how does this sound to you?

104
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:13,436
Numabuchi, broke and in trouble,
decided to use the old incident

105
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:17,856
to blackmail the assemblyman
out of money but was refused.

106
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:21,356
So he killed off everyone
involved in the incident

107
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,026
and then repeated his threat.

108
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:26,606
That, or Goshi used
Numabuchi to kill off everyone

109
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:31,996
to keep the scandal from interfering
with his Diet member campaign.

110
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:35,106
Both sound plausible enough.

111
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:39,526
When Nagao-san and
Noyasu-san quit working for him,

112
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,176
they received a lot of severance pay.

113
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:48,806
Mention the instructor's death
and his companions back then,

114
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:52,016
and I bet that cop-hater
will start talking!

115
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,616
Okay! Let's go!

116
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:03,906
Conan-kun! What are you doing here?!
You suddenly disappeared!

117
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,276
Oh no! I forgot to call!

118
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:09,196
Hey, Hei-chan! Long time, no see!

119
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:13,206
Otaki-han from headquarters?!
Why are you here?!

120
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:13,566
Kazuha-chan asked me to be a driver.

121
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,606
Inspector Otaki Osaka Prefectural Police
Kazuha-chan asked me to be a driver.

122
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:17,486
Sakata-han called us about the glasses boy.
Inspector Otaki Osaka Prefectural Police

123
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:20,666
Sakata-han called us about the glasses boy.

124
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:23,276
Now why'd you do that?

125
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,606
Must be convenient, always having
the cops at your beck and call!

126
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:30,606
Who're you to talk?! You were
touring Osaka in a police car!

127
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:31,516
Now, now!

128
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:35,436
I can drive the boy to
the chief's house if you'd like.

129
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,146
Shall we go?

130
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:40,276
No! I wanna stay with
Heiji-niichan!

131
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,766
Just a minute, Otaki-han.

132
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:50,526
This is Osaka. Just leave this
to us and go on your way, Kudo!

133
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:56,076
But knowing you,
you'll just find a way to butt in again.

134
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,616
Fine, then. I'll let you hold onto this.

135
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:02,736
Your good luck charm?

136
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:06,276
In exchange, hold yourself
back as much as you can today.

137
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:09,986
When I come home,
I'll tell you all about what happened!

138
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:10,716
'Kay?

139
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:15,316
Conan-kun! Hurry up!

140
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:22,316
Don't worry. I won't let
them mess with Osaka anymore!

141
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,686
I bet my life on it!

142
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,276
See you later!

143
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:29,686
Who's he talking to?

144
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,656
I'm starving...

145
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:40,166
We'll be at the chief's house
in Neyagawa in half an hour...

146
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,646
Heiji's mom is making
blowfish stew tonight!

147
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:45,626
Oh?!

148
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:48,316
I can't wait!

149
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,186
Otaki.

150
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,186
What?!

151
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:55,636
You found the car of
Numabuchi, the fugitive,

152
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,146
in the Mino mountains?!

153
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:59,186
I'll be right there!

154
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:05,146
Sorry, Mori-han, but you'll have to
wait longer for the blowfish stew.

155
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:07,276
I'm taking a side trip!

156
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:16,956
Mino Waterfall

157
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:26,686
Sorry! I'll have a youngster
come get you in a minute.

158
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:27,586
Okay...

159
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:31,776
Isn't Numabuchi that
murderer who escaped with a gun?

160
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:35,556
Things have gotten really bad.
Right, Conan--?

161
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,676
Conan-kun!

162
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,256
How's it look?

163
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,356
Oh, Inspector Otaki!

164
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:46,856
We found the car covered
in plants, but Numabuchi is still...

165
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,936
And that shack?

166
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:52,366
It was empty
when I peeked inside.

167
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:56,826
Maybe he ditched the car
and ran off somewhere else?

168
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,746
He's in there.

169
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:01,456
L-Little boy!
When did you get here?!

170
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:03,916
Have a look here!

171
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,436
I found these burned
at the bottom of this can.

172
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:14,526
See? Convenience store receipts
from five and three days ago,

173
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:18,226
and stickers from lots of convenience
store lunches that expire today.

174
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:21,396
Not many people would
eat convenience store lunches

175
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,186
at a place like this every day, right?

176
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:28,146
But, boy, if a wanted man
showed up at a convenience store...

177
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:30,606
Someone else probably bought it.

178
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:33,446
Someone's sheltering him.

179
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,566
For some reason...

180
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,931
Hey! You find Numabuchi?!

181
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:50,871
Well?!

182
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:55,231
No! There are signs that someone
lived here awhile ago, but...

183
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:02,361
There's mud on the windowsill!

184
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:06,081
That pillar and those
beams are free of cobwebs...

185
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:10,791
I see! He stood
on the windowsill and...

186
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,921
S-Stop, little boy!

187
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:28,551
Oh?! It looks like
this leads to the attic!

188
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:32,011
Wait, boy! Leave the rest to us!

189
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,231
Numabuchi!

190
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,201
Numabuchi Kiichiro! You're under
arrest for robbery and murder!

191
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,611
F-Food!

192
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:49,231
Hurry, give me food!

193
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,201
Goshi Sotaro's residence

194
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,321
What?! Old man Goshi won't come out?!
Goshi Sotaro's residence

195
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:54,581
What?! Old man Goshi won't come out?!

196
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,961
No, he's kept us waiting
in here since this evening.

197
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,321
I'll go see him myself!

198
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:06,421
Now, now! Please simmer down
and let my senior save face!

199
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:07,621
Sir! We can't keep the police detectives waiting any longer!

200
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:10,881
Goshi Sotaro Prefectural Assemblyman
Sir! We can't keep the police detectives waiting any longer!

201
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,601
Forget 'em. They'll give
up and leave eventually.

202
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:20,441
Shall I at least tell them about
the phone call with the strange voice?

203
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:24,701
N-No! I absolutely can't...

204
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:30,031
Let's make a deal in one hour
about the incident twenty years ago.

205
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:33,741
Go out the back gate
and wait in the far storehouse.

206
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,831
We absolutely can't tell them!

207
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:43,331
Sheesh! I told you to stop
scampering around, Conan-kun!

208
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,541
All you do is worry me...

209
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,191
Sorry.

210
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:48,481
Come on! Get walking!

211
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:54,511
Hey!

212
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:00,741
Hey, you alright?

213
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:01,901
Hey, you!

214
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,351
Outta the way!

215
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:15,451
It's no use!

216
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:22,621
Conan-kun!

217
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,301
Conan-kun! Hang in there!
Conan-kun!

218
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:35,721
It can't be--!

219
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,951
What is it, Heiji-kun?

220
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,311
Oh, nothing!

221
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,891
Huh? Where's Sakata-han?

222
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,861
He just left to use the bathroom.

223
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:49,371
I should probably go, too.

224
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:54,241
Conan-kun! Conan-kun!

225
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,651
Someone rush him to the hospital!

226
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:58,331
Yes, sir!

227
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,251
I'm okay... It only pricked me!

228
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,171
That can't be! The knife went--!

229
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,511
A good luck charm?

230
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:16,971
It must be thanks to the good
luck charm Heiji-niichan lent me!

231
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,681
Heiji's?

232
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:26,491
See? The knife got caught in
the chain link, so it couldn't stab me!

233
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,521
Never do that again!

234
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,151
Up, you!

235
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,191
No funny business!

236
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:37,661
Why does he have two
handcuffs on his left hand?

237
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:43,871
Oh, this? I'm not sure why,
but he was handcuffed to a pillar.

238
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:48,791
We had to get him free, so we cut
the chain and put our cuffs on him.

239
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,251
He was handcuffed?!

240
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:57,821
Looks like you were right
about someone bringing him food, kid.

241
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:00,571
Wait a minute!

242
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:02,431
It couldn't be! It couldn't be!

243
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,771
It couldn't be!

244
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,201
Oh no!

245
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:29,251
Wait all you want,
old man Goshi won't come.

246
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:34,921
Sakata-han. You're the
serial murderer, aren't you?!

247
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,181
P-Please don't joke like that!

248
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:44,141
I was just admiring how
unusual this storehouse is!

249
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,101
First, when the
body fell onto the cop car...

250
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:52,311
You craftily took us there.

251
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:57,651
Mere moments before we exited
the restaurant, you made a call

252
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:03,031
and put the special set-up in action.

253
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:10,251
Then, while I was on the roof,
you called Okazaki-san to the scene,

254
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:15,131
left a threatening call on her
machine when you knew she was gone,

255
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:19,421
and led her to
hole up in her apartment.

256
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:25,011
After you had me witness her
and made an impression on her,

257
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:31,621
you brought up the topic and
called her after passing her apartment.

258
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:36,821
Then, after I heard her
frightened voice and leapt from the car,

259
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:43,621
you parked the car in an alley
and called her again while chasing me.

260
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:48,121
I'm the detective who just called!
You're in danger there!

261
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:51,571
Please wait in the nearby
public restroom! Got it?!

262
00:16:52,491 --> 00:17:02,651
And then, while we were in her room,
you killed her in the restroom!

263
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:11,951
You were able to arrive by
car immediately after she was found

264
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:16,021
because you had rented
two cars of the exact same model!

265
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:21,991
After you killed her, you got in
the other rental car that was nearby

266
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:28,911
to make it look like you'd
just gotten there after some time.

267
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:34,831
You drove for us and got us
closer to the heart of the case

268
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:38,461
to get everyone here so you
could kill old man Goshi!

269
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,911
He's a prefectural assemblyman.
He'd stand out if he left his home.

270
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,391
And he could even
take bodyguards with him.

271
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:51,081
But if you came here with us,
you could wander around freely.

272
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,351
When did you realize it, Heiji-kun?

273
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:59,991
The rental cars' side-view
mirrors were the first thing.

274
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:03,531
It was at a different
angle the second time.

275
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:10,491
And then I noticed the instructor
in the picture from twenty years ago

276
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,951
looked a lot like you.

277
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:16,911
It was your habit in the
car that finally convinced me.

278
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,911
You fiddled with the rear-view mirror

279
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,281
the same way Noyasu-san
and Okazaki-san did!

280
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:26,931
That's proof you'd all been
involved with the same person.

281
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:30,321
I don't know what
happened twenty years ago,

282
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:32,901
but shouldn't you turn
yourself in, Sakata-han?

283
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,401
I'm sorry, Heiji-kun.

284
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,481
It's all over at this point...

285
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:43,571
You idiot!

286
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,491
Sakata is the killer?!

287
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:50,831
That's right! Numabuchi
told us everything!

288
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,911
After he committed the murders,
he planned to frame Numabuchi

289
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:59,381
and then kill him in a fake suicide!

290
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,871
Where's Sakata?!

291
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:03,531
H-He's been gone awhile--

292
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:14,321
There, it's empty!
Now you can't do anything stupid!

293
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,191
A bullet hit your leg?!

294
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,151
N-Never mind me,
Heiji-kun... Hurry and escape!

295
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:30,281
No can do... Looks like I got hit, too...

296
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:38,911
He was my father... The instructor
who died twenty years ago.

297
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,571
He was a strict driver

298
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:45,211
and was always telling my
mother to check the rear-view mirror.

299
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,181
That's probably where I got it from.

300
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:52,971
Do you think someone
like that would drive drunk?!

301
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:57,281
And then I became a police detective...

302
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,191
...to expose the
truth of my father's death!

303
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:06,871
I solved the mystery when I found
Numabuchi in a mountain shack.

304
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:11,871
I look like my father, so the instant
he saw me, he grew frightened

305
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:14,371
and blurted everything out.

306
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,531
F-Forgive me, Instructor Inaba!
It was just a prank!

307
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,571
We just wanted to see your scared face

308
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:25,751
when we forced you to drink
and drive a car without brake fluid!

309
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:32,821
And then you went after all
six people who took part in it?

310
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:35,761
The statute of limitations
for murder is fifteen years.

311
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:41,701
So I decided that if the
law can't punish them, I would!

312
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:50,741
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Heiji-kun.

313
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:54,121
D-Don't talk like that!

314
00:20:55,451 --> 00:21:01,951
You're a cop! You're the only
ones in Japan allowed to carry guns!

315
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,631
Why don't you feel any pride for that?!

316
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,171
Get up, Sakata!

317
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:12,261
You put the cherry blossom
emblem on your notebook to shame!

318
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,611
O-Otaki-san...

319
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,321
How's Heiji-kun?!

320
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:34,821
They took him away in
another ambulance just now.

321
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:40,541
He's really something. He carried
you out of that fire, on his back.

322
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:42,571
Yes...

323
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:46,291
Is this the homicidal
maniac who tried to kill me?!

324
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,921
Why, you--!

325
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:54,221
He is still my subordinate. Hands off.

326
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:56,931
O-Old man Toyama!

327
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,681
I'll pay a visit later, Goshi-san.

328
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:07,281
When I do, we can talk about
what happened twenty years ago.
