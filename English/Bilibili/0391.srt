1
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.540
In today's case, the suspect is a police officer's friend.

2
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.940
How far will the love of the two go

3
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.640
after overcoming the obstacle filled scene?

4
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.840
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:57.225
Hearing that he would be dispatched to Tottori

8
00:01:57.225 --> 00:01:59.025
to work on a joint investigation project,

9
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:01.925
Officer Takagi is flustered.

10
00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:05.125
Despite the fact that they may have to be separated for three years,

11
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.325
Officer Sato remains the same as always.

12
00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:09.625
While all this is going on,

13
00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:13.425
we happen to witness the suspect of a homicide case.

14
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.725
And...

15
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:17.625
"Yui Shimura" -You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi, aren't you?

16
00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:20.125
What? Me? Commit murder?

17
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.425
"Akira Kato" -Just what are you talking about? Out of the blue like that.

18
00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:25.225
What's going on? Cut out the noise.

19
00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:26.425
What?

20
00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:29.325
-What? -Officer Chiba?

21
00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:32.225
This is interesting.

22
00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:40.025
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 2)"

23
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.625
Hey, Chiba! Come here.

24
00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.225
Oh, yes, sir.

25
00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:45.425
What is it?

26
00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:52.925
Chiba!

27
00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:59.225
Hey! Chiba! Is it true?

28
00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.925
What you said about being with that man

29
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.825
and watching TV with him during the time of the crime?

30
00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:05.325
You're not lying, are you?

31
00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:09.025
Chiba! I'm asking if you swear by this Cherry Blossom crest!

32
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.125
Yes, sir! I swear!

33
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.125
I see.

34
00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:20.625
Sorry.

35
00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:24.725
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

36
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:29.525
Being a police officer is a crummy job.

37
00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:37.025
Think...

38
00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:39.025
Hurry, the continuation...

39
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.025
Next it's finally episode four!

40
00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:44.325
Yaiba's archrival the Potato Baron appears!

41
00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:48.225
"The Conspiracy of the Potato Baron!"

42
00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.225
Come to think of it. If I remember correctly...

43
00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:22.025
No doubt about it!

44
00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:24.225
The killer is Mr. Kato after all!

45
00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:28.525
He deceived Officer Chiba and used him to establish his alibi.

46
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:31.725
He twisted the passage of time with blood smeared hands.

47
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:36.125
I can't find a thing.

48
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.225
Neither can I find the gray parka nor the black knapsack

49
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:40.225
that the suspicious looking man had on him.

50
00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:43.425
How is it over there?

51
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:45.325
Nothing here.

52
00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:47.025
How about over there?

53
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:50.025
Nothing anywhere.

54
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:52.225
It doesn't seem to be around.

55
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.325
I guess not.

56
00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:54.725
Not here, anyways.

57
00:04:56.125 --> 00:05:00.225
I guess Mr. Kato who is freeloading here with you

58
00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:02.525
is not a suspect after all.

59
00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:04.425
Yeah.

60
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:07.025
Then, who on earth is it?

61
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:09.025
The man that looked like Mr. Kato

62
00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:12.625
that the children saw near the crime scene.

63
00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:15.625
He was probably another man who looked very much like him!

64
00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:18.025
Because during the time of the crime,

65
00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:20.925
Mr. Kato has an alibi that he was here watching "Morning Live Seven"

66
00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:22.725
with Officer Chiba.

67
00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:29.825
Okay, we'll leave for now!

68
00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:33.125
We've got to send the children home too.

69
00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:36.025
Anyway, that's enough for today.

70
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.525
Gosh.

71
00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:43.925
Inspector Megure told me to learn something from this veteran officer.

72
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:45.825
But at this rate...

73
00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:48.825
Hey, Officer Chiba.

74
00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:50.025
Officer Chiba!

75
00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.125
Oh, yes!

76
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.425
Will you go get Mr. Kato who's waiting in the police car?

77
00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:58.125
We can't go home without telling him goodbye.

78
00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.525
I'll go get him!

79
00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:08.225
So, we've got to start all over again.

80
00:06:08.225 --> 00:06:10.225
I hope it won't take too long.

81
00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:11.925
Take too long?

82
00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:14.825
Wait. If it takes long for this case to be solved...

83
00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:18.725
Maybe I won't have to be dispatched to Tottori for the joint investigation

84
00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:21.925
and stay here with Officer Sato.

85
00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:24.025
You idiot! Just what's wrong with you?

86
00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:25.625
I'm a police officer,

87
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:27.725
so I've got to solve the case as soon as possible.

88
00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:30.325
Hey, this is no time to be absorbed in your thoughts.

89
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:31.825
Don't worry.

90
00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:35.925
I'll make sure I get this case solved before leaving for Tottori.

91
00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:37.525
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:38.725
Well, if it's going to take long,

93
00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:41.225
just have someone else to take over the case.

94
00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:42.525
It's as simple as that.

95
00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:44.025
That's right.

96
00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.425
Everything will be fine.

97
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.025
What?

98
00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:49.725
Everything will be fine, Officer Takagi.

99
00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:55.925
I don't think'll take that long.

100
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:01.525
I've been telling you, haven't I?

101
00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:04.325
During the time of the crime from 7 am to 7:30 am,

102
00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:06.725
I was watching TV together with Chiba in the living room!

103
00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.225
Come...

104
00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:10.525
Excuse me, Mr. Kato!

105
00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:13.725
What was that program you were watching?

106
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:17.525
Like I said, "Morning Live Seven"!

107
00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:18.725
Which one?

108
00:07:19.825 --> 00:07:23.725
Which one but the one aired on Nichiuri TV from 7 am?

109
00:07:23.725 --> 00:07:25.125
But...

110
00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:26.425
See.

111
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:28.525
"Morning Live Seven" is also playing on cable TV

112
00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:31.025
from 9 am in the morning too.

113
00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:33.025
"Morning Live Seven"

114
00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:35.625
True.

115
00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:38.325
Which means...

116
00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:42.525
even if it were to take an hour and a half by car from here.

117
00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:46.025
He could've killed Mr. Nakamoto at a little after 7 am,

118
00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:49.325
come back here, wake Officer Chiba up at 9 am

119
00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:52.925
and watch "Morning Live Seven" playing on cable TV together,

120
00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:55.325
it seems possible for him to establish a fake alibi.

121
00:07:57.325 --> 00:08:01.425
Chiba you said that you both drank last night

122
00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:03.525
and you fell asleep in the living room, right?

123
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:04.625
Yes.

124
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:05.925
Officer Sato.

125
00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:08.625
If he made Chiba drink to make him groggy in the morning,

126
00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:11.425
and if Chiba who was awakened in the morning still half asleep.

127
00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:14.325
He probably wouldn't have realized it if it were the cable TV program.

128
00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:16.725
Wait a minute!

129
00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:19.525
I could've been half asleep

130
00:08:19.525 --> 00:08:21.625
but you can't trick the video, can you?

131
00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:25.025
The video I recorded this morning of "Morning Live Seven" cooking corner

132
00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:28.325
had the time and everything recorded too, didn't it?

133
00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:31.025
If it's the "Morning Live Seven" that played on cable TV

134
00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:33.225
the time wouldn't be displayed!

135
00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:35.125
It's aired two hours later, you know.

136
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.325
That's true too.

137
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:40.025
Besides, after watching Morning Live till 8 am,

138
00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:41.725
we watched a six hours video.

139
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:44.925
And like I was saying he was with me all the time

140
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.925
while we watched the live baseball broadcast from 2 pm,

141
00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:50.425
when Officer Chosuke and all of you came part way through the game.

142
00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:51.525
The only time I wasn't with him was

143
00:08:51.525 --> 00:08:54.425
when I went to take a bath for about 30 minutes.

144
00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:56.225
It would've been impossible for him

145
00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:59.625
to even make it to the crime scene that would've taken

146
00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:01.025
more than an hour by car.

147
00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:04.125
Well, I took a bath after watching the video halfway,

148
00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:06.025
I think it was about 11 am

149
00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:09.625
so I think it would be impossible for him to commit the crime.

150
00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.825
But...

151
00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:16.325
There's a lot you can do with 30 minutes.

152
00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:18.225
You can make coffee,

153
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.525
Watch TV.

154
00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:22.925
Dub videos.

155
00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:24.725
Dubbing?

156
00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:29.525
Right! Dubbing videos.

157
00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:35.847
I see!

158
00:09:35.847 --> 00:09:39.547
If he had set the timer to record "Morning Live Seven" before going out,

159
00:09:39.547 --> 00:09:42.547
he could've dubbed it over the cable TV program

160
00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:44.547
that Officer Chiba recorded!

161
00:09:44.547 --> 00:09:48.647
Moreover, what he taped was "Yoko Okino's Four-minute Cooking"!

162
00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:52.547
Since there are two decks so 30 minutes would be more than enough!

163
00:09:52.547 --> 00:09:55.247
But if there's no time display,

164
00:09:55.247 --> 00:09:58.147
I think I would have noticed when I recorded the program.

165
00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:00.747
Oh, I wonder about that?

166
00:10:00.747 --> 00:10:05.347
Those memo stickers that are stuck all over the TV.

167
00:10:05.347 --> 00:10:10.147
If you're used to seeing those memos on the set all the time,

168
00:10:10.147 --> 00:10:12.947
even if you can't see the time display on the upper left,

169
00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:15.047
you would just figure

170
00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.247
that's the reason why you can't see the time,

171
00:10:17.247 --> 00:10:19.447
and it wouldn't even bother you, right?

172
00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:20.447
You seem to have known that

173
00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:24.247
the cooking corner was after the weather forecast

174
00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:28.247
so you don't have to see the time to record it.

175
00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:31.247
And, you also mentioned that the flash news about Hide

176
00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:35.147
was displayed on the screen during "Morning Live Seven", right?

177
00:10:35.147 --> 00:10:36.147
Yeah.

178
00:10:36.147 --> 00:10:38.347
If the program that you were watching was really

179
00:10:38.347 --> 00:10:41.547
the news variety program from 7 am,

180
00:10:41.547 --> 00:10:45.047
I think they would have talked about that news during the program.

181
00:10:45.047 --> 00:10:46.847
In other words, even if it's a live program if it's a recording,

182
00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:50.447
new news coverage is impossible?

183
00:10:50.447 --> 00:10:51.447
Chiba!

184
00:10:51.447 --> 00:10:52.847
You said that the news on the video

185
00:10:52.847 --> 00:10:55.247
wasn't mentioned in the program, right?

186
00:10:55.247 --> 00:10:57.047
Yeah.

187
00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:59.447
I think that sort of news was on display

188
00:10:59.447 --> 00:11:01.847
when Chiba left to go to the restroom.

189
00:11:01.847 --> 00:11:04.247
But, don't forget.

190
00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:09.847
We were watching the Masked Yaiba video from 8 am for six hours!

191
00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:12.647
If you include the time that Chiba was taking a bath,

192
00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:14.047
it's six and a half hours!

193
00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:16.147
If we were watching "Morning Live Seven"

194
00:11:16.147 --> 00:11:19.247
on cable TV from 9 am to 10 am,

195
00:11:19.247 --> 00:11:21.847
then we would've finished watching the video at 4 pm or 4:30 pm.

196
00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:25.947
The live baseball broadcast was until 4 pm so it would've been finished,

197
00:11:25.947 --> 00:11:30.247
and you all came here a little before 4 pm, right?

198
00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:31.847
Now that he mentions it, that's true.

199
00:11:31.847 --> 00:11:34.347
So, I wouldn't have had the time.

200
00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:38.947
What time did you begin watching the Masked Yaiba video?

201
00:11:38.947 --> 00:11:41.447
So, like I've been telling you! At 8 am in the morning!

202
00:11:41.447 --> 00:11:43.847
Not you, but them!

203
00:11:44.947 --> 00:11:49.147
A little before we began searching this room so...

204
00:11:49.147 --> 00:11:50.847
About 4:10 pm.

205
00:11:50.847 --> 00:11:54.147
Which means about two hours have passed since they started watching.

206
00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.247
Right.

207
00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.847
Hey, you guys.

208
00:11:56.847 --> 00:11:58.547
What episode are you watching now?

209
00:11:58.547 --> 00:12:01.247
Here goes! Secret technique Yaiba Thunder God Fist!

210
00:12:05.147 --> 00:12:07.847
Hey! Tell me what episode you're watching!

211
00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:09.947
The last scene of episode six!

212
00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:11.447
This is the good part, you know?

213
00:12:11.447 --> 00:12:14.247
Stop bugging us, Conan!

214
00:12:14.247 --> 00:12:15.247
Episode six?

215
00:12:15.247 --> 00:12:16.847
What is the meaning of this?

216
00:12:16.847 --> 00:12:18.447
If the episodes are 30 minutes long,

217
00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:20.947
three hours should've gone by.

218
00:12:20.947 --> 00:12:22.747
-Tomorrow is another day! -Mitsuhiko!

219
00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:24.147
-Go, our hero! -Hurry! The continuation!

220
00:12:24.147 --> 00:12:25.147
-Masked Yaiba! -Yes, yes!

221
00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:26.847
The next one is...

222
00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:29.747
I see! The commercials!

223
00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:31.547
It's not only the commercials...

224
00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:34.647
They can't wait to watch the next episode

225
00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:37.847
that they're skipping the opening theme song as well as the end,

226
00:12:37.847 --> 00:12:41.647
preview of the next episode and the summary of the previous episode.

227
00:12:41.647 --> 00:12:45.247
So, it only takes them a little more than 20 minutes to watch an episode.

228
00:12:46.747 --> 00:12:48.847
Were you doing that too, Chiba?

229
00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:51.247
Yeah. Probably.

230
00:12:51.247 --> 00:12:54.547
Then, watching 12 episodes would be 240 minutes.

231
00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:56.747
That's only four hours!

232
00:12:56.747 --> 00:12:58.847
I see.

233
00:12:58.847 --> 00:13:00.247
Between 9 am to 10 am,

234
00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:03.347
if programs that were two hours delayed

235
00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:06.147
followed by that video was shown to Chiba,

236
00:13:06.147 --> 00:13:07.547
the discrepancy in time would be compensated,

237
00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:11.647
and you'd make it for the live baseball broadcast at 2 pm.

238
00:13:11.647 --> 00:13:14.447
Very smart, sonny.

239
00:13:14.447 --> 00:13:17.547
Moreover, since Chiba took a bath part way,

240
00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.347
his concept of time could've been thrown off a bit.

241
00:13:20.347 --> 00:13:24.847
Even if he were to watch the baseball game from after it started,

242
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.647
he wouldn't be able to tell how much time passed,

243
00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:28.047
so, time can be connected very conveniently!

244
00:13:28.047 --> 00:13:30.447
But Chiba went to the restroom

245
00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:32.447
and to the kitchen to get drinks too!

246
00:13:32.447 --> 00:13:34.347
Didn't you look at the clock then?

247
00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:38.847
Yeah. I didn't think there was anything odd going on though.

248
00:13:38.847 --> 00:13:40.847
So, he must've rigged it, right?

249
00:13:43.247 --> 00:13:44.747
Rigged?

250
00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:47.047
The clock?

251
00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:50.647
He rigged the clock two hours backwards before waking Officer Chiba up.

252
00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:53.447
He moved the hands of the clock here in the living room and the kitchen.

253
00:13:53.447 --> 00:13:56.247
While Officer Chiba was absorbed in watching the video,

254
00:13:56.247 --> 00:13:59.147
Mr. Kato slowly moved the clock back to the original time, right?

255
00:13:59.147 --> 00:14:01.147
I see.

256
00:14:01.147 --> 00:14:04.847
The living room clock is opposite the TV,

257
00:14:04.847 --> 00:14:06.347
and as for the clock in the kitchen,

258
00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:08.447
if you close the door you can't see a thing,

259
00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.847
so it'll be easy to move the hands of the clock!

260
00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:13.747
But there are clocks in the bedroom and the front entrance too.

261
00:14:13.747 --> 00:14:16.847
Officer Chiba fell asleep in this living room last night.

262
00:14:16.847 --> 00:14:21.347
And when he took a bath, his change of clothes are here

263
00:14:21.347 --> 00:14:23.347
so the clock in the bedroom was probably left untouched,

264
00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:25.947
thinking that Officer Chiba wouldn't go there anyway.

265
00:14:25.947 --> 00:14:27.647
Then, what about the clock at the front entrance?

266
00:14:27.647 --> 00:14:30.147
He can't touch the clock at the front entrance!

267
00:14:30.147 --> 00:14:32.747
When the courier comes at the specified time,

268
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.147
and the time on the clock is not right, it'll be odd!

269
00:14:35.147 --> 00:14:37.347
I see.

270
00:14:37.347 --> 00:14:39.747
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Kato made sure that

271
00:14:39.747 --> 00:14:41.347
when somebody came to the door,

272
00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:46.047
he would answer it in place of Officer Chiba.

273
00:14:46.047 --> 00:14:49.947
Come to think of it, when we got here you...

274
00:14:49.947 --> 00:14:52.747
Hey, kid! Where do you have such proof?

275
00:14:52.747 --> 00:14:55.847
Why don't you ask Officer Chiba, then?

276
00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:56.947
What?

277
00:14:58.047 --> 00:15:00.447
Kato.

278
00:15:00.447 --> 00:15:04.547
The clocks in this house were all set five minutes early.

279
00:15:04.547 --> 00:15:06.447
So that I wouldn't over sleep.

280
00:15:08.147 --> 00:15:09.747
I just went to check

281
00:15:09.747 --> 00:15:12.247
but only the clock in the living room and the kitchen

282
00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:16.647
had been returned to the original time by someone.

283
00:15:17.947 --> 00:15:20.547
Kato! You're the only one who could've...

284
00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:22.247
You gotta be kidding!

285
00:15:22.247 --> 00:15:26.247
I'm called a killer just because your clocks were delayed!

286
00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:30.547
If you suspect me, show me proof that I killed the guy!

287
00:15:30.547 --> 00:15:33.847
I'm sure that it can be found on the way here.

288
00:15:33.847 --> 00:15:36.747
It's been found!

289
00:15:36.747 --> 00:15:37.947
Just now.

290
00:15:39.347 --> 00:15:41.447
Between the scene of the crime and here,

291
00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:43.247
at the bottom of the Teimuzu River,

292
00:15:43.247 --> 00:15:46.247
the black knapsack was found with a weight tied on it.

293
00:15:46.247 --> 00:15:49.447
Inside it were a blood smeared shirt and slacks

294
00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:52.247
as well as a parka smeared with blood on the inside,

295
00:15:52.247 --> 00:15:56.647
which he seems to have been wearing on top of shirt.

296
00:15:56.647 --> 00:15:59.047
Moreover, here and there on the knapsack,

297
00:15:59.047 --> 00:16:02.047
there seemed to be blackened red fingerprints

298
00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:05.347
which probably got on there when he took off his shirt

299
00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:08.247
that was splattered with the blood of the victim.

300
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:12.147
And, of course, you know who those fingerprints belong to, don't you?

301
00:16:15.047 --> 00:16:18.247
Well, it seems that the car you rented last night

302
00:16:18.247 --> 00:16:21.647
was also found at a nearby parking lot,

303
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.047
so we'll check it out later too.

304
00:16:24.047 --> 00:16:25.747
That's a problem.

305
00:16:25.747 --> 00:16:27.047
As for those red fingerprints,

306
00:16:27.047 --> 00:16:29.547
I was going to wipe them off clean later,

307
00:16:29.547 --> 00:16:32.747
that they're still all over the car.

308
00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:34.447
So, it was you, after all!

309
00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:37.247
You used me?

310
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:40.147
You deceived me to establish your alibi.

311
00:16:40.147 --> 00:16:42.947
Yeah. I figured since you're a cop,

312
00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:45.947
the police would believe your testimony.

313
00:16:45.947 --> 00:16:47.747
Kato, how dare you!

314
00:16:47.747 --> 00:16:51.147
Sorry. I couldn't think of any other way

315
00:16:51.147 --> 00:16:55.047
to let out my anger of having my girl taken away.

316
00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.947
I knew that my girl's feelings for me had faded

317
00:16:56.947 --> 00:17:00.547
while I was abroad on my business trip

318
00:17:00.547 --> 00:17:02.147
so I wasn't all that shocked

319
00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.347
when I heard that she was getting married to Nakamoto.

320
00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:07.947
But, I couldn't take it when I went to give him a piece of my mind

321
00:17:07.947 --> 00:17:10.347
and I was shown the letters and postcards that I had sent.

322
00:17:10.347 --> 00:17:14.147
He had the nerve to say, "What a push over",

323
00:17:14.147 --> 00:17:16.447
while grinning as he threw them at me.

324
00:17:16.447 --> 00:17:17.747
All the postcards and unopened letters

325
00:17:17.747 --> 00:17:21.047
that I had written while I was abroad.

326
00:17:21.047 --> 00:17:23.247
So, he probably kept them from her even

327
00:17:23.247 --> 00:17:25.747
before she could read them.

328
00:17:25.747 --> 00:17:31.047
That's what made me lose my temper.

329
00:17:31.047 --> 00:17:32.247
I was so furious

330
00:17:32.247 --> 00:17:34.647
that I didn't even notice all the clocks here

331
00:17:34.647 --> 00:17:38.147
were set five minutes earlier.

332
00:17:38.147 --> 00:17:41.747
The sneakers that you saw inside the shoe cabinet?

333
00:17:41.747 --> 00:17:42.947
Yeah.

334
00:17:42.947 --> 00:17:45.647
The seams of the shoe strings were damp

335
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:48.947
while all the other shoes were clean and dry.

336
00:17:48.947 --> 00:17:50.647
Wouldn't you think it's strange?

337
00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:53.747
If he washed it, he would've removed the shoe strings at least, right?

338
00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:57.147
So, that's how you figured the killer was Mr. Kato!

339
00:17:57.147 --> 00:17:59.547
That he hastily dried his shoes with a dryer

340
00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:03.747
after he washed the mud from the rain off his shoes.

341
00:18:03.747 --> 00:18:04.747
Right!

342
00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:07.947
And after that I dispatched investigators to places

343
00:18:07.947 --> 00:18:09.747
between here and the scene of the crime

344
00:18:09.747 --> 00:18:12.947
where he may have thrown the black knapsack away.

345
00:18:12.947 --> 00:18:14.847
I did it all after I confirmed that Chiba wasn't lying

346
00:18:14.847 --> 00:18:17.747
to protect his friend.

347
00:18:17.747 --> 00:18:19.447
I didn't want to think that way,

348
00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:21.947
but if Chiba were an accomplice,

349
00:18:21.947 --> 00:18:24.547
they would've thrown the stuff away somewhere farther.

350
00:18:24.547 --> 00:18:26.247
What do you mean?

351
00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:31.547
Then you suspected Officer Chiba too?

352
00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:32.847
Yeah!

353
00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:35.847
A police officer is a crummy job

354
00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:39.847
where you have to suspect even the nicest people.

355
00:18:39.847 --> 00:18:41.147
I'll bet Officer Chiba who is facing that man

356
00:18:41.147 --> 00:18:43.247
in the interrogation room right now

357
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.947
is taking the blow right now.

358
00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:49.847
See you.

359
00:18:49.847 --> 00:18:51.947
I'll leave the rest up to you.

360
00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:54.947
Yes, sir. We'll take the children home.

361
00:19:01.047 --> 00:19:02.147
I get to sit in the front seat!

362
00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:04.647
What again? That's not fair!

363
00:19:04.647 --> 00:19:08.947
Genta! You should let us sit in the passenger's seat sometimes too!

364
00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:13.347
Come... Don't fight and hurry inside!

365
00:19:13.347 --> 00:19:14.847
Okay, it's stone-paper-scissors!

366
00:19:14.847 --> 00:19:16.247
Conan, come here please!

367
00:19:16.247 --> 00:19:17.247
Never mind him!

368
00:19:17.247 --> 00:19:19.247
Right!

369
00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:20.647
Police officer.

370
00:19:20.647 --> 00:19:22.147
A police officer is a crummy job

371
00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:25.047
where you have to suspect even the nicest people.

372
00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:27.847
Officer Sato, aren't you going to doubt me?

373
00:19:27.847 --> 00:19:30.747
I'm going to Tottori, you know?

374
00:19:30.747 --> 00:19:36.047
I might be hit on by some cute co-worker.

375
00:19:36.047 --> 00:19:37.747
If you really like me...

376
00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:40.947
If you even have a tinge of feeling for me.

377
00:19:40.947 --> 00:19:42.947
Hey! Come on, get in.

378
00:19:42.947 --> 00:19:46.447
You could at least show a tinge of anxiety or something.

379
00:19:53.747 --> 00:19:55.547
Officer Sato.

380
00:19:55.547 --> 00:19:58.547
Who is it? Who's the one that played a prank like this?

381
00:19:58.547 --> 00:20:00.247
-How terrible! -Gosh.

382
00:20:00.247 --> 00:20:03.747
This is a challenge to the police!

383
00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:06.447
Oh, no, that's what Officer Sato did herself.

384
00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:10.547
What?

385
00:20:10.547 --> 00:20:12.147
You mean she's a bit concerned?

386
00:20:12.147 --> 00:20:13.547
No way.

387
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.847
You won't, right?

388
00:20:20.147 --> 00:20:21.847
Cheat on me...

389
00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:24.647
What? Of course not.

390
00:20:26.447 --> 00:20:28.147
Even if a super cute mini skirt police woman

391
00:20:28.147 --> 00:20:31.347
or a sexy actress comes to the station as one day chief of police?

392
00:20:31.347 --> 00:20:32.647
You really won't?

393
00:20:36.347 --> 00:20:37.947
Officer Sato.

394
00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:45.947
I'll go over there and become a fine police officer!

395
00:20:45.947 --> 00:20:47.147
So...

396
00:20:47.147 --> 00:20:51.247
So, before I go...

397
00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:56.247
Please...

398
00:20:56.247 --> 00:20:58.347
Engage...

399
00:20:58.347 --> 00:20:59.747
Where are you going?

400
00:20:59.747 --> 00:21:00.847
What?

401
00:21:02.747 --> 00:21:04.647
Inspector Megure.

402
00:21:04.647 --> 00:21:06.647
Sergeant Matsumoto.

403
00:21:11.047 --> 00:21:12.147
What?

404
00:22:40.047 --> 00:22:42.847
What?

405
00:22:42.847 --> 00:22:46.047
Officer Chosuke's going to Tottori?

406
00:22:46.047 --> 00:22:47.547
Not me?

407
00:22:47.547 --> 00:22:49.047
You idiot!

408
00:22:49.047 --> 00:22:51.847
We can't dispatch a greenhorn like you to another prefecture!

409
00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:55.247
He's going as a representative of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police after all.

410
00:22:55.247 --> 00:22:58.347
But Inspector, didn't you called me at home this morning?

411
00:22:58.347 --> 00:23:01.847
Sorry! His name is Chosuke Takagi!

412
00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.647
Since you both have the same last name, I made a mistake.

413
00:23:06.847 --> 00:23:09.247
Officer Chosuke's last name is Takagi?

414
00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:10.847
Gosh... That Yumi!

415
00:23:15.547 --> 00:23:19.247
Oh, no? I wonder if somebody's talking about me?

416
00:23:19.247 --> 00:23:21.447
Take care of the children, okay?

417
00:23:21.447 --> 00:23:23.647
Be careful taking them home!

418
00:23:23.647 --> 00:23:25.147
Yes, sir.

419
00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:27.947
And?

420
00:23:27.947 --> 00:23:29.147
Do what with you?

421
00:23:29.147 --> 00:23:32.347
Oh, well, you see.

422
00:23:32.347 --> 00:23:35.447
Please be...

423
00:23:42.147 --> 00:23:43.747
Right!

424
00:23:43.747 --> 00:23:45.247
Before heading home, let's go to Karaoke.

425
00:23:45.247 --> 00:23:46.647
Oh, sounds good!

426
00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:47.647
Karaoke?

427
00:23:47.647 --> 00:23:48.847
Aye!

428
00:23:48.847 --> 00:23:49.947
Let's! Let's!

429
00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:53.047
-"Masked Yaiba" -"Masked Yaiba"

430
00:23:53.047 --> 00:23:54.447
Would you like something to drink?

431
00:23:55.747 --> 00:23:56.847
What a day.

432
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.447
"Next Episode" -What on earth was he waiting for?

433
00:24:02.447 --> 00:24:04.047
What?

434
00:24:04.047 --> 00:24:06.747
-What? -What? 110 cm?

435
00:24:06.747 --> 00:24:09.147
Isn't that the height of a child?

436
00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:13.947
But, how could he do something like that?

437
00:24:13.947 --> 00:24:15.947
The thing that you waited for five hours

438
00:24:15.947 --> 00:24:18.647
in Mr. Kitamura's president's room

439
00:24:18.647 --> 00:24:19.647
was...

440
00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:29.635
Next Conan, "Mysterious 20 cm Height Discrepancy"

441
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.074
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:32.074 --> 00:24:34.674
"Chandelier"

443
00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:35.674
The next episode has to do with height.

444
00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:38.474
In our case, it's more a problem of discrepancy of weight than height.
