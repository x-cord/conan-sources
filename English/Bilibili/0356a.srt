1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.640
Liar.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.140
Thief.

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.940
Sonoko?

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.240
All the programs for today have ended.

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.040
Thank you very much for your patronage.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.240
What's the matter, Sonoko?

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.540
You're the one who wanted to come to watch this thief movie, right?

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.240
But...

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.040
Part one was really good

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.240
so I expected this one to be even better.

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.840
But, they're just doing the same thing over again?

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.340
Talk about a meaningless part two!

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.140
I see. I kind of enjoyed it.

14
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.040
Kind of isn't good enough!

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.440
Well, most second editions are like that.

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.240
How I wish that somewhere,

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.940
an incident so incredible would make my heart beat so badly

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.240
that it would erase all the sounds around me!

19
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.140
Sonoko.

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.340
Come to think of it, I haven't seen that guy around recently.

21
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.840
Today's culprit is Thief Kid.

22
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.140
He may be able to deceive everyone else,

23
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.240
but I'm protecting the treasure and my dream.

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.640
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.440
This is what I wanted to see.

28
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.740
Hey!

29
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
Wait up, you!

30
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.140
When you bump into people you're supposed to apologize!

31
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.740
Hey, Sonoko.

32
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.340
Sonoko, your bag...

33
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.840
-Mugged? -Mugged?

34
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.840
Sonoko, stay here!

35
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.040
Why should I listen to that glasses boy?

36
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.840
Hey, wait!

37
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.640
Go get him, Lupin!

38
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.940
Lupin?

39
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240
Stop it.

40
00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:22.835
"Thief Kid's Wondrous Sky Walk"

41
00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.035
That hurt.

42
00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:29.735
How dare you snatch the bag of a fragile lady?

43
00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:33.235
I'm going to write about you in a corner of my biography.

44
00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:34.735
That hurt.

45
00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:38.335
Hey, young lady, hurry and contact the police, please.

46
00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:41.335
Yes. Thank you.

47
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.035
Thank you too, doggy.

48
00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:48.935
Well, even if Lupin here were to let him get away,

49
00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:53.435
with my Ultra Classic 1500 cc Twin Cam model

50
00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:55.935
he could never have gotten away anyway.

51
00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.335
If the situation calls for it, I have a speed-up function

52
00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:00.635
rigged to this motorbike, too.

53
00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:06.235
Uncle?

54
00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:08.835
Aren't you Uncle Jirokichi?

55
00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.235
You're Shiro's daughter!

56
00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:15.835
The last time I saw you, was at the Seven-Five-Three Festival!

57
00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:17.435
They know each other?

58
00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:18.935
Looks to be so.

59
00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:21.535
He's my father's cousin

60
00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:23.235
and advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group,

61
00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:25.535
Uncle Jirokichi Suzuki.

62
00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:27.435
How do you do?

63
00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:30.235
But uncle, when did you come here?

64
00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:33.835
I heard that you went out on a trip 6 months ago.

65
00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:35.935
I just got back last week.

66
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:38.935
I went the world over and finally found it

67
00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:41.235
so I came back.

68
00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.435
The best bait in the world.

69
00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:44.735
Bait?

70
00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:46.035
-Bait? -Bait?

71
00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:52.035
There are so many medals and trophies here!

72
00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:56.235
The European Golf Open, the US Cup yacht race

73
00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:59.135
and worldwide fast hamburger eater contest!

74
00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:01.435
And, all of them are the first prize.

75
00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:05.435
Amazing. This old man's won the Savanna Rally, too.

76
00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:07.035
Check this one out!

77
00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:10.235
Around the world on a man-powered plane.

78
00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:12.335
The pastime of a rich man.

79
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.735
Was this statue here from before?

80
00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:20.935
Yes, it's the Golden Goddess that was decorated

81
00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:24.535
on the bow of the Sea Goddess

82
00:05:24.535 --> 00:05:27.235
during the Grand Navigation Era

83
00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:29.435
when the pirates used to raid ships.

84
00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:31.735
That thing that she is holding up in her right hand

85
00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:34.135
is the legendary aquamarine,

86
00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.935
which is said to have turned

87
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.135
into a gemstone from the tears of a mermaid.

88
00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:39.035
It has the power to prevent disasters at sea

89
00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:41.535
and is known as the miracle of the ocean,

90
00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:42.935
Blue Wonder!

91
00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:47.435
It is valued very highly as an artistic work

92
00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:50.035
and I had a hell of a time bidding it off.

93
00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:52.335
I finally got hold of it last week.

94
00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.935
Then, don't tell me that this is the bait that you mentioned

95
00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:58.535
-just a while ago? -Exactly, this is the bait.

96
00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:01.035
To fish that guy!

97
00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:04.735
Fish what guy?

98
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:07.935
It's been 72 years since I've come to this world

99
00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.235
and there is not one time that I, Jirokichi,

100
00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.135
has ever let prey go in my life.

101
00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:15.235
Yes. I've gotten every award that I've gone after

102
00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:17.835
and realized every dream that I've ever had.

103
00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:20.035
But, there is just one thing in this world

104
00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:22.735
that I just couldn't get a hold of.

105
00:06:22.735 --> 00:06:25.735
That guy slips through the tightest security

106
00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:27.135
and the most armored vaults.

107
00:06:27.135 --> 00:06:30.235
He is a white sinner who magically breaks through everything in his way

108
00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:32.335
and spreads his wings gracefully,

109
00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:33.935
flying off into the night sky.

110
00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:36.635
Hey, wait a minute.

111
00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:38.335
Don't tell me that you're referring to...

112
00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:40.835
Yes. His name is...

113
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.735
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The Thief Kid?

114
00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:45.435
"Making a declaration to the Thief Kid.

115
00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:47.535
The big jewel that you so desire,

116
00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:49.735
the miracle of the ocean, Blue Wonder,

117
00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:54.335
has been placed on the roof of the Great Museum in Shiodome.

118
00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:57.535
If you want it, come and get it.

119
00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:00.535
Advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki."

120
00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:06.535
To declare something like this on the front pages of the papers.

121
00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:09.235
Rich people sure are something.

122
00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:11.635
But, it's a bit exciting.

123
00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:14.335
You idiot. He won't show up.

124
00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.635
A super-rich dude is sending out

125
00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:19.835
a challenging demand like this full of confidence.

126
00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:22.035
Who in the world would fly right into a trap

127
00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:24.235
that is so well set up?

128
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.935
Exactly.

129
00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:28.335
But, Sonoko was saying that just a while ago,

130
00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:30.635
her Uncle Jirokichi got an okay mail

131
00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:33.435
from the Thief Kid on his cell phone.

132
00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:34.635
Okay?

133
00:07:34.635 --> 00:07:36.435
What?

134
00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:38.335
It seems that he's going to come

135
00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:40.035
to check the place out this Saturday or something.

136
00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:42.435
See, here's that mail.

137
00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:45.535
She forwarded it to my cell phone, too.

138
00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:46.635
Let me see.

139
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:51.035
"I shall respond to your challenge.

140
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:54.035
I will go to get what I want on April 12th at 20:00.

141
00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.135
However, please forgive me

142
00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:57.735
for going to check the place out on the night before.

143
00:07:57.735 --> 00:07:59.035
Thief Kid."

144
00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:00.035
"P.S."

145
00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:03.035
He sure has a way of putting on airs like always.

146
00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:06.435
What's the P.S. after the mail?

147
00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:08.135
Post script?

148
00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:13.135
Just as the name has it, I shall walk over and appear.

149
00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:15.435
He's going to walk over?

150
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.160
Just what're you doing?

151
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.960
Never mind. Get on with the check, go ahead and check!

152
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.860
Make sure that all the roads leading to this museum are blocked

153
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.060
and officers are standing guard.

154
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.760
Don't let one suspicious thing get through! Understand?

155
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.360
Gosh! Those choppers sure are noisy.

156
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.560
What? You don't know how you should identify the Thief Kid?

157
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.760
Pull on his face! His face, get that?

158
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.660
Inspector.

159
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.860
Don't pull softly.

160
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.160
But, strongly!

161
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.060
Firm and tight. Understand?

162
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.560
Inspector Nakamori is really into this.

163
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.560
Hey, Ran!

164
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.260
Sonoko.

165
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.660
Ran!

166
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.060
What a flashy appearance.

167
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.960
Did Thief Kid appear already?

168
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.360
No, not yet.

169
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.760
This man with the slight mustache is Ran's father,

170
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.360
the Sleeping Kogoro.

171
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.760
Slight mustache?

172
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.960
I've heard a lot of rumors about you.

173
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.460
Is that so?

174
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.360
Hey! Are you the one?

175
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.960
Who started this riot to begin with?

176
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.960
What?

177
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.860
Do something about your helicopters up there!

178
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.760
They're in getting in the way of the police choppers!

179
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.160
There's no need for police choppers, is there?

180
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.660
The Thief Kid announced he was going to walk over here after all.

181
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.960
Then, why do you have so many helicopters up there like that?

182
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.760
Those helicopters are up there to film my autobiography.

183
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.660
Film an autobiography?

184
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.960
Amazing.

185
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.760
It's like an outside broadcast van of the TV station.

186
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.160
The helicopters aren't the only ones shooting the film.

187
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.760
All the images that are filmed by the cameras

188
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.560
that are set in 100 places all over the museum can be viewed here.

189
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.560
Hey. There's nobody inside the museum.

190
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.360
There were too many up to now.

191
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.560
Since there's nobody there, even if he were to disguise himself

192
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.060
and sneak in there,

193
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.060
it would be plain for all to see, right?

194
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.960
Since it's possible to open and lock

195
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.260
all the doors of the museum from here

196
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
even if he were to get to the roof where the Golden Goddess is,

197
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.860
the most that he'll end up doing is get locked up.

198
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.060
That is if he shows up just as he said he would.

199
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.160
I think he's here.

200
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160
What?

201
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.560
Where?

202
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.360
Can't we get a larger view?

203
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.760
Over here. Right here.

204
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.760
-Hurry it up! -Yes, sir.

205
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.760
So, he's appeared.

206
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.860
Thief...

207
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.660
Thief Kid!

208
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.260
Hey! Which one is it?

209
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.160
Which helicopter is the image coming from?

210
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
Which helicopter is shooting the film?

211
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.860
Helicopter number 7, sir!

212
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.460
From behind the museum, I think.

213
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.560
Behind the museum?

214
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560
Okay!

215
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.060
In the back?

216
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.660
Conan?

217
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.960
What shall we do?

218
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.860
Shall we move the Golden Goddess inside using that device, just in case.

219
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.860
Come on. Cool it.

220
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.660
He's just checking the place out tonight.

221
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.960
He won't steal it yet.

222
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.360
Besides, he announced he'd come on foot.

223
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.660
Hey, move it!

224
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.160
Outta the way!

225
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.260
Let's watch how the great thief,

226
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
the so-called illusionist under the moonlight

227
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.460
will make his appearance.

228
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.060
Hey! Where is the Thief Kid?

229
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.860
Well, after he went across between the buildings,

230
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.060
he hasn't come out.

231
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.360
Come on out. Thief Kid.

232
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.560
You can't walk unless you come down on the ground.

233
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.360
Come on out, Thief Kid.

234
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.060
What the...

235
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.260
No way! No way.

236
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.660
Darling Thief Kid, he's floating in the air.

237
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.860
Fantastic!

238
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.560
No way! How can this be?

239
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.360
How is he defying gravity...

240
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.860
and floating in the midair?

241
00:13:37.624 --> 00:13:40.824
Don't be deceived! This is a trick!

242
00:13:40.824 --> 00:13:43.224
Thief Kid is just riding a black blimp

243
00:13:43.224 --> 00:13:47.124
or something with his body suspended in the air with a wire.

244
00:13:47.124 --> 00:13:51.124
Any helicopters that are nearby, film his head and confirm!

245
00:13:54.024 --> 00:13:55.924
Chopper no.7 here.

246
00:13:55.924 --> 00:13:57.524
There's nothing above Thief Kid's head.

247
00:13:57.524 --> 00:13:59.024
What?

248
00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:01.424
Thief Kid sure is amazing.

249
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.124
-Don't you think so, Ran? -Yes.

250
00:14:07.124 --> 00:14:08.624
Chopper no.7 here.

251
00:14:08.624 --> 00:14:10.024
What shall we do?

252
00:14:10.024 --> 00:14:11.724
Don't move from there for a while.

253
00:14:11.724 --> 00:14:12.824
Roger!

254
00:14:13.924 --> 00:14:16.224
That Thief Kid, just what kind of trick is he using anyway?

255
00:14:16.224 --> 00:14:17.624
There's no way he can float like that.

256
00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:19.524
Look for the rope.

257
00:14:22.724 --> 00:14:26.224
Already making such a big fuss. The show's just begun.

258
00:14:26.224 --> 00:14:28.024
If he's not up there...

259
00:14:28.024 --> 00:14:30.224
The side? I get it.

260
00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:31.824
The wire is hooked on to the buildings on both sides

261
00:14:31.824 --> 00:14:33.424
and he's suspending himself with it.

262
00:14:33.424 --> 00:14:35.224
Okay. I'll go to the building on the left,

263
00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:37.224
so you go to the one on the right

264
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:38.824
and look for the wire on the roof!

265
00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:39.824
Yes, sir!

266
00:14:40.224 --> 00:14:41.924
Darn.

267
00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:45.224
That Thief Kid, how dare he play around with us like this?

268
00:14:49.524 --> 00:14:51.924
It's nothing more than magic, plain illusion.

269
00:14:51.924 --> 00:14:53.924
Just you wait, Thief Kid.

270
00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:56.024
All I have to do is see through your trick...

271
00:14:56.824 --> 00:15:00.724
Nothing? There's no wire anywhere?

272
00:15:00.724 --> 00:15:02.324
There's nothing here!

273
00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:03.724
There's no wire anywhere.

274
00:15:04.724 --> 00:15:06.324
Inspector Nakamori!

275
00:15:06.324 --> 00:15:08.824
There's nothing on this side of the building either.

276
00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:12.524
It can't be. Then, how is he up there?

277
00:15:12.524 --> 00:15:14.724
How is he floating in the air?

278
00:15:17.024 --> 00:15:20.924
Ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:15:26.524 --> 00:15:28.924
So, on this day, before my actual feat will be carried out,

280
00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:30.624
please watch to your heart's content

281
00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:32.324
the miracle that my legs will perform.

282
00:15:35.124 --> 00:15:37.124
He's walking...

283
00:15:39.624 --> 00:15:41.624
He's walking?

284
00:15:43.524 --> 00:15:46.424
Amazing, he's walking.

285
00:15:51.324 --> 00:15:54.224
This is chopper no.3, Thief Kid is still walking in the air.

286
00:15:54.224 --> 00:15:56.624
It can't be. What kind of trick is he using anyway?

287
00:16:08.124 --> 00:16:12.224
Hang on. My darling Thief Kid is walking?

288
00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:13.624
Amazing.

289
00:16:13.624 --> 00:16:14.724
I see.

290
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:15.924
So that's what he meant by

291
00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:18.024
he'll come on foot to get his target.

292
00:16:18.024 --> 00:16:21.424
Detective Mouri, never mind that,

293
00:16:21.424 --> 00:16:23.724
but please tell me how is he performing this feat

294
00:16:23.724 --> 00:16:25.424
that goes against all laws of nature.

295
00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:26.824
This is chopper no.3.

296
00:16:26.824 --> 00:16:30.024
Thief Kid is now walking over the skies of Shiodome Park.

297
00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:32.024
If he goes on as is,

298
00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:34.424
he will reach the roof of the Suzuki Museum

299
00:16:34.424 --> 00:16:36.624
where the Blue Wonder is in less than a minute.

300
00:16:47.624 --> 00:16:51.524
Thief Kid will reach the Blue Wonder in a few seconds.

301
00:16:53.424 --> 00:16:54.624
Uncle.

302
00:16:56.924 --> 00:16:58.024
You mean we can't do a thing

303
00:16:58.024 --> 00:16:59.624
but just watch him steal the stuff right before our eyes?

304
00:16:59.624 --> 00:17:01.924
Darn. That Thief Kid.

305
00:17:01.924 --> 00:17:04.424
How is he planning to flee,

306
00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:07.724
when there are police officers on the ground and choppers in the air?

307
00:17:07.724 --> 00:17:11.524
Advisor, don't you think it's time we start the device?

308
00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:15.124
We've got no choice.

309
00:17:27.524 --> 00:17:30.524
So, this will be all for the show the night before.

310
00:17:30.524 --> 00:17:34.324
I will see you again tomorrow at 20:00 at the same place.

311
00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:39.224
Darn.

312
00:17:40.124 --> 00:17:43.124
Didn't I tell you that you're going to be sorry

313
00:17:43.124 --> 00:17:44.824
if you underestimate Thief Kid?

314
00:17:44.824 --> 00:17:47.424
I won't let him steal it.

315
00:17:47.424 --> 00:17:50.924
Because I went all over the world to look for it

316
00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:55.024
and finally got hold of the "Miracle of the Ocean", Blue Wonder.

317
00:17:55.124 --> 00:17:59.124
Why is the golden statue inside and upside down?

318
00:17:59.124 --> 00:18:01.224
This is how it's rigged.

319
00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:10.524
I see.

320
00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:14.524
It rotates so the real one is exchanged for the fake.

321
00:18:15.424 --> 00:18:18.224
Thief Kid will see through a childish thing like this right away.

322
00:18:18.224 --> 00:18:22.624
Of course I don't intend to deceive him with something like this.

323
00:18:22.624 --> 00:18:25.624
If so, leave everything to the police tomorrow

324
00:18:25.624 --> 00:18:27.124
and keep your helicopters from flying.

325
00:18:27.124 --> 00:18:29.224
Stay put and stay still.

326
00:18:29.224 --> 00:18:31.024
I'm doing just the opposite.

327
00:18:31.024 --> 00:18:32.424
The opposite?

328
00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:36.624
He vanished saying let's meet at the same place tomorrow night.

329
00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:39.124
If he so wishes, I will do exactly that and ambush him.

330
00:18:40.524 --> 00:18:43.224
What do you mean by ambushing him?

331
00:18:43.224 --> 00:18:47.024
I'm going to rent practically all the buildings in this area

332
00:18:47.024 --> 00:18:48.724
and be prepared for him with a helicopter squad

333
00:18:48.724 --> 00:18:50.824
and security guard unit even greater than tonight.

334
00:18:50.824 --> 00:18:53.924
I don't know what kind of trick he's using to walk floating in the air,

335
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:57.224
but if he dares come out again, I'm going to nab him

336
00:18:57.224 --> 00:18:59.424
and add him on to the final episode of my autobiography.

337
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.724
Don't move. Don't move.

338
00:19:04.724 --> 00:19:06.424
Stay still!

339
00:19:07.424 --> 00:19:09.624
What's happened?

340
00:19:09.624 --> 00:19:11.024
Never mind and just don't move!

341
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:14.824
If you move, you'll never walk before me again!

342
00:19:14.824 --> 00:19:17.424
Where? Where is it?

343
00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:18.524
Don't you dare move.

344
00:19:24.224 --> 00:19:25.424
There it is!

345
00:19:25.424 --> 00:19:27.224
What's with this dog?

346
00:19:28.724 --> 00:19:30.124
Just as expected of Lupin.

347
00:19:30.124 --> 00:19:32.924
He will never let a prey that he is after go.

348
00:19:33.924 --> 00:19:35.324
Contacts?

349
00:19:35.324 --> 00:19:38.424
I didn't know your eyes were bad, Uncle Jirokichi?

350
00:19:38.424 --> 00:19:41.624
Well, at 72 years, all parts of my body

351
00:19:41.624 --> 00:19:44.224
are refusing to work the way they should.

352
00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:46.724
Your body seems to be working just fine.

353
00:19:46.724 --> 00:19:49.824
I would at least like to nab him while I'm still alive and kicking.

354
00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:53.124
What makes you want to pursue Thief Kid as much as you do?

355
00:19:53.124 --> 00:19:55.124
Kid, Thief Kid.

356
00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:56.724
The sound of that name itself,

357
00:19:56.724 --> 00:19:59.324
the one who stole everything from me, that Thief Kid.

358
00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.924
I'll never forgive him.

359
00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:05.824
Listen, I, Jirokichi Suzuki will nab him!

360
00:20:05.824 --> 00:20:07.624
I won't let anyone get in my way!

361
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.724
I won't let you have your way, Kid. Just you watch!

362
00:20:10.724 --> 00:20:13.724
I promise, I swear.

363
00:20:14.724 --> 00:20:17.624
You've already seen the many honorary gifts

364
00:20:17.624 --> 00:20:19.324
and awards I have won so far.

365
00:20:19.324 --> 00:20:22.924
They've always covered the headlines of the papers.

366
00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:25.024
All except for one time.

367
00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:26.624
Don't tell me that's why you're going after him?

368
00:20:26.624 --> 00:20:27.824
Yes, exactly!

369
00:20:27.824 --> 00:20:29.824
That Thief Kid not only stole the headline from me,

370
00:20:29.824 --> 00:20:31.424
he also stole the 2nd page from me!

371
00:20:31.424 --> 00:20:34.324
My article of having flown the world over on a manned plane

372
00:20:34.324 --> 00:20:37.224
was pushed over to a corner on the 3rd page because of him!

373
00:20:37.224 --> 00:20:39.424
Do you understand how humiliated I felt?

374
00:20:39.424 --> 00:20:42.224
Can you understand how sad I felt?

375
00:20:42.224 --> 00:20:44.224
A bit, I guess.

376
00:20:44.224 --> 00:20:46.324
When I do get my hands on him,

377
00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:50.624
I, Jirokichi Suzuki, will be on the front page once again!

378
00:20:59.102 --> 00:21:02.002
Really look at the huge number of helicopters.

379
00:21:02.002 --> 00:21:04.102
More than the helicopters, the number of onlookers here

380
00:21:04.102 --> 00:21:05.802
is even more surprising.

381
00:21:05.802 --> 00:21:08.202
They should've put up a "Keep out" sign.

382
00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:10.602
Uncle had them come in deliberately

383
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.602
because he wanted the arrest scene of the Thief Kid

384
00:21:12.602 --> 00:21:14.902
to be complemented by genuine extras.

385
00:21:14.902 --> 00:21:17.202
Come to think of it, the advertisement for introducing

386
00:21:17.202 --> 00:21:19.002
that large museum as well as the special program

387
00:21:19.002 --> 00:21:21.102
was really flashy and filmed from the air.

388
00:21:21.102 --> 00:21:22.802
But, wouldn't it be difficult

389
00:21:22.802 --> 00:21:25.102
to find Thief Kid among this large crowd?

390
00:21:25.102 --> 00:21:29.602
Don't worry, he has special seats reserved for us.

391
00:21:29.602 --> 00:21:32.102
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki, we've been waiting for you.

392
00:21:32.102 --> 00:21:33.302
Thank you.

393
00:21:33.302 --> 00:21:35.802
Please follow me, everyone to the seat over that way.

394
00:21:35.802 --> 00:21:37.902
Hey, is this for real?

395
00:21:37.902 --> 00:21:40.102
This is the roof.

396
00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:45.102
Would you like anything to drink?

397
00:21:45.102 --> 00:21:46.402
We'll leave it up to you.

398
00:21:46.402 --> 00:21:50.102
For the first time, she kind of looks like a rich little lady.

399
00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:52.202
This certainly is the roof of the building

400
00:21:52.202 --> 00:21:54.302
near the building where Thief Kid appeared,

401
00:21:54.302 --> 00:21:56.902
because the only ones here beside us are the security guards.

402
00:21:56.902 --> 00:21:59.002
I still don't understand.

403
00:21:59.002 --> 00:22:02.402
I looked through the image the helicopter sent afterwards,

404
00:22:02.402 --> 00:22:05.102
but there was nothing strange in it.

405
00:22:05.102 --> 00:22:08.102
Moreover, he vanished in midair.

406
00:22:08.102 --> 00:22:09.802
Just how on earth did he do it?

407
00:22:11.802 --> 00:22:13.502
I'll go get it.

408
00:22:13.502 --> 00:22:15.002
I'm sorry!

409
00:22:17.802 --> 00:22:20.502
A scratch? It seems like something got stuck here.

410
00:22:20.502 --> 00:22:22.902
And it's still new.

411
00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:25.202
Do you see what I see?

412
00:22:25.202 --> 00:22:28.202
A multitude of helicopters practically covered the entire sky.

413
00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:30.102
And look at the many security guards that are positioned

414
00:22:30.102 --> 00:22:31.802
all through the vicinity.

415
00:22:31.802 --> 00:22:33.802
This is indeed a handpicked unit of security guards

416
00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:35.402
that the Suzuki Financial Group has gotten together

417
00:22:35.402 --> 00:22:36.902
to maintain their prestige.

418
00:22:36.902 --> 00:22:40.702
Will he really appears under such tight security?

419
00:22:40.702 --> 00:22:43.602
The one who forewarned that he would steal Blue Wonder

420
00:22:43.602 --> 00:22:45.802
that is decorated on the roof of the great Suzuki Museum.

421
00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:47.802
The Thief Kid!

422
00:22:47.802 --> 00:22:50.602
He'll come. Of course, he'll come.

423
00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:52.702
It sure doesn't sound like a remark that would come out

424
00:22:52.702 --> 00:22:54.102
of the mouth of a little lady of the Suzuki Financial Group

425
00:22:54.102 --> 00:22:56.202
whose treasure is the target of theft.

426
00:22:56.202 --> 00:22:58.702
But, he's the Thief Kid, you know.

427
00:22:58.702 --> 00:23:02.002
If just this once, I'd sure like to see him in person.

428
00:23:02.002 --> 00:23:06.702
I actually wanted to hold the Golden Goddess statue

429
00:23:06.702 --> 00:23:09.702
with a lot of gemstones on it that is on the roof,

430
00:23:09.702 --> 00:23:13.402
but Uncle Jirokichi wouldn't let me.

431
00:23:13.402 --> 00:23:14.802
Of course he wouldn't let you.

432
00:23:14.802 --> 00:23:16.602
Don't tell me you wished

433
00:23:16.602 --> 00:23:19.002
that he would take you away with him, gemstones and all?

434
00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:22.302
Right, exactly, and Makoto would come to rescue me,

435
00:23:22.302 --> 00:23:25.302
who is being held captive.

436
00:23:26.302 --> 00:23:30.302
I, Sonoko wouldn't know what to do with two men fighting over me.

437
00:23:32.302 --> 00:23:33.702
I guess

438
00:23:33.702 --> 00:23:37.002
all this abnormal security around here can't be helped.

439
00:23:37.002 --> 00:23:39.302
After all he declares that he is coming to check the place out last night

440
00:23:39.302 --> 00:23:42.502
and appears by the building right beside this one floating in midair.

441
00:23:42.502 --> 00:23:46.502
He walks in midair and closes in on the museum.

442
00:23:46.502 --> 00:23:47.602
Then, he suddenly vanishes.

443
00:23:47.602 --> 00:23:48.602
I guess it's understandable,

444
00:23:48.602 --> 00:23:50.402
since he is the great thief that they are all trying to arrest.

445
00:23:50.402 --> 00:23:52.102
Really, he was walking in midair

446
00:23:52.102 --> 00:23:54.902
as though there were no tricks involved.

447
00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:57.102
I'm sure that there are tricks and magic involved.

448
00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:01.102
Because if people can so easily walk in midair,

449
00:24:01.102 --> 00:24:03.602
it would surprise the birdies, right?

450
00:24:03.602 --> 00:24:05.902
-Birdies, he says. -Oh, my.

451
00:24:05.902 --> 00:24:08.202
What a cute thing to say, Conan.

452
00:24:09.402 --> 00:24:11.202
Maybe the remark was a bit too childish.

453
00:24:12.302 --> 00:24:16.502
Brat, let Thief Kid's magic surprise you and the birdies.

454
00:24:16.502 --> 00:24:18.802
I don't know what trick he used yet,

455
00:24:18.802 --> 00:24:20.102
but we may found the marks that he left behind

456
00:24:20.102 --> 00:24:22.002
when he set up the trick.

457
00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:24.202
See! The scratch on the wall over there

458
00:24:24.202 --> 00:24:26.402
looks as if something was hooked on!

459
00:24:26.902 --> 00:24:28.602
The scratch is still new

460
00:24:28.602 --> 00:24:31.002
so it could be something that Thief Kid left behind.

461
00:24:32.702 --> 00:24:33.802
Well?

462
00:24:35.002 --> 00:24:36.602
There's one over that side, too?

463
00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:38.602
Are you sure that there's a mark

464
00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:40.202
that looks similar on the building on your side, too?

465
00:24:40.202 --> 00:24:42.902
Yes, a brand new scratch.

466
00:24:42.902 --> 00:24:45.102
But, I wonder what the mark is?

467
00:24:45.102 --> 00:24:49.602
Maybe he hooked a wire up from this building to the other?

468
00:24:49.602 --> 00:24:52.002
Thief Kid probably did so to put people under the illusion

469
00:24:52.002 --> 00:24:54.802
that he was floating in midair.

470
00:24:54.802 --> 00:24:56.202
No way.

471
00:24:56.202 --> 00:25:00.202
Inspector Nakamori who climbed the other building last night said

472
00:25:00.202 --> 00:25:03.702
that there were no wires or anything like that.

473
00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:06.102
Besides, if he's suspended from something like that,

474
00:25:06.102 --> 00:25:07.602
he wouldn't be able to walk.

475
00:25:07.602 --> 00:25:09.702
Right.

476
00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:12.502
Hey, maybe he set up a device to project a 3-D image?

477
00:25:12.502 --> 00:25:14.802
And, that's what left the traces?

478
00:25:14.802 --> 00:25:18.202
See, if he projected from two sides, this side and that side.

479
00:25:18.202 --> 00:25:19.602
Impossible. He couldn't have done something like that

480
00:25:19.602 --> 00:25:21.202
with the technique of this day and age.

481
00:25:21.202 --> 00:25:25.102
It's impossible to project such a clear moving 3-D image

482
00:25:25.102 --> 00:25:27.202
in a space where there's nothing.

483
00:25:27.202 --> 00:25:29.902
Then, do you know how he carried out the trick, dad?

484
00:25:30.902 --> 00:25:32.202
Sort of.

485
00:25:32.202 --> 00:25:33.802
What kind of trick did he use?

486
00:25:33.802 --> 00:25:37.502
When people think that something is not there,

487
00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:39.602
they have a way of not being able to see it

488
00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:42.102
because of the influence of preconceived ideas, even if it's there.

489
00:25:43.102 --> 00:25:44.302
-Preconceived ideas? -Preconceived ideas?

490
00:25:44.302 --> 00:25:45.302
And?

491
00:25:45.302 --> 00:25:47.402
Just what is that something supposed to be?

492
00:25:47.402 --> 00:25:49.502
Well, for example...

493
00:25:49.502 --> 00:25:52.002
A super huge hard glass.

494
00:25:52.002 --> 00:25:57.202
He placed it over one building to the other and walked on it.

495
00:25:57.202 --> 00:25:59.502
Inspector Nakamori probably didn't notice it

496
00:25:59.502 --> 00:26:02.702
because he didn't think that the glass was there.

497
00:26:02.702 --> 00:26:05.902
It could be that the scratch was made when the equipment

498
00:26:05.902 --> 00:26:08.202
that held the glass in place was removed.

499
00:26:08.202 --> 00:26:12.202
If such a glass were there, somebody is bound to have seen it.

500
00:26:12.202 --> 00:26:13.502
That's why I said...

501
00:26:13.502 --> 00:26:15.902
In the first place, how would he have brought something

502
00:26:15.902 --> 00:26:18.002
as large as that along, and then put it away as well?

503
00:26:18.002 --> 00:26:21.502
That's why I said it could be that.

504
00:26:21.502 --> 00:26:24.102
Not being able to see it because of preconceived ideas?

505
00:26:24.102 --> 00:26:27.202
Kid...

506
00:26:27.202 --> 00:26:30.702
Inspector Nakamori, so many people are flowing in

507
00:26:30.702 --> 00:26:32.502
that it's impossible to keep checking them!

508
00:26:32.502 --> 00:26:33.902
It seems that the Suzuki Financial Group

509
00:26:33.902 --> 00:26:36.802
passed out a leaflet saying, "Welcome fans of Thief Kid".

510
00:26:36.802 --> 00:26:38.502
Passed out leaflets?

511
00:26:38.502 --> 00:26:40.102
If things are left as is, a riot may break out.

512
00:26:41.202 --> 00:26:44.102
It can't be helped, let them through without checking them!

513
00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.202
Roger!

514
00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:47.802
He's probably going to come from the sky anyway.

515
00:26:49.902 --> 00:26:53.102
Darn! The security structure of the police is a mess,

516
00:26:53.102 --> 00:26:55.802
thanks to that attention-craving old man.

517
00:26:55.802 --> 00:26:58.302
You're the owner of the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder,

518
00:26:58.302 --> 00:27:01.602
the advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki, aren't you?

519
00:27:01.602 --> 00:27:03.302
Indeed.

520
00:27:03.302 --> 00:27:05.802
It's an hour more to go before the time declared by Thief Kid,

521
00:27:05.802 --> 00:27:08.602
but are you more than prepared to take him on?

522
00:27:08.602 --> 00:27:11.902
It seems that he put on a cheap magic show last night,

523
00:27:11.902 --> 00:27:14.702
but tonight I shall be the one to put on a show.

524
00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:16.602
I'll show you all a dramatical arrest

525
00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:18.702
that will make Hollywood movies look like child's play!

526
00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:21.902
Gee, my uncle is really out for the kill!

527
00:27:21.902 --> 00:27:24.002
Let's take a short commercial break then.

528
00:27:24.002 --> 00:27:26.602
The new talk of the town that has opened in Shiodome,

529
00:27:26.602 --> 00:27:28.602
bringing along with it the fragrance of history and culture

530
00:27:28.602 --> 00:27:29.802
is the Great Suzuki Museum.

531
00:27:29.802 --> 00:27:33.202
Hey, even the commercial is about the museum?

532
00:27:33.202 --> 00:27:35.202
It's a tie-up, you know? A tie-up.

533
00:27:35.202 --> 00:27:38.502
Uncle never misses chances like these.

534
00:27:38.502 --> 00:27:39.702
Even this aerial film

535
00:27:39.702 --> 00:27:42.002
is a cut and paste of what he used in the special program.

536
00:27:42.002 --> 00:27:45.902
Though he may not look it, he's quite thrifty.

537
00:27:45.902 --> 00:27:48.002
Please come quickly, my dear Thief Kid.

538
00:27:48.002 --> 00:27:50.202
And please steal my passionate heart away.

539
00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:52.902
What's the use seeing him in a noisy place like this?

540
00:27:52.902 --> 00:27:55.702
Besides, the wind's so strong, too.

541
00:27:55.702 --> 00:27:57.102
Wind?

542
00:27:57.102 --> 00:27:58.202
What's the matter?

543
00:27:58.202 --> 00:28:01.802
I'm going over to where Uncle Jirokichi is for a while.

544
00:28:01.802 --> 00:28:04.102
I just realized something interesting!

545
00:28:04.102 --> 00:28:06.102
Just what is that interesting thing?

546
00:28:06.102 --> 00:28:07.202
It's a secret!

547
00:28:08.202 --> 00:28:13.202
What? Show you the film of yesterday's Thief Kid again?

548
00:28:13.202 --> 00:28:17.302
Yes, Uncle Mouri insisted that I look at it no matter what.

549
00:28:17.302 --> 00:28:20.602
Sonny, you watched it more than enough last night, didn't you?

550
00:28:20.602 --> 00:28:22.902
Besides, it's already been sent to the staff

551
00:28:22.902 --> 00:28:25.302
that are making his autobiographic movie.

552
00:28:25.302 --> 00:28:27.602
What?

553
00:28:27.602 --> 00:28:29.902
Well, but the film will eventually

554
00:28:29.902 --> 00:28:33.802
be submitted to the police afterwards.

555
00:28:33.802 --> 00:28:37.202
After all, Thief Kid has never come to check any place out

556
00:28:37.202 --> 00:28:39.702
like he did last night, ever before in the past.

557
00:28:39.702 --> 00:28:41.602
Come to think of it, he's right.

558
00:28:41.602 --> 00:28:44.102
I wonder why Thief Kid put on such a demonstration?

559
00:28:45.102 --> 00:28:48.802
It's less than a minute to go before the time declared by Thief Kid.

560
00:28:48.802 --> 00:28:52.402
The Thief Kid fans who have gathered here are starting to countdown.

561
00:28:52.402 --> 00:28:55.802
Let's all watch this miraculous moment, too.

562
00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:58.502
He won't come.

563
00:28:58.502 --> 00:29:01.702
No magician would ever let any viewer up on stage

564
00:29:01.702 --> 00:29:05.302
before the show starts and let them surround him.

565
00:29:05.302 --> 00:29:08.402
Because he would be revealing the secret of his trick that way.

566
00:29:08.402 --> 00:29:10.802
Although he declared that he would appear again tonight

567
00:29:10.802 --> 00:29:13.302
between those two buildings,

568
00:29:13.302 --> 00:29:15.102
where the eyes of all the spectators are on him

569
00:29:15.102 --> 00:29:16.602
and the wind of the helicopters

570
00:29:16.602 --> 00:29:21.002
are going to blow his hand glider out of control.

571
00:29:22.502 --> 00:29:26.202
He will not appear!

572
00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:29.002
Well, if he's a long-nosed goblin or a mountain hermit,

573
00:29:29.002 --> 00:29:31.102
it may be a different story.

574
00:29:44.302 --> 00:29:47.002
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!
