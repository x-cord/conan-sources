00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:14,224
Oh, a rainbow!

3
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,324
See, it's beautiful!

4
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,224
A rainbow...

5
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:22,924
Boy, staying up all night playing mahjong.

6
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:27,024
Wrong. It was a match of a life time.

7
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:30,124
Because Yoko Okino's picture was at stake.

8
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:35,024
I doubt if it's something that you should do

9
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,524
after coming all the way to a hot spring.

10
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:43,524
Look at that!

11
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,924
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

13
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:55,124
The view if clear and yet many accidents occur.

14
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,324
There's something suspicious about the devilish intersection.

15
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,924
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,824
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,324
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:52,937
"Intersection of fear"

19
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:57,537
It's an accident!

20
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,937
Ran, you go over to the car on that side!

21
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:11,937
Okay!

22
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,837
This is...

23
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,837
No good! I can't rescue him!

24
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:22,537
Ran, how is it on your side?

25
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,037
I can't open the door!

26
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,437
Please get a hold of yourself!

27
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:30,137
Hey, both these cars were parked

28
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:32,237
at the convenience store a while ago, right?

29
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:33,737
Never mind about that!

30
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,237
Are you all right?

31
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,337
Yeah, I guess so.

32
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,937
What happened?

33
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:49,337
You seem to have gotten into a traffic accident.

34
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:52,737
I'm sure there was another car involved.

35
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,537
I tried to help him,

36
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,337
but the car was on fire and I couldn't get close.

37
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,137
Are you all right?

38
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,837
Ran, call the ambulance and the police!

39
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:04,837
Yes!

40
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,137
Why did this happen?

41
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:23,737
It's such a big accident.

42
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:26,437
What shall I do?

43
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:29,837
I've done something terrible!

44
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,237
Come... please calm down.

45
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:33,837
Would you like a cigarette?

46
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:37,637
Oh, but I don't smoke.

47
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:39,537
Oh, I see.

48
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,137
You're the one who was driving the green car?

49
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,437
Yes.

50
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,937
Would it be okay if I asked you some questions?

51
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,537
-Yes. -First of all, could you tell me your name and occupation?

52
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:55,437
"Seiji Kurumatani, age 28" -Seiji Kurumatani. I'm an auto mechanic.

53
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,837
You're the first person who found him?

54
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:58,837
Your name please?

55
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:06,537
Oh, you're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

56
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:08,137
I've heard about you.

57
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:11,037
Oh well, it's no big deal.

58
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:12,737
You mean, that Kogoro Mouri?

59
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:15,837
"Michida Junko, age 38" -I'm so honored

60
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,237
"Michida Junko, age 38" -to get help from a famed detective.

61
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,537
And, you're the first one who found the cars

62
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:21,137
who got into an accident, Mr. Mouri?

63
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,437
Yes, the red one was already on flames.

64
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:29,137
Mr. Hayato Hayamizu who was driving the car was found dead.

65
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:30,837
Mr. Kurumatani...

66
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:33,937
will you tell me about the time the accident occurred?

67
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,737
Yes.

68
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,637
When I was ready to enter the intersection,

69
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,637
I, for some reason, didn't realize the other car coming at all.

70
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:44,637
I just kept going straight,

71
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:47,037
then, the red car suddenly appeared in front of me.

72
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:52,537
I slammed on the brakes and turned the wheels,

73
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,637
but I couldn't avoid the car.

74
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,137
Didn't you stop once

75
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,737
before entering the intersection?

76
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,237
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,637
I wasn't careful enough.

78
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,737
That's why accidents occur.

79
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:09,037
The steel column is so bent out of shape.

80
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,937
The front of this car is reinforced with a grill guard.

81
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:21,737
But, the thing about the other car

82
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:23,837
suddenly appearing in front of him bothers me.

83
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:26,637
I'll bet you were dozing off while driving,

84
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,637
or didn't have your eyes on the road.

85
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,037
Neither!

86
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:32,337
I was looking ahead while driving like I should,

87
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,337
but I didn't see the other car at all!

88
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:37,037
No way!

89
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:39,537
It's an intersection located right in the middle of a rice field

90
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:40,937
and has a clear view, you know.

91
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,337
It could be that...

92
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,337
That?

93
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:50,037
This place is known for frequent accidents occurring.

94
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:54,037
The locals call it the intersection of fear.

95
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:57,337
The intersection of fear?

96
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:58,637
According to a story I heard,

97
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:00,737
it's said that the cause of the accidents

98
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,937
is due to the collision course phenomenon.

99
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:06,537
What's that thing called the collision course?

100
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:09,137
The collision course phenomenon.

101
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,037
It's an intersection with a clear view,

102
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:13,537
and in broad daylight, but still accidents occur.

103
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:19,237
When two cars head into the intersection at the same speed,

104
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:22,237
both cars will be positioned at an angle of 45 degrees

105
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:24,137
at all times from the front.

106
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:27,537
In other words, the other car always look to be in the same position,

107
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:30,237
outside your visual range.

108
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,837
The vision of humans

109
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:35,437
are broadly divided into central and peripheral vision,

110
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:36,737
but since it is difficult

111
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,937
to confirm small things using peripheral vision,

112
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:43,337
mutually noticing the other car may be delayed,

113
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,937
and both cars may enter the intersection without noticing the other,

114
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:48,137
thus, crash into each other.

115
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:55,537
Then, you're saying that Mr. Kurumatani's accident

116
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,737
was also because of that korean course phenomenon?

117
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,237
It's collision course.

118
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:03,337
That could've been the reason the accident occurred.

119
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:07,237
I had no idea there was such a phenomenon.

120
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,337
I should've... I should've been more careful driving.

121
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:12,737
But...

122
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,437
There aren't any traces

123
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:20,537
whatsoever of braking with the red car.

124
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:22,237
The driver in the red car

125
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:24,937
didn't notice the other car coming at all too, then.

126
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,937
Which makes the collision course phenomenon

127
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:29,537
even more plausible.

128
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,337
But, I just can't believe yet that both car

129
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,437
wouldn't notice each other

130
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:38,037
in a spacious place like this.

131
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,337
I guess you're suspicious of everything

132
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:41,437
because you're a detective.

133
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,137
The two cars that we saw

134
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:47,837
at the convenience store are all smashed up.

135
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,737
Right, Pops?

136
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,237
Yeah... right.

137
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:54,537
What? Both cars were at the convenience store?

138
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:58,537
Yes, when we stopped over to buy canned coffee,

139
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:02,837
we saw both cars leave the parking lot almost simultaneously.

140
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:07,937
Hold it.

141
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:10,537
Come to think of it, it's too coincidental, isn't it?

142
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:12,137
What is it?

143
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,437
The two cars that left the convenience store at almost the same time,

144
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,837
take separate roads

145
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:20,437
and a few minutes later, they collide here.

146
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,937
I wonder if it's really a coincidence?

147
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,937
I think it's just a casual coincidence.

148
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,437
If you like, would you like to go

149
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,237
and confirm at the convenience store?

150
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:37,837
Yes, he came at around 14:00.

151
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,237
He was acting strange,

152
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:40,637
so something bothered me.

153
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,637
Did you come yesterday, too, sir?

154
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:50,337
See, I remember that green car.

155
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,237
That's Kurumatani's car!

156
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:55,437
Don't mix things up!

157
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,537
He yelled at me.

158
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:58,837
No way.

159
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:01,237
He really said Kurumatani?

160
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:05,237
-Yes, sir. -Mr. Hayamizu knew Mr. Kurumatani.

161
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,937
Something smells.

162
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,537
Then...

163
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,237
How about this man?

164
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,137
He...

165
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:16,837
He was arguing with the young man

166
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:20,037
I was talking about a while ago.

167
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,437
I see.

168
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:24,237
I must've seen the two cars leave,

169
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,937
after they both got into an argument.

170
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:30,037
Soon after that, the accident occurred.

171
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:44,737
If I remember correctly, back then...

172
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:59,037
Here goes, Conan.

173
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:00,237
Okay.

174
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,437
Mr. Kurumatani.

175
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:09,837
You knew Mr. Hayamizu

176
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,637
who was riding the red car, didn't you?

177
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,237
Oh, well...

178
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:16,137
I've seen him around,

179
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:18,537
but I wasn't all that sure.

180
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:19,837
Then, what were arguing over

181
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,937
at the convenience store with Mr. Hayamizu?

182
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,237
The manager of the convenience store

183
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:27,537
saw you both arguing.

184
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:30,837
The fact is, that red foreign car is a second hand car

185
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:33,737
that my friend sold him three months ago.

186
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:36,337
When I asked him about the loan of the car

187
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:38,837
not being paid by the buyer,

188
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:41,737
he suddenly broke out in rage.

189
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:44,437
I see.

190
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,237
By the way, why did you come driving over this way?

191
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:51,437
You live in the opposite direction, don't you?

192
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:52,737
No special reason.

193
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:57,237
I was driving around because I had time to kill.

194
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,637
The rainbow was nice too.

195
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,237
Rainbow? I wonder if there was any rainbow.

196
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,837
What is it anyway, since a while ago?

197
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:07,937
Why are you talking about things

198
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:09,637
that have nothing to do with the accident?

199
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:11,337
I get it!

200
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:15,037
Mr. Kurumatani, you're an auto mechanic, aren't you?

201
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:17,837
Yes, I am.

202
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,137
You knew that this was a place

203
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,937
full of collisions beforehand.

204
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,737
No, I didn't.

205
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,737
Since you got into an argument with Mr. Hayazumi,

206
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:29,537
you rigged the brakes of his car

207
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:32,237
during the few minutes he was shopping in the convenience store.

208
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:33,437
You could probably do so hands down,

209
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,237
being that you're an auto mechanic.

210
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,037
That's why there were no traces of brakes

211
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,137
where the red foreign car was.

212
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:41,837
But, nothing abnormal was found

213
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:43,937
in the brakes of the red car.

214
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,237
Is that so?

215
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:50,137
But, I'll bet you stuck something in between the brake pedal.

216
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,437
It's an old trick that's used when you want to fake an accident.

217
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:58,937
You were planning to give Mr. Hayamizu a taste of his own medicine,

218
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:00,237
but it turned out into an accident you never imagined would happen,

219
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,337
and Mr. Hayamizu died.

220
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:05,637
That's why you wanted to hide the fact, isn't that right?

221
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,137
But nothing suspicious was found

222
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,637
inside the red car.

223
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:13,937
Mr. Detective!

224
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:16,637
Please cut out saying strange things!

225
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:23,537
Dad, don't smoke while you're walking!

226
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,837
There's an ashtray in the car too, isn't there?

227
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:28,137
Yeah.

228
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:29,637
Ashtray in the car?

229
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,237
I see.

230
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,737
So, that's the story.

231
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,134
What're you doing, Conan?

232
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,334
Nothing much.

233
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,734
The image on the surveillance camera for traffic is ready.

234
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,234
A surveillance camera here?

235
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:09,134
Because there are too many accidents.

236
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,734
I see.

237
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,434
Not for kids!

238
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,534
After the red foreign car entered the intersection

239
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:24,734
without braking at all,

240
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:27,334
the green car that came later crashed into it.

241
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:31,234
The green car crashed into the sign after that and stopped.

242
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:34,034
The red car fell into the irrigation channel.

243
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:39,234
There seems to be nothing suspicious about.

244
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:42,534
It seems to be so.

245
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,834
I guess there's no problem closing this case as an accident.

246
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:48,634
Darn.

247
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,334
I'd like to see the image on the surveillance camera.

248
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:56,934
Come on. Dad'll scold you if go here and there.

249
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:00,834
Huh?

250
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,634
Ran, excuse me a bit.

251
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:05,734
Conan.

252
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:06,834
Boy.

253
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,334
This is...

254
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,134
Ran.

255
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:21,834
You mean, Dad?

256
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:33,234
How was it?

257
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,134
Just as you said,

258
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,634
we think that it is an accident of two cars colliding.

259
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,634
Only, your ignoring to stop at the stop sign

260
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,134
is a grave offense.

261
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:45,234
I am very sorry.

262
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,534
So, the case is closed!

263
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,534
I'm counting on you, Ran.

264
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:57,034
I'm taking you back to the station

265
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:59,234
and interrogating you regarding the accident,

266
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:01,634
so please come with me.

267
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:03,034
All right.

268
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:06,634
Please wait.

269
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,434
This is not just a mere traffic accident,

270
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:14,434
but rather a planned homicide case.

271
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,034
What?

272
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,034
Just what do you mean?

273
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,334
It's not true that Mr. Kurumatani coincidentally happened

274
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,834
to run into Mr. Hayamizu at the convenience store.

275
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,634
Just... just what do you think you're saying?

276
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,734
Just a while ago,

277
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:31,634
the boy I came with saw the ashtray in your car,

278
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:34,434
and told me that it was full of cigarette butts.

279
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,534
That's strange,

280
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:40,834
because you don't seem to smoke.

281
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,234
Well, that's...

282
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,334
The brand name of that cigarette is called Paradise

283
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:49,834
and moreover, the filter of all the cigarette butts were bitten flat.

284
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:54,234
I mean it's the same as the cigarette butts that were thrown away

285
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:57,334
by Mr. Hayamizu in front of the convenience store.

286
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:59,934
In other words, Mr. Hayamizu drove the green car

287
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:03,634
up to that convenience store.

288
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,234
It's most likely that

289
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,534
you lent the green car to Mr. Hayamizu

290
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:12,234
while he was having his car tuned up at the factory.

291
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,834
And isn't it that you promised to meet Mr. Hayamizu

292
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,234
at the convenience store after tune-up was done

293
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,834
to exchange his car for the green car that you lent him?

294
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,434
Then you pretended to have a collision with Mr. Hayamizu

295
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:25,434
and killed him, right?

296
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:28,134
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

297
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:31,334
In other words, Mr. Kurumatani was planning

298
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:35,334
to collide with Mr. Hayamizu's car to begin with.

299
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,334
Don't be ridiculous!

300
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:39,834
I'm hurt too, you know!

301
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,734
One mistake, and I may have been dead too.

302
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,834
No worry about that with your car,

303
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:50,334
because it's equipped with iron pipe grill guard.

304
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:53,134
Getting hurt would make it look even more like an accident

305
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,634
and is better for you, isn't it?

306
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,034
Making up stories!

307
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,234
It's an accident that was caused by the collision course!

308
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:03,334
The fact that there were no traces of the other driver

309
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:05,434
stepping on the brakes is proof, isn't it?

310
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,634
True.

311
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,334
Mr. Mouri, I think it would be difficult

312
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,234
to cause this phenomenon deliberately.

313
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:14,234
The fact that Mr. Hayamizu didn't step on the brakes

314
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:17,234
is not because of the collision course phenomenon.

315
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:20,434
Mr. Kurumatani rigged it,

316
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:24,734
so that Mr. Hayamizu couldn't step on the gas.

317
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:27,434
But, they just said that the car wasn't rigged in any way just now.

318
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,934
The car wasn't.

319
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:33,434
Another place was rigged.

320
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,834
-Ran! -Oh, yes!

321
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:47,034
It's the same as a road sign

322
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:50,534
and reflective plate is pasted on it.

323
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:51,834
It is normally positioned,

324
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,934
so that it faces the direction in which Mr. Hayamizu's car came from

325
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:57,034
and it stands out when light is shined on it.

326
00:18:57,034 --> 00:19:00,234
The glare does strain the eyes.

327
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,134
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Kurumatani

328
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:05,734
had changed the direction the sign faced beforehand.

329
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:09,134
If so, the light that reflects from the sign

330
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,634
will shine on Mr. Hayamizu's car.

331
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:15,634
I wonder why we didn't notice it

332
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,234
when we saw the image on the surveillance camera?

333
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,434
It was outside the visual range of the surveillance camera,

334
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:23,434
it wasn't in view.

335
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:26,134
After leaving the convenience store,

336
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:28,434
Mr. Hayamizu's car headed for this intersection

337
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,634
using the road alongside the irrigation channel.

338
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:34,034
At the intersection, he had the right of way,

339
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:38,134
so he drove straight without slowing down.

340
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,634
Just about that time,

341
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,034
the light that reflected on the sign,

342
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,034
was at an angle that shined a little

343
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:45,734
in the foreground of the intersection.

344
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:49,334
Not aware of this, Mr. Hayamizu approached the intersection.

345
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:54,134
What the...

346
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:09,134
Mr. Hayamizu was surprised at the blinding light

347
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:11,834
and failed to step on the brakes.

348
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,834
Moreover, because of the after image of the reflected light,

349
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:18,034
Mr. Kurumatani's car wasn't found.

350
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:20,934
He probably picked 14:00 as the time to meet at the convenience store,

351
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:24,134
taking into consideration the angle of the sun.

352
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,834
Could it be that he crashed into the sign

353
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,934
to cover up the fact that he changed directions?

354
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:31,934
It's most likely that you crashed into Mr. Hayamizu's car

355
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,834
on the driver's seat side.

356
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,934
I actually wanted to crash into that guy directly.

357
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:44,034
-Huh? -Hayamizu hit-and-run my little sister a year ago.

358
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,434
What?

359
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:46,734
Six months ago,

360
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:50,534
I realized when a red foreign car came in for a tune up.

361
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:55,434
Ever since then, all I thought about is avenging her death.

362
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:59,234
Hayamizu brought that car in again for a tune up.

363
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:02,834
That's why I planned what I did.

364
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,434
I urged him to turn himself into the police

365
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:06,934
when he came to return the car.

366
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:10,034
But, he insisted on playing dumb,

367
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,734
so I went on with my plan.

368
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,134
If he only turned himself in,

369
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:20,834
I would've at least spared him his life, that rat.

370
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:21,934
You're just as much a rat yourself

371
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:25,434
if you keep quiet about the fact

372
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,234
that you planned an accident to kill Mr. Hayamizu.

373
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:30,634
Now's your turn to turn yourself in.

374
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:40,534
Mr. Detective, when did you realize my scheme?

375
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:45,334
When you said you didn't notice the rainbow.

376
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:48,134
The collision course phenomenon cannot happen

377
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,934
unless the driver is looking ahead.

378
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,534
You didn't notice the rainbow,

379
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,534
because you were so absorbed in wanting to hit Mr. Hayamizu's car

380
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:59,134
that you were looking only to the side, isn't that right?

381
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:03,134
If you keep on harboring feelings of grudge and hate,

382
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,234
you'll lose sight of the beautiful things

383
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:08,234
right in front of your eyes.

384
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:35,234
Dad, it's dangerous to speed so much

385
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,634
when you didn't get enough sleep.

386
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:40,034
I'm fine. My head's cleared up.

387
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:43,234
I guess so, after all you did get some sleep.

388
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:44,734
We've got to return the rental car tonight

389
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,734
or we'll have to pay extension fee, don't we?

390
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:50,134
But, everything will be in vain if we get into an accident, you know.

391
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,434
I'm fine...

392
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:55,434
Besides, I've got a mahjong game tonight

393
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,834
and the prize is Yoko-chan's premium DVD!

394
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:01,034
I'll be there soon, Yoko-chan!

395
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:04,434
This is what you call, Kogoro phenomenon. He never learns.

396
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:09,434
"Next Episode" -The yawning girl with those unpleasing eyes.

397
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:12,534
I'm so sorry.

398
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,534
That I'm the yawning girl with unpleasing eyes.

399
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,434
The car that you hitchhiked on

400
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:20,634
was that of bad people?

401
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,534
I wonder who these two are?

402
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:27,734
What if they're men from the Black Organization?

403
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,934
They may virtually kill us. Kill us all together?

404
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,334
Next Conan,

405
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:35,599
"Dangerous Twosome"

406
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:53,619
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,319
"Dialect"

408
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,319
In the next episode Dr. Agasa and Ai are in big trouble.

409
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:00,019
-Kansai dialect? -Make sure you tune in next week too, okay?
