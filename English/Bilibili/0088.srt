1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.600
A racing second hand,
tiny shooting stars!

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.420
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.800
Today's case is a Western legend!
Don't put much stake in theories!

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.350
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.270
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.020
His name?

7
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.979
Dracula Manor?!

8
00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.849
Yeah. Most of Mr. Dorakura's
novels are centered around vampires,

9
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.909
so he's earned the
nickname "Mr. Dracula."

10
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.899
And that's why it's
called Dracula Manor?

11
00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.869
Is Dorakura Daisuke a famous writer?

12
00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.219
He's the most popular writer in
the Japan Horror Novel Association.

13
00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.929
He's even started to branch
out into heroic fantasy novels,

14
00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.559
and is gaining female fans, too.

15
00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.139
You sure know a lot about him, Dad!

16
00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:16.759
Of course I do! I am a
brilliant detective, you know!

17
00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.059
Ran-neechan.

18
00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:25.029
Horror Times Monthly--
Special Dorakura Daisuke Issue!

19
00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.259
Ah, a cheat sheet, huh?

20
00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.179
Shut up!

21
00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.159
There it is!

22
00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.979
That's Dracula Manor?

23
00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.389
"The Dracula Manor Murder Case (Part 1)."

24
00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.029
Detective Mori-san, right?

25
00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:12.509
Yes.

26
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.429
Thank you for coming all this way!

27
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.409
Who are you?

28
00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.619
I'm Tadokoro, I'm studying
under Dorakura-sensei.

29
00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.249
He's been waiting for you.
Come this way.

30
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.719
Who is she?

31
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.099
Dorakura Etsuko (30) Dorakura Daisuke's Wife

32
00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.679
Oh, that's his wife.
Dorakura Etsuko (30) Dorakura Daisuke's Wife

33
00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.509
What a beautiful woman!
I'm jealous!

34
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.889
Dad!

35
00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.809
Geez...

36
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.609
Old mansions certainly
have a unique feel to them,

37
00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.489
I get a chill down
my spine for some reason...

38
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.659
That's why I--

39
00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.429
Oh? Is that...

40
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.129
Might you be Mori
Kogoro-san, the detective?!

41
00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.599
Yes... that's right.

42
00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.589
I knew it! It's an honor to meet you!

43
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:18.759
I'm Doi, editor in chief for
Daigakkan's Horror Times Monthly.

44
00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.969
Oh, I know that magazine.

45
00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:24.939
Wow, so you're the famous detective?

46
00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:25.389

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.399
I'm a folklore researcher
at North Kanto University.
Hamura Shuichi (33) NKU Folklore Researcher

49
00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.859
Oh? What sort of research do you do?

50
00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.829
Mainly... vampire legends.

51
00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.559
O-Oh. That's interesting research...

52
00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.849
Say, where's Mr. Dorakura?

53
00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.039
He's in the study, writing.

54
00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.969
That's... a study room?

55
00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.219
He's right in here.

56
00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:08.559
A black-out curtain...

57
00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.499
Just a movie...

58
00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.249
Mori Kogoro-san, I take it?

59
00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.539
Welcome to Dracula Manor.

60
00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:33.929

Welcome to Dracula Manor.

I am Dorakura Daisuke.
Dorakura Daisuke (50) Horror Writer

62
00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.389
Octagonal rooms certainly are rare...

63
00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.319
Umm... do you always dress
up like Dracula like that?

64
00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:01.619
By writing while cloaked in Dracula
attire as I play Dracula films,

65
00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.079
I've brought many a
masterpiece into the world.

66
00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.289
So, how can I help you?

67
00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:14.629
I wish to hire you to investigate
the behavior of my wife, Etsuko.

68
00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.969
Behavior? An affair, in other words?

69
00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.509
Yes.

70
00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:25.599
I want you to find definitive proof
of the affair, and the man it's with.

71
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.809
Bastard called me all the way out
here just for some stupid affair...

72
00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.679
I am willing to pay one million yen,
and related expenses, of course.

73
00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:38.239
Certainly! I gladly accept the job!

74
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.869
Damn. I didn't bring
any chains for the car...

75
00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:50.079
No worries. You may spend
the night here, in Dracula Manor.

76
00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.039
I think I'll do that, then...

77
00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.809
What a lovely smell!

78
00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.149
It's homemade rosemary tea.

79
00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:18.359
And dinner was delicious, too!
You're a good cook, Tadokoro-san!

80
00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:23.639
Thanks to him, the lady of the
house can live an easy, carefree life.

81
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.569
Hamura-san...

82
00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:32.039
No, I'm studying novel-writing here,
so it's only natural that I help out.

83
00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:37.349
Great. I look forward to your
new series starting next month.

84
00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.349
Though, I must finish this
month's manuscript first.

85
00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:44.929
Tadokoro, bring wine
and a movie to the study.

86
00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:48.639
Of course.
What movie would you like?

87
00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:51.609
You decide.

88
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:01.759
Say! Ran-san! Conan-kun!
Want to come with me?

89
00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.809
There's lots of rare stuff to see!

90
00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:04.859
Rare stuff?

91
00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:08.969
He means Dorakura-sensei's
prized "Dracula Collection,"

92
00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:11.829
full of props and costumes
from vampire films.

93
00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:14.559
Let's go see, Ran-neechan!

94
00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:16.429
I think I'll--

95
00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.219
C'mon!

96
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:31.389
His vast collection of props
and films are kept in here.

97
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.059
Hey, where do these stairs go?

98
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:39.849
Oh, there's a library in the basement.

99
00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:44.029
It's filled with vampire books and
old texts from around the world.

100
00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:46.989
A Dracula Library, you could call it.

101
00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:54.249
Whoa, a Dracula mask!

102
00:08:54.249 --> 00:08:56.209
A Dracula hand!

103
00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.169
A cross sword!

104
00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:01.879
Yes, this one'll do.

105
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:04.339
Have you decided on a movie?

106
00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:09.219
Yes. An old British movie
called Banquet of Fresh Blood.

107
00:09:09.219 --> 00:09:11.599
He just loves this one!

108
00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:13.519
See that wooden stake there?

109
00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:18.539
It was driven through the vampire's
heart in the last scene of this film.

110
00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:24.939
In his study, he also has the
cross the vampire was strung up on.

111
00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:28.969
Huh? I smell oil paint...

112
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.659
That's odd. There aren't
any oil paintings...

113
00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:33.889
Well, let's go back.

114
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:35.059
Okay!

115
00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.499
Oh, Ran-san.

116
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:40.459
Sorry to ask, but could you
make sure all the windows are locked?

117
00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:42.449
Sure, no problem!

118
00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.099
They're locked!

119
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:55.809
Thanks!

120
00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:06.719
What did you think
of the Dracula Collection?

121
00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:08.449
It was kind of gross!

122
00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:19.579
Say, Hamura-san.
Dracula is just fiction, right?

123
00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.139
It's true that the Count Dracula we know

124
00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:31.469
was a monster created by
Bram Stoker in his 1897 novel, Dracula.

125
00:10:31.969 --> 00:10:36.389
But, there were several
noblemen in medieval Europe

126
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.539
who were feared as vampires
because of the atrocities they committed.

127
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:47.599
Dorakura-sensei has collected
many old documents concerning that,

128
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:51.699
which is why I visit here personally.

129
00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:09.219
Conan-kun! Want to play cards?

130
00:11:09.219 --> 00:11:10.009
Yeah!

131
00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:14.969
Great! Hold on while I make
sure everything's locked up.

132
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:25.729
Tadokoro-san seems really nice,
does he like horror novels, too?

133
00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:29.689
If anything, I'd say he's
probably more into fantasy.

134
00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:34.219
I was the one who introduced
him to Dorakura-sensei!

135
00:11:34.219 --> 00:11:36.659
He seemed to have real talent, you see!

136
00:11:41.349 --> 00:11:42.919
Is it still snowing?

137
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:45.379
No, it's stopped now.

138
00:11:48.849 --> 00:11:52.259
Won't you two play cards with us, too?

139
00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:58.429
Sorry. I have a headache,
so I'm going to bed now.

140
00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:02.269
And I'd like to browse the library
a bit more. If you'll excuse me.

141
00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:15.309
Conan-kun! Use your 6 of Hearts already!

142
00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:16.379
Not gonna happen.

143
00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:21.099
And my theory was right on the mark!

144
00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:21.909
Oh!

145
00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:26.009
Won't you join us, Hamura-san?

146
00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:29.589
Mori-san is retelling his many exploits!

147
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:32.649
That sounds interesting.

148
00:12:33.969 --> 00:12:38.219
I need to use the restroom.
I've been feeling ill since this morning.

149
00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:40.219
Sure, go ahead.

150
00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:43.389
Sorry.

151
00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:56.469
Dad. We're going to bed now.

152
00:12:56.469 --> 00:13:00.559
You do that. It's grownup time now.

153
00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:02.409
Huh? That's weird.

154
00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:04.079
What is it?

155
00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:06.829
He won't answer the phone.

156
00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.559
You think maybe he dozed off?

157
00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:15.049
He'd never do that! Late nights
and alcohol never affect him!

158
00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:18.089
I'll go have a look.

159
00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.559
I'll go with him.

160
00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:23.309
Sensei! Say something!

161
00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:24.449
Dorakura-sensei!

162
00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:25.689
Sensei!

163
00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:28.899
It's locked.

164
00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.849
What's all the noise?

165
00:13:31.849 --> 00:13:34.859
Ma'am! Your husband
isn't responding to us!

166
00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:36.819
Oh, that's strange.

167
00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:40.659
I can hear the projector!

168
00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:44.619
That can't be! Shouldn't the
movie be long over by now?!

169
00:13:45.219 --> 00:13:48.059
Let's go outside and
call for him from the window.

170
00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:48.829
Right!

171
00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:51.749
It's cold!

172
00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.549
The window's open.

173
00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:01.489
Only the snow by the
window's been trampled on!

174
00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:04.009
What's going on?!

175
00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:08.719
Dorakura-san! Are you in here?!

176
00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:11.609
W-What the...

177
00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:15.889
W-What is it?!

178
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.199
What's going on?!

179
00:14:44.628 --> 00:14:49.258
All the windows, but the one
we entered from, are fixed in place.

180
00:14:49.358 --> 00:14:50.488
And...

181
00:14:57.858 --> 00:15:01.668
the only door is locked from the inside.

182
00:15:07.608 --> 00:15:09.968
Rubber sealing...

183
00:15:10.688 --> 00:15:13.928
It'd be impossible to use
string to lock it from the outside.

184
00:15:15.478 --> 00:15:19.388
It would appear the killer entered
and exited through that window.

185
00:15:20.068 --> 00:15:23.858
But, Mori-san, how did
the killer get here?

186
00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:27.728
Only the snow in front
of the window was trampled...

187
00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:29.528
there were no other footprints.

188
00:15:30.568 --> 00:15:33.528
Climbing up the cliff
would be impossible,

189
00:15:33.528 --> 00:15:37.998
and the rough waves in the lake
would quickly capsize any boat.

190
00:15:38.358 --> 00:15:41.358
So, even with the window open,

191
00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:45.438
this study room was
still as good as locked...

192
00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:46.298
What did the police say?

193
00:15:46.298 --> 00:15:47.708
It's no good!

194
00:15:48.108 --> 00:15:52.608
The snowstorm caused an avalanche
that blocked the only road here!

195
00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:55.428
They say they can't clear
the road until at least morning!

196
00:15:56.108 --> 00:16:00.138
Damn... Looks like I'll
have to examine the body...

197
00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:03.528
What a vulgar murderer,

198
00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:06.518
killing him with a wooden stake,
as if he were Dracula...

199
00:16:08.688 --> 00:16:12.318
...and sticking his body
on a cross, on top of that.

200
00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.438
Hold on, now!

201
00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:18.288
Why did the killer move the
projector and light up the body?!

202
00:16:19.148 --> 00:16:20.808
Is there some reason behind it?!

203
00:16:22.108 --> 00:16:25.028
It's almost like the last scene
of Banquet of Fresh Blood.

204
00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:26.668
Banquet of Fresh Blood?

205
00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:29.628
That's the movie
Tadokoro-san brought him!

206
00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:31.358
T-That's right!

207
00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:35.598
It was Dorakura-sensei's
most beloved vampire film.

208
00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:40.518
So, the killer set it up to look
like the movie's last scene?!

209
00:16:43.358 --> 00:16:45.518
Rigor mortis has set in.

210
00:16:45.518 --> 00:16:49.728
Meaning he's probably
been dead for at least an hour.

211
00:16:50.228 --> 00:16:57.368
In short, the time of the murder
was between 9:00 and 11:00 pm.

212
00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:01.578
There's a wound on the back of his head.

213
00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:05.578
He must've been hit with this.
There's some blood on it.

214
00:17:05.978 --> 00:17:07.228
I see.

215
00:17:07.228 --> 00:17:11.418
He was strung up and impaled with
the stake after being knocked out.

216
00:17:12.028 --> 00:17:15.688
Mori-san, that stake came
from the collection room!

217
00:17:15.688 --> 00:17:17.138
What?!

218
00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:24.688
In short, the killer snuck in
and stole the stake

219
00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:26.558
after Tadokoro-san
came to get the movie.

220
00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:30.438
Then, after Tadokoro-san delivered
the movie to the study room,

221
00:17:30.438 --> 00:17:32.688
the person murdered Mr. Dorakura.

222
00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:34.028
Huh?

223
00:17:34.938 --> 00:17:36.568
It doesn't smell like oil paint...

224
00:17:37.648 --> 00:17:41.618
But all the windows
were locked from the inside.

225
00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:48.208
There's not a single
footprint outside the window.

226
00:17:49.438 --> 00:17:52.958
Which means the killer is an insider!

227
00:18:01.188 --> 00:18:02.358
Mister! Look!

228
00:18:03.528 --> 00:18:05.478
The end of a twig...

229
00:18:06.148 --> 00:18:08.978
That's got nothin' to do with this!

230
00:18:08.978 --> 00:18:09.688
Hamura-san!

231
00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:13.688
The only one who
could've stolen the stake

232
00:18:13.688 --> 00:18:18.028
is you, who went to browse the library.

233
00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:20.118
Yes, that's true.

234
00:18:20.978 --> 00:18:26.078
But, Mori-san, how exactly
did I take the stake to the study?

235
00:18:26.938 --> 00:18:31.788
I would've had to pass through
the living room, where you all were.

236
00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:33.978
W-Well...

237
00:18:33.978 --> 00:18:35.538
There is one way!

238
00:18:35.538 --> 00:18:36.128
What?!

239
00:18:36.568 --> 00:18:39.728
By going upstairs and
walking across the corridor's roof!

240
00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:41.598
You could get to the study that way!

241
00:18:43.358 --> 00:18:44.928
Ah.

242
00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:48.648
I don't need your help!
I already knew that!

243
00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:54.528
If I wanted to leave, I would still
have to go through the living room.

244
00:18:54.528 --> 00:18:56.608
Either way, I couldn't have done it.

245
00:18:56.608 --> 00:18:57.568
Ma'am.

246
00:18:58.318 --> 00:18:59.028
Yes?

247
00:18:59.528 --> 00:19:02.718
Your room is above
the collection room, yes?

248
00:19:05.648 --> 00:19:08.918
Ma'am, you conspired
with Hamura-san, didn't you?

249
00:19:08.918 --> 00:19:11.628
W-What are you saying, Mori-san?!

250
00:19:12.028 --> 00:19:16.588
You could dangle a rope to the
collection room window from here.

251
00:19:17.028 --> 00:19:20.528
Hamura-san used it
to climb up to your room,

252
00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:23.778
then traversed the corridor
roof to reach the study.

253
00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:28.178
He then scaled the roof there
and set down in front of that window.

254
00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:31.768
Then, he called out to
Mr. Dorakura to let him inside,

255
00:19:31.768 --> 00:19:33.978
then murdered him
when he got the chance!

256
00:19:34.318 --> 00:19:38.358
He used the same course
in reverse to get back.

257
00:19:38.358 --> 00:19:39.648
Am I wrong?

258
00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:42.108
Ridiculous!

259
00:19:42.108 --> 00:19:46.368
Why would Hamura-san and I need
to conspire to kill my husband?!

260
00:19:46.648 --> 00:19:50.328
Mr. Dorakura suspected
you of having an affair.

261
00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:55.038
Ma'am, were you having
an affair with Hamura-san?

262
00:19:55.038 --> 00:19:57.528
W-What makes you think we're--

263
00:19:57.528 --> 00:20:00.108
Etsuko, let's not hide the truth.

264
00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:01.568
Hamura-san!

265
00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:04.758
The police would find
out right away, anyway.

266
00:20:04.758 --> 00:20:07.218
So, you admit it, then?

267
00:20:07.858 --> 00:20:12.348
I do. But, we truly love each other!

268
00:20:12.688 --> 00:20:16.028
Yeah! Hamura-san is the only one I love!

269
00:20:16.028 --> 00:20:18.568
I never once loved Dorakura!

270
00:20:18.938 --> 00:20:20.988
Then why did you get married?

271
00:20:25.818 --> 00:20:30.148
Eight years ago, my father's
business took a nosedive

272
00:20:30.148 --> 00:20:32.538
and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

273
00:20:33.528 --> 00:20:36.188
Dorakura was an old
acquaintance of my father's,

274
00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:39.028
and in exchange for
financing the business,

275
00:20:39.028 --> 00:20:44.028
he demanded my hand in marriage
after I had just graduated college!

276
00:20:44.028 --> 00:20:45.688
If the company went bankrupt,

277
00:20:45.688 --> 00:20:48.218
so many people, and families,
would be affected!

278
00:20:48.608 --> 00:20:51.678
So, I had no choice but to...

279
00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:56.188
We later learned
that the business' downfall

280
00:20:56.188 --> 00:21:00.028
was actually because of Dorakura's
behind-the-scenes dirty work.

281
00:21:00.028 --> 00:21:05.228
But, by the time we found out,
the company was already in his name,

282
00:21:05.228 --> 00:21:08.118
and he threatened to destroy
the company if we divorced...

283
00:21:08.118 --> 00:21:10.078
That's horrible!

284
00:21:10.648 --> 00:21:12.188
I see.

285
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:17.858
If Mr. Dorakura died, his wife
would inherit his company...

286
00:21:17.858 --> 00:21:18.838
So, that's why you...

287
00:21:18.838 --> 00:21:21.548
No! It wasn't us!

288
00:21:22.688 --> 00:21:27.008
Do you have proof that we killed him?

289
00:21:27.648 --> 00:21:31.468
Very well. If that's how
you want it, then I'll show you.

290
00:21:33.278 --> 00:21:38.858
You left her room, climbed onto
the corridor roof from this window,

291
00:21:38.858 --> 00:21:40.148
and went to the study.

292
00:21:40.608 --> 00:21:43.108
The old guy's on the ball today!

293
00:21:43.358 --> 00:21:47.408
Which is why Hamura-san's
footprints are still on the roof!

294
00:21:50.368 --> 00:21:52.788
T-There aren't any footprints!

295
00:21:53.108 --> 00:21:54.538
Say what?!

296
00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.708
That's impossible!

297
00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:01.438
There's not a single footprint!

298
00:22:01.438 --> 00:22:07.178
With the corridor unusable, this roof
was the only way to the study!

299
00:22:08.028 --> 00:22:16.358
Don't tell me the killer actually
flew through the air, like a vampire?!

300
00:23:43.698 --> 00:23:46.608
Leave the rest to me, old guy!

301
00:23:49.568 --> 00:23:54.948
First, I thought only Hamura-san
could have taken the stake,

302
00:23:54.948 --> 00:23:59.158
but actually, anyone could
have stolen it from outside!

303
00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:00.828
Anyone?

304
00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:05.298
There were no footprints because
the killer walked through the air.

305
00:24:05.835 --> 00:24:07.208
Walked through the air?

306
00:24:08.191 --> 00:24:13.098
On the next Conan: "The Dracula
Manor Murder Case (Part 2)."
