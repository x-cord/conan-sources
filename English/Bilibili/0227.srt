1
00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:20.832
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:22.632
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.232
The game is a killer!

4
00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.232
It's time for another deduction show!

5
00:00:26.232 --> 00:00:27.832
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.732
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:32.032
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:58.591
We were at a game arcade getting our photo stickers made,

9
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.591
that's when we run into Jody Santemillion,

10
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.691
an English teacher at Teitan High School

11
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.191
deeply engrossed in a shooting game.

12
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:11.491
At her insistence, Ran is set to compete in a fighting game

13
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:15.291
against a skilled gamer named Kengo Bito who beats her in no time at all.

14
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:21.591
But during the game with his next opponent,

15
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:24.291
Mr. Bito ends up getting killed!

16
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.791
There are four suspects.

17
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:31.091
Mr. Bito's opponent, Takayasu Shimizu,

18
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:34.791
the game arcade attendant, Hitoshi Dejima,

19
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.591
taxi driver, Toshitsugu Emori,

20
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:41.591
and Miss Jody.

21
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.891
Judging from the condition of the body,

22
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:48.491
I'm positive he was poisoned.

23
00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:52.591
Which means, that person is the most suspicious

24
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.491
and the evidence is probably in there.

25
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.591
All that leaves are the needle or hypodermic syringe,

26
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:02.091
nothing like that was on the floor.

27
00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:06.291
I doubt the killer would still be holding on to it.

28
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:09.191
The killer...

29
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.191
Where did the killer hide the weapon?

30
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:20.391
"Battle Game Trap (Part 2)"

31
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:23.591
I was picking up a 100 yen coin.

32
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.891
"Toshitsugu Emori (41)" -I want to get some coffee from the vending machine,

33
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.091
"Taxi Driver" -but I dropped the coins on the floor.

34
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:32.091
Sure, he was a creep

35
00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:35.291
but I respected his skills as a gamer.

36
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.291
Sure you did.

37
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.091
He saw you make a mistake when you played that racing game

38
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.491
and he treat you like a fool in front of everybody.

39
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.291
Is that true?

40
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.491
"Takayasu Shimizu (30), Game Magazine Writer" -It sure is! He yelled out,

41
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:52.591
"You'd better not get in this guy's taxi unless you want to die!"

42
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:56.491
Well, you had a stronger motive to kill him!

43
00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:01.891
After all, that guy was your precious sister's boyfriend.

44
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:03.891
His sister's boyfriend?

45
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:06.391
They were living together,

46
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.791
or you could say he was living off of her,

47
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.691
After all, as her brother, he is also a gamer, just like that guy.

48
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:14.791
I guess he can't complain about anything either.

49
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.191
And what about you?

50
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.591
You wanted him out of the way too, didn't you?

51
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:22.491
What do you mean?

52
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:25.191
"Hitoshi Dejima (22)" -Up until six months ago,

53
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:27.191
"Store Worker" -he had a pretty good reputation as a gamer

54
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.191
and known as "The Battler of Beika".

55
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:31.591
That was until that guy came along and thrashed him,

56
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:33.191
then he dropped out of sight.

57
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.491
Who would've thought he'd change his hairstyle

58
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.791
and start working part time in a game arcade?

59
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.191
Inspector! They found poison in the victim's blood!

60
00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:47.291
What?

61
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.691
The name of the poison is tetrodotoxin!

62
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.091
The point of entry was the inside of his upper right arm

63
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.391
and it appears the penetration went up to the artery.

64
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.791
Tetrodotoxin? that's...

65
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.291
Puffer fish poison!

66
00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:02.291
Tetrodotoxin, commonly called TTX.

67
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.091
0.5-1 mg would cause instant death,

68
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:07.591
that's 1/500th the amount needed for a deadly dose of potassium cyanide,

69
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:09.691
it's a crazy poison.

70
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:12.191
It is found in most puffer fish.

71
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.591
But when ingested by mouth, the symptoms progress slowly

72
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:17.991
and the rate of survival is quite high.

73
00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:20.491
When directly introduced into the bloodstream,

74
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:24.891
paralysis sets in quickly and it's "The End"?

75
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.291
Miss Jody?

76
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.291
"Jody Santemillion (28)" -My friend, who's a doctor told me.

77
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.291
"English Teacher" -When I was coming to Japan,

78
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:33.791
"English Teacher" -I was warned about eating puffer fish!

79
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:38.291
I knew it. Now to find where the weapon is hidden.

80
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:40.491
At any rate, let's go back to the scene of the crime

81
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:41.491
and go over everything one more time!

82
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:42.891
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:45.091
I hope you will all cooperate!

84
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:46.791
Sure...

85
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.491
There it is again. It's that sound.

86
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:58.191
What could it be?

87
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:04.091
Hey, the shoe lace on your left shoe is coming loose.

88
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:06.891
Thanks, kid.

89
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.791
It's dangerous, you could've tripped.

90
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.991
It was that person, that person killed Mr. Bito.

91
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:18.091
The distinct features of these arcades

92
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:20.691
were used to commit the murder.

93
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.591
But one thing bothers me.

94
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:26.491
Why'd that person deliberately do that in front of the police?

95
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:28.891
Conan!

96
00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:30.291
What's the matter, Conan?

97
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.091
Come on, hurry!

98
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.191
Inspector! We've searched this floor from top to bottom

99
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:50.291
but we haven't come up with anything needle-like

100
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:53.191
that could've been the weapon.

101
00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:55.591
According to the film in the security camera,

102
00:06:55.591 --> 00:07:02.591
none of the suspects left this floor until the police arrived.

103
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:06.591
Chances are high the killer still has the weapon, don't you think?

104
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:08.491
Yes.

105
00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:13.191
We'll be taking you all into another room for a body check.

106
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:16.591
I'll answer all of your questions or anything you want,

107
00:07:16.591 --> 00:07:19.291
but don't you think you're making a mistake by suspecting me?

108
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:22.491
He died while playing against me,

109
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.291
I didn't have a chance to poison him.

110
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:28.691
Well, that goes for me too.

111
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:32.191
I was close to Mr. Bito just to collect the coins in the machine

112
00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:35.891
before the game started, that's all.

113
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:37.891
If you going to do a body check,

114
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.491
you should check Mr. Emori who was close to the machine

115
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.591
when he was picking up the coin he dropped during the game.

116
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:48.291
And the lady was next to Mr. Bito playing her racing game.

117
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.291
Hey, wait a minute! What are you talking about?

118
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.591
Miss Jody was playing the game the whole time,

119
00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:55.891
she couldn't have stopped! Right?

120
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:59.591
Right! No mistake about it!

121
00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:04.191
Besides, the inspection of the scene just now proved, didn't it?

122
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:06.191
If you're sitting here...

123
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:09.891
See? Your hands don't reach the chair next to you.

124
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:13.191
I don't think she could have done it.

125
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:17.791
Let me say something now.

126
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:21.891
The poison was injected under Bito's right arm, wasn't it?

127
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:25.891
I came up from his left side, I couldn't have done it.

128
00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:28.091
Everybody just calm down.

129
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.791
This is just a formality, so please cooperate.

130
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:35.991
Sonoko, what's wrong?

131
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:38.991
Good grief, how disappointing.

132
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:42.391
Inspector Megure, what's up with you?

133
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:43.791
What?

134
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:46.591
The killer's smiling right in front of you,

135
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:48.591
and you haven't caught on yet.

136
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:49.991
What?

137
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:53.591
The poison's point of entry was the inside of his upper right arm.

138
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:54.891
As Mr. Emori himself pointed out,

139
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:58.091
he couldn't have done it because the only time he was close to the victim,

140
00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:00.491
he was on the left.

141
00:09:00.491 --> 00:09:02.091
We can also cross Mr. Dejima out

142
00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:04.491
since he came in contact with the victim before the game started

143
00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:09.291
and after that, the victim was seen talking to Mr. Shimizu.

144
00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:13.891
And of course, Miss Jody was busy playing her game

145
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.491
and we were on the opposite side of the victim

146
00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:18.991
so none of us could have done it either.

147
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.091
Then that only leaves...

148
00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:25.091
That's right. Only one person remains.

149
00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:28.591
You're the only one who could've done it!

150
00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:38.899
That's right. Only one person remains.

151
00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:41.899
You're the only one who could've done it!

152
00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:44.299
Takayasu Shimizu.

153
00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:48.799
You're the only one!

154
00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.499
Young lady, do you know what you're saying?

155
00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:57.199
You watched the video, didn't you?

156
00:09:57.199 --> 00:10:00.799
You saw me getting beaten in the game!

157
00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:05.599
How could I have poisoned him in the midst of all that?

158
00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:08.199
It's no use to acting innocent.

159
00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:10.999
You'll see how easy it is when we demonstrate!

160
00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:12.199
What?

161
00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:14.699
Ran and Detective Takagi!

162
00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:18.199
Excuse me, but will you play that game?

163
00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:22.499
What? -The answer will come to you right away when you do it.

164
00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:26.899
Please.

165
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.399
Hey...

166
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:35.799
Are you going to allow this?

167
00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:38.999
To let the police take orders from a young girl.

168
00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:43.799
Well, you may not know it but Sonoko's pretty sharp.

169
00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:45.299
It's starting!

170
00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:47.599
Fight!

171
00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:54.899
What? -That girl is getting a total beating!

172
00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:57.599
That police is real mean.

173
00:10:57.599 --> 00:11:02.199
Hey, Takagi, go easy on her.

174
00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.199
Hey!

175
00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:14.099
K.O!

176
00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:16.399
The girl's had it.

177
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.999
Poor thing.

178
00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:23.599
Ta... Takagi! I know how much you hate to lose

179
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:27.099
but don't you think you went overboard here just a little too much?

180
00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:31.799
Sonoko told me to tell Detective Takagi what to do.

181
00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.499
She said he would be the girl character

182
00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:35.199
and that he had to blindfold himself with his necktie

183
00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:39.099
and not do anything during the game, just go limp!

184
00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:42.499
Then the one controlling the male character was...

185
00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:45.499
It was me! Sonoko told me to do this.

186
00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:47.099
Isn't that right, Conan?

187
00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:48.499
Yes!

188
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.499
Do you mean...

189
00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:52.899
That's right. Preconceived notion.

190
00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:54.699
Everyone would assume Ran would be the female character

191
00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:58.499
and Detective Takagi would be the male character, correct?

192
00:11:58.499 --> 00:12:01.299
But it was actually the opposite

193
00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:03.499
just like it was before.

194
00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:05.799
Mr. Bito is "The Shisa of Beika"

195
00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:08.299
and Mr. Shimizu is "Lutus from Haido".

196
00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:12.899
Everyone assumed they'd use their own characters.

197
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:17.199
And on top of that, this game has no hit point gauge

198
00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:21.999
so no one can tell who is which character just by watching the monitor.

199
00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:26.199
Nobody would notice if they switched!

200
00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:30.199
Are you saying Mr. Bito was killed before the game started?

201
00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:34.799
Yes, Mr. Shimizu had already injected him and he was either dead

202
00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:38.599
or the poison was just starting to take effect and he was semi-conscious.

203
00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:42.799
Tetrodotoxin causes paralysis.

204
00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:45.599
Even if Mr. Bito was alive during the game,

205
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:49.399
it would have been difficult for him to sit straight up.

206
00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:53.399
But if that were the case,

207
00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:57.499
someone was bound to notice something was wrong.

208
00:12:57.499 --> 00:13:00.299
No, that's not necessarily true!

209
00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:02.899
I let my body go limp,

210
00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:06.599
but every time I took a hit, my arms and legs would move a little bit.

211
00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:08.599
Unless someone was watching very closely,

212
00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:12.799
it would look like I was playing the game!

213
00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:15.399
And besides, these guards would keep his body propped up

214
00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:17.399
so he wouldn't fall.

215
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:21.199
This is how Mr. Shimizu did it!

216
00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:22.699
Before the game starts,

217
00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:24.699
he goes up to Mr. Bito

218
00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:27.199
and injects him with the poison.

219
00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:29.199
While Mr. Bito is struggling,

220
00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:32.199
he finishes the game he's in the midst of

221
00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:35.199
and then starts the new game with the new character,

222
00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:38.499
his character, Lutus!

223
00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:41.399
Then all he has to do is go to another machine

224
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:46.699
and enter the game as Mr. Bito's character, Shisa and he's set!

225
00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:49.299
Then you deliver a series of blows to an unmoving opponent

226
00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:54.599
and everyone thinks you're getting beat up.

227
00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:58.999
But why didn't he deliver the finishing blow at the end of the game?

228
00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:03.199
Because if he had and someone ran up to Mr. Bito,

229
00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:08.299
they'd see the words "You Lose" on his machine when in fact he had won.

230
00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:12.599
If they ended in a draw, "Draw" would appear on the screen!

231
00:14:12.599 --> 00:14:14.899
And in a draw, the game comes to an immediate end!

232
00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:19.899
The character Mr. Bito used would remain unknown.

233
00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:21.999
What about the weapon?

234
00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:25.499
If what you're saying is true, it should be around someplace.

235
00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:28.399
Where's the needle or syringe?

236
00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.799
That's why we're going to do a body check.

237
00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:35.299
Search all you want.

238
00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:38.899
But if you don't find it, you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

239
00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:41.499
Of course we won't find it!

240
00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:44.899
You don't have the weapon on you anymore,

241
00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:46.899
but I bet you didn't notice.

242
00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:51.599
A certain something has been following you around.

243
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.199
What do you mean?

244
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:56.399
Mr. Dejima, could you please come here?

245
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.399
Sure.

246
00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.499
What is it?

247
00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:04.299
That's fine, you can go back.

248
00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:06.499
Well...

249
00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:08.399
Okay.

250
00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:10.599
What was that all about?

251
00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:13.199
Didn't you notice it, Inspector?

252
00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:15.099
Every time he takes a step,

253
00:15:15.099 --> 00:15:18.299
you can hear a strange sound, like metal scratching something.

254
00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:20.899
-What? -What?

255
00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:23.299
Do you mean it's on the bottom of his shoe?

256
00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:26.299
Yes, Mr. Shimizu...

257
00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:28.899
he put the used needle inside a cigarette,

258
00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:30.499
then stuck some gum to it

259
00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:34.099
and then put it on top of the gum wrapping paper

260
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.899
and left it on the floor.

261
00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:40.499
Someone would step on it while they were watching the game on the monitor

262
00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:43.799
and then the evidence would be carried to another location.

263
00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:49.799
And it was done when he bent down to pick up the lighter he dropped.

264
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:52.899
If the cigarette is flattened,

265
00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:56.199
you wouldn't really notice when you stepped on it.

266
00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:57.899
And even if you did notice,

267
00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:01.699
you'd just think it was rubbish

268
00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:04.499
and throw it in the trash bin.

269
00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:08.099
I suppose we'll just have to rely on Mr. Shimizu's good conscience

270
00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:12.499
as to whether he wiped the poison off the needle before he got rid of it.

271
00:16:12.499 --> 00:16:15.699
He probably prepared the cigarette trick before the crime

272
00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:19.399
in the toilet of this arcade.

273
00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:20.899
All he had to do was roll up the paper

274
00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:23.599
and put it into the box of cigarettes,

275
00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:27.199
then when he took it out, it wouldn't look suspicious.

276
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:28.299
I see.

277
00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:31.599
So if we find Mr. Shimizu's fingerprints on this cigarette or paper,

278
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:34.399
then we'll have the proof we need.

279
00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:38.399
I must commend you that was one terrific story

280
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.799
but unfortunately, this is a trap, young lady.

281
00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:42.999
What?

282
00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:44.499
Take a look!

283
00:16:44.499 --> 00:16:48.899
Both the gum and the cigarette aren't my brand.

284
00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:50.199
It's true.

285
00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:54.699
Sure. I'm sure somebody's trying to frame me!

286
00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:57.699
It's a well-known fact that I chew on gum

287
00:16:57.699 --> 00:17:00.999
during the game to keep rhythm, it was even written up in a magazine.

288
00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:02.599
Check if you don't believe me,

289
00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:05.999
you're not going to find my fingerprint on anything!

290
00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:09.299
Now I understand. That's what bothered me all along.

291
00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:10.299
What?

292
00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:12.699
I couldn't understand

293
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:15.599
why you would chew gum in front of the police

294
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:20.199
when you used gum to hide the weapon!

295
00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:23.399
I'll bet you used someone else's gum and cigarette

296
00:17:23.399 --> 00:17:27.399
from the ashtrays in this arcade.

297
00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:30.599
You chewed gum so that you could use that excuse

298
00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.899
just in case the needle was found.

299
00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:34.799
You used the preconceived notion that

300
00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:39.399
no criminal would deliberately incriminate himself to your own advantage.

301
00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:43.399
But wouldn't his fingerprints he left behind when he injected the victim?

302
00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:47.099
No, if the needle was placed between his fingers,

303
00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.499
it would be possible to commit the crime

304
00:17:48.499 --> 00:17:51.099
and not leave any finger or palm print!

305
00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:52.399
That's right!

306
00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:55.899
If you push the top and bottom of the cigarette box,

307
00:17:55.899 --> 00:18:00.599
you could take it out without leaving your fingerprint.

308
00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:03.599
But what about the coins?

309
00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:05.799
Mr. Dejima.

310
00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:08.599
Could you please open up the coin box on that machine?

311
00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:10.599
Sure.

312
00:18:12.199 --> 00:18:16.899
There should be 2100 yen coins in there if his story is true.

313
00:18:16.899 --> 00:18:19.099
Because before Mr. Bito started the game,

314
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.899
Mr. Dejima had collected the coins already.

315
00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:25.299
But I'm sure you'll find three coins in there!

316
00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:26.299
What?

317
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.199
She's right!

318
00:18:30.199 --> 00:18:31.799
There's three coins in here!

319
00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:33.699
You... You're right.

320
00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:38.699
One of them is the coin Mr. Bito put in to start the game,

321
00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:43.199
another will be Detective Takagi's, he just finished his game

322
00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:46.899
and the last one is the coin the killer put in

323
00:18:46.899 --> 00:18:51.199
when he started the "camouflage game"?

324
00:18:51.199 --> 00:18:53.199
That's right. Mr. Shimizu,

325
00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:58.499
your fingerprints should be all over that 100 yen coin.

326
00:18:59.899 --> 00:19:03.299
But we won't know until we have it analysed.

327
00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:04.599
Sure we do.

328
00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:09.599
The coins were collected before Mr. Shimizu got here.

329
00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:11.599
He probably thought it wouldn't pose a problem

330
00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:16.399
if a coin with his fingerprint was found in a mountain of other coins.

331
00:19:17.799 --> 00:19:20.299
Another thing, unless he wore gloves,

332
00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:24.099
he wouldn't be able to drop the coin in without leaving his fingerprint.

333
00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:27.499
You'll find them. My fingerprints are on it.

334
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:31.099
I had a tight grip on it when I dropped it in.

335
00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:34.699
That's because I intended that to be my last game.

336
00:19:34.699 --> 00:19:36.599
Your last game?

337
00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:42.499
Yes, I intended to bid farewell to these games as well as to that guy.

338
00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:46.999
It was for my sister's sake, she's in the hospital and almost blind.

339
00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:49.499
Almost blind?

340
00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:52.999
Do you know how she got that way?

341
00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:57.499
Vitamin E deficiency due to malnutrition.

342
00:19:57.499 --> 00:20:00.199
Can you imagine in this day and age?

343
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:04.999
In order to repay the gambling debts of that guy,

344
00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:09.999
my sister was working like crazy this past month and hardly ate anything.

345
00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:11.599
But after all he put her through,

346
00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:14.799
she still refused to break up with him.

347
00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:19.699
I don't know how you could have played games with someone like that.

348
00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:22.099
He told me that

349
00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:28.499
if I won just one game against him, he'd leave my sister alone.

350
00:20:28.499 --> 00:20:35.499
I practiced and got good enough to be called "Lutus from Haido",

351
00:20:35.499 --> 00:20:37.899
but I just couldn't beat him.

352
00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:40.499
And so you killed him?

353
00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:45.299
Yes, but you know, Inspector? I regret it now.

354
00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:49.699
That unbeatable character he controlled, Shisa,

355
00:20:49.699 --> 00:20:52.299
I destroyed my chance to beat it with my own hands.

356
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:25.799
Sonoko, you were terrific, good job!

357
00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:27.899
Sonoko, you were great!

358
00:22:27.899 --> 00:22:31.099
You were just like Kate Martinelli!

359
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:33.299
Kate?

360
00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:35.799
That famous female police officer in the America.

361
00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:39.599
It's true, even Shinichi would've been impressed!

362
00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.299
Shinichi?

363
00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:45.599
The boy who appeared at the school fest!

364
00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:48.299
He is so cool!

365
00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:52.899
I wouldn't say that, all he thinks of solving crimes.

366
00:22:52.899 --> 00:22:56.299
Well, Miss Jody, we go this way.

367
00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:00.299
Goodbye, Miss Jody!

368
00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:04.299
Bye bye, see you tomorrow at school!

369
00:23:10.399 --> 00:23:12.899
Bye bye, cool guy.

370
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.999
Yes, that's right.

371
00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:27.199
A lot happened.

372
00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:32.299
You were right, I don't think I'll be bored.

373
00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:36.599
I think I've got one of our targets.

374
00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:40.799
Yes, he changed his appearance and going to school as if nothing happened.

375
00:23:42.499 --> 00:23:44.499
Isn't that funny?

376
00:23:44.499 --> 00:23:46.799
Little mister target.

377
00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.899
That's right.

378
00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:51.599
Rotten apple.

379
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:54.699
Shall I turn him into a rotten apple?

380
00:24:00.699 --> 00:24:02.399
"Next Episode" -What?

381
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:05.199
Didn't my dad tell you when he came by last week?

382
00:24:05.199 --> 00:24:08.199
My dad's actually Kogoro Mouri,

383
00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:09.799
he's a private detective.

384
00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:13.899
I am so sorry! Is it broken?

385
00:24:13.899 --> 00:24:17.099
No, mine is okay.

386
00:24:17.099 --> 00:24:18.599
Then that sound just now...

387
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.299
Next Conan,

388
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:30.599

389
00:24:31.517 --> 00:24:33.717
